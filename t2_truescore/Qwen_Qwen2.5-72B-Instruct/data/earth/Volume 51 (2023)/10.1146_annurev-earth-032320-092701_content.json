{"grounding": "The current rapid increase in atmospheric CO2, linked to the massive use of fossil fuels, will have major consequences for our climate and for living organisms. To understand what is happening today, it is informative to look at the past. The evolution of the carbon cycle, coupled with that of the past climate system and the other coupled elemental cycles, is explored in the field, in the laboratory, and with the help of numerical modeling. The objective of numerical modeling is to be able to provide a quantification of the processes at work on our planet. Of course, we must remain aware that a numerical model, however complex, will never include all the relevant processes, impacts, and consequences because nature is complex and not all the processes are known. This makes models uncertain. We are still at the beginning of the exploration of the deep-time Earth. In the present contribution, we review some crucial events in coupled Earth-climate-biosphere evolution over the past 540 million years, focusing on the models that have been developed and what their results suggest. For most of these events, the causes are complex and we are not able to conclusively pinpoint all causal relationships and feedbacks in the Earth system. This remains a largely open scientific field.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe era of the pioneers of geological carbon cycle modeling is coming to an end with the recent development of numerical models simulating the physics of the processes, including climate and the role of vegetation, while taking into account spatialization.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tNumerical models now allow us to address increasingly complex processes, which suggests the possibility of simulating the complete carbon balance of objects as complex as a mountain range.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWhile most of the processes simulated by models are physical-chemical processes in which the role of living organisms is taken into account in a very simple way, via a limited number of parameters, models of the carbon cycle in deep time coupled with increasingly complex ecological models are emerging and are profoundly modifying our understanding of the evolution of our planet's surface.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Phanerozoic eon, spanning approximately 541 million years, has witnessed significant changes in the Earth's carbon cycle, driven by a complex interplay of biological, geological, and climatic processes. This study synthesizes recent advances in modeling techniques to explore the evolution of carbon sources and sinks over this vast timescale. By integrating data from geochemical proxies, paleoclimate reconstructions, and biogeochemical models, we provide a comprehensive overview of the key mechanisms that have shaped the carbon cycle. Our models suggest that the primary drivers of carbon cycle dynamics during the Phanerozoic include variations in volcanic outgassing, weathering rates, and the burial of organic carbon. Notably, the rise of land plants during the Devonian period significantly enhanced silicate weathering, leading to a drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and a cooling trend that persisted into the Carboniferous. This cooling was further amplified by the extensive burial of organic carbon in peat swamps, which later formed coal deposits. In contrast, the Mesozoic era saw a reversal of this trend, with increased volcanic activity and reduced weathering efficiency contributing to higher atmospheric CO2 levels and a warmer climate. The Cenozoic era, particularly the Neogene, experienced a gradual cooling, driven by the uplift of mountain ranges and the associated increase in weathering rates. Our models also highlight the importance of oceanic processes, such as the biological pump and the carbonate compensation depth, in regulating the marine carbon cycle. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of the carbon cycle over deep time and provide a framework for understanding the long-term feedbacks between the carbon cycle, climate, and Earth's biota. The implications of these models for future climate change scenarios are discussed, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to carbon cycle research that integrates both short-term and long-term perspectives.", "label": 1}
