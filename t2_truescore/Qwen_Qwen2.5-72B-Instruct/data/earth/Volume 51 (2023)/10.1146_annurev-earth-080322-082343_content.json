{"grounding": "I describe my career journey from a young girl in Cameroon, West Africa, to a trailblazing geophysicist to my current role as dean. I chronicle my time as a student, the transition to being an early career faculty, launching my research career, and ultimately finding my way to administration. Along the way I helped pioneer biogeophysics as a subdiscipline in geophysics while simultaneously maintaining an international research program in continental rift tectonics. I also describe the many intersectionalities in my life including being the first Black woman in many spaces, being a champion for student success, developing a diverse talent pipeline by enhancing diversity in the geosciences, and navigating academic job searches as part of a dual-career couple. Finally, I acknowledge all those who helped shape my career including the many students I had the opportunity to mentor.", "generated_text": "This paper presents autobiographical notes from Estella Atekwana, a distinguished scholar in biogeophysics and the study of continental rifts. Atekwana reflects on her academic journey, highlighting the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in fostering student success. She discusses the challenges and strategies for supporting dual-career couples in academia, drawing from personal experiences and professional insights. Her narrative underscores the interconnectedness of personal and professional growth, offering valuable lessons for early-career researchers and institutions committed to creating inclusive environments.", "label": 1}
