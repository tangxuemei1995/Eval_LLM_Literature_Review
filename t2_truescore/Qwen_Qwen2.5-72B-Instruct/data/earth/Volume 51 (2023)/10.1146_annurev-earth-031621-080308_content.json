{"grounding": "Volcanic eruptions are driven by bubbles that form when volatile species exsolve from magma. The conditions under which bubbles form depend mainly on magma composition, volatile concentration, presence of crystals, and magma decompression rate. These are all predicated on the mechanism by which volatiles exsolve from the melt to form bubbles. We critically review the known or inferred mechanisms of bubble formation in magmas: homogeneous nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation on crystal surfaces, and spontaneous phase separation (spinodal decomposition). We propose a general approach for calculating bubble nucleation rates as the sum of the contributions from homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, suggesting that nucleation may not be limited to a single mechanism prior to eruption. We identify three major challenges in which further experimental, analytical, and theoretical work is required to permit the development of a general model for bubble formation under natural eruption conditions.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe review the mechanisms of bubble formation in magma and summarize the conditions under which the various mechanisms are understood to operate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tBubble formation mechanisms may evolve throughout magma ascent as conditions change such that bubbles may form simultaneously and sequentially via more than one mechanism.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tContributions from both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation on multiphase crystal phases can be captured via a single equation.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFuture work should focus on constraining macroscopic surface tension, characterizing the microphysics, and developing a general framework for modeling bubble formation, via all mechanisms, over natural magma ascent pathways.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of bubbles in magma is a critical process that influences the dynamics and outcomes of volcanic eruptions. This study investigates the mechanisms of bubble nucleation and growth, focusing on the roles of volatiles and spinodal decomposition in magma. Through a combination of experimental simulations and theoretical modeling, we explore how changes in pressure and temperature affect the nucleation rate and the subsequent dynamics of bubble growth. Our findings indicate that the initial stages of bubble formation are dominated by homogeneous nucleation, driven by the supersaturation of volatiles such as water and carbon dioxide. As the magma decompresses, the nucleation rate increases exponentially, leading to a rapid increase in bubble number density. Spinodal decomposition, a process where the magma spontaneously separates into two phases, further enhances bubble formation by creating favorable conditions for nucleation. The dynamics of bubble growth are then influenced by the viscosity of the magma and the diffusion of volatiles, with higher viscosities and lower diffusivities leading to slower growth rates. These insights into bubble formation and dynamics are crucial for understanding the mechanisms that control the explosivity of volcanic eruptions and can contribute to more accurate predictive models of volcanic behavior.", "label": 1}
