{"grounding": "The continental crust in the overriding plate of the India-Asia collision zone in southern Tibet is characterized by an overthickened layer of felsic composition with an underlying granulite-eclogite layer. A large data set indicates that this crust experienced magmatism from 245 to 10 Ma, as recorded by the Gangdese Batholith. Magmatism was punctuated by flare-ups at 185\u2212170, 90\u221275, and 55\u221245 Ma caused by a combination of external and internal factors. The growth of this crust starts with a period dominated by fractional crystallization and the formation of voluminous (ultra)mafic arc cumulates in the lower crust during subduction, followed by their melting during late-subduction and collision, due to changes in convergence rate. This combined accumulation-melting process resulted in the vertical stratification and density sorting of the Gangdese crust. Comparisons with other similarly thickened collision zones suggests that this is a general process that leads to the stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records the time-integrated development of the world's thickest crust, reaching greater than 50 km at 55\u201345 Ma and greater than 70 km after 32 Ma.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records three magmatic flare-ups in response to distinct drivers; the last one at 55\u221245 Ma marks the arrival of India.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMagmatism was first dominated by fractional crystallization (accumulation) followed by crustal melting: the accumulation-melting process.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tAccumulation-melting in other collision zones provides a general process for vertical stratification and stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Gangdese Batholith, located in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, provides a unique window into the processes of continental crustal growth in a collision zone. This study integrates geochemical, isotopic, and geochronological data to elucidate the magmatic and tectonic evolution of the batholith. The batholith is characterized by a diverse suite of granitoids, ranging from tonalites to granites, which were emplaced during the Cenozoic era. Geochemical analyses reveal that the magmas were derived from both mantle and crustal sources, with significant contributions from the partial melting of the lower continental crust. Isotopic signatures indicate a complex interplay between magmatic arc processes and crustal assimilation, suggesting that the growth of the Gangdese Batholith was influenced by the subduction of the Indian plate beneath the Eurasian plate. The stratification of the crust, as evidenced by variations in magma composition and age, reflects multiple phases of magmatic activity and crustal thickening. This study highlights the importance of magmatic arc processes in the formation and evolution of continental crust, particularly in collisional settings such as the Tibetan Plateau. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of crustal growth mechanisms and the geological history of one of the most significant orogenic belts on Earth.", "label": 1}
