{"grounding": "Terrestrial plants have transformed Earth's surface environments by altering water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. Studying vegetation-climate interaction in deep time has necessarily relied on modern-plant analogs to represent paleo-ecosystems\u2014as methods for reconstructing paleo- and, in particular, extinct-plant function were lacking. This approach is potentially compromised given that plant physiology has evolved through time, and some paleo-plants have no clear modern analog. Advancements in the quantitative reconstruction of whole-plant function provide new opportunities to replace modern-plant analogs and capture age-specific vegetation-climate interactions. Here, we review recent investigations of paleo-plant performance through the integration of fossil and geologic data with process-based ecosystem- to Earth system\u2013scale models to explore how early vascular plants responded to and influenced climate. First, we present an argument for characterizing extinct plants in terms of ecological and evolutionary theory to provide a framework for advancing reconstructed vegetation-climate interactions in deep time. We discuss the novel mechanistic understanding provided by applying these approaches to plants of the late Paleozoic ever-wet tropics and at higher latitudes. Finally, we discuss preliminary applications to paleo-plants in a state-of-the-art Earth system model to highlight the potential implications of different plant functional strategies on our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFor hundreds of millions of years, plants have been a keystone in maintaining the status of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and climate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tExtinct plants have functioned differently across time, limiting our understanding of how processes on Earth interact to produce climate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tNew methods, reviewed here, allow quantitative reconstruction of extinct-plant function based on the fossil record.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIntegrating extinct plants into ecosystem and climate models will expand our understanding of vegetation's role in past environmental change.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "This study employs a systems approach to elucidate the profound impact of plants on Earth's environment during the late Paleozoic era, a period marked by significant climatic and ecological transformations. By integrating plant functional traits and strategies with advanced ecosystem and Earth system modeling, we explore the mechanisms through which early land plants altered atmospheric composition, soil formation, and global climate. Our analysis reveals that the evolution of key plant traits, such as vascular systems and root structures, played a crucial role in enhancing carbon sequestration and oxygen production, thereby driving the transition from a greenhouse to an icehouse climate. Additionally, the expansion of terrestrial vegetation influenced hydrological cycles and nutrient cycling, leading to the development of more complex and diverse ecosystems. The vegetation-climate interactions during this period are reconstructed using a coupled model that simulates the feedbacks between plant growth, atmospheric CO2 levels, and climate patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of plants in shaping Earth's environment and provide insights into the long-term consequences of vegetation dynamics on planetary systems. This research underscores the importance of considering plant functional strategies in understanding past and future environmental changes, offering a robust framework for predicting the impacts of contemporary vegetation shifts on global climate and ecosystems.", "label": 0}
