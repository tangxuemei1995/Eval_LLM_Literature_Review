{"grounding": "Carbonate minerals contain stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen with different masses whose abundances and bond arrangement are governed by thermodynamics. The clumped isotopic value \u0394i is a measure of the temperature-dependent preference of heavy C and O isotopes to clump, or bond with or near each other, rather than with light isotopes in the carbonate phase. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry uses \u0394i values measured by mass spectrometry (\u039447, \u039448) or laser spectroscopy (\u0394638) to reconstruct mineral growth temperature in surface and subsurface environments independent of parent water isotopic composition. Two decades of analytical and theoretical development have produced a mature temperature proxy that can estimate carbonate formation temperatures from 0.5 to 1,100\u00b0C, with up to 1\u20132\u00b0C external precision (2 standard error of the mean). Alteration of primary environmental temperatures by fluid-mediated and solid-state reactions and/or \u0394i values that reflect nonequilibrium isotopic fractionations reveal diagenetic history and/or mineralization processes.

This review synthesizes recent advancements in the methodology and application of clumped isotope thermometry, focusing on the measurement of the abundance of isotopologues containing multiple heavy isotopes (e.g., 13C18O16O) in carbonate minerals. The clumped isotope composition, denoted as \u039447, provides a direct measure of the temperature at which the carbonate formed, independent of the isotopic composition of the fluid. Recent studies have refined the calibration of \u039447 to temperature, improving the precision and accuracy of temperature reconstructions. Advances in mass spectrometry and sample preparation techniques have enabled the analysis of smaller and more diverse carbonate samples, expanding the applicability of this method to a wider range of geological settings. Additionally, the integration of clumped isotope data with other geochemical proxies, such as traditional stable isotopes (\u03b413C and \u03b418O), has provided new insights into the paleoenvironmental and biogeochemical processes that influence carbonate formation. This review also highlights the challenges and limitations of clumped isotope thermometry, including the effects of diagenesis and kinetic fractionation, and discusses future directions for research to address these issues. The continued development of clumped isotope thermometry promises to enhance our understanding of Earth's climate and environmental history.", "label": 1}
