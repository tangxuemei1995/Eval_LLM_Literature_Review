{"grounding": "Planets are expected to conclude their growth through a series of giant impacts: energetic, global events that significantly alter planetary composition and evolution. Computer models and theory have elucidated the diverse outcomes of giant impacts in detail, improving our ability to interpret collision conditions from observations of their remnants. However, many open questions remain, as even the formation of the Moon\u2014a widely suspected giant-impact product for which we have the most information\u2014is still debated. We review giant-impact theory, the diverse nature of giant-impact outcomes, and the governing physical processes. We discuss the importance of computer simulations, informed by experiments, for accurately modeling the impact process. Finally, we outline how the application of probability theory and computational advancements can assist in inferring collision histories from observations, and we identify promising opportunities for advancing giant-impact theory in the future.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGiant impacts exhibit diverse possible outcomes leading to changes in planetary mass, composition, and thermal history depending on the conditions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tImprovements to computer simulation methodologies and new laboratory experiments provide critical insights into the detailed outcomes of giant impacts.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWhen colliding planets are similar in size, they can merge or escape one another with roughly equal probability, but with different effects on their resulting masses, densities, and orbits.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDifferent sequences of giant impacts can produce similar planets, encouraging the use of probability theory to evaluate distinct formation hypothesis.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Giant impacts play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planetary bodies within protoplanetary disks. These high-energy collisions between large planetary embryos and planetesimals are pivotal in shaping the final composition, size, and orbital characteristics of planets. Recent simulations and observational data have provided new insights into the mechanisms and consequences of these events. The angular momentum transfer during giant impacts can lead to the formation of moons, as exemplified by the Earth-Moon system, where a Mars-sized body is hypothesized to have collided with the proto-Earth. Additionally, the redistribution of mass and energy during these impacts can significantly alter the internal structure and thermal evolution of the impacted bodies, influencing their long-term geophysical and geochemical processes. This review synthesizes the current understanding of giant impacts, highlighting their role in the accretion of terrestrial planets and the delivery of volatiles, which are essential for the development of habitable environments. The implications of giant impacts extend beyond our Solar System, as similar processes are likely to occur in exoplanetary systems, providing a framework for understanding the diversity of planetary architectures observed in the universe.", "label": 1}
