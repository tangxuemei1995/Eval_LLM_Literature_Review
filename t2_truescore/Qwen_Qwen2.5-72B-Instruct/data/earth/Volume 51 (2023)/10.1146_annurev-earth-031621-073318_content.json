{"grounding": "For the first time, from early 2019 to the end of 2022, Mars\u2019 shallow and deep interiors have been explored by seismology with the InSight mission. Thanks to the performances of its seismometers and the quality of their robotic installation on the ground, 1,319 seismic events have been detected, including about 90 marsquakes at teleseismic distances, with Mw from 2.5 to 4.7 and at least 6 impacts, the largest ones with craters larger than 130 m. A large fraction of these marsquakes occur in Cerberus Fossae, demonstrating active regional tectonics. Records of pressure-induced seismic noise and signals from the penetration of a heat flow probe have provided subsurface models below the lander. Deeper direct and secondary body wave phase travel time, receiver function, and surface wave analysis have provided the first interior models of Mars, including crustal thickness and crustal layering, mantle structure, thermal lithospheric thickness, and core radius and state.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWith InSight's SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure of Mars) experiment and for the first time in planetary exploration, Mars\u2019 internal structure and seismicity are constrained.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMore than 1,300 seismic events and seismic noise records enable the first comparative seismology studies together with Earth and lunar seismic data.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tInversion of seismic travel times and waveforms provided the first interior model of another terrestrial planet, down to the core.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSeveral impacts were also seismically recorded with their craters imaged from orbit, providing the first data on impact dynamic on Mars.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Mars seismology has emerged as a critical field for understanding the planet's interior structure and geological activity. The InSight mission, equipped with the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), has provided unprecedented data on marsquakes and impact events. Analysis of seismic waves has revealed that the Cerberus Fossae region is particularly active, with frequent seismic events suggesting ongoing tectonic and volcanic processes. The data also indicate a complex interior structure, with evidence of a thin crust, a partially molten mantle, and a large, liquid core. The seismic waves' travel times and amplitudes have been used to infer the presence of distinct layers within the Martian interior, contributing to our understanding of the planet's thermal and compositional evolution. Additionally, the detection of meteoroid impacts has provided insights into the current impact flux on Mars, which is crucial for assessing the planet's geological and environmental conditions. These findings not only enhance our knowledge of Mars but also offer valuable comparisons with Earth and other terrestrial planets, advancing our broader understanding of planetary formation and evolution.", "label": 1}
