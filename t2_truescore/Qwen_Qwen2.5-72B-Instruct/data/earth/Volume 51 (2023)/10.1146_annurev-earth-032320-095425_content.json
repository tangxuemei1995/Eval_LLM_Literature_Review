{"grounding": "An oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals. The early Earth had an anoxic atmosphere, and understanding the rise and maintenance of high O2 levels is critical for investigating what drove our own evolution and for assessing the likely habitability of exoplanets. A growing number of techniques aim to reproduce changes in O2 levels over the Phanerozoic Eon (the past 539 million years). We assess these methods and attempt to draw the reliable techniques together to form a consensus Phanerozoic O2 curve. We conclude that O2 probably made up around 5\u201310% of the atmosphere during the Cambrian and rose in pulses to \u223c15\u201320% in the Devonian, reaching a further peak of greater than 25% in the Permo-Carboniferous before declining toward the present day. Evolutionary radiations in the Cambrian and Ordovician appear consistent with an oxygen driver, and the Devonian \u201cAge of the Fishes\u201d coincides with oxygen rising above 15% atm.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tAn oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals such as humans.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe review the methods for reconstructing past variation in oxygen levels over the past 539 million years (the Phanerozoic Eon).\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe produce a consensus plot of the most likely evolution of atmospheric oxygen levels.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEvolutionary radiations in the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Devonian periods may be linked to rises in oxygen concentration.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Phanerozoic eon, spanning the last 541 million years, has witnessed significant fluctuations in atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels, which have profound implications for the evolution of life and the Earth's geochemical cycles. This study revisits the evolution of atmospheric O2 through the Phanerozoic, integrating recent advancements in geochemical proxies, isotopic records, and paleontological data. We analyze the interplay between the carbon cycle, volcanic outgassing, and biological processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, to reconstruct O2 levels with higher temporal resolution. Our findings suggest that O2 concentrations have oscillated between 15% and 35% over the Phanerozoic, with notable peaks during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, coinciding with the proliferation of land plants and the diversification of terrestrial animals. These high O2 levels are hypothesized to have facilitated the evolution of large-bodied animals and complex ecosystems. Conversely, periods of low O2, such as the end-Permian mass extinction, are linked to widespread ocean anoxia and significant biodiversity loss. The study also highlights the role of tectonic activities and climate change in modulating O2 levels, underscoring the complex feedback mechanisms within the Earth system. This comprehensive review provides a refined understanding of the long-term dynamics of atmospheric O2 and its impact on the evolution of life on Earth.", "label": 1}
