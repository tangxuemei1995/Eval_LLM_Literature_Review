{"grounding": "Future sea-level rise poses an existential threat for many river deltas, yet quantifying the effect of sea-level changes on these coastal landforms remains a challenge. Sea-level changes have been slow compared to other coastal processes during the instrumental record, such that our knowledge comes primarily from models, experiments, and the geologic record. Here we review the current state of science on river delta response to sea-level change, including models and observations from the Holocene until 2300 CE. We report on improvements in the detection and modeling of past and future regional sea-level change, including a better understanding of the underlying processes and sources of uncertainty. We also see significant improvements in morphodynamic delta models. Still, substantial uncertainties remain, notably on present and future subsidence rates in and near deltas. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern sea-level rise also remain elusive, posing major challenges to model validation.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThere are large differences in the initiation time and subsequent delta progradation during the Holocene, likely from different sea-level and sediment supply histories.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tModern deltas are larger and will face faster sea-level rise than during their Holocene growth, making them susceptible to forced transgression.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tRegional sea-level projections have been much improved in the past decade and now also isolate dominant sources of uncertainty, such as the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tVertical land motion in deltas can be the dominant source of relative sea-level change and the dominant source of uncertainty; limited observations complicate projections.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tRiver deltas globally might lose 5% (\u223c35,000 km2) of their surface area by 2100 and 50% by 2300 due to relative sea-level rise under a high-emission scenario.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "River deltas, critical interfaces between land and sea, are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise, a consequence of global climate change. This study synthesizes recent findings from geomorphology and sedimentary geology to assess the resilience and adaptability of river deltas in the face of rising sea levels. Deltas are dynamic environments shaped by the interplay of fluvial, tidal, and wave processes, which are all influenced by the changing climate. As sea levels rise, the balance between sediment supply and accommodation space is disrupted, leading to increased erosion, saltwater intrusion, and the loss of coastal wetlands. The geomorphological response of deltas to these changes varies depending on factors such as the rate of sea-level rise, the magnitude of sediment input, and the degree of human intervention. For instance, deltas with high sediment loads, such as the Mississippi Delta, may have a greater capacity to keep pace with sea-level rise through natural accretion processes. However, deltas with reduced sediment supply, often due to upstream damming and river regulation, are more susceptible to submergence and land loss. This research highlights the importance of integrated coastal management strategies that consider both natural and anthropogenic factors to enhance the resilience of deltaic systems. By understanding the complex interactions between sea-level rise and deltaic geomorphology, this study provides a foundation for developing adaptive management practices that can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on coastal communities and ecosystems.", "label": 1}
