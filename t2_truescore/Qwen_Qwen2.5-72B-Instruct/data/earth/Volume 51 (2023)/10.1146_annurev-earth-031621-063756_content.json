{"grounding": "The strength of lithospheric plates is a central component of plate tectonics, governed by brittle processes in the shallow portion of the plate and ductile behavior in the deeper portion. We review experimental constraints on ductile deformation of olivine, the main mineral in the upper mantle and thus the lithosphere. Olivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (GBS), and diffusion-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (diffusion creep). Deformation in most of the lithosphere is dominated by GBS, except in shear zones\u2014in which diffusion creep dominates\u2014and in the brittle-ductile transition\u2014in which low-temperature plasticity may dominate. We find that observations from naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of the experimentally constrained olivine flow laws to geological conditions but that geophysical observations predict a weaker lithosphere. The causes of this discrepancy are unresolved but likely reside in the uncertainty surrounding processes in the brittle-ductile transition, at which the lithosphere is strongest.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDuctile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is constrained by experimental data for olivine.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tOlivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, and diffusion creep.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tObservations of naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of olivine flow laws from experimental conditions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tExperiments predict stronger lithosphere than geophysical observations, likely due to gaps in constraints on deformation in the brittle-ductile transition.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is a critical process in the dynamics of plate tectonics and the evolution of the Earth's crust. This study investigates the mechanisms of ductile flow in the mantle, focusing on the role of olivine, the predominant mineral in the upper mantle. Through a combination of experimental deformation studies and natural observations, we explore the conditions under which olivine deforms plastically, including temperature, pressure, and strain rate. Our findings indicate that dislocation creep and grain boundary sliding are the primary mechanisms responsible for ductile deformation at depths where temperatures exceed 800\u00b0C and pressures are greater than 1 GPa. These mechanisms facilitate the accommodation of large-scale tectonic movements, such as subduction and continental collision. Additionally, the presence of water and other volatiles is shown to significantly enhance the ductility of olivine, reducing the activation energy for plastic deformation. This research provides insights into the rheological behavior of the lithospheric mantle and its implications for the mechanical strength of tectonic plates. The results are crucial for understanding the long-term deformation of the Earth's lithosphere and the distribution of seismic activity in tectonically active regions.", "label": 1}
