{"grounding": "Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is not only an economic insect but also a model organism for life science research. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) disease is a major infectious disease in the world's sericulture industry. The cocoon loss caused by this disease accounts for more than 60% of the total loss caused by all silkworm diseases. To date, there has been no effective solution for preventing and treating this disease. The most effective measure is to breed disease-resistant varieties. The quickest way to breed disease-resistant varieties is to apply genetic modification. However, this requires that we obtain disease resistance genes and know the mechanism of disease resistance. Since the discovery of disease-resistant resources in 1989, scholars in the sericulture industry around the world have been inspired to search for resistance genes. In the past two decades, with the help of multi-omics technologies, screening of resistance genes, gene localization, protein modification, virus\u2013host interactions, etc., researchers have found some candidate genes that have been proposed to function at the cellular or individual level. Several disease-resistant varieties have been obtained and used in production through hybrid breeding, RNA interference, and genetic modification. This article summarizes and reviews the discovery of and research advances related to silkworm resistance to BmNPV. It is anticipated that the review will inspire scientific researchers to continue searching for disease resistance genes, clarify the molecular mechanism of silkworm disease resistance, and promote disease-resistant silkworm breeding.", "generated_text": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a significant insect in sericulture, but its productivity is often compromised by infections from the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV). Understanding the mechanisms of silkworm resistance to BmNPV is crucial for developing antiviral breeding strategies. This study investigates the genetic and molecular bases of silkworm resistance to BmNPV through comprehensive genetic analysis and gene location studies. We identified several candidate resistant genes that play key roles in the virus\u2013host interaction, including those involved in the immune response, apoptosis, and cellular signaling pathways. Through linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies, we localized these genes to specific chromosomal regions, providing a foundation for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs. Additionally, functional assays revealed that certain resistant genes enhance the silkworm's ability to recognize and neutralize BmNPV, thereby reducing viral replication and spread. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between the silkworm and BmNPV, and offer valuable insights for the development of more resilient silkworm strains through targeted genetic modification and traditional breeding techniques.", "label": 1}
