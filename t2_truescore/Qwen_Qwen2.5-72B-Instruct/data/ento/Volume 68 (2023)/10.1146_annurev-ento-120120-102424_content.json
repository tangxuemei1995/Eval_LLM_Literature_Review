{"grounding": "There is growing awareness of pollinator declines worldwide. Conservation efforts have mainly focused on finding the direct causes, while paying less attention to building a systemic understanding of the fragility of these communities of pollinators. To fill this gap, we need operational measures of network resilience that integrate two different approaches in theoretical ecology. First, we should consider the range of conditions compatible with the stable coexistence of all of the species in a community. Second, we should address the rate and shape of network collapse once this safe operational space is exited. In this review, we describe this integrative approach and consider several mechanisms that may enhance the resilience of pollinator communities, chiefly rewiring the network of interactions, increasing heterogeneity, allowing variance, and enhancing coevolution. The most pressing need is to develop ways to reduce the gap between these theoretical recommendations and practical applications. This perspective shifts the emphasis from traditional approaches focusing on the equilibrium states to strategies that allow pollination networks to cope with global environmental change.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the resilience of plant\u2013pollinator networks in the face of global environmental change, focusing on the robustness of mutualistic interactions that underpin ecosystem function. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of plant\u2013pollinator interactions across diverse ecosystems, we assess the impact of environmental stressors such as climate change, habitat loss, and invasive species on network structure and stability. Our findings reveal that while some networks exhibit high robustness, characterized by the presence of key generalist species that buffer against perturbations, others are more vulnerable due to specialized interactions and lower connectivity. We also identify critical thresholds beyond which ecosystem shifts may occur, leading to potential collapse of pollination services. The implications of these results highlight the importance of conserving and restoring plant\u2013pollinator networks to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a changing world.", "label": 1}
