{"grounding": "The economic and environmental threats posed by non-native forest insects are ever increasing with the continuing globalization of trade and travel; thus, the need for mitigation through effective biosecurity is greater than ever. However, despite decades of research and implementation of preborder, border, and postborder preventative measures, insect invasions continue to occur, with no evidence of saturation, and are even predicted to accelerate. In this article, we review biosecurity measures used to mitigate the arrival, establishment, spread, and impacts of non-native forest insects and possible impediments to the successful implementation of these measures. Biosecurity successes are likely under-recognized because they are difficult to detect and quantify, whereas failures are more evident in the continued establishment of additional non-native species. There are limitations in existing biosecurity systems at global and country scales (for example, inspecting all imports is impossible, no phytosanitary measures are perfect, knownunknowns cannot be regulated against, and noncompliance is an ongoing problem). Biosecurity should be a shared responsibility across countries, governments, stakeholders, and individuals.", "generated_text": "This study examines the multifaceted challenges and strategies associated with forest insect biosecurity, focusing on the processes, patterns, predictions, and pitfalls of managing non-native species. Biological invasions by forest insects pose significant threats to ecosystem health, biodiversity, and economic stability. We review the primary pathways of introduction, including international trade and human-mediated transport, and discuss the effectiveness of current phytosanitary measures. The paper highlights the importance of early detection and rapid response through enhanced surveillance systems, which are critical for the potential eradication of invasive species. However, the complexity of predicting invasion success and the ecological impacts of non-native species remains a significant challenge. Case studies from various regions illustrate the successes and failures of biosecurity protocols, emphasizing the need for adaptive management and international cooperation. This comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for developing more robust and proactive strategies to mitigate the risks of forest insect invasions.", "label": 1}
