{"grounding": "Bed bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) are an important group of obligate hematophagous urban insect pests. The global resurgence of bed bugs, involving the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius L., and the tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus (F.), over the past two decades is believed to be primarily due to the development of insecticide resistance, along with global travel and poor pest management, which have contributed to their spread. This review examines and synthesizes the literature on bed bug origins and their global spread and the literature on historical and contemporary control options. This includes bed bug prevention, detection and monitoring, nonchemical and chemical control methodologies (and their limitations), and potential future control options. Future research needs are highlighted, especially the factors behind the modern resurgence, the necessity of identifying differences between the two bed bug species relevant to control, and the need to improve insecticide test protocols and management strategies.", "generated_text": "Bed bugs, primarily Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, have experienced a global resurgence, necessitating a comprehensive review of historical and contemporary control options. This study synthesizes data from a wide range of sources, including historical texts and recent scientific literature, to evaluate the efficacy of both chemical and nonchemical management strategies. Chemical control methods, such as pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, have been widely used but are increasingly met with resistance. Nonchemical approaches, including heat treatment, mechanical traps, and biological control agents, offer promising alternatives. The integration of these methods into a robust integrated pest management (IPM) framework is essential for sustainable control. This review highlights the importance of combining multiple strategies to address the complex challenges posed by bed bug infestations, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and adaptive management practices.", "label": 1}
