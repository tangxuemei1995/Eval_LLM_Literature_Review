{"grounding": "Wood-boring pests (WBPs) pose an enormous threat to global forest ecosystems because their early stage infestations show no visible symptoms and can result in rapid and widespread infestations at later stages, leading to large-scale tree death. Therefore, early-stage WBP detection is crucial for prompt management response. Early detection of WBPs requires advanced and effective methods like remote sensing. This review summarizes the applications of various remote sensing sensors, platforms, and detection methods for monitoring WBP infestations. The current capabilities, gaps in capabilities, and future potential for the accurate and rapid detection of WBPs are highlighted.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of remote sensing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imagery, for the early detection of wood-boring pests in forest ecosystems. By analyzing spectral signatures and canopy changes, the research aims to develop a robust monitoring system capable of identifying pest infestations at their onset. The integration of high-resolution imagery and machine learning algorithms enhances the accuracy and efficiency of pest detection, providing forest managers with critical information for timely intervention. Field validation confirms the potential of this approach in improving forest health management.", "label": 0}
