{"grounding": "Stingless bees form perennial colonies of honey-making insects. The >600 species of stingless bees, mainly Neotropical, live throughout tropical latitudes. Foragers influence floral biology, plant reproduction, microbe dispersal, and diverse ecosystem functions. As tropical forest residents since the upper Cretaceous, they have had a long evolutionary history without competition from honey bees. Most stingless bees are smaller than any Apis species and recruit nest mates to resources, while their defense strategies exclude stinging behavior but incorporate biting. Stingless bees have diversified ecologically; excel in nesting site selection and mutualisms with plants, arthropods, and microbes; and display opportunism, including co-opting plant defenses. As their biology becomes better known, applications to human endeavors are imposing selective pressures from exploitation and approaches to conservation that entail colony extraction from wildlands. Although some meliponines can adjust to new conditions, their populations shall require tropical diversity for survival and reproduction.", "generated_text": "Stingless bees (Apidae: Apinae: Meliponini) are essential pollinators and honey producers in tropical and subtropical regions. This study explores their ecological roles, focusing on their foraging behavior, nest architecture, and interactions with the environment. Stingless bees collect nectar, pollen, and resin, contributing to plant reproduction and ecosystem health. Their unique social structure and nest-building techniques provide insights into the evolution of eusociality. Bee-keeping practices for stingless bees are gaining attention due to their potential for sustainable honey production and pollination services. This review synthesizes current knowledge on stingless bee ecology, highlighting the importance of conserving these species and their habitats to maintain biodiversity and support agricultural productivity in the tropics.", "label": 1}
