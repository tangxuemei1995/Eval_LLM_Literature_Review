{"grounding": "Communication by substrate-borne mechanical waves is widespread in insects. The specifics of vibrational communication are related to heterogeneous natural substrates that strongly influence signal transmission. Insects generate vibrational signals primarily by tremulation, drumming, stridulation, and tymbalation, most commonly during sexual behavior but also in agonistic, social, and mutualistic as well as defense interactions and as part of foraging strategies. Vibrational signals are often part of multimodal communication. Sensilla and organs detecting substrate vibration show great diversity and primarily occur in insect legs to optimize sensitivity and directionality. In the natural environment, signals from heterospecifics, as well as social and enemy interactions within vibrational communication networks, influence signaling and behavioral strategies. The exploitation of substrate-borne vibrational signaling offers a promising application for behavioral manipulation in pest control.", "generated_text": "Vibrational signaling, a critical component of biotremology, plays a pivotal role in the communication and behavior of numerous insect species. This review explores the functional diversity of substrate-borne communication systems, highlighting the evolutionary adaptations and signaling contexts that underpin these interactions. We examine the role of vibrosensory evolution in shaping the complexity of vibrational signals and their integration with other sensory modalities, such as chemical and auditory cues. The implications of this multimodal signaling for pest management are also discussed, emphasizing the potential for developing novel control strategies that exploit the unique aspects of insect vibrational communication. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of understanding the intricate signaling systems in insects for both ecological and applied contexts.", "label": 1}
