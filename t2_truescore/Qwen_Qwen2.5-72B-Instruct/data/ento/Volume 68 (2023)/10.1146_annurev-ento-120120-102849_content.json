{"grounding": "The use of the functional feeding group\u2013damage type system for analyzing arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants has transformed our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages by providing data, analyses, and interpretation of the local, regional, and global patterns of a 420-Myr history. The early fossil record can be used to answer major questions about the oldest evidence for herbivory, the early emergence of herbivore associations on land plants, and later expansion on seed plants. The subsequent effects of the Permian\u2013Triassic ecological crisis on herbivore diversity, the resulting formation of biologically diverse herbivore communities on gymnosperms, and major shifts in herbivory ensuing from initial angiosperm diversification are additional issues that need to be addressed. Studies ofherbivory resulting from more recent transient spikes and longer-term climate trends provide important data that are applied to current global change and include herbivore community responses to latitude, altitude, and habitat. Ongoing paleoecological themes remaining to be addressed include the antiquity of modern interactions, differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms, and origins of modern tropical forests. The expansion of databases that include a multitude of specimens; improvements in sampling strategies; development of new analytical methods; and, importantly, the ability to address conceptually stimulating ecological and evolutionary questions have provided new impetus in this rapidly advancing field.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the origins and evolution of herbivory on land by examining arthropod and pathogen damage on both fossil and modern plants. We analyze damage types and functional feeding groups across different geological periods, including the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (K\u2013Pg) and Permian\u2013Triassic (P\u2013Tr) ecologic crises, as well as the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Our continental-scale analysis reveals that the diversity and complexity of herbivory have increased over time, with significant shifts in damage types coinciding with major ecological disruptions. During the K\u2013Pg event, we observe a reduction in the diversity of damage types, suggesting a temporary decline in herbivore diversity and plant-herbivore interactions. In contrast, the PETM is characterized by an increase in damage diversity, indicating a rapid expansion of herbivory in response to environmental changes. The P\u2013Tr crisis, one of the most severe mass extinctions, led to a prolonged period of reduced herbivory, followed by a gradual recovery and diversification. These findings provide insights into the resilience and adaptability of plant-herbivore systems in the face of global environmental changes, highlighting the importance of long-term ecological studies in understanding the dynamics of herbivory over geological time scales.", "label": 0}
