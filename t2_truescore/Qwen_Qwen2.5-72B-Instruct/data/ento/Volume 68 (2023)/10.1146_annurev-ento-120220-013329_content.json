{"grounding": "Mites are masters at attaching to larger animals, often insects, in a temporary symbiosis called phoresy that allows these tiny animals to exploit patchy resources. In this article, we examine phoresy in the Acari, including those that feed on their carriers in transit, from a broad perspective. From a phylogenetic perspective, phoresy has evolved several times from free-living ancestors but also has been lost frequently. Rotting logs appear to be the first patchy resource exploited by phoretic mites, but the evolution of rapid life cycles later permitted exploitation of short-lived resources. As phoresy is a temporary symbiosis, most species have off-host interactions with their carrier. These relationships can be highly complex and context dependent but often are exploitative of the carrier's resources or progeny. Transitions from phoresy to parasitism seem widespread, but evidence for transitions from obligate phoretic parasitism to permanent parasitism is weak.", "generated_text": "Phoresy, a form of symbiotic relationship where one organism (the phoront) attaches to another (the carrier) for transport, is a widespread phenomenon among mites (Acari). This study explores the complex dynamics of phoretic relationships, revealing that these interactions are not merely passive dispersal mechanisms but can involve conditional relationships that shift between mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and new empirical data, we demonstrate that the nature of these relationships is influenced by environmental factors, host availability, and the life history traits of both the phoront and the carrier. Our findings highlight the importance of phoresy in the dispersal and survival of mites, and suggest that these interactions play a crucial role in shaping host relationships and ecosystem dynamics. This research provides a deeper understanding of the adaptive significance of phoresy and its implications for the study of symbiosis and parasitism.", "label": 1}
