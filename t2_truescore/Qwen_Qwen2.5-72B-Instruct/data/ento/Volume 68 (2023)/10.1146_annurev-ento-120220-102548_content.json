{"grounding": "The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), is a well-known agricultural pest in its native range, North and South America, and has become a major invasive pest around the globe in the past decade. In this review, we provide an overview to update what is known about S. frugiperda in its native geographic ranges. This is followed by discussion of studies from the invaded areas to gain insights into S. frugiperda's ecology, specifically its reproductive biology, host plant use, status of insecticide resistance alleles, and biocontrol methods in native and invasive regions. We show that reference to host strains is uninformative in the invasive populations because multidirectional introduction events likely underpinned its recent rapid spread. Given that recent genomic analyses show that FAW is much more diverse than was previously assumed, and natural selection forces likely differ geographically, region-specific approaches will be needed to control this global pest.", "generated_text": "Spodoptera frugiperda, commonly known as the fall armyworm, is a significant agricultural pest with a complex ecology and evolutionary history. This review synthesizes current knowledge on its taxonomy, population genetics, host plant use, strain hybridization, mate attraction, and insecticide resistance. Genetic studies reveal distinct lineages and hybridization events that influence its adaptability and spread. Host plant use varies widely, impacting crop selection and management strategies. Mate attraction mechanisms, including pheromone communication, are crucial for understanding population dynamics and developing control methods. Insecticide resistance has emerged as a critical challenge, necessitating integrated pest management approaches that combine biological, chemical, and cultural practices. This comprehensive overview highlights the need for continued research to address the ecological and evolutionary complexities of S. frugiperda and to develop sustainable management options.", "label": 1}
