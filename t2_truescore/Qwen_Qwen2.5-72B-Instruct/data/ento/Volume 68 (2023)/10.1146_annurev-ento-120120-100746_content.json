{"grounding": "Insect eggs are exposed to a plethora of abiotic and biotic threats. Their survival depends on both an innate developmental program and genetically determined protective traits provided by the parents. In addition, there is increasing evidence that (a) parents adjust the egg phenotype to the actual needs, (b) eggs themselves respond to environmental challenges, and (c) egg-associated microbes actively shape the egg phenotype. This review focuses on the phenotypic plasticity of insect eggs and their capability to adjust themselves to their environment. We outline the ways in which the interaction between egg and environment is two-way, with the environment shaping the egg phenotype but also with insect eggs affecting their environment. Specifically, insect eggs affect plant defenses, host biology (in the case of parasitoid eggs), and insect oviposition behavior. We aim to emphasize that the insect egg, although it is a sessile life stage, actively responds to and interacts with its environment.", "generated_text": "Phenotypic plasticity in insect eggs is a critical adaptive mechanism that allows species to thrive in diverse and changing environments. This study investigates how insect eggs exhibit adaptive plasticity in response to various environmental challenges, including microbial threats and plant defenses. Through a combination of field observations and laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that insect eggs can alter their developmental trajectories, morphology, and chemical defenses to enhance survival. For instance, eggs laid on plants with high levels of defensive compounds show increased resistance to these chemicals, while those exposed to microbial pathogens exhibit enhanced immune responses. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between environmental cues and the developmental plasticity of insect eggs, underscoring their importance in ecological and evolutionary contexts.", "label": 0}
