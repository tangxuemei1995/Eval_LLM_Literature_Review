{"grounding": "Genetically engineered corn and cotton that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used to manage insect pests in the United States and elsewhere. In some cases, this has led to regional suppression of pest populations and pest eradication within the United States, and these outcomes were associated with reductions in conventional insecticides and increased profits for farmers. In other instances, pests evolved resistance to multiple Bt traits, compromising the capacity of Bt crops to manage pests and leading to increased feeding injury to crops in the field. Several aspects of pest biology and pest\u2013crop interactions were associated with cases where pests remained susceptible versus instances where pests evolved resistance. The viability of future transgenic traits can be improved by learning from these past outcomes. In particular, efforts should be made to delay resistance by increasing the prevalence of refuges and using integrated pest management.", "generated_text": "The deployment of Bt crops, genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, has revolutionized pest management in the United States, particularly for key pests in corn and cotton. These crops have shown significant efficacy against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, reducing the reliance on chemical insecticides. However, the evolution of resistance in target pests poses a critical challenge to the sustainability of Bt technology. Insect resistance management (IRM) strategies, such as the high-dose/refuge approach, have been implemented to delay resistance development. This strategy involves planting a portion of the field with non-Bt crops (refuge) to ensure the survival of susceptible insects, which can then mate with any resistant individuals. Despite these efforts, resistance has been documented in some pest populations, necessitating ongoing monitoring and adaptive management practices. This review examines the current status of Bt crop adoption, the effectiveness of IRM strategies, and the implications for future pest management in the United States.", "label": 1}
