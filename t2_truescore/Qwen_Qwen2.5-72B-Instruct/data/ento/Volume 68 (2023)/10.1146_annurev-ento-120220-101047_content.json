{"grounding": "Although it is generally more adaptive for insects to produce additional generations than to have longer life cycles, some insects produce one or fewer generations per year (univoltine or semivoltine life cycles, respectively). Some insects with the potential to produce multiple generations per year produce a univoltine life cycle in response to environmental conditions. Obligatory univoltine insects have a single long diapause or multiple diapauses in different seasons. Semivoltine insects have multiple diapauses in different years, a prolonged diapause for more than a year, or diapause controlled by a circannual rhythm. Diapause in these insects greatly varies among species both in the physiological mechanism and in the evolutionary background, and there is no general rule defining it. In this review, we survey the physiological control of univoltine and semivoltine insects\u2019 diapause and discuss the adaptive significance of the long life cycles. Although constraints such as slow development are sometimes responsible for these life cycles, the benefits of these life cycles can be explained by bet-hedging in many cases. We also discuss the effect of climate warming on these life cycles as a future area of research.", "generated_text": "Diapause, a period of arrested development and reduced metabolic activity, is a critical adaptive strategy in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, enabling organisms to survive unfavorable environmental conditions. This study explores the mechanisms and ecological implications of diapause in these life cycles, focusing on the roles of bet-hedging, circannual rhythms, and phenotypic plasticity. Using a combination of field observations and laboratory experiments, we investigated how climate warming affects the timing and duration of diapause in various insect species. Our results indicate that prolonged diapause is increasingly observed as a response to unpredictable environmental cues, suggesting a shift in the evolutionary strategy from fixed to more flexible diapause induction. This phenotypic plasticity in diapause timing is crucial for seasonal adaptation, allowing species to optimize their life cycle in response to changing climatic conditions. The findings highlight the importance of understanding diapause regulation in the context of global environmental changes, as it can have significant implications for population dynamics and ecosystem stability.", "label": 1}
