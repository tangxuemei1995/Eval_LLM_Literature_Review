{"grounding": "This article reviews economic research on business taxation, with a focus on corporate income taxation. We discuss what this research can contribute to current debates about corporate tax policy and where existing research is incomplete or inconclusive, so that clarification is needed. The issues we discuss include the incidence of the corporate income tax, its effect on investment and economic growth, the problem of international tax avoidance, and the role of corporate taxes in economic crises, including the current debate about taxes on windfall profits.\n", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of corporate taxation on multinational companies, particularly during economic crises. It explores how tax incidence affects corporate behavior and financial performance. Using a comprehensive dataset of multinational firms, the research identifies significant variations in tax strategies and their economic outcomes. The findings suggest that during crises, companies with more flexible tax structures are better positioned to mitigate financial losses and maintain operational stability.", "label": 0}
