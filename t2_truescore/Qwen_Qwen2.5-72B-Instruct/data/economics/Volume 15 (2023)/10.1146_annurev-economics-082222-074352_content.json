{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the methods used for algorithmic text analysis in economics, with a focus on three key contributions. First, we introduce methods for representing documents as high-dimensional count vectors over vocabulary terms, for representing words as vectors, and for representing word sequences as embedding vectors. Second, we define four core empirical tasks that encompass most text-as-data research in economics and enumerate the various approaches that have been taken so far to accomplish these tasks. Finally, we flag limitations in the current literature, with a focus on the challenge of validating algorithmic output.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the application of advanced text algorithms, including topic models, word embeddings, and transformer models, in the field of economics. By treating text as data, these algorithms enable the extraction of meaningful insights from large volumes of textual information, enhancing our understanding of economic phenomena. The integration of large language models further amplifies the potential for analyzing complex economic narratives and patterns, offering new avenues for research and policy-making.", "label": 0}
