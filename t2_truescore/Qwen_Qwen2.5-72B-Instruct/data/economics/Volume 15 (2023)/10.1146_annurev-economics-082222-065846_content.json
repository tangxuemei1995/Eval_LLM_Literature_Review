{"grounding": "The dynamic causal effect of an intervention on an outcome is of paramount interest to applied macro- and microeconomics research. However, this question has been generally approached differently by the two literatures. In making the transition from traditional time series methods to applied microeconometrics, local projections can serve as a natural bridge. Local projections can translate the familiar language of vector autoregressions and impulse responses into the language of potential outcomes and treatment effects. There are gains to be made by both literatures from greater integration of well-established methods in each. This review shows how to make these connections and points to potential areas of further research.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of local projections (LPs) in the field of applied economics, offering a robust alternative to traditional vector autoregressions (VARs) for analyzing dynamic relationships in panel data. By leveraging the potential outcomes framework, LPs provide a flexible and transparent method for estimating causal effects, particularly in settings with heterogeneous treatment effects. The paper demonstrates the advantages of LPs through empirical examples, highlighting their ability to handle non-linearities and time-varying coefficients, making them a valuable tool for econometric analysis.", "label": 1}
