{"grounding": "We review theoretical and empirical work on the economic effects of the United States and China trade relations during the past 20 years. We first discuss the origins of the China shock and its measurement and present methods used to study its economic effects on different outcomes. We then focus on the recent US\u2013China trade war. We review methods used to evaluate its effects, describe its economic effects, and analyze whether this increase in trade protectionism reverted the effects of the China shock. The main lessons learned in this review are that (a) the aggregate gains from US\u2013China trade created winners and losers; (b) China's trade expansion seems not to be the main cause of the decline in US manufacturing employment during the same period; and (c) the recent trade war generated welfare losses, had small employment effects, and was ineffective in reversing the distributional effects due to the China shock.", "generated_text": "This study examines the multifaceted impacts of US\u2013China trade relations, particularly focusing on the trade war and the 'China shock,' on US manufacturing employment through the lens of dynamic spatial economics and input-output linkages. By integrating comprehensive trade data with detailed employment statistics, the analysis reveals that while the initial surge in Chinese imports led to significant job losses in certain US manufacturing sectors, the subsequent trade war imposed additional costs on both countries. The research highlights the importance of input-output linkages, demonstrating that disruptions in supply chains exacerbated the negative effects on US manufacturing employment. Moreover, the study underscores the role of regional economic dynamics, showing that areas with more diversified economies and stronger innovation ecosystems were better able to adapt to the trade shocks. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in crafting more resilient trade policies and supporting affected industries and workers.", "label": 0}
