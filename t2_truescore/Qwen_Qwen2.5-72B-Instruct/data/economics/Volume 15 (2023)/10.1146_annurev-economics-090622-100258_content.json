{"grounding": "In this article we survey recent advances in the economic theory of cultural transmission. We highlight three main themes on which the literature has made great progress in the last 10 years: the domain of traits subject to cultural transmission; the microfoundations for the technology of transmission; and feedback effects between culture, institutions, and various socioeconomic environments. We conclude by suggesting interesting areas for future research.", "generated_text": "This paper explores recent developments in the economic theory of cultural transmission, focusing on the mechanisms through which cultural norms and practices evolve and persist over time. It examines the role of institutions in shaping cultural dynamics and the implications for economic outcomes, integrating insights from evolutionary game theory and institutional economics.", "label": 0}
