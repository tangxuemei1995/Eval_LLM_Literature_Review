{"grounding": "In recent years, experiments have documented a new mechanism that leads to failures of profit maximization: the failure of contingent thinking (FCT). This article summarizes key experimental findings, clarifies what constitutes an FCT, and outlines how FCTs can be tested in other environments. Subsequently, we relate FCTs to recent theoretical work on cognitive limitations in behavioral economics. Finally, we connect FCTs to suboptimal behavior documented in applied environments.", "generated_text": "This study explores the cognitive limitations that lead to failures in contingent thinking, challenging the sure-thing principle. Through a series of behavioral experiments, we examine how individuals deviate from rational decision-making, providing insights into the psychological mechanisms underlying these cognitive biases. The findings contribute to the fields of cognitive economics and behavioral theory.", "label": 0}
