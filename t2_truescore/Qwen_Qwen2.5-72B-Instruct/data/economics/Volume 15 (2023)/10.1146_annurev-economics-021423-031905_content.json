{"grounding": "This article compares early childhood enrichment programs that promote social mobility for disadvantaged children within and across generations. Instead of conducting a standard meta-analysis, we present a harmonized primary data analysis of programs that shape current policy. Our analysis is a template for rigorous syntheses and comparisons across programs. We analyze new long-run life-cycle data collected for iconic programs when participants are middle-aged and their children are in their twenties. The iconic programs are omnibus in nature and offer many services to children and their parents. We compare them with relatively low-cost, more focused home-visiting programs. Participants in programs that enrich home environments grow up with better skills, jobs, earnings, marital stability, and health, as well as reduced participation in crime. The long-run monetized gains are substantially greater than the costs of the iconic programs. A study of focused home-visiting programs that target parents enables us to isolate a crucial component of successful programs: They activate and promote the parenting skills of child caregivers. The home-visiting programs we analyze produce outcomes comparable to those of the iconic omnibus programs. National implementation of the programs with long-run follow-up that we analyze would substantially shrink the overall Black-White earnings gap in the United States.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of parenting in promoting social mobility within and across generations, focusing on the development of skills and the reduction of inequality. Using a longitudinal dataset spanning three decades, we analyze the impact of various parenting practices, such as cognitive stimulation, emotional support, and educational involvement, on children's educational and occupational outcomes. Our findings indicate that high-quality parenting significantly enhances children's cognitive and social skills, which are crucial for academic success and later career advancement. Moreover, the positive effects of parenting are observed across different socioeconomic backgrounds, suggesting that supportive parenting can mitigate the adverse effects of early-life disadvantage. The study also reveals that the benefits of effective parenting extend to the next generation, as individuals who experienced supportive parenting are more likely to provide similar support to their own children, thus perpetuating a cycle of upward social mobility. These results underscore the importance of parenting in human development and highlight the potential of targeted interventions to promote social mobility and reduce inequality.", "label": 0}
