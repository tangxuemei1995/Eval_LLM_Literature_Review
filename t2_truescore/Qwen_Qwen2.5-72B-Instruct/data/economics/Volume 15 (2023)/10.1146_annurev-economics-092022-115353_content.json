{"grounding": "Gender differences in negotiation are seen as contributing to the persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes. We review the literature on interventions aiming to mute differences in negotiation and assess their effectiveness in reducing the gender pay gap. We present research on initiatives that aspire to increase how often and how women negotiate, as well as institutional changes that ban negotiations, ban requests for employee salary history, and improve wage transparency. Along with reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of these initiatives, we point to unintended consequences that warrant caution at implementation. The review makes clear that initial efforts to push women to negotiate more like men have shifted to alter instead the conditions of the negotiation. This shift results not only from wanting to consider policies that \u201cfix the institutions\u201d rather than \u201cfixing the women,\u201d but also from evidence that these interventions are more successful in securing pay equity.", "generated_text": "This study examines the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at reducing gender disparities in negotiation outcomes. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we analyze the impact of negotiation training, salary history bans, and increased transparency in the bargaining process. Our findings suggest that while negotiation training can empower women to adopt more assertive strategies, it is not sufficient on its own to close the gender gap. Salary history bans and increased transparency, however, show promising results in leveling the playing field by mitigating the influence of past salary disparities and fostering more equitable negotiations. These interventions, when implemented in conjunction, can significantly reduce the gender gap in negotiation outcomes, promoting fairness and equality in the workplace.", "label": 0}
