{"grounding": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator and its demand system are ubiquitous in business cycles theory, macroeconomic growth and development, international trade and other general equilibrium fields; this is because the CES aggregator has many knife-edge properties that help to keep the analysis tractable in the presence of many goods and factors. However, this also makes it hard to tell which properties of CES are responsible for certain results. Furthermore, it is necessary to relax some of those properties for certain applications. In this article, I review several classes of non-CES aggregators, each of which removes some properties of CES and keeps the rest to introduce some flexibility while retaining the tractability of CES as much as possible. These classes are named after the properties of CES they keep. I explain how these classes are related to each other and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses to indicate which classes are suited for which applications.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of non-CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) aggregators, which are essential in modeling nonhomothetic preferences and CRS (Constant Returns to Scale) production functions. We explore the properties of implicit additivity and how it facilitates the aggregation of goods and services in economic models. The paper also delves into the concepts of gross substitutes and gross complements, highlighting their roles in determining the substitutability and complementarity of inputs. Additionally, we discuss the distinction between essential and inessential goods, and how these classifications impact the structure of demand and production functions. Through a guided tour of theoretical foundations and empirical applications, this paper aims to provide a clear understanding of the complexities and nuances of non-CES aggregators in modern economic analysis.", "label": 0}
