{"grounding": "International trade contributes directly to global greenhouse gas emissions, as the carbon content of high-emission products is priced differently in different countries. This phenomenon is termed carbon leakage. Thus, not putting a price on carbon is theoretically equivalent to an export subsidy, although that would be difficult to challenge in the context of multilateral trade law. Leakage can be alleviated by pricing the carbon embedded in imported products through a border carbon adjustment (BCA), be it a tax, a carbon tariff, or a regulation requiring the purchase of emissions allowances. The design of a BCA is a compromise between environmental effectiveness in preventing leakage, economic effectiveness in preserving competitiveness and ensuring acceptability, technical feasibility of the implementation, and World Trade Organization compatibility. An import-limited BCA is more effective than free emissions allowances in reducing leakage, but it does not preserve the export competitiveness of the country imposing it.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the economic rationale and potential impacts of implementing border carbon adjustments (BCAs) as a policy tool to address carbon leakage and support global climate action. BCAs, often referred to as carbon tariffs, aim to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers by adjusting the carbon price of imported goods to match domestic carbon pricing policies. The analysis reveals that BCAs can effectively prevent carbon leakage, where industries relocate to countries with less stringent environmental regulations, thereby undermining the effectiveness of domestic climate policies. However, the paper also highlights the potential trade-offs, including the risk of trade disputes and the complexity of accurately measuring and applying carbon content to imported goods. Furthermore, the concept of a 'climate club' is explored, where countries with similar climate ambitions collaborate to implement BCAs, enhancing their collective bargaining power and promoting a more coordinated global response to climate change. The findings suggest that while BCAs are a promising policy instrument, their design and implementation must be carefully considered to maximize benefits and minimize adverse effects.", "label": 1}
