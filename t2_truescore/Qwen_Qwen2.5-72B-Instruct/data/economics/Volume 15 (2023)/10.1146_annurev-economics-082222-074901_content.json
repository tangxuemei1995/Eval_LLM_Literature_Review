{"grounding": "Over the last two decades, the unprecedented increase in non-bank financial intermediation, particularly the rise of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, accounts for nearly half of the external financing flows to emerging markets, exceeding cross-border lending by global banks. Evidence suggests that investment fund flows enhance risk sharing across borders and provide emerging markets access to more diverse forms of financing. However, a growing body of evidence also indicates that investment funds are inherently more vulnerable to liquidity and redemption risks during periods of global financial market stress, increasing the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. Benchmark-driven investments, namely passive funds, appear particularly sensitive to global risk shocks, such as tightening US dollar funding conditions, compared to their active fund counterparts. The procyclicality of investment fund flows to emerging markets during times of global stress poses financial stability concerns, with implications for the role of macroprudential policy.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of global risk shocks on non-bank financial intermediation and their implications for emerging market vulnerabilities. Using a comprehensive dataset of investment funds and international capital flows, we find that global risk shocks significantly affect the behavior of non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly investment funds, leading to increased capital outflows from emerging markets. The analysis reveals that benchmark investing practices exacerbate these outflows, as funds tend to rebalance their portfolios towards safer assets during periods of heightened global risk. This behavior amplifies tail risk in emerging markets, making them more susceptible to financial instability. The findings highlight the need for policymakers to consider the role of non-bank financial intermediaries in the transmission of global risk and to develop strategies to mitigate the associated vulnerabilities in emerging economies.", "label": 0}
