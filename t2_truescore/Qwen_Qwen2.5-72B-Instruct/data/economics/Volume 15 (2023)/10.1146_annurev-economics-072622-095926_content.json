{"grounding": "China's financial system has been integral to its spectacular economic growth over the past 40 years. We review the recent literature on China's financial system and its connections to the Chinese economy based on the categories of Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (AFRE), a broad measure of the nation's yearly flow of liquidity accounting for unique features of China's financial system. While early work on China's financial system emphasizes the state-owned enterprise reform, the recent literature explores other more market-based financing channels\u2014including shadow banking\u2014that grew rapidly after 2010 and have become important components of AFRE. These new financing channels not only are intertwined with each other, but also, and more importantly, are often ultimately tied back to the dominant banking sector in China. Understanding the mechanisms behind these channels and their intrinsic connections is crucial to alleviate capital allocation distortion and mitigate potential systemic financial risk in China.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of China\u2019s financial system and its impact on economic development. Since the initiation of economic reforms in 1978, China has undergone significant transformations, with the financial sector playing a pivotal role. The review highlights the evolution of financial markets, the role of state-owned banks, and the emergence of fintech. It also examines the concept of implicit guarantees, which have influenced risk perceptions and investment behaviors. Despite substantial progress, challenges remain, including the need for further market liberalization and regulatory reforms to enhance financial stability and efficiency. The paper concludes with an analysis of the implications of these developments for China\u2019s continued economic growth and global financial integration.", "label": 0}
