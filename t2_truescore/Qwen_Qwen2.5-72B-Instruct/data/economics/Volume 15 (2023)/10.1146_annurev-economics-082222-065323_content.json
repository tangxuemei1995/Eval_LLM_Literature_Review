{"grounding": "This article surveys the development of nonparametric models and methods for estimation of choice models with nonlinear budget sets. The discussion focuses on the budget set regression, that is, the conditional expectation of a choice variable given the budget set. Utility maximization in a nonparametric model with general heterogeneity reduces the curse of dimensionality in this regression. Empirical results using this regression are different from maximum likelihood and give informative inference. The article also considers the information provided by kink probabilities for nonparametric utility with general heterogeneity. Instrumental variable estimation and the evidence it provides of heterogeneity in preferences are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the econometric challenges and solutions associated with nonlinear budget sets, focusing on the random utility model and budget set regression. We analyze the phenomenon of bunching, where individuals cluster their choices at kinks or notches in the budget set, and discuss the use of instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of consumer behavior under complex budget constraints and provide robust methods for empirical analysis.", "label": 0}
