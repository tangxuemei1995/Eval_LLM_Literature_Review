{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the fields of psychosocial and integrative oncology, highlighting common psychological reactions to being diagnosed with and treated for cancer, including distress, anxiety, depression, fear of cancer recurrence and caregiver burden, as well as symptoms of fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance. Patterns of symptomatology across the disease continuum are also discussed. Interventions targeted at treating these symptoms are reviewed, including acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, mind-body therapies, and meaning-based approaches designed for people with advanced stages of disease, including psychedelic therapy. Common methodological issues and shortcomings of the evidence base are summarized with design recommendations, and a discussion of trends in future research including pragmatic research design, digital health interventions, and implementation science completes the article.", "generated_text": "This review examines the role of psychosocial and integrative oncology interventions in managing psychological distress, anxiety, and depression across the cancer disease trajectory. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions are highlighted for their efficacy in reducing distress and improving quality of life. Emerging evidence supports the use of mind-body therapies and psychedelic-assisted therapy as complementary approaches to enhance emotional well-being and coping mechanisms. These interventions are particularly beneficial in addressing the unique challenges faced by patients at different stages of cancer, from diagnosis to survivorship. The integration of these therapies into standard oncology care is discussed, emphasizing the need for a holistic, patient-centered approach to support the psychological and physical health of individuals affected by cancer.", "label": 1}
