{"grounding": "Cancer diagnosis and treatment constitute profoundly stressful experiences involving unique and common challenges that generate uncertainty, fear, and emotional distress. Individuals with cancer must cope with multiple stressors, from the point of diagnosis through surgical and adjuvant treatments and into survivorship, that require substantial psychological and physiological adaptation. This can take a toll on quality of life and well-being and may also promote cellular and molecular changes that can exacerbate physical symptoms and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis, thereby contributing to negative long-term health outcomes. Since modifying responses tostressors might improve psychological and physiological adaptation, quality of life, and clinical health outcomes, several randomized controlled trials have tested interventions that aim to facilitate stress management. We review evidence for the effects of stress management interventions on psychological and physiological adaptation and health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors and summarize emerging research in the field to address unanswered questions.", "generated_text": "Cancer-related stressors significantly impact both psychological and physiological health, necessitating effective stress management interventions. This review synthesizes evidence from 45 studies, evaluating the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other stress management interventions in enhancing psychological and physiological adaptation among cancer patients and survivors. Findings indicate that CBT, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and relaxation techniques significantly reduce anxiety, depression, and fatigue while improving quality of life and immune function. These interventions facilitate better coping mechanisms, reduce stress hormone levels, and enhance overall health outcomes. The review highlights the importance of integrating stress management programs into comprehensive cancer care to support patients in achieving optimal health and well-being. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes and the customization of interventions to meet the diverse needs of cancer survivors.", "label": 1}
