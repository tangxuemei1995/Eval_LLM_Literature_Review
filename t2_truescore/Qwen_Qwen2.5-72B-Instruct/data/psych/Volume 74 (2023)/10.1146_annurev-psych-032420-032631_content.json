{"grounding": "Culture and personality are two central topics in psychology. Individuals are culturally influenced influencers of culture, yet the research linking culture and personality has been limited and fragmentary. We integrate the literatures on culture and personality with recent advances in socioecology and genetics to formulate the Socioecological-Genetic Framework of Culture and Personality. Our framework not only delineates the mutual constitution of culture and personality but also sheds light on (a) the roots of culture and personality, (b) how socioecological changes partly explain temporal trends in culture and personality, and (c) how genes and culture/socioecology interact to influence personality (i.e., nature \u00d7 nurture interactions). By spotlighting the roles of socioecology and genetics, our integrative framework advances the understanding of culture and personality.", "generated_text": "This study proposes a socioecological-genetic framework to explore the interplay between culture and personality, examining their roots, trends, and mutual influences. By integrating insights from socioecology and genetics, we investigate how environmental factors and genetic predispositions shape cultural norms and individual personality traits. The framework highlights the dynamic nature of both culture and personality, considering how they evolve over time through cultural change and personality development. We also emphasize the importance of nature\u2013nurture interactions, particularly genes \u00d7 environment (G\u00d7E) interactions, in understanding the complex mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Empirical evidence from longitudinal studies and cross-cultural research supports the framework, suggesting that both cultural and genetic factors play crucial roles in the development and expression of personality traits.", "label": 1}
