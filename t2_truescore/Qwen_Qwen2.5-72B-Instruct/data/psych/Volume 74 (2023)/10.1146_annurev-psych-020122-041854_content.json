{"grounding": "Exposure to adversity (e.g., poverty, bereavement) is a robust predictor of disruptions in psychological functioning. However, people vary greatly in their responses to adversity; some experience severe long-term disruptions, others experience minimal disruptions or even improvements. We refer to the latter outcomes\u2014faring better than expected given adversity\u2014as psychological resilience. Understanding what processes explain resilience has critical theoretical and practical implications. Yet, psychology's understanding of resilience is incomplete, for two reasons: (a) We lack conceptual clarity, and (b) two major approaches to resilience\u2014the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach\u2014have limitations and are relatively isolated from one another. To address these two obstacles,we first discuss conceptual questions about resilience. Next, we offer an integrative affect-regulation framework that capitalizes on complementary strengths of both approaches. This framework advances our understanding of resilience by integrating existing findings, highlighting gaps in knowledge, and guiding future research.", "generated_text": "This paper presents an affect-regulation framework for understanding psychological resilience, emphasizing the role of emotion and emotion regulation in coping with adversity. Resilience is conceptualized as a dynamic process wherein individuals effectively manage emotional responses to stress, thereby maintaining or enhancing psychological health. The framework integrates theories of emotion regulation and stress, highlighting the importance of adaptive strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Empirical evidence supports the notion that resilient individuals exhibit greater flexibility in their affect-regulation strategies, allowing them to navigate challenging situations with greater ease. The implications of this framework for intervention and prevention programs are discussed, suggesting that enhancing affect-regulation skills can foster resilience and improve mental well-being in the face of stress and adversity.", "label": 1}
