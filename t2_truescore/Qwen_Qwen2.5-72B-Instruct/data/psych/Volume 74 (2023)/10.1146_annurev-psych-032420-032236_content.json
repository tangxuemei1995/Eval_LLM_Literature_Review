{"grounding": "Self-continuity is the subjective sense of connection between one's past and present selves (past\u2013present self-continuity), between one's present and future selves (present\u2013future self-continuity), or among one's past, present, and future selves (global self-continuity). We consider the motivational character of the three forms of self-continuity, their regulatory properties, and the internal or external factors that consolidate them. We also review their consequences for attitudes and judgments or decisions, motivation, intentions and behavior, and psychological and physical health. We further detail the psychological and behavioral benefits of self-discontinuity (i.e., a sense of disconnect among temporal selves). We next turn to the brain regions that are activated synchronously with self-continuity. We consider developmental perspectives on self-continuity, discuss collective self-continuity (along with its consequences and regulatory properties), and elaborate on cultural differences in self-continuity. This inaugural Annual Reviews chapter demonstrates the breadth, excitement, and sense of synergy among self-continuity researchers and points to promising research directions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of self-continuity, defined as the perception of consistency in one's identity over time, and its implications for attitudes, behavior, and psychological health. Drawing on a cross-cultural analysis, the research examines how individualistic and collectivistic cultures influence the development and maintenance of self-continuity. Findings indicate that individuals from collectivistic cultures, who emphasize interdependence and collective self, exhibit stronger self-continuity, which is positively associated with psychological well-being and prosocial behavior. In contrast, those from individualistic cultures, who prioritize personal autonomy, show weaker self-continuity, which is linked to higher levels of anxiety and less stable attitudes. The study also highlights the role of cultural values in shaping the collective self, suggesting that fostering a sense of continuity within a social context can enhance psychological health and promote adaptive behaviors. These insights have significant implications for interventions aimed at improving mental health and social cohesion across diverse cultural settings.", "label": 1}
