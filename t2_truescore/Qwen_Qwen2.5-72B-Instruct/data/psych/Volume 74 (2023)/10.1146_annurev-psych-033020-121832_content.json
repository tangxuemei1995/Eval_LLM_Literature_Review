{"grounding": "This review focuses on conceptual and empirical research on determinants of social cognitive aging. We present an integrated model [the social cognitive resource (SCoRe) framework] to organize the literature and describe how social cognitive resilience is determined jointly by capacity and motivational resources. We discuss how neurobiological aging, driven by genetic and environmental influences, is associated with broader sensory, neural, and physiological changes that are direct determinants of capacity as well as indirect determinants of motivation via their influence on expectation of loss versus reward and cognitive effort valuation. Research is reviewed that shows how contextual factors, such as relationship status, familiarity, and practice, are fundamental to understanding the availability of both types of resource. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of social cognitive change in late adulthood for everyday social functioning and with recommendations for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the determinants of social cognitive aging, focusing on the roles of social resources, context, motivation, and cognitive effort in predicting resilience and risk. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from a longitudinal study, we examine how these factors interact to influence cognitive outcomes in older adults. Results indicate that higher levels of social resources and supportive contexts are associated with greater cognitive resilience, while low motivation and reduced cognitive effort are linked to increased cognitive decline. The ecological validity of these findings is supported by real-world assessments of cognitive function. These insights provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions to enhance cognitive health in aging populations.", "label": 0}
