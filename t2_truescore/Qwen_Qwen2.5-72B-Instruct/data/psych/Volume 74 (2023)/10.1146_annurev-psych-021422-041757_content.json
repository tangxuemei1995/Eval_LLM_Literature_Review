{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires guidance not only by sensations that are available immediately but also by relevant mental contents carried forward through working memory. Therefore, selective-attention functions that modulate the contents of working memory to guide behavior (inside-out) are just as important as those operating on sensory signals to generate internal contents (outside-in). We review the burgeoning literature on selective attention in the inside-out direction and underscore its functional, flexible, and future-focused nature. We discuss in turn the purpose (why), targets (what), sources (when), and mechanisms (how) of selective attention inside working memory, using visual working memory as a model. We show how the study of internal selective attention brings new insights concerning the core cognitive processes of attention and working memory and how considering selective attention and working memory together paves the way for a rich and integrated understanding of how mind serves behavior.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between working memory and selective attention, highlighting how these cognitive processes facilitate anticipatory and expectational behaviors. By integrating findings from neuroimaging, behavioral experiments, and computational models, we demonstrate that working memory not only maintains and manipulates information but also dynamically guides attentional resources to optimize visual processing and action planning. Our results suggest that the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in this interplay, modulating attentional focus based on the contents of working memory. This mechanism allows for efficient anticipation of upcoming events and the preparation of appropriate responses, thereby enhancing behavioral adaptability. The implications of these findings extend to understanding cognitive disorders and developing more effective interventions for attention and memory deficits.", "label": 1}
