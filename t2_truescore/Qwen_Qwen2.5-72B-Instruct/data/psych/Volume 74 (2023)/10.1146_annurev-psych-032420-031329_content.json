{"grounding": "Conspiracy theories are abundant in social and political discourse, with serious consequences for individuals, groups, and societies. However, psychological scientists have started paying close attention to them only in the past 20 years. We review the spectacular progress that has since been made and some of the limitations of research so far, and we consider the prospects for further progress. To this end, we take a step back to analyze the defining features that make conspiracy theories different in kind from other beliefs and different in degree from each other. We consider how these features determine the adoption, consequences, and transmission of belief in conspiracy theories, even though their role as causal or moderating variables has seldom been examined. We therefore advocate for a research agenda in the study of conspiracy theories that starts\u2014as is routine in fields such as virology and toxicology\u2014with a robust descriptive analysis of the ontology of the entity at its center.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive definitional approach to understanding conspiracy theories, their correlates, consequences, and communication. By integrating insights from psychology, sociology, and communication studies, we delineate the key characteristics of conspiracy theories and explore the psychological and social factors that predict their endorsement. We examine the consequences of conspiracy beliefs on individual and societal levels, including their impact on trust, political engagement, and public health. Additionally, we analyze the role of media and social networks in the dissemination and reinforcement of conspiracy theories, highlighting the importance of effective communication strategies to mitigate their negative effects. This interdisciplinary approach offers a robust framework for future research and practical interventions aimed at addressing the pervasive nature of conspiracy theories in contemporary society.", "label": 1}
