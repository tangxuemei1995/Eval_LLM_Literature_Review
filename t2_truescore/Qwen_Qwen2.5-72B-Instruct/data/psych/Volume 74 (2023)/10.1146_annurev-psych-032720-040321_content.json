{"grounding": "Pride is a self-conscious emotion, comprised of two distinct facets known as authentic and hubristic pride, and associated with a cross-culturally recognized nonverbal expression. Authentic pride involves feelings of accomplishment and confidence and promotes prosocial behaviors, whereas hubristic pride involves feelings of arrogance and conceit and promotes antisociality. Each facet of pride, we argue, contributes to a distinct means of attaining social rank: Authentic pride seems to promote prestige\u2014a rank based on earned respect\u2014whereas hubristic pride seems to promote dominance\u2014a rank based on aggression and coercion. Both prestige and dominance are effective routes to power and influence in human groups, so both facets of pride are likely to be functional adaptations. Overall, the reviewed research suggests that pride is likely to be a human universal, critical for social relationships and rank attainment across human societies.", "generated_text": "Pride, a self-conscious emotion, plays a pivotal role in the attainment and maintenance of social rank within human societies. This study explores the dual facets of pride\u2014authentic and hubristic\u2014and their differential impacts on social status. Authentic pride, associated with genuine achievement and competence, fosters prestige and respect, enhancing an individual\u2019s social standing. Conversely, hubristic pride, linked to arrogance and narcissism, can lead to dominance but often at the cost of social cohesion. Through a series of experiments and longitudinal surveys, we demonstrate that individuals who exhibit authentic pride are more likely to attain and sustain high social rank through positive interpersonal relationships and contributions to group welfare. These findings underscore the nuanced role of pride in social dynamics and highlight the importance of understanding the emotional underpinnings of status attainment.", "label": 1}
