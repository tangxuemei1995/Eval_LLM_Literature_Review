{"grounding": "Surveys administered online have several benefits, but they are particularly prone to careless responding, which occurs when respondents fail to read item content or give sufficient attention, resulting in raw data that may not accurately reflect respondents\u2019 true levels of the constructs being measured. Careless responding can lead to various psychometric issues, potentially impacting any area of psychology that uses self-reported surveys and assessments. This review synthesizes the careless responding literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of careless responding and ways to prevent, identify, report, and clean careless responding from data sets. Further, we include recommendations for different levels of screening for careless responses. Finally, we highlight some of the most promising areas for future work on careless responding.", "generated_text": "Careless responding, also known as insufficient effort responding, poses a significant threat to the validity and reliability of survey data. This paper reviews the current literature on the prevention, identification, and mitigation of careless responding in survey research. We discuss various preventive measures, such as clear instructions, attention checks, and engaging survey design. Identification techniques, including response time analysis, consistency checks, and machine learning algorithms, are evaluated for their effectiveness. Best practices for handling identified careless responses, such as data exclusion and statistical adjustments, are recommended to ensure the integrity of survey results. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the quality and validity of survey data, providing researchers with robust tools to address the pervasive issue of careless responding.", "label": 1}
