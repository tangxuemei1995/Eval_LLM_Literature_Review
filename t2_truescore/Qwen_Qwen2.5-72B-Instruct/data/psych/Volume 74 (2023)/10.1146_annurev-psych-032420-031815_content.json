{"grounding": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) research investigates changes in the evaluation of a stimulus after co-occurrence with an affective stimulus. To explain the motivation behind this research, this review begins with an overview of the history of EC research, followed by a summary of the state of the art with respect to three key questions. First, how should EC procedures be used to influence evaluation? We provide a guide based on evidence concerning the functional properties of EC effects. Second, how does the EC effect occur? We discuss the possible mediating cognitive processes and their automaticity. Third, are EC effects ubiquitous outside the lab? We discuss the evidence for the external validity of EC research. We conclude that the most important open questions pertain to the relevance of EC to everyday life and to the level of control that characterizes the processes that mediate the EC effect after people notice the stimulus co-occurrence.", "generated_text": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) is a fundamental process in attitude formation, where the affective evaluation of a neutral stimulus changes due to its repeated pairing with a valenced stimulus. This review synthesizes the extensive literature on EC, tracing its historical development, current understanding, and future directions. Historically, EC has been studied through classical conditioning paradigms, but recent research has expanded to include cognitive and neuroscientific approaches. The role of associations and propositions in EC is critically examined, highlighting how both automatic and deliberative processes contribute to attitude formation. External validity remains a key challenge, as laboratory findings often struggle to generalize to real-world settings. Future research should focus on integrating these processes and enhancing the ecological validity of EC studies to better understand their implications for social and consumer behavior. This comprehensive review aims to provide a robust foundation for advancing the field of EC and its applications.", "label": 1}
