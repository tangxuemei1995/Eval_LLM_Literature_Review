{"grounding": "Objects are the core meaningful elements in our visual environment. Classic theories of object vision focus upon object recognition and are elegant and simple. Some of their proposals still stand, yet the simplicity is gone. Recent evolutions in behavioral paradigms, neuroscientific methods, and computational modeling have allowed vision scientists to uncover the complexity of the multidimensional representational space that underlies object vision. We review these findings and propose that the key to understanding this complexity is to relate object vision to the full repertoire of behavioral goals that underlie human behavior, running far beyond object recognition. There might be no such thing as core object recognition, and if it exists, then its importance is more limited than traditionally thought.", "generated_text": "This study explores the mechanisms of human object vision, focusing on how the visual cortex processes and represents objects. Utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as a model, we investigate the hierarchical processing of visual information and its correspondence to human behavior in object recognition tasks. Our findings reveal that DCNNs can effectively simulate the complexity of object representations in the visual cortex, providing insights into the neural basis of object recognition. The results highlight the importance of both lower and higher-level features in the visual processing stream, suggesting a multi-faceted approach to understanding how the brain perceives and categorizes objects.", "label": 0}
