{"grounding": "Color is a pervasive feature of our psychological experience, having a role in many aspects of human mind and behavior such as basic vision, scene perception, object recognition, aesthetics, and communication. Understanding how humans encode, perceive, talk about, and use color has been a major interdisciplinary effort. Here, we present the current state of knowledge on how color perception and cognition develop. We cover the development of various aspects of the psychological experience of color, ranging from low-level color vision to perceptual mechanisms such as color constancy to phenomena such as color naming and color preference. We also identify neurodiversity in the development of color perception and cognition and implications for clinical and educational contexts. We discuss the theoretical implications of the research for understanding mature color perception and cognition, for identifying the principles of perceptual and cognitive development, and for fostering a broader debate in the psychological sciences.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development of color perception and cognition from infancy through childhood. Utilizing a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, we investigated how infants and young children process and categorize colors. Results indicate that color perception is present in infancy, with categorical color perception emerging around 18 months of age. Cognitive development, including language acquisition and memory, plays a crucial role in the maturation of color categorization. The findings suggest that while innate mechanisms provide a foundation for color perception, environmental and cultural factors significantly influence the development of color cognition. These insights contribute to our understanding of the interplay between perceptual and cognitive processes in early development.", "label": 0}
