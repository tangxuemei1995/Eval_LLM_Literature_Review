{"grounding": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revolutionized our understanding of common genetic variation and its impact on common human disease and traits. Developed and adopted in the mid-2000s, GWAS led to searchable genotype\u2013phenotype catalogs and genome-wide datasets available for further data mining and analysis for the eventual development of translational applications. The GWAS revolution was swift and specific, including almost exclusively populations of European descent, to the neglect of the majority of the world's genetic diversity. In this narrative review, we recount the GWAS landscape of the early years that established a genotype\u2013phenotype catalog that is now universally understood to be inadequate for a complete understanding of complex human genetics. We then describe approaches taken to augment the genotype\u2013phenotype catalog, including the study populations, collaborative consortia, and study design approaches aimed to generalize and then ultimately discover genome-wide associations in non-European descent populations. The collaborations and data resources established in the efforts to diversify genomic findings undoubtedly provide the foundations of the next chapters of genetic association studies with the advent of budget-friendly whole-genome sequencing.", "generated_text": "Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare to individual genetic profiles, yet the majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in populations of European ancestry, limiting the generalizability of genetic associations. This review highlights the critical importance of diversity in GWAS to enhance the identification of disease susceptibility variants across different ancestry groups. We summarize recent findings from diverse cohorts and consortia, demonstrating that the inclusion of underrepresented populations can uncover novel genetic loci and improve the accuracy of polygenic risk scores (PRS). The analysis of multi-ethnic datasets reveals that PRS developed in European populations often perform poorly in non-European groups, underscoring the need for more inclusive study designs. By integrating data from diverse populations, precision medicine can achieve greater equity and effectiveness in disease prediction and treatment, ultimately benefiting a broader spectrum of patients.", "label": 1}
