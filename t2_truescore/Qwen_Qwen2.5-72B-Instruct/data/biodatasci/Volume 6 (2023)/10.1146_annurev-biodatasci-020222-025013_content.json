{"grounding": "Drug development is a wide scientific field that faces many challenges these days. Among them are extremely high development costs, long development times, and a small number of new drugs that are approved each year. New and innovative technologies are needed to solve these problems that make the drug discovery process of small molecules more time and cost efficient, and that allow previously undruggable receptor classes to be targeted, such as protein\u2013protein interactions. Structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs) have become a leading contender in this context. In this review, we give an introduction to the foundations of SBVSs and survey their progress in the past few years with a focus on ultralarge virtual screenings (ULVSs). We outline key principles of SBVSs, recent success stories, new screening techniques, available deep learning\u2013based docking methods, and promising future research directions. ULVSs have an enormous potential for the development of new small-molecule drugs and are already starting to transform early-stage drug discovery.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in computational methods have significantly enhanced the capabilities of structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) in drug discovery. This review highlights the integration of ultralarge libraries, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of SBVS. The use of GPU acceleration and free energy simulations has further optimized the screening process, enabling the rapid identification of potential drug candidates from vast chemical spaces. Molecular docking, a cornerstone of SBVS, has been refined through these technological advancements, leading to more reliable predictions of ligand-protein interactions. The application of these methods in various therapeutic areas demonstrates their potential to accelerate the early stages of drug development, reducing both time and cost. This review also discusses the challenges and future directions in the field, emphasizing the need for continued innovation to address the complexity of biological systems.", "label": 1}
