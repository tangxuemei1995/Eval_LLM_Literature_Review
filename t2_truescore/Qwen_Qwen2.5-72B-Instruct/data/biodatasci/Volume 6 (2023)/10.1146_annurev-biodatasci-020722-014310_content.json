{"grounding": "Admixed populations constitute a large portion of global human genetic diversity, yet they are often left out of genomics analyses. This exclusion is problematic, as it leads to disparities in the understanding of the genetic structure and history of diverse cohorts and the performance of genomic medicine across populations. Admixed populations have particular statistical challenges, as they inherit genomic segments from multiple source populations\u2014the primary reason they have historically been excluded from genetic studies. In recent years, however, an increasing number of statistical methods and software tools have been developed to account for and leverage admixture in the context of genomics analyses. Here, we provide a survey of such computational strategies for the informed consideration of admixture to allow for the well-calibrated inclusion of mixed ancestry populations in large-scale genomics studies, and we detail persisting gaps in existing tools.", "generated_text": "The genomic analysis of admixed populations presents unique challenges and opportunities for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits. This review outlines advanced strategies and methods for dissecting the genetic architecture of admixed populations, focusing on the integration of ancestry information and statistical genetics. We discuss the application of admixture mapping, local ancestry inference, and multi-way admixture models to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits. Additionally, we highlight the importance of accounting for population stratification and the use of machine learning approaches to enhance the power and precision of genetic association studies. These methodologies not only improve our understanding of the genetic diversity within admixed populations but also have significant implications for personalized medicine and public health.", "label": 1}
