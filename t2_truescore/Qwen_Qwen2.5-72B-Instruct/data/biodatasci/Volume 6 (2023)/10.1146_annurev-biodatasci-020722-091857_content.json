{"grounding": "Since the first publication a decade ago describing the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the context of cancer, over 200 datasets and thousands of scRNA-seq studies have been published in cancer biology. scRNA-seq technologies have been applied across dozens of cancer types and a diverse array of study designs to improve our understanding of tumor biology, the tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic responses, and scRNA-seq is on the verge of being used to improve decision-making in the clinic. Computational methodologies and analytical pipelines are key in facilitating scRNA-seq research. Numerous computational methods utilizing the most advanced tools in data science have been developed to extract meaningful insights. Here, we review the advancements in cancer biology gained by scRNA-seq and discuss the computational challenges of the technology that are specific to cancer research.", "generated_text": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting the heterogeneity of human cancers. This technology enables the profiling of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing unprecedented insights into the complex cellular composition of tumors and their microenvironments. Recent advancements in bioinformatics have further enhanced the ability to analyze and interpret scRNA-seq data, facilitating the identification of novel cell types, states, and interactions. These findings have significant implications for understanding tumor biology, predicting patient outcomes, and developing targeted immunotherapies. This review summarizes the current state of scRNA-seq in cancer research, highlighting key applications and future directions in the field.", "label": 1}
