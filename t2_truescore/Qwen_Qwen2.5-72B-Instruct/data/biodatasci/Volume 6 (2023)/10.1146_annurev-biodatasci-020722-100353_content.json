{"grounding": "The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey of statistical challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, from neuroimaging techniques to large-scale neuroimaging studies and statistical learning methods. We briefly review eight popular neuroimaging techniques and their potential applications in neuroscience research and clinical translation. We delineate four themes of neuroimaging data and review major image processing analysis methods for processing neuroimaging data at the individual level. We briefly review four large-scale neuroimaging-related studies and a consortium on imaging genomics and discuss four themes of neuroimaging data analysis at the population level. We review nine major population-based statistical analysis methods and their associated statistical challenges and present recent progress in statistical methodology to address these challenges.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of advanced statistical learning methods in the analysis of neuroimaging data, focusing on addressing heterogeneity and identifying causal pathways. Utilizing population-based statistical analysis, the research integrates diverse neuroimaging techniques and image processing methods to enhance the accuracy and reliability of findings. The study design emphasizes robust validation strategies to ensure the generalizability of results, contributing to a deeper understanding of neurological processes and potential clinical applications.", "label": 0}
