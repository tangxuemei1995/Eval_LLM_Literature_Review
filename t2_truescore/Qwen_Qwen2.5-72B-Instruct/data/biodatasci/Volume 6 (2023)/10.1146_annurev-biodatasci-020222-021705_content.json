{"grounding": "SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is silent or benign in most infected individuals, but causes hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia in about 10% of cases. We review studies of the human genetics of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on both rare and common variants. Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified more than 20 common loci robustly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia with modest effect sizes, some implicating genes expressed in the lungs or leukocytes. The most robust association, on chromosome 3, concerns a haplotype inherited from Neanderthals. Sequencing studies focusing on rare variants with a strong effect have been particularly successful, identifying inborn errors of type I interferon (IFN) immunity in 1\u20135% of unvaccinated patients with critical pneumonia, and their autoimmune phenocopy, autoantibodies against type I IFN, in another 15\u201320% of cases. Our growing understanding of the impact of human genetic variation on immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is enabling health systems to improve protection for individuals and populations.", "generated_text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic, with significant variability in the clinical outcomes of infected individuals. This study investigates the genetic basis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and the analysis of rare variants. We identified several common variants associated with increased susceptibility to severe disease, including loci near genes involved in type I interferon signaling. Additionally, we discovered rare inborn errors of immunity, such as mutations in genes encoding key components of the type I interferon pathway, which are overrepresented in patients with critical illness. These findings highlight the critical role of genetic factors in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for the management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.", "label": 1}
