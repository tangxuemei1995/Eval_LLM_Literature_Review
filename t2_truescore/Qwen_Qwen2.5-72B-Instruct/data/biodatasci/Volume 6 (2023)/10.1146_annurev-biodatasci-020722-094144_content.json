{"grounding": "Prenatal screening using sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA has transformed obstetric care over the past decade and significantly reduced the number of invasive diagnostic procedures like amniocentesis for genetic disorders. Nonetheless, emergency care remains the only option for complications like preeclampsia and preterm birth, two of the most prevalent obstetrical syndromes. Advances in noninvasive prenatal testing expand the scope of precision medicine in obstetric care. In this review, we discuss advances, challenges, and possibilities toward the goal of providing proactive, personalized prenatal care. The highlighted advances focus mainly on cell-free nucleic acids; however, we also review research that uses signals from metabolomics, proteomics, intact cells, and the microbiome. We discuss ethical challenges in providing care. Finally, we look to future possibilities, including redefining disease taxonomy and moving from biomarker correlation to biological causation.", "generated_text": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has revolutionized prenatal care by enabling the detection of fetal genetic abnormalities through the analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) in maternal blood. Recent advances in genomics and liquid biopsy techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and scope of NIPT, allowing for the detection of chromosomal aneuploidies, single-gene disorders, and even epigenetic markers. However, challenges remain, including the need for more comprehensive coverage of genetic conditions, improved sensitivity and specificity, and the ethical implications of expanded testing. This review discusses the current state of NIPT, highlighting recent technological advancements, ongoing challenges, and the potential future directions for integrating cfDNA and cfRNA analysis into routine prenatal care.", "label": 1}
