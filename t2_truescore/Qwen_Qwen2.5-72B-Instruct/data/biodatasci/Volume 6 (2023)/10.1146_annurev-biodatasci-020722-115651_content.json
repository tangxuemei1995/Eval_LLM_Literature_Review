{"grounding": "Following the widespread use of deep learning for genomics, deep generative modeling is also becoming a viable methodology for the broad field. Deep generative models (DGMs) can learn the complex structure of genomic data and allow researchers to generate novel genomic instances that retain the real characteristics of the original dataset. Aside from data generation, DGMs can also be used for dimensionality reduction by mapping the data space to a latent space, as well as for prediction tasks via exploitation of this learned mapping or supervised/semi-supervised DGM designs. In this review, we briefly introduce generative modeling and two currently prevailing architectures, we present conceptual applications along with notable examples in functional and evolutionary genomics, and we provide our perspective on potential challenges and future directions.", "generated_text": "This review provides an overview of the application of deep generative models, including variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), in the fields of functional and evolutionary genomics. These models have shown significant potential in generating synthetic genomic data, imputing missing values, and uncovering latent biological structures. We discuss the theoretical foundations of these models and their specific adaptations for genomic data, highlighting recent advancements and challenges. Case studies in gene expression analysis, epigenetic regulation, and phylogenetic inference illustrate the practical utility of deep generative models. The review also addresses the ethical considerations and future directions for integrating these models into genomic research, emphasizing their role in enhancing our understanding of complex biological systems.", "label": 1}
