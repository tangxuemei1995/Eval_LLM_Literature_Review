{"grounding": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that can regulate all steps of gene expression (induction, transcription, and translation). Several virus families, primarily double-stranded DNA viruses, encode small RNAs (sRNAs), including miRNAs. These virus-derived miRNAs (v-miRNAs) help the virus evade the host's innate and adaptive immune system and maintain an environment of chronic latent infection. In this review, the functions of the sRNA-mediated virus\u2013host interactions are highlighted, delineating their implication in chronic stress, inflammation, immunopathology, and disease. We provide insights into the latest viral RNA\u2013based research\u2014in silico approaches for functional characterization of v-miRNAs and other RNA types. The latest research can assist toward the identification of therapeutic targets to combat viral infections.", "generated_text": "Virus-derived small RNAs (vsRNAs) and virally encoded microRNAs (v-miRNAs) play crucial roles in viral infection, host immune modulation, and disease progression. This review focuses on the biogenesis, function, and bioinformatics analysis of v-miRNAs, particularly those from Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV). Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and computational tools have facilitated the identification and characterization of these regulatory RNAs, providing insights into their mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic targets. The integration of viral RNA bioinformatics resources with experimental data enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between viral and host gene expression, highlighting the significance of v-miRNAs in both health and disease.", "label": 1}
