{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and other data-driven technologies hold great promise to transform healthcare and confer the predictive power essential to precision medicine. However, the existing biomedical data, which are a vital resource and foundation for developing medical AI models, do not reflect the diversity of the human population. The low representation in biomedical data has become a significant health risk for non-European populations, and the growing application of AI opens a new pathway for this health risk to manifest and amplify. Here we review the current status of biomedical data inequality and present a conceptual framework for understanding its impacts on machine learning. We also discuss the recent advances in algorithmic interventions for mitigating health disparities arising from biomedical data inequality. Finally, we briefly discuss the newly identified disparity in data quality among ethnic groups and its potential impacts on machine learning.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing biomedical data inequality, a critical issue that exacerbates health disparities across diverse populations. We analyze the challenges posed by subpopulation shift and data inequality, which often result in biased AI models that perform poorly on underrepresented groups. The study proposes a multiethnic machine learning framework that leverages transfer learning techniques to improve model generalization across different demographic subgroups. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce performance disparities and enhance health equity. The findings highlight the potential of AI to mitigate data inequality and underscore the importance of inclusive data practices in biomedical research.", "label": 1}
