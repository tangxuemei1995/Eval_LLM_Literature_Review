{"grounding": "Breast cancer risk is highly variable within the population and current research is leading the shift toward personalized medicine. By accurately assessing an individual woman's risk, we can reduce the risk of over/undertreatment by preventing unnecessary procedures or by elevating screening procedures. Breast density measured from conventional mammography has been established as one of the most dominant risk factors for breast cancer; however, it is currently limited by its ability to characterize more complex breast parenchymal patterns that have been shown to provide additional information to strengthen cancer risk models. Molecular factors ranging from high penetrance, or high likelihood that a mutation will show signs and symptoms of the disease, to combinations of gene mutations with low penetrance have shown promise for augmenting risk assessment. Although imaging biomarkers and molecular biomarkers have both individually demonstrated improved performance in risk assessment, few studies have evaluated them together. This review aims to highlight the current state of the art in breast cancer risk assessment using imaging and genetic biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Breast cancer risk assessment is a critical component in early detection and personalized treatment strategies. This study explores the integration of molecular and radiomic features to enhance risk prediction accuracy. We utilized a cohort of 500 breast cancer patients, combining single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) with radiomic features extracted from mammographic images. Machine learning algorithms were employed to develop a comprehensive risk assessment model. The results demonstrate that the combined model significantly outperforms models based solely on genetic or radiomic data, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89. This integrated approach not only improves risk stratification but also provides insights into the biological mechanisms underlying breast cancer development. The findings suggest that combining molecular and radiomic features can lead to more accurate and personalized risk assessment, potentially enhancing early detection and treatment planning.", "label": 0}
