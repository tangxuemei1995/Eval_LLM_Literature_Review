{"grounding": "Organismal aging exhibits wide-ranging hallmarks in divergent cell types across tissues, organs, and systems. The advancement of single-cell technologies and generation of rich datasets have afforded the scientific community the opportunity to decode these hallmarks of aging at an unprecedented scope and resolution. In this review, we describe the technological advancements and bioinformatic methodologies enabling data interpretation at the cellular level. Then, we outline the application of such technologies for decoding aging hallmarks and potential intervention targets and summarize common themes and context-specific molecular features in representative organ systems across the body. Finally, we provide a brief summary of available databases relevant for aging research and present an outlook on the opportunities in this emerging field.", "generated_text": "Aging is characterized by a complex interplay of molecular and cellular changes, collectively known as aging hallmarks. This study employs advanced single-cell analysis tools to dissect these hallmarks at an unprecedented resolution, revealing distinct cellular and molecular signatures across various tissues. By integrating comprehensive data resources, we identify key intervention targets and mechanisms that could be harnessed to mitigate age-related decline. Our findings provide a robust framework for understanding the heterogeneity of aging processes and pave the way for personalized anti-aging strategies.", "label": 1}
