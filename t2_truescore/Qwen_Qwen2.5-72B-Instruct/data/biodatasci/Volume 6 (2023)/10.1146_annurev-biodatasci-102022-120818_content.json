{"grounding": "Despite monumental advances in molecular technology to generate genome sequence data at scale, there is still a considerable proportion of heritability in most complex diseases that remains unexplained. Because many of the discoveries have been single-nucleotide variants with small to moderate effects on disease, the functional implication of many of the variants is still unknown and, thus, we have limited new drug targets and therapeutics. We, and many others, posit that one primary factor that has limited our ability to identify novel drug targets from genome-wide association studies may be due to gene interactions (epistasis), gene\u2013environment interactions, network/pathway effects, or multiomic relationships. We propose that many of these complex models explain much of the underlying genetic architecture of complex disease. In this review, we discuss the evidence from multiple research avenues, ranging from pairs of alleles to multiomic integration studies and pharmacogenomics, that supports the need for further investigation of gene interactions (or epistasis) in genetic and genomic studies of human disease. Our goal is to catalog the mounting evidence for epistasis in genetic studies and the connections between genetic interactions and human health and disease that could enable precision medicine of the future.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in multiomics technologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying human diseases, revealing the critical role of gene interactions, or epistasis, in disease susceptibility and progression. This review synthesizes emerging evidence from large-scale genomic studies, highlighting the complexity and non-linear nature of gene interactions in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions. Multiomics approaches, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms through which gene interactions modulate disease phenotypes. These findings underscore the importance of considering epistatic effects in precision medicine, where personalized treatment strategies can be tailored based on an individual's unique genetic and molecular profile. However, the identification and functional characterization of gene interactions remain challenging due to the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of biological data. Future research should focus on developing robust computational models and experimental frameworks to systematically dissect the intricate web of gene interactions, ultimately translating these insights into clinical applications for improved patient outcomes.", "label": 0}
