{"grounding": "Single-cell RNA sequencing methods have led to improved understanding of the heterogeneity and transcriptomic states present in complex biological systems. Recently, the development of novel single-cell technologies for assaying additional modalities, specifically genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial data, allows for unprecedented insight into cellular biology. While certain technologies collect multiple measurements from the same cells simultaneously, even when modalities are separately assayed in different cells, we can apply novel computational methods to integrate these data. The application of computational integration methods to multimodal paired and unpaired data results in rich information about the identities of the cells present and the interactions between different levels of biology, such as between genetic variation and transcription. In this review, we both discuss the single-cell technologies for measuring these modalities and describe and characterize a variety of computational integration methods for combining the resulting data to leverage multimodal information toward greater biological insight.", "generated_text": "Single-cell multiomics represents a transformative approach in biological research, enabling the simultaneous analysis of multiple molecular layers within individual cells. This technique integrates various omics data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, to provide a comprehensive understanding of cellular heterogeneity and function. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing and computational methods have facilitated the development of multimodal platforms that can efficiently process and integrate these complex datasets. These platforms not only enhance our ability to identify rare cell types and states but also reveal intricate regulatory networks and dynamic cellular processes. The integration of single-cell multiomics data has significant implications for fields such as developmental biology, immunology, and cancer research, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. However, the computational challenges associated with data integration and interpretation remain a critical area for ongoing research and innovation.", "label": 0}
