{"grounding": "The All of Us Research Program's Data and Research Center (DRC) was established to help acquire, curate, and provide access to one of the world's largest and most diverse datasets for precision medicine research. Already, over 500,000 participants are enrolled in All of Us, 80% of whom are underrepresented in biomedical research, and data are being analyzed by a community of over 2,300 researchers. The DRC created this thriving data ecosystem by collaborating with engaged participants, innovative program partners, and empowered researchers. In this review, we first describe how the DRC is organized to meet the needs of this broad group of stakeholders. We then outline guiding principles, common challenges, and innovative approaches used to build the All of Us data ecosystem. Finally, we share lessons learned to help others navigate important decisions and trade-offs in building a modern biomedical data platform.", "generated_text": "The All of Us Data and Research Center aims to establish a robust, secure, and scalable data ecosystem to advance precision medicine. This initiative integrates diverse datasets, including electronic health records, genetic information, and environmental data, from a broad and inclusive participant base. The center prioritizes data privacy and security through advanced encryption and access control mechanisms, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. By fostering data integration and interoperability, the center supports a wide range of biomedical research, facilitating discoveries that can lead to more personalized and effective healthcare solutions. The sustainable model of the All of Us Data and Research Center ensures long-term viability and continuous improvement, positioning it as a cornerstone of the precision medicine landscape.", "label": 1}
