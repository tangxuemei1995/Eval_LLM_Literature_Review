{"grounding": "Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental delay that affects at least 1 in 44 children. Like many neurological disorder phenotypes, the diagnostic features are observable, can be tracked over time, and can be managed or even eliminated through proper therapy and treatments. However, there are major bottlenecks in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and longitudinal tracking pipelines for autism and related neurodevelopmental delays, creating an opportunity for novel data science solutions to augment and transform existing workflows and provide increased access to services for affected families. Several efforts previously conducted by a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress toward improved digital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review the literature on digital health methods for autism behavior quantification and beneficial therapies using data science. We describe both case\u2013control studies and classification systems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and therapeutics that integrate machine learning models of autism-related behaviors, including the factors that must be addressed for translational use. Finally, we describe ongoing challenges and potential opportunities for the field of autism data science. Given the heterogeneous nature of autism and the complexities of the relevant behaviors, this review contains insights that are relevant to neurological behavior analysis and digital psychiatry more broadly.", "generated_text": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric condition characterized by a wide range of symptoms and phenotypic expressions. Recent advancements in data science and machine learning have opened new avenues for understanding and managing ASD. This review synthesizes the current state of research on the application of data science and machine learning to the neuropsychiatric phenotype of autism, highlighting key findings and methodologies. We explore the use of digital phenotyping, which leverages mobile and wearable devices to collect real-time data, providing a more granular and dynamic view of ASD symptoms. Machine learning algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning and natural language processing, have shown promise in identifying patterns and predicting outcomes in large, heterogeneous datasets. Crowdsourcing platforms have also emerged as valuable tools for data collection, enabling the aggregation of diverse and representative samples. However, challenges remain, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for robust validation of digital biomarkers. This review outlines a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the integration of multimodal data, the development of explainable AI models, and the importance of stakeholder engagement in the design and implementation of digital health interventions. By addressing these challenges, data science and machine learning can significantly enhance our understanding of ASD and improve clinical outcomes for individuals with the disorder.", "label": 1}
