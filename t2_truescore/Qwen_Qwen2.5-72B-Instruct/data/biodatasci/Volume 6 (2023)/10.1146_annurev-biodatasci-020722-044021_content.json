{"grounding": "Alternative splicing is pivotal to the regulation of gene expression and protein diversity in eukaryotic cells. The detection of alternative splicing events requires specific omics technologies. Although short-read RNA sequencing has successfully supported a plethora of investigations on alternative splicing, the emerging technologies of long-read RNA sequencing and top-down mass spectrometry open new opportunities to identify alternative splicing and protein isoforms with less ambiguity. Here, we summarize improvements in short-read RNA sequencing for alternative splicing analysis, including percent splicing index estimation and differential analysis. We also review the computational methods used in top-down proteomics analysis regarding proteoform identification, including the construction of databases of protein isoforms and statistical analyses of search results. While many improvements in sequencing and computational methods will result from emerging technologies, there should be future endeavors to increase the effectiveness, integration, and proteome coverage of alternative splicing events.", "generated_text": "Alternative splicing plays a crucial role in generating proteomic diversity from a limited number of genes. This study integrates short-read and long-read RNA-seq data with top-down mass spectrometry to comprehensively identify splice variants and protein isoforms. Short-read RNA-seq provides high coverage and accuracy for gene expression quantification, while long-read RNA-seq captures full-length transcripts, enabling the identification of novel splice variants. Top-down mass spectrometry further validates these findings at the protein level, distinguishing between proteoforms that arise from alternative splicing and post-translational modifications. Our integrated approach reveals a significant number of previously unannotated splice variants and protein isoforms, highlighting the complexity of the transcriptome and proteome. This work underscores the importance of combining multiple omics technologies to gain a more complete understanding of gene expression and protein function in biological systems.", "label": 1}
