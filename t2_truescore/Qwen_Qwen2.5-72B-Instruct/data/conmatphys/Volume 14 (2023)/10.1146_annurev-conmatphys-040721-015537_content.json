{"grounding": "In Floquet engineering, periodic driving is used to realize novel phases of matter that are inaccessible in thermal equilibrium. For this purpose, the Floquet theory provides us a recipe for obtaining a static effective Hamiltonian. Although many existing works have treated closed systems, it is important to consider the effect of dissipation, which is ubiquitous in nature. Understanding the interplay of periodic driving and dissipation is a fundamental problem of nonequilibrium statistical physics that is receiving growing interest because of the fact that experimental advances have allowed us to engineer dissipation in a controllable manner. In this review, we give a detailed exposition on the formalism of quantum master equations for open Floquet systems and highlight recent work investigating whether equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to Floquet states.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamics of Floquet states in open quantum systems, focusing on the interplay between periodic driving and dissipation. By employing nonequilibrium statistical physics, we analyze the stability and coherence of Floquet states under various environmental conditions. Our findings reveal that the presence of a dissipative environment can lead to the emergence of novel quasi-steady states, characterized by unique spectral properties and enhanced resilience to decoherence. These results provide valuable insights into the control and manipulation of quantum systems in periodically driven settings, with potential applications in quantum computing and quantum simulation.", "label": 0}
