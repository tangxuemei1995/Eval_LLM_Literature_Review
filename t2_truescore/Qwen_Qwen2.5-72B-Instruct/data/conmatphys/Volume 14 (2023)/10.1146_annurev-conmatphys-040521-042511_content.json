{"grounding": "Inversion and time reversal are essential symmetries for the structure of Cooper pairs in superconductors. The loss of one or both leads to modifications to this structure and can change the properties of the superconducting phases in profound ways. Superconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry, or noncentrosymmetric materials, has become an important topic. These materials show unusual magnetic and magnetoelectric properties and can host topological superconductivity. Recently, crystal structures with local, but not global, inversion-symmetry breaking have attracted attention. Here, superconductivity can exhibit phenomena not naively expected in centrosymmetric materials. In this review, we first introduce the concept of locally noncentrosymmetric crystals and different material realizations. We then discuss consequences of such local symmetry breaking on the normal state electronic structure and the classification of superconducting order parameters. Finally, we review the expected and, in parts, already observed phenomenology of unconventional superconductivity and possible topological superconducting phases.", "generated_text": "This study explores the interplay between superconductivity and local inversion-symmetry breaking, focusing on the emergence of topological and unconventional superconducting states. By incorporating Rashba spin-orbit coupling into a model system, we demonstrate that local inversion-symmetry breaking can induce hidden spin polarization, leading to novel superconducting phases. Our findings reveal that the combination of these effects can stabilize topological superconductivity, characterized by the presence of Majorana zero modes at the boundaries. These results provide insights into the design of materials for quantum computing applications and highlight the importance of symmetry breaking in the realization of exotic superconducting states.", "label": 0}
