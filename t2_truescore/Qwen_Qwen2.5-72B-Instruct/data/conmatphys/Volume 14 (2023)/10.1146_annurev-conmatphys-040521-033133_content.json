{"grounding": "The past decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in topological materials, and a lot of mathematical concepts have been introduced in condensed matter physics. Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central topic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on boundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex. Besides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon called the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition. In this article, we review developments in non-Hermitian topological physics by focusing mainly on the boundary problem. As well as the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena, we discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself.", "generated_text": "This review explores the emerging field of non-Hermitian topological phenomena, focusing on the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topological phases. We discuss the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and the emergence of new topological invariants and edge states. The review covers recent advances in spectral theory, highlighting the role of exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects. Applications in photonic and electronic systems are examined, illustrating the potential for novel devices and materials. Theoretical frameworks and experimental realizations are discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving area of research.", "label": 1}
