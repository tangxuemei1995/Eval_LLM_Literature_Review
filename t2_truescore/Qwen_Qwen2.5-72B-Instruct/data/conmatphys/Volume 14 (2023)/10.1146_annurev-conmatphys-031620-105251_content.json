{"grounding": "Life is a nonequilibrium phenomenon: Metabolism provides a continuous supply of energy that drives nearly all cellular processes. However, very little is known about how much energy different cellular processes use, i.e., their energetic costs. The most direct experimental measurements of these costs involve modulating the activity of cellular processes and determining the resulting changes in energetic fluxes. In this review, we present a flux balance framework to aid in the design and interpretation of such experiments and discuss the challenges associated with measuring the relevant metabolic fluxes. We then describe selected techniques that enable measurement of these fluxes. Finally, we review prior experimental and theoretical work that has employed techniques from biochemistry and nonequilibrium physics to determine the energetic costs of cellular processes.", "generated_text": "This review dissects the methodologies and challenges associated with measuring energetic costs in cell biology through the lens of flux balances. By integrating bioenergetics and metabolic flux analysis, we explore how cells allocate energy resources to maintain homeostasis and support growth. Techniques such as 13C metabolic flux analysis, extracellular flux analysis, and isotopic labeling are discussed, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The review also addresses the complexities of in vivo measurements and the need for robust computational models to interpret flux data accurately. Understanding these energetic costs is crucial for elucidating cellular processes and has implications for metabolic engineering and disease treatment.", "label": 1}
