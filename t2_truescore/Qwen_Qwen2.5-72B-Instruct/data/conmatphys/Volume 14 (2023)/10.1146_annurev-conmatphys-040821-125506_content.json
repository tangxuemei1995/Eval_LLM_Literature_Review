{"grounding": "Elasticity typically refers to a material's ability to store energy, whereas viscosity refers to a material's tendency to dissipate it. In this review, we discuss fluids and solids for which this is not the case. These materials display additional linear response coefficients known as odd viscosity and odd elasticity. We first introduce odd viscosity and odd elasticity from a continuum perspective, with an emphasis on their rich phenomenology, including transverse responses, modified dislocation dynamics, and topological waves. We then provide an overview of systems that display odd viscosity and odd elasticity. These systems range from quantum fluids and astrophysical gases to active and driven matter. Finally, we comment on microscopic mechanisms by which odd viscosity and odd elasticity arise.", "generated_text": "This study explores the phenomena of odd viscosity and odd elasticity in active matter systems, which exhibit non-equilibrium behavior. By integrating principles from continuum and fluid mechanics, we analyze how these unconventional properties arise in systems far from equilibrium. Our findings reveal that odd viscosity, a non-dissipative form of viscosity, and odd elasticity, a chiral elastic response, play crucial roles in the hydrodynamics and rheology of active materials. These properties are shown to influence the stability and dynamics of active fluids, offering new insights into the behavior of complex systems such as bacterial suspensions and active gels.", "label": 0}
