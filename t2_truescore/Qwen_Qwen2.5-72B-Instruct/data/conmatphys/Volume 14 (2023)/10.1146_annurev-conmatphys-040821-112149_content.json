{"grounding": "We review the literature on swimming in complex fluids. A classification is proposed by comparing the length- and timescales of a swimmer with those of nearby obstacles, interpreted broadly, extending from rigid or soft confining boundaries to molecules that confer the bulk fluid with complex stresses. A third dimension in the classification is the concentration of swimmers, which incorporates fluids whose complexity arises purely by the collective motion of swimming organisms. For each of the eight system types that we identify, we provide a background and describe modern research findings. Although some types have seen a great deal of attention for decades, others remain uncharted waters still open and awaiting exploration.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the locomotion of microorganisms in complex fluids, focusing on the interplay between active matter and the rheological properties of biological fluids. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we explore how the viscoelasticity of soft matter affects the swimming efficiency and dynamics of active suspensions. Our findings reveal that the presence of polymers and other macromolecules in the fluid can significantly alter the swimming behavior, leading to enhanced or reduced motility depending on the fluid's microstructure. These results have implications for understanding the movement of microorganisms in natural environments and the design of artificial microswimmers for biomedical applications.", "label": 0}
