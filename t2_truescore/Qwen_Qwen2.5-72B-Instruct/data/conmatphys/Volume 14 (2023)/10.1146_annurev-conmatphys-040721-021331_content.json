{"grounding": "The modern scope of fermiology encompasses not just the classical geometry of Fermi surfaces but also the geometry of quantum wave functions over the Fermi surface. This enlarged scope is motivated by the advent of topological metals\u2014metals whose Fermi surfaces are characterized by a robustly nontrivial Berry phase. We review the extent to which topological metals can be diagnosed from magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations of transport and thermodynamic quantities. A holistic analysis of the oscillatory wave form is proposed, in which different characteristics of the wave form (e.g., phase offset, high-harmonic amplitudes, temperature-dependent frequency) encode different aspects of a topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. Which characteristic to focus on depends on (a) the orientation of the magnetic field relative to certain crystallographic axes, (b) the symmetry class of the topological metal, and (c) the separation of Fermi-surface pockets in quasimomentum \n\n space. Closely proximate pockets arise when (1) spin\u2013split pockets are nearly overlapping due to a weak spin\u2013orbit force or when (2) two pockets touch at an isolated \n\n point, which can be a topological band-touching point or a saddlepoint in the energy-momentum dispersion. The emergence of a pseudospin degree of freedom (in case 1) and the implications of magnetic breakdown (in case 2) are reviewed, with emphasis on new aspects originating from the (nonabelian) Berry connection of the Fermi surface. Future extensions of topofermiology are suggested in the directions of interaction-induced Fermi-liquid instabilities and two-dimensional electron liquids.", "generated_text": "The study of topological metals has emerged as a vibrant field, bridging the realms of condensed matter physics and topology. This work delves into the fermiology of these materials, focusing on the intricate interplay between the Fermi surface, Berry phase, and quantum oscillations. Topological metals, characterized by their non-trivial band structures, exhibit unique electronic properties that are deeply rooted in the geometric and topological aspects of their Fermi surfaces. We explore how the Berry phase, a geometric phase acquired by electrons as they traverse the Brillouin zone, influences the electronic transport and magnetic properties of these materials. Quantum oscillations, a hallmark of Fermi surface topology, are analyzed in detail, providing insights into the complex Fermi surface geometry. Additionally, the phenomenon of magnetic breakdown, where electrons tunnel between different parts of the Fermi surface, is examined, revealing its role in shaping the electronic band structure. The discussion is further enriched by the examination of Dirac\u2013Weyl semimetals, a subclass of topological metals where the Fermi surface hosts linearly dispersing bands, leading to exotic quasiparticles. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of topological considerations in understanding the electronic behavior of these materials, paving the way for potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics.", "label": 1}
