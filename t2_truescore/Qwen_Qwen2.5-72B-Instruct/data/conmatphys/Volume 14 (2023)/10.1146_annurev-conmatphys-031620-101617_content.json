{"grounding": "Weakly interacting quasiparticles play a central role in the low-energy description of many phases of quantum matter. At higher energies, however, quasiparticles cease to be well defined in generic many-body systems owing to a proliferation of decay channels. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of quantum many-body scars, which can give rise to certain species of stable quasiparticles throughout the energy spectrum. This goes along with a set of unusual nonequilibrium phenomena including many-body revivals and nonthermal stationary states. We provide a pedagogical exposition of this physics via a simple yet comprehensive example, that of a spin-1 XY model. We place our discussion in the broader context of symmetry-based constructions of many-body scar states, projector embeddings, and Hilbert space fragmentation. We conclude with a summary of experimental progress and theoretical puzzles.", "generated_text": "Quantum many-body scars, a phenomenon where certain quantum systems fail to thermalize despite being isolated and interacting, are explored from a quasiparticle perspective. This study investigates how constrained dynamics and the presence of quasiparticles can lead to the emergence of scarred eigenstates, which defy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. By analyzing out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, we identify conditions under which these scars manifest, providing insights into the interplay between quantum chaos and integrability. Our findings suggest that the existence of quasiparticles with specific symmetries and conservation laws can stabilize non-thermal states, offering a new avenue for understanding the breakdown of thermalization in quantum systems.", "label": 1}
