{"grounding": "Learning is traditionally studied in biological or computational systems. The power of learning frameworks in solving hard inverse problems provides an appealing case for the development of physical learning in which physical systems adopt desirable properties on their own without computational design. It was recently realized that large classes of physical systems can physically learn through local learning rules, autonomously adapting their parameters in response to observed examples of use. We review recent work in the emerging field of physical learning, describing theoretical and experimental advances in areas ranging from molecular self-assembly to flow networks and mechanical materials. Physical learning machines provide multiple practical advantages over computer designed ones, in particular by not requiring an accurate model of the system, and their ability to autonomously adapt to changing needs over time. As theoretical constructs, physical learning machines afford a novel perspective on how physical constraints modify abstract learning theory.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of learning without neurons, focusing on physical systems capable of adaptive behavior through non-biological mechanisms. By integrating principles from learning theory, inverse design, and machine learning, we investigate how metamaterials, self-assembly processes, and molecular computing can be engineered to perform tasks typically associated with neural networks. Our research demonstrates that these physical systems can autonomously optimize their structures and functions in response to environmental stimuli, enabling applications in adaptive materials, smart sensors, and autonomous molecular machines. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of learning in non-neural contexts and open new avenues for the development of intelligent physical systems.", "label": 0}
