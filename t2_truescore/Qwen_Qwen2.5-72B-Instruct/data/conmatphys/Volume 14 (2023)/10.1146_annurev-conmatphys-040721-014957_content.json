{"grounding": "The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) refers to the generation of a spin current as a result of a temperature gradient in a magnetic material, which can be detected electrically via the inverse spin Hall effect in a metallic contact. Since the discovery of the SSE in 2008, intensive studies on the SSE have been conducted to elucidate its origin. SSEs appear in a wide range of magnetic materials including ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnets and also paramagnets with classical or quantum spin fluctuation. SSE voltage reflects fundamental properties of a magnet, such as elementary excitation, static magnetic order, spin correlation, and spin transport. In this article, we review recent progress on the SSE in various systems, with particular emphasis on its emerging role as a probe of these magnetic properties in solids. We also briefly discuss the recently discovered nuclear SSE.", "generated_text": "The Spin Seebeck Effect (SSE) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the fundamental properties of magnetic materials, including elementary excitations, spin correlations, transport, magnetic order, and domain dynamics. This review highlights recent advancements in SSE studies, particularly in the context of spin(calori)tronics and antiferromagnetic spintronics. The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) plays a crucial role in detecting the SSE, enabling the measurement of spin currents generated by thermal gradients. Magnons, as the primary carriers of spin angular momentum, are central to understanding the SSE in various magnetic systems, including quantum spin liquids. Additionally, the influence of nuclear spins on the SSE is explored, revealing new insights into the interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. These findings not only advance our understanding of spin dynamics in solids but also pave the way for novel spintronic applications.", "label": 1}
