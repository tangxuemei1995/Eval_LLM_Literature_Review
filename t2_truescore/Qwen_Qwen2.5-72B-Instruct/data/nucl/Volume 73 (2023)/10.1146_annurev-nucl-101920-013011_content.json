{"grounding": "This article is a pedagogical review of searches for long-lived particles at the LHC. It is primarily aimed at experimentalists and theorists seeking to initiate and/or deepen their research in this field. We cover the general theoretical motivation and some example models, the main experimental techniques employed in searches for long-lived particles, and some of the important subtleties involved in estimating signal efficiencies and background rates.", "generated_text": "This guide provides an overview of the experimental techniques and theoretical frameworks for detecting long-lived particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It highlights the unique signatures of these particles and the challenges in their identification, emphasizing the importance of advanced detector technologies and sophisticated data analysis methods.", "label": 0}
