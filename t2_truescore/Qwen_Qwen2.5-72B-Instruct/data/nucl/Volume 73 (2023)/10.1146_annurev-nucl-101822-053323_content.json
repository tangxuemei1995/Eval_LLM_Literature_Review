{"grounding": "Vector boson scattering is a key production process to probe the electroweak symmetry breaking of the Standard Model and is one of the most important topics of the physics program for the HL-LHC since it involves both self-couplings of vector bosons and their coupling with the Higgs boson. If the Higgs mechanism is not the sole source of electroweak symmetry breaking, the scattering amplitude deviates from the Standard Model prediction at high scattering energy. Moreover, deviations may be detectable even if a New Physics scale is higher than the reach of direct searches. In this review, the most recent experimental measurements of the production cross sections of vector boson pairs in association with two jets in proton\u2013proton collisions at  TeV at the LHC are reported, using data sets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors. Applications to searches for New Physics, as well as prospects for measuring the electroweak vector boson scattering processes with larger data samples, are also summarized.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the production and interactions of diboson systems at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), focusing on the electroweak processes and vector boson scattering. Utilizing data from recent LHC runs, we analyze the kinematic distributions and invariant mass spectra of WW, WZ, and ZZ boson pairs. The results provide stringent tests of the Standard Model predictions and offer insights into the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. Enhanced sensitivity to anomalous couplings and potential new physics beyond the Standard Model is achieved through detailed comparisons with theoretical models. The observed diboson production rates and angular distributions are consistent with the electroweak theory, while deviations in specific kinematic regions suggest the need for further investigation. This research contributes to the broader understanding of fundamental particle interactions and the validation of the electroweak sector at high energies.", "label": 1}
