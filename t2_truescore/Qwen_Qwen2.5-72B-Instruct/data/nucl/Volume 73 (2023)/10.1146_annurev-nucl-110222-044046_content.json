{"grounding": "We present a comprehensive review of purely leptonic and semileptonic decays of D\n0(+), \n\n, and charmed baryons (including \n\n, \u039e\nc\n, and \u03a9\nc\n). The precise studies of these decays help deepen our understanding and knowledge of quantum chromodynamics via measuring decay constants and form factors, and test the Standard Model through examining the unitarity of the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix and lepton flavor universality. We give an overview of the theoretical and experimental tools before discussing the recent progress. The data sets collected by the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) near the production thresholds of \n\n, \n\n, and \n\n offer important opportunities for studies of charm physics.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) have significantly enhanced our understanding of (semi-)leptonic decays of charmed hadrons. This review summarizes the latest experimental and theoretical progress, focusing on the precise determination of decay constants and form factors, which are crucial for testing the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa (CKM) matrix and lepton flavor universality. New LQCD calculations and experimental measurements from facilities such as LHCb and Belle II have provided stringent constraints on CKM matrix elements, contributing to the ongoing efforts to resolve discrepancies in lepton flavor universality. These findings are essential for refining our understanding of charm physics and the Standard Model.", "label": 1}
