{"grounding": "Ultra-high-energy (UHE, >0.1 PeV) \u03b3-ray astronomy is rapidly evolving into an expanding branch of \u03b3-ray astronomy with the surprising discovery of 12 PeVatrons and the detection of a handful of photons above 1 PeV. Nearly all known celestial object types that have emissions in the TeV band are found also to emit UHE photons. UHE \u03b3-rays have a well-defined horizon inside our Galaxy due to the absorption of infrared and cosmic microwave backgrounds in the Universe. In the last 30 years, traditional cosmic ray (CR) measurement techniques have enabled the detection of UHE \u03b3-rays and opened the last observation window. For leptonic sources, UHE radiation is in the deep Klein\u2013Nishina regime, which is largely suppressed. Therefore, UHE \u03b3-ray detection will be helpful in locating and identifying hadronic radiation sources, tracing the historic pursuit for the origin of CRs around the knee of the spectrum. The Crab Nebula is the focus of attention with measured photon emissions up to 1 PeV. In the absence of hadronic processes, these emissions may indicate the existence of an extreme accelerator of e\n+\ne\n\u2212. Use of CR extensive air shower detection techniques broadens the field of view of the source observations, enabling measurement of UHE radiation surrounding the sources. These observations can probe the particle propagation inside and outside the accelerators and the subsequent injection/escape into the interstellar medium.", "generated_text": "Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has entered a new era with the advent of advanced observatories such as the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). This paper presents recent findings from LHAASO, focusing on the detection of ultra-high-energy gamma rays from the Crab Nebula, a well-known supernova remnant. The Crab Nebula has long been a benchmark source for high-energy astrophysics, and recent observations have revealed the presence of a PeVatron, a cosmic accelerator capable of producing particles with energies exceeding 1 PeV (10^15 eV). The extensive air shower (EAS) technique, employed by LHAASO, has been crucial in identifying these high-energy gamma rays. The muon content of the EAS, in particular, provides a powerful tool for distinguishing gamma-ray signals from cosmic-ray backgrounds. This study not only confirms the existence of a PeVatron in the Crab Nebula but also sheds light on the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and propagation in extreme astrophysical environments. The implications of these findings extend to our understanding of the sources and distribution of cosmic rays in the Milky Way, offering new insights into the high-energy universe.", "label": 0}
