{"grounding": "Applying dimensional analysis to the Higgs mass leads one to predict new physics interactions that generate this mass at a scale of the order of 1 TeV. The question of what these interactions could be is known as the gauge hierarchy problem. Resolving this question has been a central aim of particle physics for the past few decades. Traditional solutions introduce new particles with masses below 1 TeV, but that prediction is now challenged by experiment. In this article, I review recent new approaches to the problem that do not require new particles at the TeV mass scale. I first discuss the relaxation approach, whereby the Higgs mass is made dynamical and is small at the absolute minimum of its potential. I then discuss the historical approach, whereby details about inflation and/or reheating after inflation cause the Higgs mass to be smaller than otherwise expected. Finally, I discuss solutions that use conditional probability, whereby conditioning on the fact that the cosmological constant is small automatically leads one to select vacua where the Higgs mass is also small.", "generated_text": "The gauge hierarchy problem, a cornerstone of particle physics, poses a significant challenge to the naturalness of the Standard Model, particularly concerning the Higgs boson mass. This paper explores novel solutions to this problem, focusing on mechanisms that relax the fine-tuning required to maintain the Higgs mass at the electroweak scale. We review recent developments in relaxation mechanisms, including composite Higgs models, extra-dimensional scenarios, and dynamical symmetry breaking. These approaches aim to stabilize the Higgs mass against quantum corrections, thereby addressing the hierarchy between the electroweak and Planck scales. Our analysis highlights the potential of these models to provide a natural explanation for the observed Higgs mass, while also predicting new particles and interactions that could be tested at current and future collider experiments. The implications of these solutions for the broader landscape of beyond-the-Standard-Model physics are discussed, emphasizing their role in guiding future theoretical and experimental efforts.", "label": 1}
