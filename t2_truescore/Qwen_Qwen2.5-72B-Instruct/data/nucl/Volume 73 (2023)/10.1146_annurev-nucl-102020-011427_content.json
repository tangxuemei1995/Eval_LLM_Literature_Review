{"grounding": "In this article, I review scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model in which the top quark plays a special role. Models that aim at the stabilization of the weak scale are presented together with the specific phenomenology of partner states that are characteristic of this type of model. Further, I present models of flavor in which the top quark is singled out as a special flavor in the Standard Model. The flavor and collider phenomenology of these models is broadly presented. Finally, I discuss the possibility that dark matter interacts preferably with the top quark flavor and give an overview of the dark matter phenomenology of these scenarios, as well as collider and flavor signals.", "generated_text": "The top quark, being the heaviest known elementary particle, plays a crucial role in exploring physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This review examines recent theoretical and experimental advancements in BSM physics associated with the top quark, focusing on the hierarchy problem, flavor physics, and dark matter. We discuss the implications of top quark interactions for new physics scenarios, including supersymmetry and composite Higgs models. Experimental results from the LHC and future collider prospects are highlighted, emphasizing the potential for discovering new particles and interactions that could address the outstanding questions in particle physics.", "label": 1}
