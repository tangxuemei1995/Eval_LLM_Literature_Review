{"grounding": "Since its start, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has helped advance both theory and experiment on the production and properties of the heaviest fundamental particle, the top quark. This review focuses on a selected set of measurements and associated searches for new physics, which have opened the door for unprecedented precision in this area of high-energy physics. Fundamental parameters of the theory such as mt\n, \u03b1S, Vtb\n, and yt\n are measured from top quark events with relative uncertainties that are smaller than 0.5%, 1.8%, 2%, and 10%, respectively, and that are expected to improve with more data, better experimental methods, and more accurate theory predictions. Several results, even if statistically limited, already significantly constrain the phase space of new physics: measurements of associated production with bosons, processes with four top quarks, and searches for rare decays, among others. It is expected that until the completion of the LHC program, top quark physics will keep providing unique insights regarding the consistency of the Standard Model and the energy scale of new physics.", "generated_text": "The top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle, plays a crucial role in testing the Standard Model and exploring physics beyond it. This review appraises the current state of top quark physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and outlines the prospects for future discoveries. Recent measurements of top quark properties, including its mass, cross section, and decay modes, have provided stringent tests of the Standard Model. The interplay between strong and electroweak interactions in top quark production and decay has been probed with unprecedented precision. Additionally, the association of top quarks with the Higgs boson has been observed, offering insights into the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. However, several anomalies and tensions with the Standard Model predictions suggest the potential for new physics. Future runs of the LHC, with increased luminosity and improved detector technologies, will enhance the sensitivity to rare processes and subtle deviations, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces and particles.", "label": 1}
