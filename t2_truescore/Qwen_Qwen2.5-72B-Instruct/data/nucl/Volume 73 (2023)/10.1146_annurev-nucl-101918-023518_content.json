{"grounding": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides an intense, high-quality source of neutrinos from pion decay at rest. This source was recently used for the first measurements of coherent elastic neutrino\u2013nucleus scattering (CEvNS) by the COHERENT Collaboration, which resulted in new constraints of physics beyond the Standard Model. The SNS neutrino source will enable further CEvNS measurements, exploration of inelastic neutrino\u2013nucleus interactions of particular relevance for understanding supernova neutrinos, and searches for accelerator-produced sub-GeV dark matter. Taking advantage of this unique facility, COHERENT's suite of detectors in Neutrino Alley at the SNS is accumulating more data to address a broad physics program at the intersection of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. This review describes COHERENT's first two CEvNS measurements, their interpretation, and the potential of a future physics program at the SNS.", "generated_text": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) has made significant strides in the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\u03bdNS). This process, predicted by the Standard Model, is a sensitive probe for new physics, including interactions with supernova neutrinos and dark matter. The experiment utilizes a variety of detector technologies to observe CE\u03bdNS, providing insights into neutrino interactions at low energies. Recent results from COHERENT have confirmed the CE\u03bdNS cross-section, enhancing our understanding of neutrino properties and their role in astrophysical phenomena. The implications of these findings extend to the detection of supernova neutrinos and the search for dark matter, offering a unique window into the fundamental nature of the universe.", "label": 1}
