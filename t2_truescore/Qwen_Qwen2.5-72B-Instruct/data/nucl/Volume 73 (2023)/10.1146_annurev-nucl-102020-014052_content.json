{"grounding": "We present a method for ordering two-nucleon interactions based upon their scaling with the number of QCD colors, N\n\nc\n, in the limit that N\n\nc\n becomes large. Available data in the two-nucleon sector show general agreement with this ordering, indicating that the method may be useful in other contexts where data are less readily available. However, several caveats and potential pitfalls can make the large-N\n\nc\n ordering fragile and/or vulnerable to misinterpretation. We discuss the application of the large-N\n\nc\n analysis to two- and three-nucleon interactions, including those originating from weak and BSM (beyond the Standard Model) interactions, as well as two-nucleon external currents. Finally, we discuss some open questions in the field.", "generated_text": "This study explores the implications of large-N_c QCD for the two-nucleon (NN) interaction, leveraging effective field theories to elucidate the underlying dynamics. By considering the limit where the number of colors N_c is large, we derive constraints on the NN potential that are consistent with the symmetries and structure of QCD. Our analysis reveals that the leading-order contributions to the NN interaction are dominated by meson exchanges, with corrections suppressed by powers of 1/N_c. These findings provide a robust framework for understanding few-nucleon interactions and offer insights into the role of higher-order corrections in nuclear physics.", "label": 1}
