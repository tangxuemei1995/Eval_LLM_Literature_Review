{"grounding": "Live (not decayed) radioisotopes on the Earth and Moon are messengers from recent nearby astrophysical explosions. Measurements of 60Fe in deep-sea samples, Antarctic snow, and lunar regolith reveal two pulses about 3 Myr and 7 Myr ago. Detection of 244Pu in a deep-sea crust indicates a recent r-process event. We review the ultrasensitive accelerator mass spectrometry techniques that enable these findings. We then explore the implications for astrophysics, including supernova nucleosynthesis, particularly the r-process, as well as supernova dust production and the formation of the Local Bubble that envelops the Solar System. The implications go beyond nuclear physics and astrophysics to include studies of heliophysics, astrobiology, geology, and evolutionary biology.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the presence of deep-sea and lunar radioisotopes, such as 60Fe and 244Pu, as tracers of nearby astrophysical explosions, specifically supernovae. Utilizing accelerator mass spectrometry, we analyzed samples from the ocean floor and lunar regolith to detect these isotopes, which are products of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Our findings suggest that these radioisotopes provide direct evidence of supernova events within the last few million years, offering insights into the frequency and impact of such cosmic phenomena on Earth and the Moon. The results contribute to our understanding of the astrophysical processes that influence the interstellar medium and the solar system.", "label": 1}
