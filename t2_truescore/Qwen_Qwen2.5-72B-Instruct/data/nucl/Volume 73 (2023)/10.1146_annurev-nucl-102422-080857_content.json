{"grounding": "Neutron captures produce the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron in the Universe. Beyond the classical slow (s) and rapid (r) processes, there is observational evidence for neutron-capture processes that operate at neutron densities in between, at different distances from the valley of \u03b2 stability. Here, we review the main properties of the s process within the general context of neutron-capture processes and the nuclear physics input required to investigate it. We describe massive stars and asymptotic giant branch stars as the s-process astrophysical sites and discuss the related physical uncertainties. We also present current observational evidence for the s process and beyond, which ranges from stellar spectroscopic observations to laboratory analysis of meteorites.", "generated_text": "The s-process, a critical nucleosynthesis mechanism, primarily occurs in AGB stars and massive stars, where neutron captures on iron-peak elements lead to the formation of heavier isotopes. This review explores recent advancements in understanding the s-process, including its role in stellar spectroscopy and the implications for meteoritic anomalies. New observational data and theoretical models are discussed, highlighting the importance of neutron density and temperature conditions in AGB stars. The abstract also addresses the contribution of massive stars to the s-process and the potential for these processes to explain isotopic variations observed in meteorites.", "label": 1}
