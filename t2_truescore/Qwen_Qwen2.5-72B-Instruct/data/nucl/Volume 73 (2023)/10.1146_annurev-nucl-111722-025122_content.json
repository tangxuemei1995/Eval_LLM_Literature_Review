{"grounding": "Detection of low-energy nuclear recoil events plays a central role in searches for particle dark matter interactions with atomic matter and studies of coherent neutrino scatters. Precise nuclear recoil calibration data allow the responses of these dark matter and neutrino detectors to be characterized and enable in situ evaluation of an experiment's sensitivity to anticipated signals. This article reviews the common methods for detection of nuclear recoil events and the wide variety of techniques that have been developed to calibrate detector response to nuclear recoils. We summarize the main experimental factors that are critical for accurate nuclear recoil calibrations, investigate mitigation strategies for different backgrounds and biases, and discuss how the presentation of calibration results can facilitate comparison between experiments. Lastly, we discuss the challenges for future nuclear recoil calibration efforts and the physics opportunities they may enable.", "generated_text": "The accurate detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils are crucial for advancing the sensitivity of dark matter and coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE\u03bdNS) experiments. This study presents a comprehensive approach to calibrating detectors for low-energy nuclear recoils, utilizing neutron scatter techniques. We detail the experimental setup and analysis methods, including the use of advanced simulation tools to model the response of the detector to nuclear recoils. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the energy threshold and resolution, enabling more precise measurements of low-energy events. This work paves the way for enhanced sensitivity in the search for dark matter particles and the study of CE\u03bdNS, contributing to a deeper understanding of fundamental physics phenomena.", "label": 1}
