{"grounding": "The study of high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider has evolved from a qualitative understanding to the precise extraction of the properties of the quantum chromodynamics medium at extremely high temperatures. Jet quenching has offered unique insights into the transport properties of the quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP) created in these energetic collisions. Apart from medium modification of jets, jet-induced medium excitation constitutes another crucial aspect of jet\u2013QGP interaction and is indispensable in understanding the soft components of jets. We review recent theoretical and phenomenological developments regarding medium response to jet energy loss, including an overview of both weakly and strongly coupled approaches for describing the thermalization and propagation of energy deposition from jets, effects of medium response on jet observables, and exploration of its unique signatures in jet\u2013hadron correlations. Jet-induced medium excitation is shown to be an essential component in probing the in-medium dynamics of jets and a critical step toward precise extraction of the QGP properties.", "generated_text": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP) leads to complex interactions between jets and the medium. This study investigates the medium response and jet\u2013hadron correlations in such collisions, focusing on the phenomena of jet quenching and jet-induced medium excitation. Jet quenching, the suppression of high-energy jets due to energy loss in the QGP, is a key observable for understanding the properties of the medium. Jet-induced medium excitation, where jets deposit energy and momentum into the QGP, results in observable modifications of the medium's flow and hadron spectra. By analyzing jet\u2013hadron correlations, this research provides insights into the dynamics of the QGP and the interplay between jets and the medium. The results are consistent with theoretical models predicting significant modifications of jet properties and enhanced hadron correlations in the presence of a dense, strongly interacting medium.", "label": 1}
