{"grounding": "Two topics have recently risen to prominence within the ongoing searches of beyond\u2013Standard Model effects in b and c decays: observables that test lepton flavor universality (LFU) and those that test lepton flavor violation (LFV). A coherent set of measurements suggests nonstandard LFU effects. General arguments relate LFU to LFV, and the observed size of the former gives hope of observable signals for the latter. We attempt a comprehensive discussion of both theoretical and experimental aspects of these tests. The main final message is that all the instruments necessary to fully establish the putative new effects are at hand, thanks to running experiments and their upgrades. Therefore, this subject stands a concrete chance of ushering in genuinely unexpected discoveries.", "generated_text": "This study investigates lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in the decays of heavy mesons containing b and c quarks, utilizing data from the LHCb experiment. The analysis focuses on the precision measurement of branching ratios and asymmetries in semileptonic decays, which can provide sensitive probes for physics beyond the Standard Model. The results are compared with theoretical predictions, highlighting discrepancies that may indicate new physics. The implications for the symmetries of fundamental interactions and the potential for new particles or interactions are discussed, emphasizing the importance of these measurements in constraining models of new physics.", "label": 0}
