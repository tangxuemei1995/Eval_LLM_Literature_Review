{"grounding": "Getting to net-zero-carbon cities while advancing well-being (W), health (H), social equity (E), and climate resilience (R) (referred to as the WHER outcomes) is critical for local and global sustainability. However, science is nascent on the linkages between zero-carbon pathways and WHER outcomes. This article presents a transboundary urban metabolism framework, rooted in seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems, to connect urban decarbonization strategies with WHER outcomes. Applying the framework along with a literature review, we find the evidence for co-beneficial decarbonization to be strong for health; limited for well-being; uncertain for resilience; and requiring intentional design to advance equity, including distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects. We describe the evidence base, identify key knowledge gaps, and delineate broad parameters of a new urban nexus science to enable zero-carbon urban transitions with WHER co-benefits. We highlight the need for fine-scale data encompassing all seven sectors across scales, along with multiple and multiscale climate risks, accompanied by next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models.", "generated_text": "This study explores the interlinkages between decarbonization efforts in urban areas and their co-benefits for health, climate resilience, and equity. By analyzing the urban metabolism and its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the research identifies key strategies for achieving zero-carbon transitions that enhance well-being and social equity. The findings highlight the importance of integrated policy approaches that address energy, transportation, and urban planning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving air quality, public health, and social inclusivity. Case studies from cities with advanced decarbonization initiatives demonstrate the potential for these co-benefits, offering insights for policymakers and urban planners. The study concludes that a holistic approach to urban sustainability can significantly advance the SDGs, particularly in areas related to health, climate action, and reduced inequalities.", "label": 1}
