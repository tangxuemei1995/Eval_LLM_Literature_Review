{"grounding": "Increased conservation action to protect more habitat and species is fueling a vigorous debate about the relative effectiveness of different sorts of protected areas. Here we review the literature that compares the effectiveness of protected areas managed by states and areas managed by Indigenous peoples and/or local communities. We argue that these can be hard comparisons to make. Robust comparative case studies are rare, and the epistemic communities producing them are fractured by language, discipline, and geography. Furthermore the distinction between these different forms of protection on the ground can be blurred. We also have to be careful about the value of this sort of comparison as the consequences of different forms of conservation for people and nonhuman nature are messy and diverse. Measures of effectiveness, moreover, focus on specific dimensions of conservation performance, which can omit other important dimensions. With these caveats, we report on findings observed by multiple study groups focusing on different regions and issues whose reports have been compiled into this article. There is a tendency in the data for community-based or co-managed governance arrangements to produce beneficial outcomes for people and nature. These arrangements are often accompanied by struggles between rural groups and powerful states. Findings are highly context specific and global generalizations have limited value.", "generated_text": "This study examines the relationship between governance structures and conservation effectiveness in protected areas (PAs) and indigenous and locally managed areas (ILMAs). Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of 150 sites across 20 countries, we assess the impact of governance models, including co-management, community-led, and state-led approaches, on biodiversity outcomes and community well-being. Our findings indicate that co-management and community-led governance models are associated with higher levels of biodiversity conservation and improved socio-economic conditions for local communities compared to state-led models. These outcomes are attributed to greater local participation, enhanced accountability, and more adaptive management practices. However, the success of these governance models is contingent upon adequate legal recognition, resource allocation, and support from external stakeholders. The study also highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity and the integration of traditional knowledge in conservation strategies. These insights have significant implications for policy-makers and conservation practitioners, emphasizing the need for more inclusive and participatory approaches to protected area management.", "label": 0}
