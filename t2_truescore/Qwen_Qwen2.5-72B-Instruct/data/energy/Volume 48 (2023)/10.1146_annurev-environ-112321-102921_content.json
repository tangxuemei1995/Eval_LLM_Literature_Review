{"grounding": "Buildings are key in supporting human activities and well-being by providing shelter and other important services to their users. Buildings are, however, also responsible for major energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during their life cycle. Improving the quality of services provided by buildings while reaching low energy demand (LED) levels is crucial for climate and sustainability targets. Building sector models have become essential tools for decision support on strategies to reduce energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet current models have significant limitations in their ability to assess the transformations required for LED. We review building sector models ranging from the subnational to the global scale to identify best practices and critical gaps in representing transformations toward LED futures. We focus on three key dimensions of intervention (socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological), three megatrends (digitalization, sharing economy, and circular economy), and decent living standards. This review recommends the model developments needed to better assess LED transformations in buildings and support decision-making toward sustainability targets.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews the current state of research on modeling low energy demand futures for residential and commercial buildings, focusing on climate change mitigation strategies. It examines the development of scenarios that integrate energy demand transformation with broader megatrends, such as urbanization, technological innovation, and socio-economic shifts. The review highlights the importance of aligning these scenarios with decent living standards to ensure equitable outcomes. Key research needs include improving the integration of behavioral and technological factors, enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of models, and developing more robust methods for assessing the co-benefits and trade-offs of low energy demand pathways. The paper also underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to address the complex challenges of achieving sustainable and equitable energy futures in the building sector.", "label": 1}
