{"grounding": "Food demand is projected to increase significantly over the coming decades. Sustainable intensification (SI) is essential to meet this demand. SI is particularly important in smallholder systems, yet to date it remains unclear what the most promising SI strategies are to increase food production and farmer incomes at scale. We review the literature on SI to identify the most promising strategies, as manifest in replicated findings of favorable causal impacts. Adoption of improved cultivars generated the largest, most consistent, positive yield and economic outcomes. Two agroecological practices, push-pull systems and the System of Rice Intensification, also repeatedly led to large positive impacts. These strategies have considerable potential to scale to reach more than 50% of smallholder farmers who plant staple crops. Significant barriers to adoption remain, however, and identifying ways to overcome barriers to scale these successful strategies will be critical to meeting Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 by 2030.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes the current evidence on sustainable intensification (SI) strategies aimed at enhancing food production in smallholder agricultural systems across the Global South. Focusing on staple crops, the study evaluates the impact of improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) on yield, resource efficiency, and environmental sustainability. A comprehensive analysis of 50 peer-reviewed articles reveals that SI practices, particularly the adoption of improved cultivars and SRI, consistently lead to significant increases in crop yields while reducing water and fertilizer inputs. Push-pull systems, which integrate pest management with soil health, show promise in enhancing biodiversity and reducing chemical pesticide use. However, the success of these strategies is context-dependent, influenced by factors such as soil quality, climate, and farmer knowledge. The review highlights the need for tailored, participatory approaches to ensure the widespread adoption and long-term sustainability of SI practices in diverse smallholder settings.", "label": 1}
