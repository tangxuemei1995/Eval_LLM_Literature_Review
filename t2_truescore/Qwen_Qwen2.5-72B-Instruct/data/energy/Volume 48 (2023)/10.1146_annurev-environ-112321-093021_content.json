{"grounding": "Urban overheating is the most documented phenomenon of climate change impacting humans. This article presents the most recent developments on the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating and the potential synergies with global climatic change. It analyses the latest qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of higher urban temperatures on buildings\u2019 energy supply and demand, heat-related mortality, morbidity and wellbeing, human productivity, survivability of low-income populations, and environmental quality of cities. It describes the state of the art on the development of innovative mitigation materials, advanced urban greenery, heat dissipation, and evaporative techniques as the main mitigation and adaptation technologies to offset the impact of urban overheating. It also analyses the current knowledge on the impact of each mitigation technology on energy, health, environmental quality, urban economy, and survivability. Finally, this article presents the main future challenges related to urban overheating and proposes a specific research agenda to alleviate and counterbalance its impact on human life.", "generated_text": "Urban overheating, characterized by the urban heat island (UHI) effect, is a critical environmental issue exacerbating thermal discomfort and energy consumption in cities. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating, its impacts on human health, infrastructure, and energy systems, and evaluates mitigation and adaptation strategies. The UHI effect can elevate urban temperatures by up to 10\u00b0C compared to rural areas, leading to increased mortality, higher energy demands, and reduced air quality. Mitigation strategies, such as green infrastructure, cool pavements, and urban planning, have shown promise in reducing surface and air temperatures. Adaptation measures, including heat action plans and public awareness campaigns, are essential for enhancing community resilience. Future challenges include integrating these strategies into urban development policies and addressing the disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. This comprehensive analysis highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches to combat urban overheating and ensure sustainable urban environments.", "label": 1}
