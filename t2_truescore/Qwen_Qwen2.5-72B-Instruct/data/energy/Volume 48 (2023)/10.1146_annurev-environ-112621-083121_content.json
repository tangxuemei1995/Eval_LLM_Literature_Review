{"grounding": "The few percent of soil organic carbon (SOC) among mineral components form the interface of climate, plant growth, soil biological processes, physical transport infrastructure, and chemical transformations. We explore maps, models, myths, motivation, means of implementation, and modalities for transformation. Theories of place relate geographic variation in SOC to climate, soil types, land cover, and profile depth. Process-level theories of biophysical change and socioeconomic theories of induced change explain SOC transitions that follow from land use change when a declining curve is bent and recovery toward SOC saturation starts. While the desirability of recovering from SOC deficits has been mainstreamed into climate policy, the effectiveness of proposed measures taken remains contested. Process-level requirements for transitions at plot and landscape scales remain uncertain. Expectations of policy-induced SOC transitions have to align with national cross-sectoral C accounting and be managed realistically with land users (farmers) and commodity supply chains (private sector, consumers).", "generated_text": "Soils play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, acting as both a significant store and sink for carbon. This review synthesizes current understanding of soil carbon dynamics, emphasizing the processes of decomposition, root turnover, and litter accumulation. Utilizing models such as the Century and Millennial models, we explore the expectations and patterns of soil carbon storage under varying climate scenarios. The review highlights the importance of soil health and management practices in enhancing carbon sequestration, which is crucial for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Soil mapping and policy interventions are discussed as essential tools for identifying and implementing effective strategies to maintain and increase soil carbon stocks. The prospects for transitions towards more sustainable land use practices are evaluated, underscoring the need for integrated approaches that consider both ecological and socio-economic factors.", "label": 0}
