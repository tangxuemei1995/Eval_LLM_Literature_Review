{"grounding": "After tentative efforts during the 1990s, the past two decades have seen a rapid increase in the number of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation policies, initially in a few frontrunner countries and more recently spreading globally. Over the same period, GHG emissions have continued to rise, but the rate of growth has recently slowed. Are mitigation policies having an effect? To explore this question, we review and synthesize the empirical literature on the impact of mitigation policies on three key outcomes: GHG emissions, proximate emission drivers like energy intensity and land use, and low-carbon technologies. Our key contribution to the available literature lies in establishing an empirically based track record of climate action, focusing on methodologically sound ex post studies. We find that mitigation policies have had a discernible impact on emissions and multiple emission drivers. Most notably, they have led to reductions in energy use, declines in deforestation rates, as well as cost reductions and capacity expansions of low-carbon technologies in many instances. Furthermore, implemented policies to date are likely to have reduced global emissions by several billion tons of CO2eq per year compared to a world without mitigation policies. In the light of current ambitions on climate action falling short of what is required to limit global warming to the Paris temperature goals, we conclude that there is ample evidence of policy instruments with demonstrable impacts, but that efforts need to be hugely strengthened and expanded. Also, far more attention is required to policy monitoring, evaluation, and learning so as to strengthen the basis for future policy and the attribution of its impacts.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of climate mitigation policies over the past three decades, examining the effectiveness of various policy instruments in achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Through a detailed analysis of the literature, we assess the impact of regulatory measures, economic incentives, and voluntary actions on global and regional scales. The review highlights the evolution of climate policy from early, fragmented efforts to more coordinated international frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement. Key findings indicate that while some policies have led to notable abatement, overall progress remains insufficient to meet the ambitious targets set by the international community. The analysis also reveals that the success of climate policies is highly context-dependent, influenced by factors such as political will, economic conditions, and technological advancements. Furthermore, the paper identifies gaps in current policy approaches, including inadequate enforcement mechanisms, limited stakeholder engagement, and insufficient integration of adaptation strategies. Recommendations for enhancing policy effectiveness include the adoption of more stringent emission reduction targets, the development of robust monitoring and verification systems, and the promotion of cross-sectoral collaboration. This review underscores the urgent need for more ambitious and coordinated global efforts to address the escalating climate crisis.", "label": 1}
