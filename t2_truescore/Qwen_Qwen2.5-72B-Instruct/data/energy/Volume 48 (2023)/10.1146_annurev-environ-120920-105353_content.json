{"grounding": "Addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development are the grand challenges for this century. This review assesses how sustainability and green jobs are changing in response to these formidable challenges, with a focus on energy transitions and responsible production and consumption. The energy transition to renewable sources will generate a net increase in employment, although some regions of the world may see net losses. Jobs in responsible consumption and production, motivated by changing consumer demand and savings from circular economy strategies, will increase the number of green and sustainability jobs. Since sustainability and green jobs require higher levels of creative problem-solving, more nonroutine activities, formal education, and on-the-job training than traditional jobs, more training will be necessary to meet skills demands in green and sustainability positions. We review how competency and capacity approaches to learning, credentialing, and on-the-job training have been employed to meet growing demand for sustainability and green jobs.", "generated_text": "This study explores the evolving landscape of sustainability careers, focusing on the competencies and training required for professionals in green jobs. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and an analysis of job market trends, the research identifies key competencies such as systems thinking, environmental knowledge, and stakeholder engagement as essential for success in sustainability roles. The study also examines the curricula of leading academic programs to assess their alignment with industry needs, highlighting gaps and opportunities for improvement. Findings suggest that interdisciplinary training and practical experience are crucial for preparing the workforce for the transition to a sustainable economy. Recommendations include the development of more tailored training programs and the integration of real-world projects into curricula to enhance the readiness of future sustainability professionals.", "label": 1}
