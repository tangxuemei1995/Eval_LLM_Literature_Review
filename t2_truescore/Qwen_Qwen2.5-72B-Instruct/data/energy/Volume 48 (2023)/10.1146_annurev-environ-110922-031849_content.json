{"grounding": "Modifications to land can serve to jointly reduce risks of floods and droughts to people and to ecosystems. Whether land modifications are implemented will depend on the willingness and ability of a diversity of actors. This article reviews the state of knowledge on land modification use in areas exposed to dual hydrologic risks and the land owners, managers, and users who directly make decisions about action on lands they control. The review presents a typology of land modifications and explains how land modifications interact with the hydrological cycle to reduce risks. It then addresses the roles and perspectives of the land owners, managers, and users undertaking land modifications, summarizing theories explaining motivations for, as well as barriers to and enablers of, land modification implementation. The analysis reveals geographical differences in narratives on land modifications as well as knowledge gaps regarding variation across actors and types of land modifications.", "generated_text": "This study explores the potential and perspectives of land modifications as a strategy for mitigating concurrent flood and drought risks, emphasizing the motivations and practices of land users. Through a comprehensive review of case studies and empirical data, the research highlights how land modifications, such as contour plowing, terracing, and the creation of water retention basins, can enhance water management and soil stability. The findings indicate that while these practices offer significant benefits in reducing the impacts of extreme weather events, their adoption is influenced by socio-economic factors, including land tenure, access to resources, and community support. The study also underscores the importance of integrating local knowledge and participatory approaches in the design and implementation of land modification strategies to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability. Overall, the research provides valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to develop climate-resilient land management practices.", "label": 1}
