{"grounding": "Qualitative research methods examine a wide range of topics in the study of environment and resource management. This first review on the topic highlights innovative and impactful research over the past few decades, drawing from social science disciplines that include sociology, geography, anthropology, political science, public policy, and psychology. We describe qualitative research methods that have addressed five scientific goals: (a) describing what the world is like, (b) predicting what the world can be like, (c) acknowl-edging researcher positionality and reflexivity and diversifying ways of knowing in theorizing and research designs, (d) integrating imaginaries into empirical research and building narratives to make sense of possible futures and to broaden our view of scientific inquiry, and (e) helping scholars grapple with the deep complexity of socioecological systems. As we explore these themes, we explain foundational qualitative approaches and highlight examples of environmental qualitative research that apply them.", "generated_text": "This paper explores recent advancements in qualitative methods within environmental research, emphasizing their role in understanding complex socioecological systems and the impacts of climate change. Qualitative approaches, including participatory research, ethnography, and narrative analysis, are increasingly recognized for their ability to capture the nuanced perspectives and lived experiences of individuals and communities. These methods facilitate a deeper understanding of how environmental changes are perceived and managed at local levels, providing critical insights that complement quantitative data. The paper also discusses the integration of qualitative methods with other research paradigms, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing environmental challenges. Case studies from diverse geographical contexts illustrate the effectiveness of these methods in informing policy and practice, underscoring their potential to enhance the resilience and sustainability of socioecological systems.", "label": 1}
