{"grounding": "Global agreement on 30\u00d730 means an unprecedented last push to define how much nature will be left on the planet. At the same time that space for nature is being defined, climate change will be moving nature around. Species are now on the move to track climate change both on land and in the oceans, a process that is accelerating under dramatic new extreme events. This is an opportune time to review conservation recommendations made early in the millennium, to see how many have been taken on board over the past 20 years, and how much is left to be done to adapt to climate change as conservation pushes toward 30\u00d730. The history of Climate Change\u2013Integrated Conservation Strategies begins with two papers published by a group of prominent climate change biologists in 2002. The importance of including adaptation to climate change in conservation was underscored by the first estimates of extinction risk due to climate change in 2004. Subsequent literature has developed concepts such as velocity of climate change and assisted migration. Regional modeling of biodiversity change, expanding protected areas to facilitate species range movements, and managing productive landscapes to facilitate species movements are all now considered \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for conservation planning for climate change. Regional coordination of conservation efforts to ensure that species on the move are managed for climate change consistently across their range, on the other hand, is under-represented in literature and practice. Improving both theory and practice of regional coordination for climate change is an important priority for conservation now and in the future. Conservation for climate change has focused mostly on warming scenarios, but failure to act on climate change emissions reduction means that meeting Paris Agreement targets will almost certainly have to include both warming past those targets and subsequent cooling back to the target. Managing this double transition is a second critical point of emphasis for climate change biology as the world moves to 30\u00d730.", "generated_text": "The 30\u00d730 initiative, which aims to conserve 30% of the Earth\u2019s land and ocean by 2030, represents a significant milestone in the integration of climate change considerations into conservation strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the historical context, current status, and future directions of climate change\u2013integrated conservation efforts, with a particular focus on the 30\u00d730 initiative. Historically, conservation efforts have often been reactive, addressing immediate threats to biodiversity without fully considering the long-term impacts of climate change. However, the increasing recognition of climate change as a primary driver of biodiversity loss has led to a paradigm shift towards more proactive and adaptive conservation strategies. The 30\u00d730 initiative is a prime example of this shift, emphasizing the need for large-scale, interconnected protected areas that can support species migration and adaptation. The paper discusses the scientific underpinnings of the 30\u00d730 target, including the role of systematic conservation planning in identifying priority areas for protection. It also highlights the importance of regional coordination and cross-border collaboration in ensuring the effectiveness of conservation efforts in the face of climate change. Case studies from various regions, such as the Amazon Basin and the Coral Triangle, illustrate the challenges and successes of implementing climate-resilient conservation strategies. Finally, the paper explores the future of climate change\u2013integrated conservation, emphasizing the need for continued research, policy development, and community engagement to achieve the 30\u00d730 goal and beyond. The integration of climate change biology into conservation planning is crucial for the long-term survival of species and the maintenance of ecosystem services, making the 30\u00d730 initiative a pivotal step towards a more resilient and sustainable future.", "label": 1}
