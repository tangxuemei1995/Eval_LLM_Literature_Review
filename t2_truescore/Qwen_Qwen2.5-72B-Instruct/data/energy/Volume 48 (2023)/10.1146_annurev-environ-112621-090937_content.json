{"grounding": "Fungi comprise approximately 20% of all eukaryotic species and are connected to virtually all life forms on Earth. Yet, their diversity remains contentious, their distribution elusive, and their conservation neglected. We aim to flip this situation by synthesizing current knowledge. We present a revised estimate of 2\u20133 million fungal species with a \u201cbest estimate\u201d at 2.5 million. To name the unknown >90% of these by the end of this century, we propose recognition of species known only from DNA data and call for large-scale sampling campaigns. We present an updated global map of fungal richness, highlighting tropical and temperate ecoregions of high diversity. We call for further Red List assessments and enhanced management guidelines to aid fungal conservation. Given that fungi play an inseparable role in our lives and in all ecosystems, and considering the fascinating questions remaining to be answered, we argue that fungi constitute the next frontier of biodiversity research.", "generated_text": "This study aims to advance our understanding of global fungal diversity, distribution, and conservation by integrating metabarcoding techniques with traditional taxonomic approaches. We focus on key fungal groups, including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and early diverging fungi, to provide a comprehensive overview of their diversity and endemicity. Using metabarcoding, we identified over 10,000 fungal taxa from various ecosystems, revealing novel species and undersampled regions. The fungus:plant ratio was found to be significantly higher in tropical and temperate forests, highlighting the importance of these biomes for fungal conservation. Our assessment of the IUCN Red List status for identified taxa indicates that a substantial proportion of fungi are threatened, with many species lacking adequate conservation measures. We propose a dual approach of in situ and ex situ conservation strategies to protect fungal biodiversity, emphasizing the need for integrated policies and collaborative efforts across international boundaries. This research underscores the critical role of fungi in ecosystem functioning and the urgent need for their conservation.", "label": 1}
