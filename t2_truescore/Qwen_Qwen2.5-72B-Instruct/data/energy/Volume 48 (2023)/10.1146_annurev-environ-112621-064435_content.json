{"grounding": "The nuclear waste management and disposal program in the United States for highly radioactive waste (spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste) has thus far been unsuccessful despite an effort that spans 40 years and the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars. Yet, today, there is considerable interest in and promotion of advanced reactor technologies, such as small modular reactors that will expand spent fuel inventories that may very well remain at the site where they are generated, awaiting permanent, geologic disposal. We examine critical elements of the US legal and regulatory framework that have impeded the success of the US program. We make recommendations on steps that are required for a successful nuclear waste program, particularly considering the development of advanced nuclear reactors and their fuel cycles.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the current and evolving legal and regulatory framework governing nuclear waste management in the United States, with a focus on both existing and advanced reactors and their fuel cycles. It analyzes the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste, highlighting its implications for retrievability and long-term storage. The study also explores regulatory challenges and opportunities for advanced reactors, including the need for flexible and adaptive regulations to accommodate new fuel cycles and waste streams. Key findings include the importance of stakeholder engagement, technological innovation, and policy coherence to ensure safe and sustainable nuclear waste management.", "label": 0}
