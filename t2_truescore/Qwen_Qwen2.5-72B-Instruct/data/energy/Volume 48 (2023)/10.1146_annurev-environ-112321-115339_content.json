{"grounding": "Polarization in the United States and around the world is of growing concern. Polarization is about more than just differences in opinions in society. It occurs when groups increasingly diverge in either actual or perceived differences in opinion and can involve both disagreements about issues and negative views of other groups. Since most environmental problems are collective action problems, polarization may interfere with the kinds of deliberation and collaborations needed for effective environmental decision-making. In this review, we examine how polarization influences environmental decision-making and what strategies could be useful for preventing or reducing the negative consequences of polarization. Evidence about the extent of polarization among citizens suggests the current situation may be less severe than is sometimes assumed. The coevolution of individual views, network interactions, and social media that cause polarization is complex and subject to rapid change. However, there are interventions that seem to be effective at reducing polarization.", "generated_text": "This study explores the impact of opinion and perceived polarization on environmental decision-making, particularly in the context of climate change. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 1,200 participants from diverse demographic backgrounds and conducted in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. Our findings reveal that perceived polarization, often more pronounced than actual opinion polarization, significantly hinders collaborative environmental decision-making. Intergroup relations are strained, leading to a decrease in trust and an increase in adversarial positions. However, the study also identifies strategies to mitigate these effects, such as fostering cross-group dialogue and emphasizing shared values. These insights are crucial for policymakers and environmental organizations aiming to build consensus and effective action in an increasingly polarized society.", "label": 0}
