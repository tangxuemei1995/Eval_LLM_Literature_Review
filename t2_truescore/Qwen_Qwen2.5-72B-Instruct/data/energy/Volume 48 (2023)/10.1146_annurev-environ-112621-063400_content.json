{"grounding": "Energy equity and justice have become priority considerations for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars alike. To ensure that energy equity is incorporated into actual decisions and analysis, it is necessary to design, use, and continually improve energy equity metrics. In this article, we review the literature and practices surrounding such metrics. We present a working definition for energy justice and equity, and connect them to both criteria for and frameworks of metrics. We then present a large sampling of energy equity metrics, including those focused on vulnerability, wealth creation, energy poverty, life cycle, and comparative country-level dynamics.We conclude with a discussion of the limitations, gaps, and trade-offs associated with these various metrics and their interactions thereof.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the development and application of metrics for decision-making in the realm of energy justice, focusing on the dimensions of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. We review existing frameworks and propose a comprehensive set of indicators to assess energy equity, including access to affordable and reliable energy, participation in decision-making processes, and the recognition of diverse energy needs and cultural values. These metrics are designed to guide policymakers, practitioners, and researchers in creating more just and equitable energy systems. Through case studies and empirical analysis, we demonstrate the utility of these metrics in identifying disparities and informing targeted interventions to promote energy justice.", "label": 0}
