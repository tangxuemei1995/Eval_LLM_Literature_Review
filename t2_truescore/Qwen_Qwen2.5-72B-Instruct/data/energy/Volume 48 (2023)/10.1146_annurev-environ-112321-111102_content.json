{"grounding": "Visions of planting walls of trees to block the expansion of the desert have long been promoted but never realized. The green wall myth persists today even though it is premised on outdated understandings of desertification. We review the history of the idea of green walls and focus on two sets of contemporary initiatives to assess their outcomes: peri-Saharan programs (Algeria's Green Dam and Great Green Wall in sub-Saharan Africa) and China's Three Norths Shelterbelt Program. This review reveals a mixed record of technical success with low rates of the establishment of monocultures of fast-growing trees vulnerable to disease. While there is evidence for reduced wind erosion in some areas, afforestation is also associated with reduced soil moisture and lowering of water tables. Social impacts include increased water scarcity for people and livestock in some cases, and resource enclosures that particularly work against pastoralist livelihoods.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the concept of Great Green Walls (GGWs) as a strategy for combating desertification and promoting environmental rehabilitation in drylands, with a focus on the initiatives in the Sahel and China. While the idea of planting vast stretches of trees to halt desertification has gained significant traction and public imagination, the scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of GGWs is mixed. The paper reviews the ecological, social, and economic impacts of GGWs, highlighting both successes and challenges. Case studies from Algeria and China illustrate the complexities of implementing such large-scale afforestation projects, including issues of species selection, water management, and community engagement. The findings suggest that while GGWs can contribute to environmental rehabilitation, their success depends on a nuanced, context-specific approach that integrates local knowledge and adaptive management practices.", "label": 1}
