{"grounding": "For millennia, agriculture has been shaping landscapes on Earth. Technological change has increased agricultural productivity dramatically, especially in the past six decades, but also resulted in trade-offs such as land and soil degradation, emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and spreading of toxic substances. In this article we review the impacts of agriculture on the world's arable land. We start by synthesizing information on the extent of arable land and associated agricultural practices, followed by a review of the state of the art of soil health and soil carbon. We review processes of land degradation, emission of GHGs, and threats to biodiversity. To conclude, we review key social and economic aspects of arable land and identify some important concerns for the future. The article ends on a positive note describing a potential new pathway for agriculture\u2014to gradually adopt polycultures of novel perennial grain crops.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes current knowledge on the state of the world's arable land, emphasizing the interplay between land degradation, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. Land degradation, driven by intensive agricultural practices, deforestation, and urbanization, has led to significant declines in soil carbon and fertility, impacting rural economies and food security. The conversion of natural habitats to agricultural land has also resulted in biodiversity loss, further compromising ecosystem resilience. However, sustainable land management practices, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry, offer promising solutions to mitigate these challenges. These practices not only enhance soil carbon sequestration and biodiversity but also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of these strategies into national and international policies is crucial for the sustainable management of arable land and the support of rural livelihoods.", "label": 1}
