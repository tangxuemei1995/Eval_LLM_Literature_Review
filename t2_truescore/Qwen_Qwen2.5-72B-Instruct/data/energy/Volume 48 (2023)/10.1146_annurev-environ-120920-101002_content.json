{"grounding": "There are large disparities in access to green technologies between countries and among different demographic groups within countries. Unless carefully managed, the energy transition risks exacerbating some of these inequalities, for example, by burdening those who are excluded from efficient new technologies with the costs of maintaining legacy infrastructure. The energy transition will create new interdependencies between sectors\u2014for example, between buildings, the power sector, and transportation\u2014requiring integrated design of policies and infrastructure in different sectors. The equitable adoption of new technologies is contingent on broadening access to enabling technologies such as the Internet and payment systems. Decisionmakers must focus on new technologies that remove disparities in access to services but do not replicate current inefficiencies in providing those services (e.g., equitable access to mobility\u2014not only to motorized personal vehicles). Data at higher resolutions and with broader coverage are needed to design equitable technology deployment strategies and evaluate their success.", "generated_text": "This study explores the multifaceted implications of green technologies for environmental justice, focusing on the concepts of just transition, electrification, modal shift, sustainable buildings, and distributional justice. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, the research highlights how the adoption of green technologies can both mitigate and exacerbate environmental inequalities. The analysis reveals that while electrification and sustainable building practices offer significant environmental benefits, their implementation often disproportionately benefits affluent communities, leaving marginalized groups behind. The study also underscores the importance of a just transition in the energy and transportation sectors, emphasizing the need for policies that ensure equitable access to green technologies and the creation of green jobs. Recommendations include targeted interventions to address distributional justice, such as subsidies for low-income households and community-led initiatives to promote sustainable practices. This research contributes to the broader discourse on achieving a sustainable and equitable future.", "label": 0}
