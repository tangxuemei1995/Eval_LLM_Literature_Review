{"grounding": "Brine contains cations such as K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Li+, B3+, Rb2+, and Cs2+, as well as anions such as SO4\n2\u2212, Cl\u2212, HCO3\n\u2212, CO3\n2\u2212, NO3\n\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212, which are valuable elements. Brines are widely distributed in salt lakes in the world's three enormous plateaus and beyond and are classified into three types: sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines. Sulfate-type brine forms in salt lakes, whereas carbonate-type brine results from magmatic and hydrothermal activity. Chloride-type brine forms in deep basins due to the reduction and transformation of buried brine. Li in brine plays a critical role in clean energy transitions, and K in brine is important for potash production. Recently, new techniques for extracting Li from brine have been developed, and the large-scale, comprehensive development pattern of brines has formed the basis for a recycling economic model, which contributes to the efficient use of brines for potash and Li2CO3 development and CO2 emission reduction. This article reviews the genesis of brines and highlights new utilization techniques, trends, and sustainable development.", "generated_text": "This study provides a comprehensive overview of the genesis of brine and its sustainable resource recovery from salt lakes worldwide. Brine, a highly concentrated solution of salts, is a critical resource for the extraction of valuable minerals such as potash and lithium. The formation of brine is influenced by geological, climatic, and hydrological factors, leading to diverse compositions and concentrations. Advanced processing techniques, including solar evaporation, ion exchange, and membrane filtration, have been developed to enhance the recovery efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. The comprehensive utilization of brine not only supports the production of essential minerals but also contributes to the development of a circular economy by minimizing waste and maximizing resource efficiency. Case studies from major salt lake regions, such as the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia and the Qaidam Basin in China, illustrate the potential and challenges of sustainable brine resource management. This research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in optimizing brine utilization and ensuring long-term environmental sustainability.", "label": 1}
