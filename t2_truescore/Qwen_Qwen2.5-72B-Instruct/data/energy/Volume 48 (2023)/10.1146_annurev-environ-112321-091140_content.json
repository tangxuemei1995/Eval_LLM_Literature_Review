{"grounding": "Renewable electricity generation will need to be rapidly scaled to address climate change and other environmental challenges. Doing so effectively will require an understanding of resource availability. We review estimates for renewable electricity of the global technical potential, defined as the amount of electricity that could be produced with current technologies when accounting for geographical and technical limitations as well as conversion efficiencies; economic potential, which also includes cost; and feasible potential, which accounts for societal and environmental constraints. We consider utility-scale and rooftop solar photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind, hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean (wave, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion, and salinity gradient energy) technologies. We find that the reported technical potential for each energy resource ranges over several orders of magnitude across and often within technologies. Therefore, we also discuss the main factors explaining why authors find such different results. According to this review and on the basis of the most robust studies, we find that technical potentials for utility-scale solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore wind, and offshore wind are above 100 PWh/year. Hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean thermal energy conversion have technical potentials above 10 PWh/year. Rooftop solar photovoltaic, wave, and tidal have technical potentials above 1 PWh/year. Salinity gradient has a technical potential above 0.1 PWh/year. The literature assessing the global economic potential of renewables, which considers the cost of each renewable resource, shows that the economic potential is higher than current and near-future electricity demand. Fewer studies have calculated the global feasible potential, which considers societal and environmental constraints. While these ranges are useful for assessing the magnitude of available energy sources, they may omit challenges for large-scale renewable portfolios.", "generated_text": "This study assesses the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity from solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. The technical potential, defined as the maximum achievable energy generation based on resource availability and technological constraints, is estimated using high-resolution spatial data and advanced modeling techniques. Results indicate that the global technical potential for renewable electricity is vast, with solar PV and wind energy leading the way due to their widespread resource availability and rapidly declining costs. The economic potential, which considers the cost-effectiveness of renewable technologies relative to conventional energy sources, is analyzed through a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, incorporating factors such as capital and operational costs, subsidies, and carbon pricing. The findings suggest that a significant portion of the technical potential is economically viable, particularly in regions with high insolation and wind speeds, and where fossil fuel subsidies are being phased out. The feasible potential, which accounts for additional constraints such as environmental, social, and grid integration challenges, is evaluated through a multi-criteria decision analysis. This analysis reveals that while the technical and economic potentials are substantial, the feasible potential is more limited due to factors like land use conflicts, grid stability issues, and regulatory barriers. However, strategic policy interventions and technological advancements can significantly enhance the feasible potential, paving the way for a sustainable and resilient global energy system. The study underscores the critical role of renewable energy in achieving global climate targets and energy security, while highlighting the need for integrated planning and international cooperation to overcome existing barriers.", "label": 0}
