{"grounding": "Some assert that noise (i.e., unwanted variance) is the most neglected yet most important source of error in judgment. We suggest that this problem was discovered nearly 100 years ago in the area of personnel selection and that a century of selection research has shown that noise can be demonstrably reduced by structuring the process (i.e., decomposing the component parts, agreeing on standards, and applying those standards consistently) and by aggregating judgments independently. Algorithms can aid significantly in this process but are often confused with methods that, in their current form, can substantially increase noise in judgment (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning).", "generated_text": "This paper synthesizes a century of research on personnel selection to explore how reducing noise\u2014unwanted variance in judgments\u2014can improve workplace decision-making. By examining the sources and impacts of noise in selection processes, we highlight strategies to enhance the reliability and validity of judgments. Key findings include the effectiveness of structured interviews, standardized assessments, and data-driven forecasting methods. These approaches not only minimize noise but also support more strategic and equitable hiring practices. Implications for organizational strategy and future research directions are discussed.", "label": 1}
