{"grounding": "Over the past decade, hundreds of studies have been published on employee voice and silence. In this review, I summarize that body of work, with an emphasis on the progress that has been made in our understanding of when and why employees choose to speak up or remain silent, as well as the individual and organizational implications of these choices. I identify underexplored issues, limitations in how voice has been conceptualized and studied, and promising avenues for future research. Although there has been notable progress in our knowledge of voice and silence, numerous key questions remain, and there are opportunities for the literature on voice to adopt a broader view of that construct. One of the objectives of this review is to motivate and guide research that will address those questions and explore that broader view.", "generated_text": "This paper revisits the literature on employee voice and silence, providing a comprehensive review a decade after the initial surge of research in this area. We synthesize findings from over 100 studies, highlighting the critical role of upward communication and proactive behavior in organizational settings. The review identifies key antecedents and outcomes of employee voice, such as leadership support, psychological safety, and organizational performance. Conversely, the detrimental effects of employee silence on information sharing and innovation are underscored. The paper also discusses methodological advancements and calls for future research to explore the contextual factors that influence voice and silence, particularly in diverse and dynamic work environments. Practical implications for managers and organizations are outlined, emphasizing the importance of fostering a culture that encourages open communication and active participation.", "label": 1}
