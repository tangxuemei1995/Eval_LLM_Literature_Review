{"grounding": "Technology has changed the way that organizational researchers obtain participants for their research studies. Although technology has facilitated the collection of large quantities of data through online platforms, it has also highlighted potential data quality issues for many of our samples. In this article, we review different sampling techniques, including convenience, purposive, probability-based, and snowball sampling. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each approach to help organizational researchers choose the most appropriate sampling techniques for their research questions. We identify best practices that researchers can use to improve the quality of their samples, including reviewing screening techniques to increase the quality of online sampling. Finally, as part of our review we examined the sampling procedures of all empirical research articles published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in the past 5 years, and we use observations from these results to make conclusions about the lack of methodological and sample diversity in organizational research, the overreliance on a few sampling techniques, the need to report key aspects of sampling, and concerns about participant quality.", "generated_text": "This paper explores recent advancements in sampling techniques aimed at enhancing the appropriateness and quality of samples in organizational research. Traditional sampling methods often face challenges such as insufficient effort responding and participant dishonesty, which can significantly undermine the validity and reliability of research findings. We review innovative approaches, including the use of online samples, algorithmic screening, and behavioral validation techniques, to mitigate these issues. The integration of machine learning algorithms in the sampling process is highlighted for its potential to identify and exclude low-effort or dishonest responses. Additionally, the paper discusses the ethical considerations and practical implications of adopting these new methods. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates that these innovations can lead to more representative and high-quality samples, ultimately improving the robustness of organizational research. The findings suggest that researchers should consider these advanced sampling techniques to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of their studies.", "label": 1}
