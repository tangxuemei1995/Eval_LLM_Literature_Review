{"grounding": "Individual and team creativity and innovation are essential for organizational effectiveness and success. The typology we developed in 2014 has stimulated much research in the past decade. We review this body of work and structure our article around the four quadrants described in our typology. We then revisit and update the eight research recommendations we proposed previously, identifying rich opportunities for developing theory and conceiving empirical studies. Finally, we highlight four desirable directions that help to chart the path for conducting frame-breaking research and accelerating theoretical breakthroughs.\n", "generated_text": "This paper reviews the current understanding of the dynamic interplay between actors and contexts in fostering creativity and innovation. It highlights the importance of person-situation and team-situation interactions, emphasizing how individual and collective attributes influence creative outcomes in various settings. The review identifies gaps in existing research and suggests future directions, including the need for more longitudinal studies and the integration of multidisciplinary perspectives to better capture the complexity of creative processes.", "label": 0}
