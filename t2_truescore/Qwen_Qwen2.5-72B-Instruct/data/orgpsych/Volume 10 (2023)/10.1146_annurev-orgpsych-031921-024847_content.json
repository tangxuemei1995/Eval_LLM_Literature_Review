{"grounding": "Emerging from distinct perspectives, decent work and meaningful work are fundamental aspects of contemporary work with profound implications for individuals, organizations, and society. Decent work reflects basic workplace conditions to which all employees are entitled, whereas meaningful work is aspirational, reflecting significance at work. Following a conceptual and empirical review of scholarship on decent work and meaningful work, we draw from psychology of working theory to connect the two constructs. We argue that need satisfaction serves as the primary connector, and societal context, organizational conditions, and individual practices (in order of effectiveness) promote access to each type of work. We suggest future research directions broadening the available scholarship and methods used, promoting a focus on the complex intersection of macrolevel and psychological factors as well as interdisciplinary approaches in determining the quality of work, and engaging in intervention research to improve the way in which people live and work together.", "generated_text": "This study explores the interplay between decent work and meaningful work, two critical concepts in the psychology of working. Decent work, characterized by fair income, security, and safe working conditions, is often seen as a prerequisite for meaningful work, which encompasses the personal significance and fulfillment individuals derive from their jobs. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this paper examines how job design and work conditions influence the perception of meaningfulness in the workplace. The findings suggest that while decent work provides the foundational elements necessary for a positive work environment, meaningful work is achieved through a combination of personal values, job autonomy, and social connections at work. The implications of these findings highlight the importance of integrating both decent and meaningful work principles in organizational practices to enhance employee well-being and organizational performance.", "label": 1}
