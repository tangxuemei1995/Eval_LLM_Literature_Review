{"grounding": "Environmental sustainability has become an ethical and strategic imperative for organizations, and more and more employees are interested, encouraged, or instructed to act in environmentally sustainable ways. Consequently, organizational scholars have increasingly studied individual-level antecedents of employee pro-environmental or employee green behavior (EGB). We argue that, to advance this literature and to inform effective interventions, research should investigate how EGB, as a compound performance domain, is associated with antecedents and consequences at multiple levels (i.e., individual, team, work context, organization, society). Accordingly, we pursue three interrelated goals with this review. We first present a comprehensive review of research on EGB, including definitions, theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. Second, we develop an integrative conceptual model of EGB as the core of organizational environmental sustainability. Third, we conclude with recommendations for future theory development and methodological improvements, as well as practical implications for employees, leaders, and human resource management.", "generated_text": "This study explores the pivotal role of employee green behavior in fostering environmentally sustainable organizations. By integrating insights from environmental psychology and organizational behavior, the research examines how individual actions and attitudes contribute to broader ecological goals. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that pro-environmental behavior among employees is significantly influenced by organizational culture, leadership, and the availability of sustainable practices. The findings suggest that fostering a culture of ecological awareness and providing resources for sustainable actions can enhance employee engagement and commitment to environmental sustainability. The study also highlights the importance of aligning individual and organizational values to promote long-term environmental stewardship. Practical recommendations for organizations include implementing green policies, offering training on sustainable practices, and recognizing and rewarding pro-environmental behaviors. This research underscores the critical link between employee green behavior and the achievement of environmental sustainability goals in the workplace.", "label": 1}
