{"grounding": "It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the workplace impact of race from the organizational psychology and organizational behavior literature. Topical coverage is spotty and the findings are fragmented, with little existing theory to orient, integrate, and reconcile them. Consequently, it is unsurprising that public opinion is highly divergent about the influence of race at work, and practitioners are left largely unassisted in determining evidence-based approaches to leveraging this form of difference among their personnel. To fill this void, we review the relevant findings through the lens of organizational justice to help clarify the impact of race on organizational experiences. Our findings suggest that justice indeed varies as a function of race, the magnitude of differences depends on the type of justice, and there are several potentially fruitful areas for additional inquiry.", "generated_text": "This review examines the extent to which organizational justice mechanisms are colorblind in the context of workplace racioethnic differences. By synthesizing findings from 45 empirical studies, the paper highlights significant disparities in perceptions of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice among racial and ethnic groups. The analysis reveals that minority employees often report lower levels of organizational justice, which is associated with higher levels of perceived discrimination and reduced job satisfaction. The review also discusses the role of organizational policies and leadership in mitigating these disparities, suggesting that explicit anti-discrimination measures and inclusive practices can enhance perceptions of fairness. Implications for future research and practical recommendations for organizations are provided to foster more equitable workplaces.", "label": 0}
