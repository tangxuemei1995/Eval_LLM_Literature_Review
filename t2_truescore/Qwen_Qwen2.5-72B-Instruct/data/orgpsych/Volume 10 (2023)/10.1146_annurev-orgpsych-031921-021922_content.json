{"grounding": "Meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for integrating findings from the research literature and building statistical models to explore trends and inconsistencies in the research base. Meta-analysis starts with a process for translating results from each study into an effect size that represents all findings in a common metric. Statistical models are then applied to estimate the mean, variance, and moderators of effect size. This article explores several key decision points in conducting a meta-analysis, including issues in obtaining a common metric, accounting for psychometric artifacts, and choosing an appropriate statistical model. It provides recommendations for choosing among alternate approaches and reporting results to ensure transparency.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the methodological options available for conducting meta-analysis in organizational research. It discusses the importance of validity generalization and the correction for psychometric artifacts in estimating effect sizes. The paper reviews various techniques for research synthesis, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. It also offers practical recommendations for researchers to enhance the rigor and transparency of their meta-analytic studies, ensuring robust and reliable findings that can inform theory and practice in the field.", "label": 1}
