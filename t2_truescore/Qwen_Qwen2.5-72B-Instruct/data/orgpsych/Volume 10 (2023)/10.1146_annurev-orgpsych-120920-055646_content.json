{"grounding": "We review the research on the psychology of entrepreneurship of the last decade. We focus on two key topics in entrepreneurship research: action and process. Combining action and process in a model of the psychology of entrepreneurship, we present the action theory process model of entrepreneurship and use it as a guiding framework for the review. We discuss theories of action, such as effectuation/causation, bricolage, theory of planned behavior, and action theory. Furthermore, we adopt a process perspective to discuss antecedents of actions in terms of cognition, motivation, and emotion and how they develop during the entrepreneurial process. The process perspective considers recursive relationships and dynamic changes in actions and their antecedents over time. We conclude that the action theory process model is a useful starting point to explain the psychological dynamics of entrepreneurship.", "generated_text": "This study explores the psychological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, focusing on the interplay between action and process. Utilizing action theory, bricolage, and effectuation, we examine how entrepreneurs' cognitive processes, motivations, and emotions influence their decision-making and resource allocation. The findings reveal that entrepreneurial action is often driven by a combination of opportunity recognition, resource leveraging, and emotional resilience. Entrepreneurs who adopt an effectual logic tend to be more adaptive and resourceful, leveraging available means to pursue opportunities. Moreover, the study highlights the role of positive emotions in sustaining motivation and fostering creative problem-solving. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms that underpin successful entrepreneurial ventures.", "label": 1}
