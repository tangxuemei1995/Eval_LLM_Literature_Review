{"grounding": "The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) has grown substantially over the past 40 years within organizational research and beyond. There have been many different developments in SEM that make it increasingly useful for a variety of data types, research designs, research questions, and research contexts in the organizational sciences. To give researchers a better understanding of how and why SEM is used, our article (a) presents a review of SEM applications within organizational research; (b) discusses SEM best practices; and (c) explores advanced SEM applications, including instrumental variable methods, latent variable interactions and nonlinear measurement models, multilevel SEM, cross-lagged panel models and dynamic structural equation models, and meta-analytic SEM. We conclude by discussing concerns and debates that are both methodological (i.e., cross-validation and regularization) and theoretical (i.e., understanding causal evidence) as they relate to SEM and its application in organizational research and beyond.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews the current state of structural equation modeling (SEM) in organizational research, highlighting its role in advancing our understanding of complex relationships among latent variables. We examine the prevalence and quality of SEM applications, focusing on issues such as model fit, latent interactions, and the integration of longitudinal data. Despite its widespread use, challenges remain, including the need for more rigorous model testing and the incorporation of advanced techniques to address non-linear relationships. We propose several strategies to enhance the robustness and validity of SEM in future research, such as the adoption of Bayesian methods and the development of more sophisticated measurement models. These recommendations aim to ensure that SEM continues to serve as a powerful tool for advancing organizational science.", "label": 1}
