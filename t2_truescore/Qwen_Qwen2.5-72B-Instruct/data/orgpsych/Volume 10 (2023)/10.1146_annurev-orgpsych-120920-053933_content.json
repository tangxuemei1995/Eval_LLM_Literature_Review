{"grounding": "Burnout refers to a work-related state of exhaustion and a sense of cynicism. In contrast, work engagement is a positive motivational state of vigor, dedication, and absorption. In this article, we discuss the concepts of burnout and work engagement and review their antecedents and consequences. We look back at our inaugural Annual Reviews article (Bakker et al. 2014) and highlight new empirical findings and theoretical innovations in relationship to job demands\u2013resources (JD-R) theory. We discuss four major innovations of the past decade, namely (a) the person \u00d7 situation approach of JD-R, (b) multilevel JD-R theory, (c) new proactive approaches in JD-R theory, and (d) the work\u2013home resources model. After discussing practical implications, we elaborate on more opportunities for future research, including JD-R interventions, team-level approaches, and demands and resources from other life domains.", "generated_text": "This review revisits the Job Demands\u2013Resources (JD-R) theory a decade after its initial formulation, synthesizing recent advancements and empirical findings. The JD-R theory posits that job demands and resources are key determinants of burnout and work engagement. Over the past ten years, research has expanded to include a broader range of job demands and resources, as well as their dynamic interplay. Studies have consistently shown that job resources can buffer the negative effects of job demands on burnout and enhance work engagement. Moreover, the role of proactive work behavior in shaping job conditions and outcomes has gained attention. This review highlights the importance of job design in fostering a positive work environment and suggests avenues for future research, including the integration of individual differences and contextual factors.", "label": 1}
