{"grounding": "With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the development and implementation of digital food systems are becoming increasingly possible. There is tremendous interest in using different AI applications, such as machine learning models, natural language processing, and computer vision to improve food safety. Possible AI applications are broad and include, but are not limited to, (a) food safety risk prediction and monitoring as well as food safety optimization throughout the supply chain, (b) improved public health systems (e.g., by providing early warning of outbreaks and source attribution), and (c) detection, identification, and characterization of foodborne pathogens. However, AI technologies in food safety lag behind in commercial development because of obstacles such as limited data sharing and limited collaborative research and development efforts. Future actions should be directed toward applying data privacy protection methods, improving data standardization, and developing a collaborative ecosystem to drive innovations in AI applications to food safety.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing food safety across the supply chain. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision, AI can detect contaminants and predict potential hazards with greater accuracy and speed than traditional methods. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and anomalies, enabling predictive analytics that can forecast foodborne illness outbreaks and contamination risks. Additionally, computer vision technologies can inspect food products for physical and chemical contaminants, ensuring compliance with public health standards. The integration of these AI tools not only improves the efficiency and reliability of food safety monitoring but also enhances the overall resilience of the food supply chain, ultimately protecting consumer health and reducing economic losses.", "label": 1}
