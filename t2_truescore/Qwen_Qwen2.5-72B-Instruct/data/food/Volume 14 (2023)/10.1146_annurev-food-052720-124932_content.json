{"grounding": "Meats are rich in lipids and proteins, exposing them to rapid oxidative changes. Proteins are essential to the human diet, and changes in the structure and functional attributes can greatly influence the quality and nutritional value of meats. In this article, we review the molecular changes of proteins during processing, their impact on the nutritional value of fresh and processed meat, the digestibility and bioavailability of meat proteins, the risks associated with high meat intake, and the preventive strategies employed to mitigate these risks. This information provides new research directions to reduce or prevent oxidative processes that influence the quality and nutritional values of meat.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the molecular changes in meat proteins during various processing techniques and their subsequent effects on the quality and nutritional value of meat products. Key findings reveal that thermal processing, such as cooking and pasteurization, can lead to protein denaturation and aggregation, which may alter texture and reduce digestibility. Additionally, the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) during processing is linked to potential health risks, including increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Understanding these molecular transformations is crucial for optimizing processing methods to enhance the nutritional profile and safety of meat products.", "label": 1}
