{"grounding": "Microbubbles are largely unused in the food industry yet have promising capabilities as environmentally friendly cleaning and supporting agents within products and production lines due to their unique physical behaviors. Their small diameters increase their dispersion throughout liquid materials, promote reactivity because of their high specific surface area, enhance dissolution of gases into the surrounding liquid phase, and promote the generation of reactive chemical species. This article reviews techniques to generate microbubbles, their modes of action to enhance cleaning and disinfection, their contributions to functional and mechanical properties of food materials, and their use in supporting the growth of living organisms in hydroponics or bioreactors. The utility and diverse applications of microbubbles, combined with their low intrinsic ingredient cost, strongly encourage their increased adoption within the food industry in coming years.", "generated_text": "This review explores the application of microbubbles in food technology, emphasizing their role in enhancing sustainability, food safety, and security. Microbubbles, due to their unique properties such as high surface area and low buoyancy, offer innovative solutions in food processing, including improved mass transfer, enhanced cleaning and disinfection, and efficient ingredient delivery. Recent studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing water and energy consumption, minimizing the use of chemical additives, and extending the shelf life of food products. The integration of microbubble technology in the production of novel foods also holds promise for developing healthier and more sustainable food options. This paper discusses the current state of research, potential applications, and future directions for microbubble technology in the food industry, highlighting its potential to address global food challenges.", "label": 1}
