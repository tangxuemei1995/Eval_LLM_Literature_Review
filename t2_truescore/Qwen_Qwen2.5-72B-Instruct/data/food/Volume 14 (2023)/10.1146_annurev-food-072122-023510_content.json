{"grounding": "Starch is one of the most abundant renewable biopolymers in nature and is the main constituent in the human diet and a raw material for the food industry. Native starches are limited in most industrial applications and often tailored by structural modification to enhance desirable attributes, minimize undesirable attributes, or create new attributes. Enzymatic approaches for structuring starch have become of interest to the food industry precisely because the reactions minimize the formation of undesirable by-products and coproducts and are therefore considered environmentally friendly methods for producing clean-label starches with better behavioral characteristics. Starches with improved functionalities for various applications are produced via enzyme hydrolysis and transfer reactions. Use of novel, multifunctional, starch-active enzymes to alter the structures of amylose and/or amylopectin molecules, and thus alter the starch's physiochemical attributes in a predictable and controllable manner, has been explored. This review provides state-of-the-art information on exploiting glycosyl transferases and glycosyl hydrolases for structuring starch to improve its functionalities. The characteristics of starch-active enzymes (including branching enzymes, amylomaltases, GH70 \u03b1-transglycosylases, amylosucrases, maltogenic amylases, cyclomaltodextrinases, neopullulanases, and maltooligosaccharide-forming amylases), structure\u2013functionality-driven processing strategies, novel conversion products, and potential industrial applications are discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the enzymatic approaches for structuring starch to enhance its functionality, focusing on the relationship between molecular structure and performance. Enzymatic modification, including branching, debranching, and transglycosylation, was employed to alter the starch structure, leading to improved properties such as solubility, gel strength, and thermal stability. The enzymatic strategies were tailored to specific applications, such as food processing, pharmaceuticals, and bioplastics. The results demonstrated that precise control over the enzymatic reactions can significantly influence the starch's molecular architecture, thereby optimizing its functional attributes. For instance, the use of specific isoamylase enzymes led to the production of starch with enhanced gelatinization properties, suitable for thickening and binding in food products. Similarly, the application of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase resulted in starch derivatives with improved solubility and emulsifying properties, beneficial for pharmaceutical formulations. The study underscores the potential of enzymatic approaches in tailoring starch for a wide range of industrial applications, highlighting the importance of understanding the structure-function relationship in starch modification.", "label": 1}
