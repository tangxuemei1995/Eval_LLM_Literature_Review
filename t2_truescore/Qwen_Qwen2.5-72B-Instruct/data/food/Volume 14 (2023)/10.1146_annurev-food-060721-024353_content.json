{"grounding": "Lipids are a large group of essential nutrients in daily diets that provide energy and maintain various physiological functions. As the global population is rapidly expanding, there is an urgent need to enhance the production and quality of food lipids. The development of modern biotechnology allows the manipulation of oil production in plants and microorganisms and the improvement of the nutritional value of food lipids. Various metabolic engineering strategies have been exploited to increase oil production and produce value-added oils in traditional oil crops and other novel lipid sources (e.g., plant vegetative tissues, microalgae, and oleaginous microorganisms). Furthermore, natural lipid structures can be modified by lipases to prepare functional lipids, e.g., diacylglycerols, medium\u2013long\u2013medium-type structured triacylglycerols, human milk-fat substitutes, and structuralphospholipids, for specific nutritional demands. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in metabolic engineering of lipid production in plants and microorganisms, and the preparation of functional lipids via biocatalysis.", "generated_text": "The integration of biotechnology in the production of future food lipids presents a promising avenue for addressing global nutritional and sustainability challenges. This review highlights the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of microbial lipids, metabolic engineering, enzymatic modification, and the production of structural and phospholipids. Microbial lipids, derived from fungi, algae, and bacteria, offer a sustainable alternative to traditional plant and animal sources, with the potential for tailored fatty acid profiles. Metabolic engineering has enabled the optimization of microbial strains to enhance lipid yield and quality, while enzymatic modification techniques allow for the precise alteration of lipid structures to improve functional properties. However, scaling up production processes, ensuring cost-effectiveness, and meeting regulatory standards remain significant hurdles. The development of novel phospholipids and structural lipids through biotechnological approaches also holds promise for enhancing the nutritional value and stability of food products. This review discusses the current state of research, technological advancements, and future directions in the biotechnological production of food lipids.", "label": 1}
