{"grounding": "Edible nanoparticles are being developed for the oral delivery of nutrients to improve human health and well-being. Because of the extremely demanding conditions foods experience within the gastrointestinal tract, fundamental knowledge about the biological fate of encapsulated nutrients must be constantly revised. In this review, we first provide an overview of the fundamental absorption pathways of ingested foods and then discuss the evaluation models available to test and predict the biological fate of nutrient-loaded nanoparticles. Then, owing to their importance for human health, the impacts of nanoparticles on the gut microbiota are evaluated. Lastly, the limitations of current evaluation methods are highlighted and future research directions on the study and application of edible nanoparticles for the oral delivery of bioactive food compounds are discussed.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive review explores the application of nanoparticles in food for oral delivery, focusing on their biological fate, evaluation models, and interactions with gut microbiota. Nanoparticles offer enhanced bioavailability and controlled release of bioactive compounds, but their safety and efficacy depend on understanding their behavior within the gastrointestinal tract. The review discusses various evaluation models, including in vitro and in vivo systems, to assess nanoparticle stability, absorption, and potential toxicity. Additionally, the influence of gut microbiota on nanoparticle fate and the reciprocal effects of nanoparticles on microbial communities are examined. This knowledge is crucial for developing safe and effective nanoparticle-based food products that can deliver health benefits while minimizing adverse effects.", "label": 1}
