{"grounding": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides are of particular interest in recent years because of their unique prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. Among different types of strategies for the production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, enzymatic methods are preferred owing to the predictability and controllability of the structure and composition of the reaction products. Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have been proved to show excellent prebiotic effects as well as other benefits to intestinal health. They have exhibited great application potential as functional food ingredients for various food products with improved quality and physicochemical characteristics. This article reviews the research progress on the enzymatic production of several typical nondigestible functional oligosaccharides in the food industry, including galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, chito-oligosaccharides, and human milk oligosaccharides. Moreover, their physicochemical properties and prebiotic activities are discussed as well as their contributions to intestinal health and applications in foods.", "generated_text": "This review focuses on the enzymatic production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides and their applications in food to promote intestinal health. Functional oligosaccharides, recognized for their prebiotic effects, are increasingly being incorporated into food products to enhance gut microbiota and support overall health. The enzymatic synthesis of these oligosaccharides offers a sustainable and efficient method to produce a diverse range of prebiotics, including galacto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, and xylo-oligosaccharides. The review discusses the enzymatic processes, including the selection of appropriate enzymes and substrates, and the optimization of reaction conditions to achieve high yields and purity. Additionally, the prebiotic effects of these oligosaccharides on the intestinal microbiota, such as the promotion of beneficial bacteria and the inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, are highlighted. The potential of these functional oligosaccharides in various food applications, including dairy products, cereals, and beverages, is also explored, emphasizing their role in developing functional foods that support intestinal health.", "label": 1}
