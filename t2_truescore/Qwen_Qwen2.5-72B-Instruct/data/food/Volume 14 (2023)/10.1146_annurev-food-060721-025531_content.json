{"grounding": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a bioactive phytochemical abundant in cruciferous vegetables. One of its main in vivo metabolites is 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM), formed by the condensation of two molecules of I3C. Both I3C and DIM alter multiple signaling pathways and related molecules controlling diverse cellular events, including oxidation, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity. There is a growing body of evidence from both in vitro and in vivo models that these compounds possess strong potential to prevent several forms of chronic disease such as inflammation, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, neurodegenerative diseases, and osteoporosis. This article reviews current knowledge of the occurrence of I3C in nature and foods, along with the beneficial effects of I3C and DIM concerning prevention and treatment of human chronic diseases, focusing on preclinical studies and their mechanisms of action at cellular and molecular levels.", "generated_text": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables, has garnered attention for its potential health benefits. This review summarizes the occurrence of I3C in dietary sources and its bioactive metabolite, 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM). Studies have shown that I3C and DIM exhibit anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which are attributed to their ability to modulate key cellular and molecular pathways. These include the regulation of phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes, modulation of estrogen metabolism, and inhibition of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, I3C and DIM have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying the health-beneficial properties of I3C and DIM, highlighting their potential as dietary supplements and therapeutic agents.", "label": 1}
