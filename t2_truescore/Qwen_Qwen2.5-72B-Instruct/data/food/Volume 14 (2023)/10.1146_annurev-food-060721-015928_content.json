{"grounding": "Bacteriophages (or phages) represent one of the most persistent threats to food fermentations, particularly large-scale commercial dairy fermentations. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are used as starter cultures in dairy fermentations are well studied, and in recent years there have been significant advances in defining the driving forces of LAB\u2013phage coevolution. The means by which different starter bacterial species defend themselves against phage predation and the chromosomal or plasmid location of the genes encoding these defense mechanisms have dictated the technological approaches for the development of robust starter cultures. In this review, we highlight recent advances in defining phage\u2013host interactions and how phage resistance occurs in different bacterial species. Furthermore, we discuss how these insights continue to transform the dairy fermentation industry and how they also are anticipated to guide food fermentations involving plant-based alternatives in the future.", "generated_text": "Bacteriophages pose a significant threat to the efficiency and quality of dairy fermentations, particularly in cheese and yogurt production. This review examines the current understanding of phage\u2013host interactions and the mechanisms by which dairy bacteria develop phage resistance. Recent studies highlight the role of CRISPR-Cas systems and abortive infection strategies in conferring resistance, while also exploring the potential for conjugation to spread resistance genes among bacterial populations. Despite these advancements, the dynamic nature of phage populations necessitates ongoing research to develop robust strategies for phage control. The integration of molecular biology and traditional fermentation practices offers promising solutions to mitigate the impact of bacteriophages, ensuring the sustainability and quality of dairy products.", "label": 1}
