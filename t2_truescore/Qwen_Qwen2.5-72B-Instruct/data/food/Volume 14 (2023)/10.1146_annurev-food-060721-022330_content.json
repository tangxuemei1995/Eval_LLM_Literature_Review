{"grounding": "Mechano-bactericidal (MB) nanopatterns have the ability to inactivate bacterial cells by rupturing cellular envelopes. Such biocide-free, physicomechanical mechanisms may confer lasting biofilm mitigation capability to various materials encountered in food processing, packaging, and food preparation environments. In this review, we first discuss recent progress on elucidating MB mechanisms, unraveling property\u2013activity relationships, and developing cost-effective and scalable nanofabrication technologies. Next, we evaluate the potential challenges that MB surfaces may face in food-related applications and provide our perspective on the critical research needs and opportunities to facilitate their adoption in the food industry.", "generated_text": "This review explores the mechanisms, nanofabrication techniques, and potential applications of mechano-bactericidal surfaces in food processing and packaging. These surfaces, engineered to physically disrupt bacterial cell walls, offer a promising alternative to chemical antimicrobials. Advanced nanofabrication methods, such as lithography and etching, enable the creation of micro- and nano-scale topographies that enhance bactericidal efficiency. The integration of these surfaces into food-contact materials can significantly reduce microbial contamination, improving food safety and shelf life. Future prospects include optimizing surface designs and scaling up production for industrial use.", "label": 1}
