{"grounding": "Food proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols are natural ingredients with different functional attributes. For instance, many proteins are good emulsifiers and gelling agents, many polysaccharides are good thickening and stabilizing agents, and many polyphenols are good antioxidants and antimicrobials. These three kinds of ingredients can be combined into protein, polysaccharide, and/or polyphenol conjugates or complexes using covalent or noncovalent interactions to create novel multifunctional colloidal ingredients with new or improved properties. In this review, the formation, functionality, and potential applications of protein conjugates and complexes are discussed. In particular, the utilization of these colloidal ingredients to stabilize emulsions, control lipid digestion, encapsulate bioactive ingredients, modify textures, and form films is highlighted. Finally, future research needs in this area are briefly proposed. The rational design of protein complexes and conjugates may lead to the development of new functional ingredients that can be used to create more nutritious, sustainable, and healthy foods.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development and characterization of novel colloidal food ingredients through the formation of protein complexes and conjugates with polysaccharides and polyphenols. The interaction between these biomolecules was investigated using advanced spectroscopic and microscopic techniques to elucidate the structural and functional properties of the complexes. The results demonstrate that the formation of protein-polysaccharide and protein-polyphenol conjugates significantly enhances the stability, solubility, and emulsifying properties of the colloidal systems. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of innovative food ingredients with improved functional attributes, contributing to the advancement of food science and technology. The potential applications of these complexes in food formulations, such as beverages, sauces, and emulsions, are discussed, highlighting their role in enhancing product quality and consumer acceptability.", "label": 0}
