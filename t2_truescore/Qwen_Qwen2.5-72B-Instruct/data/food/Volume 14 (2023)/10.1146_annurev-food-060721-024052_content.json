{"grounding": "With the rising problems of food shortages, energy costs, and raw materials, the food industry must reduce its environmental impact. We present an overview of more resource-efficient processes to produce food ingredients, describing their environmental impact and the functional properties obtained. Extensive wet processing yields high purities but also has the highest environmental impact, mainly due to heating for protein precipitation and dehydration. Milder wet alternatives exclude, for example, low pH\u2013driven separation and are based on salt precipitation or water only. Drying steps are omitted during dry fractionation using air classification or electrostatic separation. Benefits of milder methods are enhanced functional properties. Therefore, fractionation and formulation should be focused on the desired functionality instead of purity. Environmental impact is also strongly reduced by milder refining. Antinutritional factors and off-flavors remain challenges in more mildly produced ingredients. The benefits of less refining motivate the increasing trend toward mildly refined ingredients.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of mild fractionation techniques, including dry fractionation and mild wet separation, to enhance the sustainability and functionality of plant-based food ingredients. By optimizing these processes, the research aims to improve resource use efficiency and reduce environmental impacts associated with traditional food processing methods. The results indicate that mild fractionation can effectively isolate high-quality plant proteins while preserving their functional properties, such as solubility and emulsification. This approach not only minimizes energy consumption and water usage but also reduces waste generation, making it a promising strategy for the development of more sustainable food ingredients. The findings highlight the potential of mild fractionation to support the growing demand for plant-based products in a resource-efficient manner.", "label": 0}
