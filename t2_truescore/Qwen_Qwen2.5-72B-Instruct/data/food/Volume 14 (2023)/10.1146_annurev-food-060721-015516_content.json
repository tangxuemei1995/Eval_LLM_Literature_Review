{"grounding": "Inadequate dietary fiber consumption has become common across industrialized nations, accompanied by changes in gut microbial composition and a dramatic increase in chronic metabolic diseases. The human gut microbiome harbors genes that are required for the digestion of fiber, resulting in the production of end products that mediate gastrointestinal and systemic benefits to the host. Thus, the use of fiber interventions has attracted increasing interest as a strategy to modulate the gut microbiome and improve human health. However, considerable interindividual differences in gut microbial composition have resulted in variable responses toward fiber interventions. This variability has led to observed nonresponder individuals and highlights the need for personalized approaches to effectively redirect the gut ecosystem. In this review, we summarize strategies used to address the responder and nonresponder phenomenon in dietary fiber interventions and propose a targeted approach to identify predictive features based on knowledge of fiber metabolism and machine learning approaches.", "generated_text": "Dietary fiber interventions hold significant promise for modulating the gut microbiome to improve health outcomes, yet individual responses to these interventions are highly variable. This study explores the potential of precision nutrition approaches to predict and optimize personalized responses to dietary fiber. By integrating data on gut microbial composition, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and host genetic factors, we identify key biomarkers that correlate with favorable outcomes following prebiotic supplementation. Our findings suggest that the presence of specific microbial taxa and CAZyme profiles can serve as predictive indicators of an individual's response to dietary fiber. These insights pave the way for tailored nutritional strategies that enhance the efficacy of fiber interventions, ultimately contributing to the prevention and management of chronic diseases. The study underscores the importance of a holistic, personalized approach to nutrition in the context of gut microbiome modulation.", "label": 1}
