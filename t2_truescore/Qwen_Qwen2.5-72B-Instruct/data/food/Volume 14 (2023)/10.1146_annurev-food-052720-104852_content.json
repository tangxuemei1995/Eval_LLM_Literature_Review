{"grounding": "In contrast to traditional breeding, which relies on the identification of mutants, metabolic engineering provides a new platform to modify the oil composition in oil crops for improved nutrition. By altering endogenous genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways, it is possible to modify edible plant oils to increase the content of desired components or reduce the content of undesirable components. However, introduction of novel nutritional components such as omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids needs transgenic expression of novel genes in crops. Despite formidable challenges, significant progress in engineering nutritionally improved edible plant oils has recently been achieved, with some commercial products now on the market.", "generated_text": "Metabolic engineering and gene editing techniques have been employed to enhance the nutritional profile of edible plant oils. This study focuses on the development of oils with increased levels of high oleic acids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E. Through targeted modifications in seed oil biosynthesis pathways, we have successfully produced oils with significantly improved nutritional qualities. These advancements not only enhance the health benefits of plant oils but also offer sustainable alternatives to traditional sources of essential nutrients.", "label": 1}
