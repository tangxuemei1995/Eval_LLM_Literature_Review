{"grounding": "Ferritins represent a class of iron storage proteins with detoxification functions. The importance of these proteins is reflected by their wide distribution throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. Ferritin has two forms: holo and apo. Holo ferritin can act as an efficient and safe factor for iron supplementation, whereas apo ferritin is able to serve as a promising delivery nanovehicle for nutrients and bioactive compounds. So far, the dual functions of ferritins from animal and plant sources have been extensively studied in several fields, such as food, nutrition, medicine, and materials. This review outlines the structure of animal and plant ferritin, the iron supplementation function of holo ferritin, and the delivery function of apo ferritin. Recent advances in iron supplementation and nutrient encapsulation and delivery are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future developments for multifunctional applications of ferritins are discussed.", "generated_text": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous iron storage protein, exists in two primary forms: holo ferritin, which is saturated with iron, and apo ferritin, which is iron-free. This review explores the dual functionality of ferritin in both animal and plant systems, highlighting its potential in iron supplementation and as a delivery vehicle. Holo ferritin, rich in iron, is essential for addressing iron deficiency, a prevalent nutritional disorder. Conversely, apo ferritin's hollow structure and biocompatibility make it an ideal candidate for targeted drug delivery and nanotechnology applications. Studies in both animal and plant models demonstrate the efficacy of ferritin in enhancing iron bioavailability and as a versatile carrier for therapeutic agents. This dual role underscores the significance of ferritin in both nutritional and biomedical contexts, offering promising avenues for future research and application.", "label": 1}
