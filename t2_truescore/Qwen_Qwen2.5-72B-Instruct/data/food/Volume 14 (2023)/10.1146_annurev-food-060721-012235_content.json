{"grounding": "The in vitro digestion model developed by the INFOGEST international consortium is widely used to simulate the physicochemical processes occurring inside the human gastrointestinal tract (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) during the digestion of foods. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the INFOGEST method and the procedures used to measure the digestion of macronutrients (lipids, proteins, and starch), the bioaccessibility of bioactive agents (vitamins, minerals, and nutraceuticals), and the changes in the structure and physical properties of foods under gastrointestinal conditions (particle size, charge, and location). We then review the application of the INFOGEST method for monitoring the gastrointestinal fate of different kinds of foods and beverages, including dairy, egg, meat, seafood, fruit, vegetable, cereal, and emulsified products. We also discuss the application of this method for studying the digestibility of next-generation plant-based foods, such as meat, seafood, dairy, and egg analogs. Finally, the benefits and limitations of this standardized in vitro digestion model are assessed.", "generated_text": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of the applications of the INFOGEST in vitro digestion model to various food types, focusing on its utility in assessing bioaccessibility and bioavailability of nutrients and bioactive compounds. The INFOGEST model, which simulates the dynamic conditions of the human gastrointestinal tract, has been widely adopted to evaluate the impact of food processing and matrix composition on nutrient release and absorption. Studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting the bioaccessibility of proteins, lipids, and micronutrients from both conventional and functional foods. The model's ability to mimic physiological conditions, including pH changes, enzymatic activities, and the presence of bile and pancreatic fluids, enhances its relevance for nutritional and food science research. This review also highlights recent advancements and potential future directions, emphasizing the model's role in optimizing food formulations for improved health outcomes.", "label": 1}
