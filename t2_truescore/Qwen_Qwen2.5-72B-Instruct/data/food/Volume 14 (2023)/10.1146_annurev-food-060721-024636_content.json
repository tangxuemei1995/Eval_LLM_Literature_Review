{"grounding": "Microgreens are edible young plants that have recently attracted interest because of their color and flavor diversity, phytonutrient abundance, short growth cycle, and minimal space and nutrient requirements. They can be cultivated in a variety of systems from simple home gardens to sophisticated vertical farms with automated irrigation, fertilizer delivery, and lighting controls. Microgreens have also attracted attention from space agencies hoping that their sensory qualities can contribute to the diet of astronauts in microgravity and their cultivation might help maintain crew physical and psychological health on long-duration spaceflight missions. However, many technical challenges and data gaps for growing microgreensboth on and off Earth remain unaddressed. This review summarizes recent studies on multiple aspects of microgreens, including nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, cultivation systems, operative conditions, innovative treatments, autonomous facilities, and potential space applications. It also provides the authors\u2019 perspectives on the challenges to stimulating more extensive interdisciplinary research.", "generated_text": "This review provides a comprehensive update on the recent advancements in microgreen cultivation, focusing on their nutritional profile, production systems, and potential applications in home, commercial, and space farming. Microgreens, known for their high nutrient density, have gained significant attention as a sustainable food source. Recent studies highlight their role in enhancing food security and dietary diversity. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in microgreen production systems has optimized growth conditions, reducing water and energy consumption while increasing yield. Additionally, the adaptability of microgreens to controlled environment agriculture makes them ideal candidates for space farming, contributing to the development of life support systems in long-duration space missions. This review synthesizes the latest findings and discusses the future directions for microgreen research and application.", "label": 1}
