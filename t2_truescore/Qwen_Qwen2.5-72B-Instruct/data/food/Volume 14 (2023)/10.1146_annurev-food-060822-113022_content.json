{"grounding": "Despite the almost universal acceptance of the phrase \u201cyou are what you eat,\u201d investment in understanding diet-based nutrition to address human health has been dwarfed compared to that for medicine-based interventions. Moreover, traditional breeding has focused on yield to the detriment of nutritional quality, meaning that although caloric content has remained high, the incidence of nutritional deficiencies and accompanying diseases (so-called hidden hunger) has risen dramatically. We review how genome sequencing coupled with metabolomics can facilitate the screening of genebank collections in the search for superior alleles related to the nutritional quality of crops. We argue that the first examples are very promising, suggesting that this approach could benefit broader ranges of crops and compounds with known relevance for human health. We argue that this represents anapproach complementary to metabolic engineering by transgenesis or gene editing that could be used to reverse some of the losses incurred through a recent focus on breeding for yield, although we caution that ensuring such approaches are not (re)introducing antinutrients is also necessary.", "generated_text": "The exploration of genebank collections for their metabolic signatures offers a promising yet underexploited avenue for enhancing human health. Genebanks, which house a vast array of plant genetic resources, represent a rich source of natural variance in phytonutrient profiles. These phytonutrients, including flavonoids, carotenoids, and polyphenols, play crucial roles in human nutrition and disease prevention. By leveraging advanced plant metabolomics techniques, researchers can identify and characterize novel phytonutrient variants that may possess enhanced health benefits. This approach not only aids in the development of more nutritious crop varieties but also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the health-promoting effects of plant-based diets. Integrating these findings into public health strategies could lead to more effective dietary recommendations and the creation of functional foods tailored to specific health needs. Thus, genebank collections serve as a valuable resource for both agricultural and nutritional sciences, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration to improve human health through plant-based interventions.", "label": 1}
