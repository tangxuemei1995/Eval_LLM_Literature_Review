{"grounding": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is an important subtype of myocardial infarction (MI) that occurs in approximately 6\u20138% of patients with spontaneous MI who are referred for coronary angiography. MINOCA disproportionately affects women, but men are also affected. Pathogenesis is more variable than in MI with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD). Dominant mechanisms include atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and coronary artery spasm. Management of MINOCA varies based on the underlying mechanism of infarction. Therefore, systematic approaches to diagnosis are recommended. The combination of invasive coronary angiography, multivessel intracoronary imaging, provocative testing for coronary spasm, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides the greatest diagnostic yield. Current clinical practice guidelines for the secondary prevention of MI are based largely on data from patients with MI-CAD. Thus, optimal medications after MINOCA are uncertain. Clinical trials focused on the treatment of patients with MINOCA are urgently needed to define optimal care.", "generated_text": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is a clinically significant condition that challenges traditional understandings of myocardial infarction (MI). This review synthesizes current knowledge on MINOCA, highlighting its prevalence, diagnostic criteria, and underlying mechanisms. MINOCA accounts for approximately 5-10% of all MIs and is associated with a diverse array of etiologies, including coronary spasm, takotsubo syndrome, and microvascular dysfunction. Advanced imaging techniques, such as coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, play crucial roles in diagnosing MINOCA and differentiating it from other forms of myocardial injury. The management of MINOCA is multifaceted, focusing on symptom relief, risk factor modification, and targeted therapies to address specific underlying causes. Future research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of MINOCA and to develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
