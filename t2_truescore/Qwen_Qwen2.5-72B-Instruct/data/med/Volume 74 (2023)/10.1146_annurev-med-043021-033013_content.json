{"grounding": "In vivo gene therapy is rapidly emerging as a new therapeutic paradigm for monogenic disorders. For almost three decades, hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) have served as model disorders for the development of gene therapy. This effort is soon to bear fruit with completed pivotal adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene addition trials reporting encouraging results and regulatory approval widely anticipated in the near future for the current generation of HA and HB AAV vectors. Here we review the clinical development of AAV gene therapy for HA and HB and examine outstanding questions that have recently emerged from AAV clinical trials for hemophilia and other monogenic disorders.", "generated_text": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy represents a promising approach for treating hemophilia A and B, characterized by deficiencies in factor VIII and factor IX, respectively. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated sustained therapeutic levels of clotting factors following a single administration of AAV vectors, leading to reduced bleeding episodes and improved quality of life. However, challenges such as immune responses, vector manufacturing, and long-term safety remain. This review summarizes the current state of AAV gene therapy for hemophilia, highlighting recent advancements and discussing future directions to optimize therapeutic outcomes.", "label": 1}
