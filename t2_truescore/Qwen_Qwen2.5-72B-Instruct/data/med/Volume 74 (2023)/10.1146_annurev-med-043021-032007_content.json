{"grounding": "Increasing numbers of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth, from early puberty through late adolescence, are seeking medical services to bring their physical sex characteristics into alignment with their gender identity\u2014their inner sense of self as male or female or elsewhere on the gender spectrum. Numerous studies, primarily of short- and medium-term duration (up to 6 years), demonstrate the clearly beneficial\u2014even lifesaving\u2014mental health impact of gender-affirming medical care in TGD youth. However, there are significant gaps in knowledge and challenges to such care. Long-term safety and efficacy studies are needed to optimize medical care for TGD youth.", "generated_text": "This review summarizes current concepts in the gender-affirming care of transgender and gender-diverse youth, focusing on the use of pubertal blockers and gender-affirming hormone treatment. Pubertal blockers, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, are used to delay puberty and reduce gender dysphoria, providing time for psychological assessment and support. Gender-affirming hormone treatment, including estrogen or testosterone, is initiated to align physical characteristics with gender identity, improving mental health outcomes and quality of life. The review highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care, including psychological, medical, and social support, to ensure comprehensive and individualized care for these youth.", "label": 0}
