{"grounding": "Aging is associated with increased mutational burden in every tissue studied. Occasionally, fitness-increasing mutations will arise, leading to stem cell clonal expansion. This process occurs in several tissues but has been best studied in blood. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, which result if additional cooperating mutations occur. Surprisingly, it is also associated with an increased risk of nonmalignant diseases, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This may be due to enhanced inflammation in mutated innate immune cells, which could be targeted clinically with anti-inflammatory drugs. Recent studies have uncovered other factors that predict poor outcomes in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, such as size of the mutant clone, mutated driver genes, and epigenetic aging. Though clonality is inevitable and largely a function of time, recent work has shown that inherited genetic variation can also influence this process. Clonal hematopoiesis provides a paradigm for understanding how age-related changes in tissue stem cell composition and function influence human health.", "generated_text": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a recently recognized condition characterized by the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells with somatic mutations. This phenomenon is increasingly prevalent with age and has been linked to a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD), malignancies, and other adverse health outcomes. Recent studies have highlighted the role of DNA methylation in the clonal trajectories of CHIP, suggesting that epigenetic changes may contribute to the pathogenesis of associated diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying CHIP, its impact on human health, and potential therapeutic strategies. By integrating genetic and epigenetic data, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how CHIP influences the risk of CAD and malignancy, and to identify biomarkers that could facilitate early detection and intervention.", "label": 1}
