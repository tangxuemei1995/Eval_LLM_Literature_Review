{"grounding": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension but is frequently underrecognized and undertreated. Patients with PA are at a markedly increased risk for target organ damage to the heart and kidneys. While patients with unilateral PA can be treated surgically, many patients with PA are not eligible or willing to undergo surgery. Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are highly effective for treating PA and reducing the risk of target organ damage. However, steroidal MRAs are often underprescribed and can be poorly tolerated by some patients due to side effects. Nonsteroidal MRAs reduce adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetic kidney disease and are bettertolerated than steroidal MRAs. While their blood pressure\u2013lowering effects remain unclear, these agents may have a potential role in reducing target organ damage in patients with PA.", "generated_text": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common cause of secondary hypertension, characterized by excessive aldosterone production, leading to cardiovascular and renal complications. This review examines the role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in mitigating the adverse effects of PA on the heart and kidneys. MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, have been shown to reduce blood pressure, improve left ventricular hypertrophy, and slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Clinical trials and observational studies highlight the efficacy and safety of MRAs in PA patients, emphasizing their potential to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, careful monitoring of potassium levels and renal function is essential to prevent hyperkalemia and renal impairment. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current evidence supporting the use of MRAs in the management of PA and its associated comorbidities.", "label": 1}
