{"grounding": "In 2020, the nephrology community formally interrogated long-standing race-based clinical algorithms used in the field, including the kidney function estimation equations. A comprehensive understanding of the history of kidney function estimation and racial essentialism is necessary to understand underpinnings of the incorporation of a Black race coefficient into prior equations. We provide a review of this history, as well as the considerations used to develop race-free equations that are a guidepost for a more equity-oriented, scientifically rigorous future for kidney function estimation and other clinical algorithms and processes in which race may be embedded as a variable.", "generated_text": "This review examines the historical and contemporary use of race in kidney function estimation, highlighting the ethical and clinical implications of race-based adjustments in clinical algorithms. We discuss the scientific limitations and the perpetuation of health disparities associated with these practices. The paper advocates for the development and implementation of race-free equations to promote equity in kidney care, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to address systemic biases and advance health justice.", "label": 0}
