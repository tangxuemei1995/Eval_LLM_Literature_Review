{"grounding": "Chronic respiratory failure is a common, important complication of many types of neuromuscular and chest wall disorders. While the pathophysiology of each disease may be different, these disorders can variably affect all muscles involved in breathing, including inspiratory, expiratory, and bulbar muscles, ultimately leading to chronic respiratory failure and hypoventilation. The use of home assisted ventilation through noninvasive interfaces aims to improve the symptoms of hypoventilation, improve sleep quality, and, when possible, improve mortality. An increasing variety of interfaces has allowed for improved comfort and compliance. In a minority of scenarios, noninvasive ventilation is either not appropriate or no longer effective due to disease progression, and a transition to tracheal ventilation should be considered.", "generated_text": "Chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure necessitates long-term ventilatory support, often achieved through home assisted ventilation (HAV). This review examines the efficacy and patient outcomes of HAV, particularly focusing on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) methods. Studies indicate that NIV significantly improves quality of life, reduces hospital admissions, and enhances survival rates in patients with neuromuscular disorders. However, successful implementation of HAV requires careful patient selection, appropriate equipment, and ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal outcomes. This paper also discusses the challenges and considerations in the management of HAV, including patient adherence, technical issues, and the need for multidisciplinary care.", "label": 1}
