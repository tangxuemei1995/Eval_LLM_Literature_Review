{"grounding": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different approaches with lentiviral vector\u2013mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation. Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality.", "generated_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, leading to chronic hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusive pain. Recent advancements in gene therapy offer promising therapeutic strategies to address the root cause of SCD. This review highlights diverse approaches, including hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant, gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9, and gene addition via lentiviral vectors. HSC transplant has shown efficacy in correcting the disease, but its application is limited by the availability of matched donors. Gene editing techniques, particularly CRISPR, enable precise correction of the sickle mutation in HSCs, while lentiviral vectors facilitate the introduction of a functional \u03b2-globin gene. These approaches aim to achieve long-term correction and reduce the clinical burden of SCD, with ongoing clinical trials demonstrating initial success and safety profiles.", "label": 1}
