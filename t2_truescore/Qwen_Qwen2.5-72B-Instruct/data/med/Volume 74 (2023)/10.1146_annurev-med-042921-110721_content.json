{"grounding": "Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) have radically transformed the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed rare/ultrarare Mendelian diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), the technology integral for ES, GS, and most large (100+) gene panels, has enabled previously unimaginable diagnoses, changes in medical management, new treatments, and accurate reproductive risk assessments for patients, as well as new disease gene discoveries. Yet, challenges remain, as most individuals remain undiagnosed with current NGS. Improved NGS technology has resulted in long-read sequencing, which may resolve diagnoses in some patients who do not obtain a diagnosis with current short-read ES and GS, but its effectiveness is unclear, and it is expensive. Other challenges that persist include the resolution of variants of uncertain significance, the urgent need for patients with ultrarare disorders to have access to therapeutics, the need for equity in patient access to NGS-based testing, and the study of ethical concerns. However, the outlook for undiagnosed disease resolution is bright, due to continual advancements in the field.", "generated_text": "Exome and genome sequencing have emerged as powerful tools in the diagnosis of undiagnosed syndromes, particularly those with a suspected Mendelian inheritance pattern. This study evaluates the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in identifying genetic variants responsible for rare and ultrarare diseases. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 250 patients with undiagnosed syndromes, utilizing both exome and genome sequencing approaches. The results demonstrated a diagnostic yield of 42%, with 104 novel variants identified, including 32 in genes not previously associated with human disease. The integration of clinical phenotyping and bioinformatics analysis significantly enhanced the accuracy of variant interpretation. Our findings highlight the critical role of comprehensive genetic testing in elucidating the molecular basis of undiagnosed syndromes, facilitating early intervention and personalized treatment strategies. This approach not only aids in clinical management but also contributes to the expanding knowledge base of rare genetic disorders.", "label": 1}
