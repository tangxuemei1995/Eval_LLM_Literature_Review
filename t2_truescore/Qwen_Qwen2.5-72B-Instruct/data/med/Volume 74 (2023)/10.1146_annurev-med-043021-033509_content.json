{"grounding": "The multifaceted interaction between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the endocrine system has been a major area of scientific research over the past two years. While common endocrine/metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes have been recognized among significant risk factors for COVID-19 severity, several endocrine organs were identified to be targeted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). New-onset endocrine disorders related to COVID-19 were reported while long-term effects, if any, are yet to be determined. Meanwhile, the \u201cstay home\u201d measures during the pandemic caused interruption in the care of patients with pre-existing endocrine disorders and may have impeded the diagnosis and treatment of new ones. This review aims to outline this complex interaction between COVID-19 and endocrine disorders by synthesizing the current scientific knowledge obtained from clinical and pathophysiological studies, and to emphasize considerations for future research.", "generated_text": "The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the complex interplay between the endocrine system and viral infections. This review examines the impact of COVID-19 on various endocrine disorders, including obesity, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, and pituitary disorders, as well as its effects on reproductive health. Emerging evidence suggests that individuals with pre-existing endocrine conditions are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. The virus's interaction with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and its potential to induce cytokine storms contribute to endocrine dysregulation. Additionally, the psychological stress and lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic have exacerbated endocrine disorders. This review synthesizes current knowledge and identifies gaps in understanding, emphasizing the need for tailored management strategies to mitigate the endocrine complications of COVID-19.", "label": 1}
