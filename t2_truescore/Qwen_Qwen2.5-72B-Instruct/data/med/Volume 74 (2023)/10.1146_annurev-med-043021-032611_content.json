{"grounding": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating autoimmune disease that can result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and treatment of SLE are clinical challenges. Patient presentation and response to therapy are heterogeneous because of the complex immune dysregulation that results in SLE disease pathogenesis. An intricate interplay between genetic risk and skewing of adaptive and innate immune system responses leads to overproduction of type I interferons and other cytokines, complement activation, immune-complex deposition, and ultimately inflammation and tissue damage. Here, we review the classification criteria as well as standard and emerging diagnostic tools available to identify patients with SLE. We then focus on medical management, including novel therapeutics, nonpharmacologic interventions, and comorbidity management.", "generated_text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and multi-organ involvement. Recent advancements in understanding the pathogenic role of interferon in SLE have paved the way for novel diagnostic biomarkers and targeted biologic therapies. This review highlights the latest diagnostic tools, including interferon signature testing, which can improve early detection and disease stratification. Additionally, emerging biologic agents, such as anti-interferon antibodies and B-cell depleting therapies, offer promising therapeutic options that may reduce disease activity and improve patient outcomes. These advancements underscore the importance of personalized medicine in the management of SLE, aiming to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles.", "label": 1}
