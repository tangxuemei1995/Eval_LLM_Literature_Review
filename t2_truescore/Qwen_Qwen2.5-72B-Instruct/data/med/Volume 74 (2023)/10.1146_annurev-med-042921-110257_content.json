{"grounding": "Shortly after the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019, clinicians rapidly recognized an apparent association between the disease and both arterial and venous thrombotic complications, which was confirmed in epidemiologic studies. Based on these data, hospitals empirically developed and implemented protocols with different strategies for anticoagulation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Subsequent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) clarified the role of anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and recently discharged from the hospital. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, observational comparative effectiveness analyses that provided hints of a benefit from anticoagulation, and finally the RCTs that established which patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation. These RCTs have demonstrated that hospitalized, noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation, but patients who are hospitalized and critically ill, discharged from the hospital, or not hospitalized do not benefit.", "generated_text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with a high incidence of thrombotic complications, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombosis in COVID-19 and evaluates the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in managing these complications. Emerging evidence suggests that hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is multifactorial, involving inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and immune activation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation can reduce the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic events, although the optimal dosing and duration of treatment remain areas of active investigation. Platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as aspirin, have also shown promise, particularly in outpatient settings. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the therapeutic strategies and highlights the need for personalized approaches to antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19 patients.", "label": 0}
