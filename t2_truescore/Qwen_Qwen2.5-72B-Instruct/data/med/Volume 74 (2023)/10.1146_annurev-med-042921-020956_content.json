{"grounding": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by SARS-CoV-2 evolution and emergence of viral variants that have far exceeded initial expectations. Five major variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) have emerged, each having both unique and overlapping amino acid substitutions that have affected transmissibility, disease severity, and susceptibility to natural or vaccine-induced immune responses and monoclonal antibodies. Several of the more recent variants appear to have evolved properties of immune evasion, particularly in cases of prolonged infection. Tracking of existing variants and surveillance for new variants are critical for an effective pandemic response.", "generated_text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) poses significant challenges to global public health efforts aimed at controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants exhibit increased transmissibility, potential for immune evasion, and may lead to more severe disease outcomes. This review discusses the genetic characteristics of prominent VOCs, their impact on vaccine efficacy, and the implications for diagnostic testing and therapeutic strategies. Understanding the evolution and spread of these variants is crucial for developing adaptive public health interventions and mitigating the ongoing threat of COVID-19.", "label": 1}
