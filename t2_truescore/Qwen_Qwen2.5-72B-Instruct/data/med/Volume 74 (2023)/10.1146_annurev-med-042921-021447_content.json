{"grounding": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited multisystemic disease that can cause progressive bronchiectasis, pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, liver dysfunction, and other disorders. Traditional therapies focused on the treatment or prevention of damage to each organ system with incremental modalities such as nebulized medications for the lungs, insulin for diabetes, and supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. However, the advent of highly effective modulator therapies that target specific cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein malformations resulting from individual genetic mutations has transformed the lives and prognosis for persons with CF.", "generated_text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR modulators, a class of drugs designed to correct the defective CFTR protein, have revolutionized CF treatment. This review summarizes the current landscape of CFTR modulator therapies, including their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles. Recent advancements in combination therapies have shown significant improvements in lung function and quality of life for CF patients, highlighting the potential for personalized medicine approaches in CF care.", "label": 1}
