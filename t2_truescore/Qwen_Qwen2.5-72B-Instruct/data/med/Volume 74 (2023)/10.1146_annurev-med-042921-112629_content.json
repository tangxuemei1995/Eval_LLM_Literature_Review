{"grounding": "Polygenic scores quantify inherited risk by integrating information from many common sites of DNA variation into a single number. Rapid increases in the scale of genetic association studies and new statistical algorithms have enabled development of polygenic scores that meaningfully measure\u2014as early as birth\u2014risk of coronary artery disease. These newer-generation polygenic scores identify up to 8% of the population with triple the normal risk based on genetic variation alone, and these individuals cannot be identified on the basis of family history or clinical risk factors alone. For those identified with increased genetic risk, evidence supports risk reduction with at least two interventions, adherence to a healthy lifestyle and cholesterol-lowering therapies, that can substantially reduce risk. Alongside considerable enthusiasm for the potential of polygenic risk estimation to enable a new era of preventive clinical medicine is recognition of a need for ongoing research into how best to ensure equitable performance across diverse ancestries, how and in whom to assess the scores in clinical practice, as well as randomized trials to confirm clinical utility.", "generated_text": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with a substantial genetic component. Recent advances in genomics have enabled the development of polygenic scores (PGS) that quantify an individual's genetic risk for CAD. These scores, derived from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), integrate the effects of multiple genetic variants to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment. This review highlights the latest developments in PGS for CAD, including improvements in score accuracy and the integration of environmental and lifestyle factors. We discuss the clinical applications of PGS in risk stratification, early intervention, and personalized prevention strategies. Additionally, we address the challenges and ethical considerations associated with the implementation of PGS in clinical practice, emphasizing the need for robust validation and equitable access. The potential of PGS to enhance CAD risk prediction and inform preventive measures underscores the importance of continued research in this field.", "label": 1}
