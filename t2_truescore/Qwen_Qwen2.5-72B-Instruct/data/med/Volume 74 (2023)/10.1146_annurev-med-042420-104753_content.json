{"grounding": "COVID-19 can cause acute kidney injury and may cause or exacerbate chronic kidney diseases, including glomerular diseases. SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells has been reported, but it remains unclear if viral infection of kidney cells causes disease. The most important causes of kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 include impaired renal perfusion and immune dysregulation. Chronic kidney disease, especially kidney failure with kidney replacement therapy and kidney transplant, is associated with markedly increased COVID-19 mortality. Persons with severe kidney disease have been excluded from most clinical trials of COVID-19 therapies, so therapeutic approaches must be extrapolated from studies of patients without kidney disease. Some medications used to treat COVID-19 should be avoided or used at reduced dosages in patients with severe kidney disease and in kidney transplant recipients. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal strategies to prevent and treat COVID-19 in patients with kidney disease.", "generated_text": "The emergence of COVID-19 has significantly impacted patients with kidney disease, particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and those undergoing dialysis or who have received a kidney transplant. This review synthesizes current evidence on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and kidney function, highlighting the increased risk of severe outcomes and mortality in these vulnerable populations. Data indicate that patients with CKD and ESKD are more susceptible to COVID-19 complications, including acute kidney injury and kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT). Additionally, the pandemic has disrupted routine care, leading to delayed treatments and potential exacerbation of underlying conditions. Strategies to mitigate these risks, such as prioritizing vaccination and optimizing telehealth services, are discussed. Understanding the specific challenges faced by kidney disease patients during the pandemic is crucial for improving clinical outcomes and healthcare delivery.", "label": 1}
