{"grounding": "Maternal mortality is unusually high in the United States compared to other wealthy nations and is characterized by major disparities in race/ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic factors. Similar to other developed nations, the United States has seen a shift in the underlying causes of pregnancy-related death, with a relative increase in mortality resulting from diseases of the cardiovascular system and preexisting medical conditions. Improved continuity of care aimed at identifying reproductive-age women with preexisting conditions that may heighten the risk of maternal death, preconception management of risk factors for major adverse pregnancy outcomes, and primary care visits within the first year after delivery may offer opportunities to address gaps in medical care contributing to the unacceptable rates of maternal mortality in the United States.", "generated_text": "Maternal mortality in the United States remains a significant public health concern, with persistent disparities across racial and socioeconomic groups. This study examines recent trends in maternal mortality rates and identifies key factors contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of national health data and literature, we highlight the critical role of preconception health and counseling in mitigating risks. Our findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve access to quality healthcare, particularly for high-risk populations. By addressing systemic barriers and enhancing preconception care, there is a substantial opportunity to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health outcomes in the United States.", "label": 1}
