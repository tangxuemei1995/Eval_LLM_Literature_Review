{"grounding": "Billions of individuals worldwide have benefited from the unprecedented large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Given the sheer number of people that have received these vaccines, it is not surprising that rare side effects are reported that were not previously detected in the phase III vaccine trials. This review addresses one rare complication called SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It occurs in approximately 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 recipients of the adenovirus vector\u2013based COVID-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca-Oxford or Johnson & Johnson. Information on VITT syndrome was disseminated quickly via social media and publications after it was first discovered. Initial observations associating VITT with specific patient populations, thrombus locations, and outcomes associated with heparin therapy have since been refined with additional clinical experience. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of VITT.", "generated_text": "Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but serious adverse event associated with adenovirus vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This condition is characterized by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), leading to platelet activation, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis. Clinical manifestations of VITT can include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The incidence of VITT is estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 vaccine recipients, with a higher risk observed in younger individuals. Early recognition and prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and non-heparin anticoagulants are critical for improving outcomes. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of VITT, highlighting the importance of continued surveillance and research to mitigate this immunologic complication.", "label": 1}
