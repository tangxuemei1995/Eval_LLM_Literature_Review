{"grounding": "Hundreds of different genetic causes of chronic kidney disease are now recognized, and while individually rare, taken together they are significant contributors to both adult and pediatric diseases. Traditional genetics approaches relied heavily on the identification of large families with multiple affected members and have been fundamental to the identification of genetic kidney diseases. With the increased utilization of massively parallel sequencing and improvements to genotype imputation, we can analyze rare variants in large cohorts of unrelated individuals, leading to personalized care for patients and significant research advancements. This review evaluates the contribution of rare disorders to patient care and the study of genetic kidney diseases and highlights key advancements that utilize new techniques to improve our ability to identify new gene\u2013disease associations.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in genomics, particularly through the application of massively parallel sequencing, have illuminated the unexpected role of rare genetic disorders in the etiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study employs collapsing analysis to aggregate rare variants within genes, revealing a significant association between specific genetic mutations and the development of CKD. The findings underscore the potential of precision medicine in tailoring therapeutic interventions for patients with genetic kidney diseases, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genetic screening in clinical practice. These insights not only enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of CKD but also pave the way for more personalized and effective treatment strategies.", "label": 0}
