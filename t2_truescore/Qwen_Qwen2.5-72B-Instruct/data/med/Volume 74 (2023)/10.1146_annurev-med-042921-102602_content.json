{"grounding": "Red blood cells transport O2 from the lungs to body tissues. Hypoxia stimulates kidney cells to secrete erythropoietin (EPO), which increases red cell mass. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) mediate EPO gene transcriptional activation. HIF-\u03b1 subunits are subject to O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation and then bound by the von Hippel\u2013Lindau protein (VHL), which triggers their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mutations in the genes encoding EPO, EPO receptor, HIF-2\u03b1, prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2), or VHL cause familial erythrocytosis. In addition to O2, \u03b1-ketoglutarate is a substrate for PHD2, and analogs of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inhibit hydroxylase activity. In phase III clinical trials evaluating the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease, HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors were as efficacious as darbepoetin alfa in stimulating erythropoiesis. However, safety concerns have arisen that are focused on thromboembolism, which is also a phenotypic manifestation of VHL or HIF-2\u03b1 mutation, suggesting that these events are on-target effects of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors.", "generated_text": "The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of erythropoiesis, particularly in conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) where erythropoietin (EPO) production is impaired. Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of the HIF pathway have been explored to enhance erythropoiesis and mitigate anemia. HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) stabilize HIF proteins, leading to increased EPO production and improved hematopoietic function. However, these interventions can also elevate the risk of thromboembolic events, highlighting the need for careful dose titration and patient monitoring. This review summarizes the current understanding of the HIF pathway's role in erythropoiesis, the mechanisms of action of HIF-PHIs, and the clinical implications of their use, including the potential for thromboembolism. The findings underscore the importance of balancing therapeutic benefits with safety considerations in the management of anemia associated with CKD and other hypoxic conditions.", "label": 1}
