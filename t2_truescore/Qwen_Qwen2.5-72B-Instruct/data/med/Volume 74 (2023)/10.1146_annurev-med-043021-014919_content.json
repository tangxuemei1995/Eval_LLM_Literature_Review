{"grounding": "Nearly half of Americans are projected to have obesity by 2030, underscoring the pressing need for effective treatments. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) represent the first agents in a rapidly evolving, highly promising landscape of nascent hormone-based obesity therapeutics. With the understanding of the neurobiology of obesity rapidly expanding, these emerging entero-endocrine and endo-pancreatic agents combined or coformulated with GLP-1 RAs herald a new era of targeted, mechanism-based treatment of obesity. This article reviews GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of obesity and previews the imminent future of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based anti-obesity therapeutics.", "generated_text": "This review explores the emerging role of GLP-1 receptor agonists and nutrient-stimulated hormone (NuSH)-based therapies in the treatment of obesity. Recent advancements in dual and triple receptor agonists have shown promising results in enhancing weight loss and metabolic control. These novel therapeutics, which mimic the effects of multiple gut hormones, offer a more comprehensive approach to managing obesity and related comorbidities. The integration of NuSH-based therapies further expands the therapeutic landscape, providing new opportunities for personalized and effective obesity treatment.", "label": 1}
