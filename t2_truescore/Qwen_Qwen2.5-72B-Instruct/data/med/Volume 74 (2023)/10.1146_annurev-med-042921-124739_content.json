{"grounding": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral pathogen in the transplant population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CMV prevention is paramount; however, selecting the best preventive strategy depends on many factors including donor\u2013recipient CMV serostatus, transplant-specific risks, antiviral toxicities and cost. Novel CMV therapeutics such as letermovir (LTV) are desperately needed to optimize CMV management. Uniquely among CMV antiviral therapies, LTV inhibits the viral terminase complex in the CMV DNA synthesis pathway and disrupts viral genome packaging. Further, it lacks side effects frequently associated with other CMV antiviral therapies and evades common mechanisms of resistance. LTV is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CMV prevention in adult CMV-seropositive hematopoietic cell transplant recipients but is increasingly applied off-label for prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes important concepts of CMV management in transplantation, with a specific focus on LTV pharmacology and clinical experience to date alongside future prospects for its application.", "generated_text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant complication in both solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Letermovir, a novel antiviral agent, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for CMV prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of letermovir in transplant recipients. Clinical trials have demonstrated that letermovir significantly reduces the incidence of CMV infection and disease in high-risk HCT patients, with a favorable safety profile. In SOT recipients, preliminary data suggest similar benefits, although more extensive studies are needed. Letermovir's unique mechanism of action, targeting the viral terminase complex, minimizes the risk of resistance and offers a valuable addition to the existing antiviral arsenal. This paper also discusses the optimal dosing strategies and potential drug interactions, highlighting the role of letermovir in the comprehensive management of CMV in transplant recipients.", "label": 1}
