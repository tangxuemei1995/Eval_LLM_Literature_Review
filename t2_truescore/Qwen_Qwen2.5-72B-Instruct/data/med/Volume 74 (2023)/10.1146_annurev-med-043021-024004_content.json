{"grounding": "Understanding how biases originate in medical technologies and developing safeguards to identify, mitigate, and remove their harms are essential to ensuring equal performance in all individuals. Drawing upon examples from pulmonary medicine, this article describes how bias can be introduced in the physical aspects of the technology design, via unrepresentative data, or by conflation of biological with social determinants of health. It then can be perpetuated by inadequate evaluation and regulatory standards. Research demonstrates that pulse oximeters perform differently depending on patient race and ethnicity. Pulmonary function testing and algorithms used to predict healthcare needs are two additional examples of medical technologies with racial and ethnic biases that may perpetuate health disparities.", "generated_text": "This study examines the origins and implications of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies, focusing on pulse oximetry and pulmonary function testing. We review the historical context and structural racism that have influenced the development and validation of these medical devices and algorithms. Disparities in accuracy and outcomes are analyzed, highlighting the need for more inclusive and representative data in the design and testing phases. The findings underscore the importance of addressing these biases to improve health equity and the reliability of pulmonary diagnostics across diverse populations.", "label": 1}
