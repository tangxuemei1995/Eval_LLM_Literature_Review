{"grounding": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described in 1906 as a dementing disease marked by the presence of two types of fibrillar aggregates in the brain: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. The process of aggregation and formation of the aggregates has been a major focus of investigation ever since the discoveries that the tau protein is the predominant protein in tangles and amyloid \u03b2 is the predominant protein in plaques. The idea that smaller, oligomeric species of amyloid may also be bioactive has now been clearly established. This review examines the possibility that soluble, nonfibrillar, bioactive forms of tau\u2014the \u201ctau we cannot see\u201d\u2014comprise a dominant driver of neurodegeneration in AD.", "generated_text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite significant advances, the detection and quantification of tau pathology in living patients remain challenging. This review highlights recent developments in tau biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood-based assays, as well as imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET). These biomarkers offer promising tools for early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Additionally, the therapeutic landscape for tau-targeted interventions is evolving, with several compounds in clinical trials showing potential to reduce tau pathology and improve cognitive function. However, further research is needed to optimize these biomarkers and therapeutics for clinical use.", "label": 1}
