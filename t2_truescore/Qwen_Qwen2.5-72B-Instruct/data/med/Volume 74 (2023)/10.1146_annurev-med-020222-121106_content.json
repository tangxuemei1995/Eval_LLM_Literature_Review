{"grounding": "Transgender people often face barriers in health care due to lack of access to care, lack of knowledgeable healthcare professionals, discrimination, and gaps in medical and mental health research. Existing research on transgender health has focused heavily on mental health, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases/infections, and substance abuse. Gender-affirming hormone therapy and/or surgery allows for some alignment of biology and gender identity. Gender-affirming care may offer quality-of-life benefits, which may outweigh modest concerns related to exogenous hormone therapy. The Endocrine Society treatment guidelines were revised in 2017, and this article reviews recent data that might inform a future guideline revision. Future longitudinal research is needed to close the gap in knowledge in the field of transgender medicine.", "generated_text": "This review provides an update on the current standards of care for adult transgender individuals, focusing on gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT). The Endocrine Society 2017 treatment guidelines are highlighted, emphasizing the importance of individualized care plans for both transfeminine and transmasculine patients. Key considerations include the timing of initiation, dosing regimens, and monitoring of hormone levels and potential side effects. The review also addresses the psychological and social aspects of GAHT, underscoring the need for multidisciplinary support to optimize health outcomes and quality of life.", "label": 1}
