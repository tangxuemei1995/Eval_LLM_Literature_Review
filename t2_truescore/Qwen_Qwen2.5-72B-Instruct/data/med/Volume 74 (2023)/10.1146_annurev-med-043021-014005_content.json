{"grounding": "Heterogeneity in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is increasingly being recognized as one of the principal barriers to finding efficacious targeted therapies. The advent of multiple high-throughput biological data (\u201comics\u201d), coupled with the widespread access to increased computational power, has led to the emergence of phenotyping in critical care. Phenotyping aims to use a multitude of data to identify homogenous subgroups within an otherwise heterogenous population. Increasingly, phenotyping schemas are being applied to sepsis and ARDS to increase understanding of these clinical conditions and identify potential therapies. Here we present a selective review of the biological phenotyping schemas applied to sepsis and ARDS. Further, we outline some of the challenges involved in translating these conceptual findings to bedside clinical decision-making tools.", "generated_text": "Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are complex critical care conditions characterized by heterogeneous clinical presentations. Recent advances in biological phenotyping have identified distinct subphenotypes that correlate with differential outcomes and treatment responses. This review synthesizes current literature on the identification and validation of these subphenotypes, emphasizing their potential to enhance precision medicine approaches. By integrating genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data, researchers have begun to delineate the molecular underpinnings of these subphenotypes, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Future studies should focus on validating these findings in diverse patient populations and translating them into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
