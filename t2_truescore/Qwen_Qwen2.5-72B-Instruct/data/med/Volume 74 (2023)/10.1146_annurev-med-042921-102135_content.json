{"grounding": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) were originally developed as antidiabetic agents, with cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials demonstrating improved CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Secondary analyses of CV outcome trials and later dedicated kidney outcome trials consistently reported improved kidney-related outcomes independent of T2D status and across a range of kidney function and albuminuria. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trials and real-world analyses demonstrating a decrease in the risk of acute kidney injury. The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors generally extend across different members of the class, possibly on the basis of hemodynamic, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in diverse patient populations.", "generated_text": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a promising class of medications for improving kidney outcomes in both diabetic and nondiabetic kidney disease. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in the risk of kidney failure, albuminuria progression, and acute kidney injury. These benefits extend beyond glycemic control, suggesting a multifaceted mechanism of action that includes hemodynamic, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects. This review summarizes the current evidence supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in kidney disease, highlighting their potential to reduce the burden of renal complications and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
