{"grounding": "This review discusses recent advancements in the field of valvular heart disease. Topics covered include recognition of the impact of atrial fibrillation on development and assessment of valvular disease, strategies for global prevention of rheumatic heart disease, understanding and management of secondary mitral regurgitation, the updated classification of bicuspid aortic valve disease, recognition of heightened cardiovascular risk associated with moderate aortic stenosis, and a growing armamentarium of transcatheter therapies.", "generated_text": "This review explores recent advancements in the pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies for valvular heart diseases, including rheumatic heart disease, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and bicuspid aortic valve disease. Emerging insights into molecular mechanisms and novel interventions, such as transcatheter valve therapies, are highlighted, offering promising avenues for improved patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
