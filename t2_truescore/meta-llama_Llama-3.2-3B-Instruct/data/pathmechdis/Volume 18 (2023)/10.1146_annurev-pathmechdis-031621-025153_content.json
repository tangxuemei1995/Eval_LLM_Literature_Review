{"grounding": "African trypanosomes are bloodstream protozoan parasites that infect mammals including humans, where they cause sleeping sickness. Long-lasting infection is required to favor parasite transmission between hosts. Therefore, trypanosomes have developed strategies to continuously escape innate and adaptive responses of the immune system, while also preventing premature death of the host. The pathology linked to infection mainly results from inflammation and includes anemia and brain dysfunction in addition to loss of specificity and memory of the antibody response. The serum of humans contains an efficient trypanolytic factor, the membrane pore-forming protein apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). In the two human-infective trypanosomes, specific parasite resistance factors inhibit APOL1 activity. In turn, many African individuals express APOL1 variants that counteract these resistance factors, enabling them to avoid sleeping sickness. However, these variants are associated with chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of virus-induced inflammation such as coronavirus disease 2019. Vaccination perspectives are discussed.", "generated_text": "African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a devastating parasitic disease caused by the protozoan African trypanosomes. The pathogenesis of this disease is complex and multifaceted, involving the interaction between the parasite and the host's immune system. One key mechanism underlying the disease is the antigenic variation of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which allows the parasite to evade host immune responses. The VSG is a critical component of the parasite's surface coat, and its expression is regulated by the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) protein. Mutations in the APOL1 gene have been linked to an increased susceptibility to African trypanosomiasis, particularly in individuals with kidney disease. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the pathogenesis of African trypanosomiasis, with a focus on the role of VSG and APOL1 in the disease. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies against this disease.", "label": 1}
