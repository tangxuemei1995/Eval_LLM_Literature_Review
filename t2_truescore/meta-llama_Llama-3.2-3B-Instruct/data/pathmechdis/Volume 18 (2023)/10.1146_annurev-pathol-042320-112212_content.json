{"grounding": "Tuft cells are found in tissues with distinct stem cell compartments, tissue architecture, and luminal exposures but converge on a shared transcriptional program, including expression of taste transduction signaling pathways. Here, we summarize seminal and recent findings on tuft cells, focusing on major categories of function\u2014instigation of type 2 cytokine responses, orchestration of antimicrobial responses, and emerging roles in tissue repair\u2014and describe tuft cell\u2013derived molecules used to affect these functional programs. We review what is known about the development of tuft cells from epithelial progenitors under homeostatic conditions and during disease. Finally, we discuss evidence that immature, or nascent, tuft cells with potential for diverse functions are driven toward dominant effector programs by tissue- or perturbation-specific contextual cues, which may result in heterogeneous mature tuft cell phenotypes both within and between tissues.", "generated_text": "Tuft cells are a recently identified cell type in the respiratory epithelium, characterized by their role in type II taste transduction and mucociliary clearance. Recent studies have highlighted the context- and tissue-specific programming of tuft cells, revealing a complex interplay between cytokines, neurotransmitters, and eicosanoids. IL-25, a cytokine involved in type 2 immunity, has been shown to promote the development and function of tuft cells in the lung. Conversely, acetylcholine and cysteinyl leukotriene have been implicated in regulating tuft cell activity. These findings suggest a conserved cell lineage, with tuft cells playing a critical role in maintaining respiratory homeostasis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying tuft cell programming is necessary to elucidate their role in respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", "label": 1}
