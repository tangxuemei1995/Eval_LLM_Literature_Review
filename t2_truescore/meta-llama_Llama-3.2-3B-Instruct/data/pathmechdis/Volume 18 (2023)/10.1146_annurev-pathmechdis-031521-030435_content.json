{"grounding": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one of the major diseases arising from chronic alcohol consumption and is one of the most common causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality. ALD includes asymptomatic liver steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and alcohol-associated hepatitis and its complications. The progression of ALD involves complex cell-cell and organ-organ interactions. We focus on the impact of alcohol on dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms and regulation of injury and repair in the liver. In particular, we discuss recent advances in understanding the disruption of balance between programmed cell death and prosurvival pathways, such as autophagy and membrane trafficking, in the pathogenesis of ALD. We also summarize current understanding of innate immune responses, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction and hepatic stellate cell activation, and gut-liver and adipose-liver cross talk in response to ethanol. In addition,we describe the current potential therapeutic targets and clinical trials aimed at alleviating hepatocyte injury, reducing inflammatory responses, and targeting gut microbiota, for the treatment of ALD.", "generated_text": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a complex and multifaceted condition characterized by progressive liver injury and fibrosis, resulting from chronic alcohol consumption. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of ALD have highlighted the critical role of programmed cell death (PCD) and pattern recognition receptors (PRR) in the development of liver damage. Activation of PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of the complement system, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of PCD. The gut-liver axis, mediated by the release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the gut microbiome, also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ALD. This review aims to summarize the recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of ALD, with a focus on the role of PCD, PRRs, and the gut-liver axis in the development of liver damage. The implications of these findings for the diagnosis and treatment of ALD are also discussed.", "label": 1}
