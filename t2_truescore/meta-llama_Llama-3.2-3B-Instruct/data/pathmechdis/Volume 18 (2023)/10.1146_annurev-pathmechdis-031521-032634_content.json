{"grounding": "Among human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-associated disorders, celiac disease has an immunopathogenesis that is particularly well understood. The condition is characterized by hypersensitivity to cereal gluten proteins, and the disease lesion is localized in the gut. Still, the diagnosis can be made by detection of highly disease-specific autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 in the blood. We now have mechanistic insights into how the disease-predisposing HLA-DQ molecules, via presentation of posttranslationally modified gluten peptides, are connected to the generation of these autoantibodies. This review presents our current understanding of the immunobiology of this common disorder that is positioned in the border zone between food hypersensitivity and autoimmunity.", "generated_text": "Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by an adverse reaction to gluten, leading to inflammation and damage in the small intestine. The immunobiology of celiac disease involves a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and immune system dysregulation. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, with specific HLA alleles conferring susceptibility to the condition. T cells and B cells are central to the immune response, with T cells mediating the cytotoxic response and B cells producing autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2, a key gluten-targeting enzyme.", "label": 1}
