{"grounding": "Molecular monitoring of tumor-derived alterations has an established role in the surveillance of leukemias, and emerging nucleic acid sequencing technologies are likely to similarly transform the clinical management of lymphomas. Lymphomas are well suited for molecular surveillance due to relatively high cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA concentrations, high somatic mutational burden, and the existence of stereotyped variants enabling focused interrogation of recurrently altered regions. Here, we review the clinical scenarios and key technologies applicable for the molecular monitoring of lymphomas, summarizing current evidence in the literature regarding molecular subtyping and classification, evaluation of treatment response, the surveillance of active cellular therapies, and emerging clinical trial strategies.", "generated_text": "Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of cancers characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant lymphocytes. Molecular monitoring of lymphomas is crucial for assessing response to therapy and detecting residual disease. This study employed next-generation sequencing to analyze circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with lymphoma. We found that ctDNA levels correlated with measurable residual disease (MRD) and response assessment. Notably, ctDNA analysis revealed specific mutations associated with treatment outcomes. These findings suggest that ctDNA-based monitoring can provide valuable prognostic information and guide treatment decisions in lymphoma patients. Further studies are warranted to validate these results and explore the clinical utility of ctDNA analysis.", "label": 0}
