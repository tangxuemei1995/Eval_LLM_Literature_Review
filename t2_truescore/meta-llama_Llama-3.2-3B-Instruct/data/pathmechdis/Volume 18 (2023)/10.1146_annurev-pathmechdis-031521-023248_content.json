{"grounding": "Nerves not only regulate the homeostasis and energetic metabolism of normal epithelial cells but also are critical for cancer, as cancer recapitulates the biology of neural regulation of epithelial tissues. Cancer cells rarely develop in denervated organs, and denervation affects tumorigenesis, in vivo and in humans. Axonogenesis occurs to supply the new malignant epithelial growth with nerves. Neurogenesis happens later, first in ganglia around organs or the spinal column and subsequently through recruitment of neuroblasts from the central nervous system. The hallmark of this stage is regulation of homeostasis and energetic metabolism. Perineural invasion is the most efficient interaction between cancer cells and nerves. The hallmark of this stage is increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Finally, carcinoma cells transdifferentiate into a neuronal profile in search of neural independence. The latter is the last stage in neuroepithelial interactions. Treatments for cancer must address the biology of neural regulation of cancer.", "generated_text": "Neuroepithelial interactions play a pivotal role in the development and progression of cancer, particularly in the perineural space. Recent studies have highlighted the complex relationships between neurons, glial cells, and cancer cells, leading to the concept of the 'neurocancer axis'. This axis is characterized by the transdifferentiation of cancer cells into neuronal-like cells, promoting axonogenesis and the formation of perineural nets. These networks facilitate the spread of cancer cells along nerve fibers, contributing to the development of perineural invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, the interaction between cancer cells and neuronal cells can lead to the suppression of antitumor immune responses and the promotion of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuroepithelial interactions in cancer is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the neurocancer axis, including immunotherapies and targeted therapies aimed at disrupting perineural nets and promoting antitumor immune responses.", "label": 1}
