{"grounding": "Hepatocytes are the main workers in the hepatic factory, managing metabolism of nutrients and xenobiotics, production and recycling of proteins, and glucose and lipid homeostasis. Division of labor between hepatocytes is critical to coordinate complex complementary or opposing multistep processes, similar to distributed tasks at an assembly line. This so-called metabolic zonation has both spatial and temporal components. Spatial distribution of metabolic function in hepatocytes of different lobular zones is necessary to perform complex sequential multistep metabolic processes and to assign metabolic tasks to the right environment. Moreover, temporal control of metabolic processes is critical to align required metabolic processes to the feeding and fasting cycles. Disruption of this complex spatiotemporal hepatic organization impairs key metabolic processes with both local and systemic consequences. Many metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetes, are associated with impaired metabolic liver zonation. Recent technological advances shed new light on the spatiotemporal gene expression networks controlling liver function and how their deregulation may be involved in a large variety of diseases. We summarize the current knowledge about spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and consequences on liver pathobiology.", "generated_text": "Liver zonation, a spatially organized pattern of metabolic and functional specialization, plays a crucial role in maintaining hepatic homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of circadian rhythm in regulating metabolic processes, including those involved in liver function. The WNT signaling pathway, a key regulator of spatial organization, is also implicated in the establishment and maintenance of liver zonation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and its consequences on pathophysiology. We discuss the role of circadian rhythm in modulating metabolic processes, including hepatic detoxification, and the impact of liver zonation on the progression of monogenic diseases. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between spatial lobular organization and WNT signaling, highlighting the complex interplay between these factors in regulating liver function. Finally, we discuss the implications of chronopharmacology, the study of the time-dependent effects of drugs on liver function, and its potential applications in the treatment of liver diseases. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and its consequences on pathophysiology, highlighting the need for further research in this area.", "label": 1}
