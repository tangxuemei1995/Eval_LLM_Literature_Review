{"grounding": "Despite the advent of sophisticated and efficient new biologics to treat inflammation in asthma, the disease persists. Even following treatment, many patients still experience the well-known symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. What are we missing? Here we examine the evidence that mucus plugs contribute to a substantial portion of disease, not only by physically obstructing the airways but also by perpetuating inflammation. In this way, mucus plugs may act as an immunogenic stimulus even in the absence of allergen or with the use of current therapeutics. The alterations of several parameters of mucus biology, driven by type 2 inflammation, result in sticky and tenacious sputum, which represents a potent threat, first due to the difficulties in expectoration and second by acting as a platform for viral, bacterial, or fungal colonization that allows exacerbations. Therefore, in this way, mucus plugs are an overlooked but critical feature of asthmatic airway disease.", "generated_text": "Asthma is a complex and multifaceted respiratory disorder characterized by chronic inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and reversible airflow obstruction. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of mucus in asthma pathophysiology, with excessive mucus production contributing to airway obstruction and exacerbating symptoms. Galectin-10, a member of the galectin family, has emerged as a key player in regulating mucus production and inflammation in the airways. Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, also play a significant role in asthma pathogenesis, with their accumulation in the airways contributing to inflammation and tissue damage. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the pathology of asthma, with a focus on the role of mucus, galectin-10, and neutrophils in airway obstruction and inflammation. By elucidating the complex interactions between these key players, this review seeks to provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies for asthma management.", "label": 1}
