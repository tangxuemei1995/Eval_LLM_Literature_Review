{"grounding": "Tumor cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can function as mediators of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment. EVs contain a host of bioactive cargo, including membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins, in addition to noncoding RNAs, other RNA types, and double-stranded DNA fragments. These shed vesicles may deposit paracrine information and can also be taken up by stromal cells, causing the recipient cells to undergo phenotypic changes that profoundly impact diverse facets of cancer progression. For example, this unique form of cellular cross talk helps condition the premetastatic niche, facilitates evasion of the immune response, and promotes invasive and metastatic activity. These findings, coupled with those demonstrating that the number and content of EVs produced by tumors can vary depending on their tumor of origin, disease stage, or response to therapy, have raised the exciting possibility that EVs can be used for risk stratification, diagnostic, and even prognostic purposes. We summarize recent developments and the current knowledge of EV cargoes, their impact on disease progression, and implementation of EV-based liquid biopsies as tumor biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are released by tumor cells and play a crucial role in modulating the tumor microenvironment. These multifunctional entities can carry a wide range of cargoes, including proteins, RNAs, and lipids, which enable them to interact with and influence various cell types, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating cells. The interaction between EVs and these cells can promote cell migration and invasion, contributing to tumor progression. Furthermore, EVs can also modulate the immune response, influencing the tumor microenvironment and potentially leading to immune evasion. Recent studies have also highlighted the potential of EVs as a diagnostic tool, with liquid biopsies emerging as a promising approach for non-invasive monitoring of tumor burden and response to therapy. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of EVs in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting their role in tumor progression, immune modulation, and potential applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy.", "label": 1}
