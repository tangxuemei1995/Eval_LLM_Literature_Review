{"grounding": "Metastatic dissemination has lethal consequences for cancer patients. Accruing evidence supports the hypothesis that tumor cells can migrate and metastasize as clusters of cells while maintaining contacts with one another. Collective metastasis enables tumor cells to colonize secondary sites more efficiently, resist cell death, and evade the immune system. On the other hand, tumor cell clusters face unique challenges for dissemination particularly during systemic dissemination. Here, we review recent progress toward understanding how tumor cell clusters overcome these disadvantages as well as mechanisms they utilize to gain advantages throughout the metastatic process. We consider useful models for studying collective metastasis and reflect on how the study of collective metastasis suggests new opportunities for eradicating and preventing metastatic disease.", "generated_text": "Tumor cell clusters have been increasingly recognized as key drivers of collective migration and metastasis in cancer progression. Through the orchestration of collective signaling, these clusters facilitate the coordinated movement of individual cells, enabling the formation of polyclonal seedings in distant organs. This process is mediated by the exchange of soluble factors, cell-cell interactions, and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The collective migration of tumor cell clusters is further enhanced by the presence of circulating tumor cell clusters in the bloodstream, which can serve as a reservoir for metastatic cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying collective metastasis is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the orchestration of tumor cell clusters.", "label": 0}
