{"grounding": "Reprogrammed metabolism is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC cells are geared toward rapid proliferation, requiring nutrients and the removal of cellular waste in nutrient-poor environments. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs), the primary cell of origin for CRCs, must adapt their metabolism along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to the unique features of their complex microenvironment that include interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, stromal cells, commensal microbes, and dietary components. Emerging evidence implicates modifiable risk factors related to the environment, such as diet, as important in CRC pathogenesis. Here, we focus on describing the metabolism of ISCs, diets that influence CRC initiation, CRC genetics and metabolism, and the tumor microenvironment. The mechanistic links between environmental factors, metabolic adaptations, and the tumor microenvironment in enhancing or supporting CRC tumorigenesis are becoming better understood. Thus, greater knowledge of CRC metabolism holds promise for improved prevention and treatment.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between metabolism and colorectal cancer has been a subject of increasing interest in recent years. Alterations in metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in energy production and nutrient processing, have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. A growing body of evidence suggests that dietary factors, such as a high-fat diet and low-fiber intake, can disrupt the balance of the gut microbiome, leading to changes in metabolic function and increasing the risk of colorectal cancer. Conversely, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been shown to promote a healthy gut microbiome and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the metabolic mechanisms underlying colorectal cancer and the role of the gut microbiome in modulating metabolic function. The findings of this review have important implications for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.", "label": 1}
