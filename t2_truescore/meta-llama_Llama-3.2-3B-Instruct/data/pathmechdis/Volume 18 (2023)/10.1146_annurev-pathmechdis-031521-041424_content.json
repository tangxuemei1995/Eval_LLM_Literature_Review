{"grounding": "Human papillomavirus\u2013positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-OPSCC) has one of the most rapidly increasing incidences of any cancer in high-income countries. The most recent (8th) edition of the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system separates HPV-OPSCC from its HPV-negative counterpart to account for the improved prognosis seen in the former. Indeed, owing to its improved prognosis and greater prevalence in younger individuals, numerous ongoing trials are examining the potential for treatment deintensification as a means to improve quality of life while maintaining acceptable survival outcomes. Owing to the distinct biology of HPV-OPSCCs, targeted therapies and immunotherapies have become an area of particular interest. Importantly, OPSCC is often detected at an advanced stage, highlighting the need for diagnostic biomarkers to aid in earlier detection. In this review, we highlight important advances in the epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and clinical management of HPV-OPSCC and underscore the need for a progressive understanding of the molecular basis of this disease toward early detection and precision care.", "generated_text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal carcinomas have emerged as a distinct entity within head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), exhibiting unique clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics. This review aims to provide an in-depth examination of the epidemiology, risk factors, and molecular mechanisms underlying HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas, with a special focus on nonkeratinizing lesions. The role of HPV in modulating immune responses and evading immune surveillance is discussed, highlighting the concept of immune escape. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics, including HPV DNA testing and next-generation sequencing, have improved the detection and characterization of HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas. The implications of these findings for clinical management, including the potential for improved treatment outcomes and reduced mortality, are also explored. Overall, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between HPV, the host immune system, and the development of oropharyngeal carcinomas, with implications for future research and clinical practice.", "label": 1}
