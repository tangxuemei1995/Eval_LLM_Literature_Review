{"grounding": "The first generation of stars, often called Population III (or Pop III), form from metal-free primordial gas at redshifts z \u223c 30 and below. They dominate the cosmic star-formation history until z \u223c 15\u201320, at which point the formation of metal-enriched Population II stars takes over. We review current theoretical models for the formation, properties, and impact of Pop III stars and discuss existing and future observational constraints. Key takeaways from this review include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tPrimordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III stars form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFeedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation, but major uncertainties remain regarding its immediate impact.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIn extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 105M\u2299. Their remnants may be the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDirect observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe remain extremely challenging. Indirect constraints from the global 21-cm signal or gravitational waves are more promising.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tStellar archeological surveys allow us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of the first stars in the universe is a pivotal event in the evolution of galaxies and the cosmos as a whole. Through a comprehensive review of the latest research in cosmology and astrophysics, this abstract provides an overview of the current understanding of the first stars, including their formation mechanisms, properties, and impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. The first stars, comprising the first and second stellar populations, are believed to have formed in the high-redshift Universe, approximately 13.5 billion years ago. These ancient stars are thought to have been Population III and II, with the latter being the first stars to undergo significant chemical enrichment. The formation of the first stars is closely tied to the process of galaxy assembly and the regulation of star formation. This abstract highlights the key findings from recent studies, including the detection of high-redshift galaxies and the analysis of their stellar populations. The impact of the first stars on the formation of subsequent generations of stars and the evolution of galaxies is also discussed, with implications for our understanding of the cosmic dawn and the early universe. By synthesizing the latest research in this field, this abstract provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on the first stars and their role in shaping the universe as we know it today.", "label": 1}
