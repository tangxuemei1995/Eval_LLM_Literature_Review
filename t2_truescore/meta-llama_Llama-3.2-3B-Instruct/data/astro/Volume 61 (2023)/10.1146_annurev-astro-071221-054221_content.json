{"grounding": "Interstellar interlopers are bodies formed outside of the Solar System but observed passing through it. The first two identified interlopers, 1I/\u2018Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited unexpectedly different physical properties. 1I/\u2018Oumuamua appeared unresolved and asteroid-like, whereas 2I/Borisov was a more comet-like source of both gas and dust. Both objects moved under the action of nongravitational acceleration. These interlopers and their divergent properties provide our only window so far onto an enormous and previously unknown galactic population. The number density of such objects is \u223c0.1 AU\u22123 which, if uniform across the galactic disk, would imply 1025 to 1026 similar objects in the Milky Way. The interlopers likely formed in, and were ejected from, the protoplanetary disks of young stars. However, we currently possess too little data to firmly reject other explanations.", "generated_text": "The Interstellar Interlopers explores the phenomenon of comets originating from the interstellar medium and perturbing the formation of protoplanetary disks around young stars. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and simulations, this study reveals the complex dynamics governing the capture and ejection of cometary bodies from interstellar space. The findings suggest that interstellar interlopers can significantly impact the growth and evolution of planetary systems, potentially influencing the delivery of volatile compounds and organic molecules to terrestrial planets. The research highlights the need for further investigation into the role of interstellar comets in shaping the architecture of protoplanetary systems and the potential for their discovery to provide insights into the early history of our solar system.", "label": 0}
