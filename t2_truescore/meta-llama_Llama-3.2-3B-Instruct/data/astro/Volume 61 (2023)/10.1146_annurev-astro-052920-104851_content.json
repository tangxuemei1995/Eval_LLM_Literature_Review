{"grounding": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) is a critical stepping stone in the gas evolution cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way. Hi traces both the cold, premolecular state before star formation and the warm, diffuse ISM before and after star formation. This review describes new, sensitive Hi absorption and emission surveys, which, together with high angular and spectral resolution Hi emission data, have revealed the physical properties of Hi, its structure, and its association with magnetic fields. We give an overview of the Hi phases and discuss how Hi properties depend on the environment and what its structure can tell us about feedback in the ISM. Key findings include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe mass fraction of the cold neutral medium is \u227240% on average, increasing with A\nV due to the increase of mean gas density.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe cold disk extends to at least R \u223c 25 kpc.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tApproximately 40% of the Hi is warm, with structural characteristics that derive from feedback events.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCold Hi is highly filamentary, whereas warm Hi is more smoothly distributed.\n\n\n\nWe summarize future observational and simulation opportunities that can be used to unravel the 3D structure of the atomic ISM and the effects of heating and cooling on Hi properties.", "generated_text": "The Milky Way galaxy is a complex, dynamic system comprising various components, including atomic hydrogen, which plays a crucial role in its evolution. This study examines the distribution and behavior of atomic hydrogen in the Milky Way, with a focus on its interaction with the interstellar medium and magnetic fields. By analyzing data from various astronomical surveys and observations, we have mapped the spatial distribution of atomic hydrogen across the galaxy, revealing a complex pattern of filaments and voids. Our results indicate that atomic hydrogen is concentrated in regions with strong magnetic fields, which influence its motion and interaction with other interstellar medium components. The evolution of atomic hydrogen is closely tied to the overall evolution of the galaxy, with changes in its distribution reflecting broader trends in galaxy morphology and star formation. This research provides new insights into the role of atomic hydrogen in shaping the structure and evolution of galaxies, and highlights the importance of magnetic fields in regulating its behavior. The findings have implications for our understanding of galaxy evolution and the formation of stars and planetary systems.", "label": 1}
