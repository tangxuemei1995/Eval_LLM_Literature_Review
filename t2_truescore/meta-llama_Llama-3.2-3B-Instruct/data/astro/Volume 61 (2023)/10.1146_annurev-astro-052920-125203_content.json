{"grounding": "Spurred by rich, multiwavelength observations and enabled by new simulations, ranging from cosmological to subparsec scales, the past decade has seen major theoretical progress in our understanding of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We review key physical processes in the CGM. Our conclusions include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe properties of the CGM depend on a competition between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. When cooling is slow relative to free fall, the gas is hot (roughly virial temperature), whereas the gas is cold (T \u223c 104 K) when cooling is rapid.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGas inflows and outflows play crucial roles, as does the cosmological environment. Large-scale structure collimates cold streams and provides angular momentum. Satellite galaxies contribute to the CGM through winds and gas stripping.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIn multiphase gas, the hot and cold phases continuously exchange mass, energy, and momentum. The interaction between turbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical. A broad spectrum of cold gas structures, going down to subparsec scales, arises from fragmentation, coagulation, and condensation onto gas clouds.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMagnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays can substantially modify how the cold and hot phases interact, although microphysical uncertainties are presently large.\n\n\nKey open questions for future work include the mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics, and how the CGM affects the evolution of galaxies.", "generated_text": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the diffuse, ionized gas that surrounds galaxies, playing a crucial role in their formation and evolution. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of key physical processes in shaping the CGM, including hydrodynamic and thermodynamic interactions between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the galaxy's hot halo. These interactions can lead to the formation of complex plasma structures, such as filaments and bubbles, which in turn influence the galaxy's growth and evolution. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of key physical processes in the CGM, including the role of hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and radiative processes in shaping the CGM's morphology and composition. We also discuss the implications of these processes for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, including the regulation of star formation and the distribution of metals. By integrating insights from cosmological simulations, observations of galaxy clusters and large-scale structure, and laboratory experiments, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex physical processes that govern the CGM. Our review highlights the need for further research into the CGM's role in shaping the universe's large-scale structure and the formation of galaxies.", "label": 1}
