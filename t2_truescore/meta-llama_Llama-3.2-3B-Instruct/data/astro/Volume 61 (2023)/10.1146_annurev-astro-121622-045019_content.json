{"grounding": "After decades of fast-paced technical advances, optical/infrared (O/IR) interferometry has seen a revolution in recent years:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with four 8-m telescopes reaches thousand-times-fainter objects than possible with earlier interferometers, and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array (CHARA) routinely offers up to 330-m baselines and aperture synthesis with six 1-m telescopes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe observed objects are fainter than 19 mag, the images have submilliarcsecond resolution, and the astrometry reaches microarcsecond precision.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThis led to breakthrough results on the Galactic Center, exoplanets, active galactic nuclei, young stellar objects, and stellar physics.\n\n\n\nFollowing a primer in interferometry, we summarize the advances that led to the performance boost of modern interferometers:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSingle-mode beam combiners now combine up to six telescopes, and image reconstruction software has advanced over earlier developments for radio interferometry.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWith a combination of large telescopes, adaptive optics (AO), fringe tracking, and especially dual-beam interferometry, GRAVITY has boosted the sensitivity by many orders of magnitude.\n\n\n\nAnother order-of-magnitude improvement will come from laser guide star AO. In combination with large separation fringe tracking, O/IR interferometry will then provide complete sky coverage for observations in the Galactic plane and substantial coverage for extragalactic targets.", "generated_text": "Advances in optical/infrared interferometry have significantly expanded our understanding of various astrophysical phenomena, from the intricate dynamics of the Galactic Center to the detection of exoplanets and the study of young stellar objects. Recent breakthroughs in instrumentation have enabled the formation of high-contrast images and spectroscopic measurements, allowing researchers to probe the properties of active galactic nuclei and the circumstellar environments of stars. The development of advanced wavefront sensing and control systems has improved the precision and stability of interferometric observations, facilitating the detection of exoplanets and the characterization of their host stars. Furthermore, the integration of optical/infrared interferometry with other observational techniques, such as spectroscopy and imaging, has enabled the study of complex astrophysical phenomena, including the formation of young stellar objects and the evolution of galaxies. This review highlights the current state of the field, discussing recent advances in instrumentation, data analysis, and theoretical modeling, and exploring the potential applications of optical/infrared interferometry in the study of the universe, from the Galactic Center to the detection of exoplanets and the study of young stellar objects.", "label": 1}
