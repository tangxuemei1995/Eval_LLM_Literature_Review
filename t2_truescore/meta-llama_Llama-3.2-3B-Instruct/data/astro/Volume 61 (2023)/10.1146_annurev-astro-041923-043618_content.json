{"grounding": "We review the progress in modeling the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations of the \u039bCDM cosmogony. State-of-the-art simulations now broadly reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies; the distributions of key characteristics, such as mass, size, and SFR; and scaling relations connecting diverse properties to mass. Such improvements engender confidence in the insight drawn from simulations. Many important outcomes, however, particularly the properties of circumgalactic gas, are sensitive to the details of the subgrid models used to approximate the macroscopic effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback processes. We compare the outcomes of leading simulation suites with observations, and with each other, to identify the enduring successes they have cultivated and the outstanding challenges to be tackled with the next generation of models. Our key conclusions include the following:", "generated_text": "This review article highlights the advancements and limitations of hydrodynamical simulations in modeling galaxy populations. By leveraging cutting-edge numerical techniques and high-performance computing, simulations have successfully reproduced the observed morphology, kinematics, and chemical properties of galaxies. Notably, simulations have reproduced the formation of galaxy halos, the regulation of gas accretion, and the role of mergers in shaping galaxy evolution. However, significant challenges persist, including the treatment of dark matter, the implementation of realistic star formation and feedback mechanisms, and the accurate modeling of galaxy interactions. Despite these challenges, hydrodynamical simulations remain a crucial tool for understanding the complex dynamics of galaxy populations and predicting their future evolution.", "label": 1}
