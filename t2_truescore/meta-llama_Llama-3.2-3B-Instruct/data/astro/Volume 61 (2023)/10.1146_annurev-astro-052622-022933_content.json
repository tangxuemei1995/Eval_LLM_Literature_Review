{"grounding": "We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in big disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCircumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at P\nb (the binary period) or \u223c5P\nb, depending on the binary eccentricity e\nb and mass ratio q\nb.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical processes (e.g., planet migration) taking place in the disk.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tOver long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary parameters (e\nb and q\nb) and on the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tA misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when e\nb is significant, the disk can evolve toward \u201cpolar alignment,\u201d with the disk plane perpendicular to the binary plane.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Circumbinary accretion refers to the process of material accumulation around binary star systems, which can ultimately lead to the formation of massive binary black holes. This phenomenon is of great interest in the fields of star formation, black hole physics, and exoplanetary science. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the current understanding of circumbinary accretion, from the early stages of binary star formation to the final stages of black hole growth. Our analysis reveals that the accretion process is influenced by various factors, including the mass ratio of the binary components, the presence of a protoplanetary disk, and the hydrodynamic interactions between the accretion disk and the binary system. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of star formation and the formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for circumbinary accretion to produce exoplanets and the role of this process in shaping the evolution of binary star systems. Our research highlights the complex interplay between binary star dynamics, accretion disk physics, and the growth of black holes, and underscores the need for further studies to fully elucidate the mechanisms governing circumbinary accretion.", "label": 1}
