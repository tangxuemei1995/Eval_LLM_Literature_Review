{"grounding": "Quasars at cosmic dawn provide powerful probes of the formation and growth of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the Universe, their connections to galaxy and structure formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). Hundreds of quasars have been discovered in the first billion years of cosmic history, with the quasar redshift frontier extended to z \u223c 7.6. Observations of quasars at cosmic dawn show the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe number density of luminous quasars declines exponentially at z > 5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerge at z \u223c 10; the lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution indicates a rapid buildup of the active galactic nucleus environment.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tBillion-solar-mass black holes (BHs) already exist at z > 7.5; they must form and grow in less than 700 Myr, by a combination of massive early BH seeds with highly efficient and sustained accretion.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe rapid quasar growth is accompanied by strong star formation and feedback activity in their host galaxies, which show diverse morphological and kinetic properties, with typical dynamical mass lower than that implied by the local BH/galaxy scaling relations.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tHi absorption in quasar spectra probes the tail end of cosmic reionization at z \u223c 5.3\u20136 and indicates the EoR midpoint at 6.9 < z < 7.6, with large spatial fluctuations in IGM ionization. Observations of heavy element absorption lines suggest that the circumgalactic medium also experiences evolution in its ionization structure and metal enrichment during the EoR.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The epoch of cosmic dawn marks a pivotal moment in the history of the universe, where the first stars and galaxies began to form and ionize the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). Quasars, incredibly luminous objects thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies, played a crucial role in this process. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this abstract aims to synthesize our current understanding of the interplay between quasars and the IGM at cosmic dawn. Research suggests that the growth of SMBHs during this period was closely tied to the formation and evolution of galaxies, with quasars serving as a key driver of galaxy evolution. The intense radiation emitted by quasars is believed to have triggered the reionization of the IGM, a process that had a profound impact on the large-scale structure of the universe. Studies of quasar spectra and IGM absorption lines have provided valuable insights into the physical conditions of the IGM at cosmic dawn. These observations have revealed a complex interplay between the IGM and the surrounding galaxy, with the IGM playing a crucial role in regulating the growth of SMBHs. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on quasars and the IGM at cosmic dawn, highlighting the key findings and open questions in this rapidly evolving field. By exploring the complex relationships between quasars, galaxies, and the IGM, this review seeks to shed new light on the early universe and the formation of the first stars and galaxies.", "label": 1}
