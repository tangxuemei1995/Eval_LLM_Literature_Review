{"grounding": "Planets form in disks of gas and dust around young stars. The disk molecular reservoirs and their chemical evolution affect all aspects of planet formation, from the coagulation of dust grains into pebbles to the elemental and molecular compositions of the mature planet. Disk chemistry also enables unique probes of disk structures and dynamics, including those directly linked to ongoing planet formation. We review the protoplanetary disk chemistry of the volatile elements H, O, C, N, S, and P; the associated observational and theoretical methods; and the links between disk and planet chemical compositions. Three takeaways from this review are:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe disk chemical composition, including the organic reservoirs, is set by both inheritance and in situ chemistry.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDisk gas and solid O/C/N/H elemental ratios often deviate from stellar values due to a combination of condensation of molecular carriers, chemistry, and dynamics.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChemical, physical, and dynamical processes in disks are closely linked, which complicates disk chemistry modeling, but these links also present an opportunity to develop chemical probes of different aspects of disk evolution and planet formation.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of planets and the origins of life in the universe are deeply intertwined with the chemical processes that occur within protoplanetary disks. These disks, the precursors to planetary systems, are dynamic environments where gas and dust interact, leading to the formation of complex molecules and the delivery of organic materials to nascent planets. This review article provides an overview of the current state of knowledge in protoplanetary disk chemistry, with a focus on the key chemical processes that shape the composition of these disks. From the formation of simple molecules such as water and ammonia, to the more complex molecules like amino acids and sugars, we examine the role of radiation, shock waves, and grain surface chemistry in shaping the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks. We also discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of planet formation and the origins of life in the universe, highlighting the potential for astrochemical studies to provide insights into the complex interplay between chemistry, physics, and biology in the early universe.", "label": 1}
