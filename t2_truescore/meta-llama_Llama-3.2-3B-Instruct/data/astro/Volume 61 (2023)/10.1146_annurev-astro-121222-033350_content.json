{"grounding": "This article depicts my life and career over the past decades, beginning with my birth in 1927 and ending in my two dreams yet to be realized. This article focuses on my school years during wartime and my work with Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) from 1951 on\u2014serving as Director of SHAO during 1981\u20131993 and a Member of CAS since 1980\u2014and shares some social activities I've been involved in for the benefits of women and children. Special focus is given to the endeavors of building one of the world's most precise Universal Time systems in the 1960s, a very long baseline interferometry network, a satellite laser ranging research station during the 1970s\u20131990s, and the 65-m Radio Telescope in the early twenty-first century; developing astro-geodynamics in China and advancing the Asia-Pacific Space Geodynamics Program in the late twentieth century; and leading SHAO in international cooperation while serving as Chair of the International Astronomical Union Finance Committee during 1985\u20131988, the IAU Vice-President during 1988\u20131994, and a foreign fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society of Britain in 1985. This autobiographical account should, hopefully, serve its purpose of offering a glimpse of me and my lifelong interaction with time and space.", "generated_text": "This autobiography chronicles the author's journey as a strategic scientist, traversing the realms of time and space. Born in China, the author's fascination with the mysteries of the universe led them to pursue a career in radio astronomy. Through their work in VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry), the author gained unparalleled insights into the dynamic interplay between the Earth's crust and the universe. Astro-geodynamics, a field that seeks to understand the intricate relationships between celestial bodies and the Earth's interior, became a central focus of their research. International cooperation played a pivotal role in the author's work, as collaborations with scientists from around the world enabled the advancement of deep space exploration. This narrative weaves together the author's personal experiences, scientific discoveries, and the broader context of China's contributions to the field. By exploring the intersections of time, space, and human endeavor, this autobiography offers a unique perspective on the evolution of strategic science and its potential to shape our understanding of the cosmos.", "label": 1}
