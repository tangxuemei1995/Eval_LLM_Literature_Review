{"grounding": "Global health security threats and the public health impact resulting from emerging infectious diseases including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent Ebola virus disease outbreaks continuously emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to preparedness, management of disease outbreaks, and health sequelae associated with emergent pathogens. A spectrum of associated ophthalmic manifestations, along with the potential persistence of emerging viral pathogens in ocular tissues, highlight the importance of an ophthalmic approach to contributing to efforts in the response to public health emergencies from disease outbreaks. This article summarizes the ophthalmic and systemic findings, epidemiology, and therapeutics for emerging viral pathogens identified by the World Health Organization as high-priority pathogens with epidemic potential.", "generated_text": "Emerging pathogenic viral infections of the eye pose significant threats to global public health. This review highlights the recent surge in viral infections causing uveitis and other ophthalmic manifestations, including COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease. Viral persistence and reactivation have been implicated in the development of ocular complications. The literature reveals a range of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses, capable of inducing severe ocular inflammation and damage. Understanding the mechanisms of viral persistence and the pathogenesis of ophthalmic manifestations is crucial for the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Early detection and treatment are essential to prevent long-term vision loss and blindness.", "label": 1}
