{"grounding": "Perception and memory are traditionally thought of as separate cognitive functions, supported by distinct brain regions. The canonical perspective is that perceptual processing of visual information is supported by the ventral visual stream, whereas long-term declarative memory is supported by the medial temporal lobe. However, this modular framework cannot account for the increasingly large body of evidence that reveals a role for early visual areas in long-term recognition memory and a role for medial temporal lobe structures in high-level perceptual processing. In this article, we review relevant research conducted in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. We conclude that the evidence is largely inconsistent with theoretical proposals that draw sharp functional boundaries between perceptual and memory systems in the brain. Instead, the weight of the empirical findings is best captured by a representational-hierarchical model that emphasizes differences in content, rather than in cognitive processes within the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe.", "generated_text": "The ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe play crucial roles in the processing and storage of visual information, with a significant impact on perception and memory. Research has shown that the ventral visual stream, particularly the perirhinal cortex, is involved in the formation and retrieval of episodic memories, while the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, is essential for the consolidation of new information into long-term memory. Studies utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have demonstrated that the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe exhibit synchronized activity during visual perception and memory tasks, suggesting a close relationship between these brain regions. This abstract reviews the current literature on the neural mechanisms underlying perception and memory in the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe, highlighting the importance of these regions in the formation and retrieval of visual memories.", "label": 1}
