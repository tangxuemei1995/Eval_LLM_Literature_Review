{"grounding": "This review examines the concept of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in patients with macular diseases. Considering monocular and binocular viewing, we (a) explain how to identify the PRL and discuss the pitfalls associated with its measurement, (b) review the current hypotheses for PRL development, (c) assess whether the PRL is the new reference point of the ocular motor system, and discuss (d) the functional and (e) the clinical implications of the PRL. We conclude that the current definition of the PRL is probably incomplete and should incorporate the need to evaluate the PRL in the framework of binocular viewing. We emphasize the need for more research.", "generated_text": "The preferred retinal locus (PRL) is a critical concept in understanding visual perception and adaptation in individuals with central vision loss, such as those affected by macular degeneration. Research has shown that the PRL is a region of the retina that is most sensitive to visual stimuli, and its location can significantly impact fixation stability and binocular viewing. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with PRLs exhibit improved fixation stability and reduced visual discomfort when viewing through their preferred retinal locus, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for improving visual function in individuals with central vision loss. Further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying PRLs and their implications for visual rehabilitation.", "label": 1}
