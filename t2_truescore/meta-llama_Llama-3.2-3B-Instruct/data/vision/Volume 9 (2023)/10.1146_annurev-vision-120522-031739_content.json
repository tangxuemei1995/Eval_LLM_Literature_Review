{"grounding": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are machine learning algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision due to their remarkable successes in tasks like object classification and segmentation. The success of DNNs as computer vision algorithms has led to the suggestion that DNNs may also be good models of human visual perception. In this article, we review evidence regarding current DNNs as adequate behavioral models of human core object recognition. To this end, we argue that it is important to distinguish between statistical tools and computational models and to understand model quality as a multidimensional concept in which clarity about modeling goals is key. Reviewing a large number of psychophysical and computational explorations of core object recognition performance in humans and DNNs, we argue that DNNs are highly valuable scientific tools but that, as of today, DNNs should only be regarded as promising\u2014but not yet adequate\u2014computational models of human core object recognition behavior. On the way, we dispel several myths surrounding DNNs in vision science.", "generated_text": "The increasing success of deep neural networks in various visual perception tasks has led to their widespread adoption as behavioral models of human visual perception. However, the adequacy of these models remains a topic of debate. This review synthesizes the current state of research on the strengths and limitations of deep neural networks in modeling human visual perception, with a focus on object recognition. We examine the empirical evidence supporting the use of deep neural networks in visual psychophysics, including their ability to replicate human performance in tasks such as object recognition and feature extraction. We also discuss the limitations of these models, including their reliance on large amounts of training data and their failure to capture the underlying cognitive mechanisms of human visual perception. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of deep neural networks in modeling human visual perception and to identify areas for future research in this field.", "label": 1}
