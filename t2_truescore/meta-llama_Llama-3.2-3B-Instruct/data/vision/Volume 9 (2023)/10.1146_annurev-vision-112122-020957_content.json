{"grounding": "Rod and cone photoreceptors degenerate in retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, robbing the visual system of light-triggered signals necessary for sight. However, changes in the retina do not stop with the photoreceptors. A stereotypical set of morphological and physiological changes, known as remodeling, occur in downstream retinal neurons. Some aspects of remodeling are homeostatic, with structural or functional changes compensating for partial loss of visual inputs. However, other aspects are nonhomeostatic, corrupting retinal information processing to obscure vision mediated naturally by surviving photoreceptors or artificially by vision-restoration technologies. In this review, I consider the mechanism of remodeling and its consequences for residual and restored visual function; discuss the role of retinoic acid, a critical molecular trigger of detrimental remodeling; and discuss strategies for suppressing retinoic acid biosynthesis or signaling as therapeutic possibilities for mitigating vision loss.", "generated_text": "Photoreceptor degenerative disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, are characterized by progressive vision loss and blindness. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of retinal remodeling in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Retinal remodeling involves the reorganization of retinal circuits, leading to the loss of photoreceptor function and synaptic connections. To mitigate vision loss, suppressing retinal remodeling is a promising therapeutic strategy. This review aims to discuss the current understanding of retinal remodeling in photoreceptor degenerative disorders, with a focus on synaptic plasticity and its role in retinal circuit reorganization. We also explore the potential therapeutic approaches to suppress retinal remodeling, including pharmacological and optogenetic interventions. By understanding the mechanisms underlying retinal remodeling, we can develop novel treatments to preserve photoreceptor function and prevent vision loss in these devastating disorders.", "label": 1}
