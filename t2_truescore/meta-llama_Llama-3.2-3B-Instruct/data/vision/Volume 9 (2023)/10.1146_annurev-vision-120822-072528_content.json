{"grounding": "As we navigate and behave in the world, we are constantly deciding, a few times per second, where to look next. The outcomes of these decisions in response to visual input are comparatively easy to measure as trajectories of eye movements, offering insight into many unconscious and conscious visual and cognitive processes. In this article, we review recent advances in predicting where we look. We focus on evaluating and comparing models: How can we consistently measure how well models predict eye movements, and how can we judge the contribution of different mechanisms? Probabilistic models facilitate a unified approach to fixation prediction that allows us to use explainable information explained to compare different models across different settings, such as static and video saliency, as well as scanpath prediction. We review how the large variety of saliency maps and scanpath models can be translated into this unifying framework, how much different factors contribute, and how we can select the most informative examples for model comparison. We conclude that the universal scale of information gain offers a powerful tool for the inspection of candidate mechanisms and experimental design that helps us understand the continual decision-making process that determines where we look.", "generated_text": "Predicting visual fixations is a fundamental problem in computer vision and neuroscience, with applications in human-computer interaction, visual attention, and cognitive psychology. This study presents a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in visual fixation prediction, highlighting the key challenges, methodologies, and findings. We provide a unifying framework that integrates information-theoretic and machine learning approaches, including saliency models, eye movement analysis, and transfer learning. Our analysis reveals that saliency-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in benchmarking datasets, but often rely on task-specific features and suffer from limited transferability. In contrast, models incorporating eye movement analysis and information-theoretic measures have shown promising results in predicting fixations across different tasks and datasets. We propose a novel taxonomy of visual fixation prediction methods, categorizing them into three main groups: saliency-based, eye movement-based, and hybrid approaches. Our findings highlight the need for a more unified framework that can effectively leverage the strengths of each approach. By providing a comprehensive review and a unifying framework, this study aims to facilitate future research in visual fixation prediction and promote the development of more accurate and transferable models.", "label": 1}
