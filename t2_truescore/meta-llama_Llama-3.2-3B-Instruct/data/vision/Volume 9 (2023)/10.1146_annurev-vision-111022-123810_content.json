{"grounding": "Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) is clinically diagnosed as a vascular disease, many studies find retinal neuronal and visual dysfunction before the onset of vascular DR. This suggests that DR should be viewed as a neurovascular disease. Prior to the onset of DR, human patients have compromised electroretinograms that indicate a disruption of normal function, particularly in the inner retina. They also exhibit reduced contrast sensitivity. These early changes, especially those due to dysfunction in the inner retina, are also seen in rodent models of diabetes in the early stages of the disease. Rodent models of diabetes exhibit several neuronal mechanisms, such as reduced evoked GABA release, increased excitatory glutamate signaling, and reduced dopamine signaling, that suggest specific neuronal deficits. This suggests that understanding neuronal deficits may lead to early diabetes treatments to ameliorate neuronal dysfunction.", "generated_text": "Visual dysfunction is a common complication of diabetes, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. This condition is characterized by damage to the retina, leading to impaired visual acuity and increased risk of blindness. Research in both human and animal models has elucidated the underlying physiological mechanisms contributing to visual dysfunction in diabetes. Studies using rodent models, including mice and rats, have demonstrated that hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation disrupt retinal neuronal function, resulting in photoreceptor degeneration and visual impairment. In contrast, human studies have shown that diabetic retinopathy is associated with altered retinal blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and impaired neuronal survival. Understanding the complex interplay between diabetes, retinal physiology, and visual function is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat visual dysfunction in diabetes.", "label": 1}
