{"grounding": "Inherited and age-associated vision loss is often associated with degeneration of the cells of the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. The mammalian retina, being a postmitotic neural tissue, does not have the capacity to repair itself through endogenous regeneration. There has been considerable excitement for the development of cell replacement approaches since the isolation and development of culture methods for human pluripotent stem cells, as well as the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. This has now been combined with novel three-dimensional organoid culture systems that closely mimic human retinal development in vitro. In this review, we cover the current state of the field, with emphasis on the cell delivery challenges, role of the recipient immunological microenvironment, and challenges related to connectivity between transplanted cells and host circuitry both locally and centrally to the different areas of the brain.", "generated_text": "Retinal degeneration is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, with limited treatment options available. Stem cell-based regenerative approaches have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to replace or repair damaged retinal cells. This review examines the key factors influencing the efficacy of stem cell-based therapies in retinal degeneration, with a focus on the role of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, ganglion cells, and immune microenvironment. Pluripotent stem cells, derived from embryonic or induced pluripotent sources, have shown potential in replacing RPE cells and promoting photoreceptor regeneration. However, the integration of transplanted stem cells into the host retina is hindered by the immune microenvironment, which must be modulated to prevent rejection and promote engraftment. Understanding the complex interactions between stem cells, RPE, photoreceptors, and immune cells is crucial for the development of effective stem cell-based therapies for retinal degeneration.", "label": 1}
