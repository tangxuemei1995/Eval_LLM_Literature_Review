{"grounding": "The basal ganglia (BG) make up a prominent nexus between visual and motor-related brain regions. In contrast to the BG's well-established roles in movement control and value-based decision making, their contributions to the transformation of visual input into an action remain unclear, especially in the context of perceptual decisions based on uncertain visual evidence. This article reviews recent progress in our understanding of the BG's contributions to the formation, evaluation, and adjustment of such decisions. From theoretical and experimental perspectives, the review focuses on four key stations in the BG network, namely, the striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons, which can have different roles and together support the decision process.", "generated_text": "The basal ganglia, a complex neural circuit, plays a crucial role in modulating visual perceptual decisions. Recent studies have employed sequential analysis and signal detection theory to investigate the contributions of the striatum and pallidum to saccadic choices and reaction times. Our analysis reveals that the basal ganglia modulate the accuracy of visual perceptual decisions by influencing the neural representation of sensory information. Specifically, the striatum is involved in the detection of relevant stimuli, while the pallidum modulates the response time. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual decisions and have implications for our understanding of the basal ganglia's role in cognition and behavior.", "label": 1}
