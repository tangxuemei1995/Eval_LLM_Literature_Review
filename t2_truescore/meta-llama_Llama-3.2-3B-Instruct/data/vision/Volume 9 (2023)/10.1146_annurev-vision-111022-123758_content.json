{"grounding": "Augmented reality (AR) systems aim to alter our view of the world and enable us to see things that are not actually there. The resulting discrepancy between perception and reality can create compelling entertainment and can support innovative approaches to education, guidance, and assistive tools. However, building an AR system that effectively integrates with our natural visual experience is hard. AR systems often suffer from visual limitations and artifacts, and addressing these flaws requires basic knowledge of perception. At the same time, AR system development can serve as a catalyst that drives innovative new research in perceptual science. This review describes recent perceptual research pertinent to and driven by modern AR systems, with the goal of highlighting thought-provoking areas of inquiry and open questions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the perceptual science of augmented reality, examining how display systems influence visual perception in AR environments. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the effects of display characteristics on user experience. Results show that display systems can significantly impact AR perception, with differences in display resolution, refresh rate, and color gamut affecting user performance and comfort. The findings highlight the importance of considering display systems in the design of AR applications, particularly in applications requiring high levels of visual fidelity and accuracy. The study contributes to our understanding of the perceptual science of AR, providing insights for the development of more effective and user-friendly AR systems.", "label": 0}
