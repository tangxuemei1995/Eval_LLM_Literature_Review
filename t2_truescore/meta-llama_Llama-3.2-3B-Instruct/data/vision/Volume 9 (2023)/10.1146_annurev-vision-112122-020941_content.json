{"grounding": "Some visual properties are consistent across a wide range of environments, while other properties are more labile. The efficient coding hypothesis states that many of these regularities in the environment can be discarded from neural representations, thus allocating more of the brain's dynamic range to properties that are likely to vary. This paradigm is less clear about how the visual system prioritizes different pieces of information that vary across visual environments. One solution is to prioritize information that can be used to predict future events, particularly those that guide behavior. The relationship between the efficient coding and future prediction paradigms is an area of active investigation. In this review, we argue that these paradigms are complementary and often act on distinct components of the visual input. We also discuss how normative approaches to efficient coding and future prediction can be integrated.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of efficient and predictive neural coding in the context of visual perception. By leveraging the principles of information bottleneck theory, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying efficient coding in the visual cortex. Our results demonstrate that efficient coding is not only a means of reducing information transmission but also a predictive process that enables the brain to anticipate and prepare for upcoming visual stimuli. Furthermore, we show that this predictive coding framework can be used to improve the efficiency of neural coding, leading to more accurate and robust visual perception. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of the neural basis of vision and the development of more efficient and effective neural coding strategies.", "label": 1}
