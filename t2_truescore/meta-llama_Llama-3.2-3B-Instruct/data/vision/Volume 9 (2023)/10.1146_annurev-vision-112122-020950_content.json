{"grounding": "Because the central nervous system is largely nonrenewing, neurons and their synapses must be maintained over the lifetime of an individual to ensure circuit function. Age is a dominant risk factor for neural diseases, and declines in nervous system function are a common feature of aging even in the absence of disease. These alterations extend to the visual system and, in particular, to the retina. The retina is a site of clinically relevant age-related alterations but has also proven to be a uniquely approachable system for discovering principles that govern neural aging because it is well mapped, contains diverse neuron types, and is experimentally accessible. In this article, we review the structural and molecular impacts of aging on neurons within the inner and outer retina circuits. We further discuss the contribution of non-neuronal cell types and systems to retinal aging outcomes. Understanding how and why the retina ages is critical to efforts aimed at preventing age-related neural decline and restoring neural function.", "generated_text": "Aging is a complex and multifaceted process that affects various retinal structures and functions, leading to age-related macular degeneration and vision loss. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the structural and molecular changes that occur in the retina during aging, with a focus on synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degeneration. The retina's complex molecular landscape, including the organization of photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells, is disrupted with age, resulting in impaired synaptic transmission and neuronal connectivity. The loss of synapses and the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of aging retinal neurons. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat age-related retinal diseases. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the structure, function, and molecular landscapes of the aging retina, highlighting the need for further research in this area.", "label": 1}
