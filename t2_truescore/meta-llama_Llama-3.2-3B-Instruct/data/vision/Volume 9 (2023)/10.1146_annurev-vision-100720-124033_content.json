{"grounding": "Using natural scenes is an approach to studying the visual and eye movement systems approximating how these systems function in everyday life. This review examines the results from behavioral and neurophysiological studies using natural scene viewing in humans and monkeys. The use of natural scenes for the study of cerebral cortical activity is relatively new and presents challenges for data analysis. Methods and results from the use of natural scenes for the study of the visual and eye movement cortex are presented, with emphasis on new insights that this method provides enhancing what is known about these cortical regions from the use of conventional methods.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of the cerebral cortex in visual search using natural scenes as stimuli. Rhesus monkeys were presented with complex natural scenes and asked to locate specific objects. Saccadic eye movements were recorded to analyze the neural mechanisms underlying visual search. Results show that the frontal eye field and visual cortex play a crucial role in guiding saccades in natural scenes. Furthermore, the cerebral cortex's ability to integrate visual information from multiple locations enhances visual search efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the neural basis of visual search and have implications for understanding the cognitive processes underlying human visual perception.", "label": 0}
