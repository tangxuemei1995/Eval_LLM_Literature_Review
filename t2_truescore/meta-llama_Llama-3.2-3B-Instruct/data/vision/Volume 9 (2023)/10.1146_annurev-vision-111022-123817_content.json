{"grounding": "The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical brain structure that is relevant for sensation, cognition, and action. In nonhuman primates, a rich history of studies has provided unprecedented detail about this structure's role in controlling orienting behaviors; as a result, the primate SC has become primarily regarded as a motor control structure. However, as in other species, the primate SC is also a highly visual structure: A fraction of its inputs is retinal and complemented by inputs from visual cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex. Motivated by this, recent investigations are revealing the rich visual pattern analysis capabilities of the primate SC, placing this structure in an ideal position to guide orienting movements. The anatomical proximity of the primate SC to both early visual inputs and final motor control apparatuses, as well as its ascending feedback projections to the cortex, affirms an important role for this structure in active perception.", "generated_text": "The primate superior colliculus (SC) plays a crucial role in the integration of visual information to facilitate efficient and adaptive eye movements. This complex structure, located in the midbrain, is responsible for the orienting response, a rapid and automatic shift in attention to detect and track visual stimuli. Recent studies have elucidated the neural mechanisms underlying the visual functions of the SC, highlighting its involvement in the processing of motion, depth, and spatial attention. The SC's ability to modulate eye movements in real-time enables active vision, allowing primates to selectively focus on relevant visual information while ignoring irrelevant stimuli. This abstract reviews the current understanding of the visual functions of the primate SC, with a focus on its role in guiding eye movements and facilitating adaptive vision. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of primate visual processing and the neural mechanisms underlying attention and eye movement control.", "label": 1}
