{"grounding": "Embodiment is a crucial concept for the autonomy and adaptivity of systems working in the physical world with high degrees of uncertainty and complexity. The physical bodies of autonomous adaptive systems heavily influence the information flow from the environment to the central processing (and vice versa), requiring us to consider the full triad of brain, body, and environment to investigate intelligent behavior. This article provides a structured review of embodied intelligence with a special emphasis on the concept of timescales and their role in self-organization and the emergence of complex behavior. We classify embodied interactions into three types\u2014cross-timescale matching, separation, and nontemporal sequences\u2014and discuss how these interactions were studied in the past as well as how they can contribute to the systematic investigation of complex autonomous and adaptive systems in both biological and artificial entities.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of embodied intelligence in autonomous adaptive systems, focusing on the timescales of cross-timescale interactions. Bioinspired robotics and artificial life approaches are employed to investigate the dynamics of embodied cognition in complex systems. The research reveals that embodied intelligence enables autonomous adaptive systems to adapt and learn across multiple timescales, from milliseconds to years. Cross-timescale interactions are found to be crucial for the emergence of adaptive behaviors, such as pattern recognition and decision-making. The findings suggest that incorporating embodied intelligence into autonomous adaptive systems can lead to improved performance, robustness, and adaptability. The study contributes to the development of bioinspired robotics and artificial life approaches, highlighting the importance of considering the timescales of embodied intelligence in the design of autonomous adaptive systems.", "label": 1}
