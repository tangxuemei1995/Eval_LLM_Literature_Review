{"grounding": "Surface tension effects are known to be dominant at the submillimeter scale. Within this context, the literature has extensively described the underlying physics (e.g., surface tension, wetting, surface texturation, and coatings), and capillary forces have been exploited in a variety of applications (e.g., capillary picking, self-alignment, capillary sealing, and capillary bearings). As several stimuli can be used to control liquid menisci, these forces have been used mainly in microrobotics in open loop (i.e., without real-time feedback). However, at least two major sources of uncertainty hinder these forces from working properly in open loop: the variability due to contact-angle hysteresis (the difference between wetting and unwetting) and the variability in the involved volume of liquid. To be able to reject these disturbances, successful sensor integration and associated advanced control schemes need to be embedded in capillary microrobotic microsystems. This article analyzes research contributions in this field from three different perspectives: the stimulus action of the surface tension effect (light, B-field, etc.), the application field (actuation, picking, sealing, etc.), and the sensing and control schemes. Technologically complex developments coexist with elegant and straightforward engineering solutions. Biological aspects of surface tension are not included in this review.", "generated_text": "The manipulation of micro-scale objects using liquid surface tension has emerged as a promising approach in the field of microrobotics. By exploiting the capillary forces generated at the liquid surface, researchers have developed novel micromanipulation techniques that enable precise control over the movement and positioning of micro-scale objects. This review article provides an in-depth examination of the underlying physics of liquid surface tension and its applications in microrobotics. We discuss the various mechanisms by which surface tension can be harnessed, including the use of microfluidic channels, surface tension-driven flow, and the manipulation of liquid droplets. Recent advances in materials science and nanotechnology have also enabled the development of novel surface-tension-driven actuators and sensors, which have far-reaching implications for the design of next-generation microrobots. Our review highlights the potential of liquid surface tension as a key enabler of micromanipulation in a wide range of applications, from biomedical engineering to microassembly and microfabrication. By exploring the latest research in this field, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with exploiting liquid surface tension in microrobotics.", "label": 0}
