{"grounding": "Over the past decades, robotics has shown great potential to impact the built environment, from automation to differentiation and efficient construction. However, construction processes are highly complex and require tackling a multitude of problems, from safety and robustness to ease of control and interactivity. For this reason, the field of construction robotics is still evolving, requiring finding solutions for new challenges every day. The present review analyzes the role of robotics in construction and architecture over time and highlights current trends in shifting from pure automation toward collaborative and adaptive processes that have the potential to fully integrate robotics into a rigid and challenging industry, such as construction.", "generated_text": "This study explores the evolution of construction robotics, transitioning from automation to human-robot collaboration. By integrating sensing technologies and industrial robots, construction sites can optimize efficiency and productivity. The integration of robotic systems with building information modeling (BIM) and computer-aided design (CAD) enables precise site monitoring and real-time data analysis. Human-robot collaboration enhances worker safety and reduces errors, while automation streamlines repetitive tasks. The findings of this research highlight the potential of construction robotics to transform the construction industry, improving quality, reducing costs, and increasing worker satisfaction.", "label": 0}
