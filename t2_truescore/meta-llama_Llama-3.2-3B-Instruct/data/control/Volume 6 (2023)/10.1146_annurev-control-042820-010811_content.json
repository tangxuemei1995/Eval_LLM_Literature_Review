{"grounding": "Networked control systems, where feedback loops are closed over communication networks, arise in several domains, including smart energy grids, autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and many industrial and robotic systems active in service, production, agriculture, and smart homes and cities. In these settings, the two main layers of the system, control and communication, strongly affect each other's performance, and they also reveal the interaction between a cyber-system component, represented by information-based computing and communication technologies, and a physical-system component, represented by the environment that needs to be controlled. The information access and distribution constraints required to achieve reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems have been intensively studied over the course of roughly two decades. This article reviews some of the cornerstone results in this area, draws a map for what we have learned over these years, and describes the new challenges that we will face in the future. Rather than simply listing different results, we present them in a coherent fashion using a uniform notation, and we also put them in context, highlighting both their theoreticalinsights and their practical significance. Particular attention is given to recent developments related to decentralized estimation in distributed sensing and communication systems and the information-theoretic value of event timing in the context of networked control.", "generated_text": "Networked control systems (NCS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern cyber-physical systems, where real-time information exchange between sensors, actuators, and controllers is crucial for optimal performance. However, the inherent communication constraints in NCS pose significant challenges to traditional control strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the many facets of information in networked estimation and control, focusing on control under communication constraints, decentralized inference, and event triggering. We discuss the importance of timing information in NCS, including its impact on system stability, performance, and robustness. Our analysis highlights the need for advanced control strategies that can effectively utilize the available information and mitigate the effects of communication constraints. We also explore the role of decentralized inference in NCS, where local agents can infer system states and control actions without relying on centralized authorities. Finally, we examine the event triggering approach, which enables controllers to adapt to changing system conditions by triggering control actions in response to specific events. By integrating these concepts, we aim to develop more efficient, scalable, and resilient control strategies for NCS, ultimately enabling the widespread adoption of these systems in various applications.", "label": 1}
