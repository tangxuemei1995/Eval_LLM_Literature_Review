{"grounding": "Electric power systems are undergoing an unprecedented transition from fossil fuel\u2013based power plants to low-inertia systems that rely predominantly on power electronics and renewable energy resources. This article reviews the resulting control challenges and modeling fallacies, at both the device and system level, and focuses on novel aspects or classical concepts that need to be revised in light of the transition to low-inertia systems. To this end, we survey the literature on modeling of low-inertia systems, review research on the control of grid-connected power converters, and discuss the frequency dynamics of low-inertia systems. Moreover, we discuss system-level services from a control perspective. Overall, we conclude that the system-theoretic mindset is essential to bridge different research communities and understand the complex interactions of power electronics, electric machines, and their controls in large-scale low-inertia power systems.", "generated_text": "This study focuses on the control of low-inertia power systems, which are critical for maintaining grid stability in the face of increasing renewable energy penetration. A dynamic virtual power plant (DVPV) approach is proposed to enhance grid-forming control in low-inertia systems. The proposed control strategy utilizes advanced power electronics and machine learning algorithms to optimize energy storage, load management, and grid frequency regulation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DVPV approach in improving grid stability and reducing the impact of low-inertia systems on grid frequency. The results also show that the proposed control strategy can effectively mitigate the effects of renewable energy variability and improve the overall efficiency of the power system. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of smart grids and the integration of low-inertia systems into the power grid.", "label": 0}
