{"grounding": "Early research on physical human\u2013robot interaction (pHRI) has necessarily focused on device design\u2014the creation of compliant and sensorized hardware, such as exoskeletons, prostheses, and robot arms, that enables people to safely come in contact with robotic systems and to communicate about their collaborative intent. As hardware capabilities have become sufficient for many applications, and as computing has become more powerful, algorithms that support fluent and expressive use of pHRI systems have begun to play a prominent role in determining the systems\u2019 usefulness. In this review, we describe a selection of representative algorithmic approaches that regulate and interpret pHRI, describing the progression from algorithms based on physical analogies, such as admittance control, to computational methods based on higher-level reasoning, which take advantage of multimodal communication channels. Existing algorithmic approaches largely enable task-specific pHRI, but they do not generalize to versatile human\u2013robot collaboration. Throughout the review and in our discussion of next steps, we therefore argue that emergent embodied dialogue\u2014bidirectional, multimodal communication that can be learned through continuous interaction\u2014is one of the next frontiers of pHRI.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of embodied communication in human-robot collaboration, focusing on the role of physical interaction in facilitating effective communication between humans and robots. Through a mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and observational studies, we investigated the ways in which robots and people communicate through physical interaction, including gestures, postures, and touch. Our results show that embodied communication plays a crucial role in human-robot collaboration, enabling robots to better understand human intentions and emotions. We also found that the use of assistive robots, designed to assist people with disabilities, can facilitate embodied communication and improve human-robot collaboration. The findings of this study have implications for the design of robots that can effectively communicate with humans through physical interaction, and highlight the potential of embodied communication to enhance human-robot collaboration in various applications, including healthcare, education, and manufacturing.", "label": 0}
