{"grounding": "Space-mounted robotics is becoming increasingly mainstream for many space missions. The aim of this article is threefold: first, to give a broad and quick overview of the importance of spacecraft-mounted robotics for future in-orbit servicing missions; second, to review the basic current approaches for modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic systems; and third, to introduce some new developments in terms of modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators using the language of hypercomplex numbers (dual quaternions). Some outstanding research questions and potential future directions in the field are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the application of advanced robotics and control techniques to spacecraft-mounted manipulators for in-orbit servicing operations. A novel control framework utilizing dual quaternions is proposed to ensure precise trajectory tracking and robust control of the robotic arm. The dynamics and kinematics of the robotic system are analyzed, and a simulation-based approach is employed to validate the proposed control strategy. The results demonstrate improved performance and stability of the robotic arm, enabling efficient and reliable in-orbit servicing operations.", "label": 0}
