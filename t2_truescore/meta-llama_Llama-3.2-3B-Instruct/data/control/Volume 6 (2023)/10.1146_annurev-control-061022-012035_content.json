{"grounding": "Soft robotic systems are human friendly and can mimic the complex motions of animals, which introduces promising potential in various applications, ranging from novel actuation and wearable electronics to bioinspired robots operating in unstructured environments. Due to the use of soft materials, the traditional fabrication and manufacturing methods for rigid materials are unavailable for soft robots. 3D printing is a promising fabrication method for the multifunctional and multimaterial demands of soft robots, as it enables the personalization and customization of the materials and structures. This review provides perspectives on the manufacturing methods for various types of soft robotic systems and discusses the challenges and prospects of future research, including in-depth discussion of pneumatic, electrically activated, magnetically driven, and 4D-printed soft actuators and integrated soft actuators and sensors. Finally, the challenges of realizing multimaterial, multiscale, and multifunctional 3D-printed soft robots are discussed.", "generated_text": "The integration of additive manufacturing in the design and fabrication of soft actuators and robots has revolutionized the field of robotics, enabling the creation of complex and dynamic systems. This convergence of 4D printing and soft robotics has led to the development of novel soft actuators and robots that can adapt and respond to their environment in a more human-like manner. The use of integrated soft actuators and sensors in these systems allows for real-time feedback and control, enabling precise manipulation and interaction with the environment. This abstract reviews the current state of the art in soft actuators and robots enabled by additive manufacturing, highlighting the potential applications in fields such as healthcare, search and rescue, and space exploration. The design and fabrication of these systems are also discussed, with a focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of 4D printing and soft robotics.", "label": 0}
