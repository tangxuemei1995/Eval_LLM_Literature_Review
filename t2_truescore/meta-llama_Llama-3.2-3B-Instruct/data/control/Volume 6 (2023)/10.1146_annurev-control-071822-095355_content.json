{"grounding": "Approximately 1.1. billion people worldwide live with some form of disability, and assistive technology has the potential to increase their overall quality of life. However, the end users\u2019 perspective and needs are often not sufficiently considered during the development of this technology, leading to frustration and nonuse of existing devices. Since its first competition in 2016, CYBATHLON has aimed to drive innovation in the field of assistive technology by motivating teams to involve end users more actively in the development process and to tailor novel devices to their actual daily-life needs. Competition tasks therefore represent unsolved daily-life challenges for people with disabilities and serve the purpose of benchmarking the latest developments from research laboratories and companies from around the world. This review describes each of the competition disciplines, their contributions to assistive technology, and remaining challenges in the user-centered development of this technology.", "generated_text": "The CYBATHLON competition has been a driving force in advancing assistive technologies, fostering innovation and inclusivity for individuals with disabilities. Since its inception in 2000, the competition has challenged teams to develop assistive technologies that enable people with physical disabilities to participate in daily life activities. Through a user-centered design approach, participants have created innovative solutions that address various challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. The competition has led to the development of cutting-edge technologies, such as exoskeletons, prosthetic limbs, and smart home systems, which have improved the quality of life for people with disabilities. By pushing the boundaries of assistive technology, CYBATHLON has promoted inclusion and accessibility, demonstrating the potential for technology to empower individuals with disabilities and enhance their participation in society.", "label": 0}
