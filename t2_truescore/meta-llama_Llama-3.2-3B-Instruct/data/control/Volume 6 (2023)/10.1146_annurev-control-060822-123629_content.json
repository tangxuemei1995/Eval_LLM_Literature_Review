{"grounding": "This review aims to present recent developments in modeling and control of multiagent systems. A particular focus is set on crowd dynamics characterized by complex interactions among agents, also called social interactions, and large-scale systems. Specifically, in a crowd each individual agent interacts with a field generated by the other agents and the environment. These systems can be modeled at the microscopic scale by ordinary differential equations, while an alternative description at the mesoscopic scale is given by a partial differential equation for the propagation of the probability density of the agents. Control actions can be applied at the individual level as well as at the level of the corresponding fields. This article presents and compares different control types, and the specific application to multilane, multiclass traffic is developed in some detail, showing the main tools at work in a hybrid setting with relevant impacts on autonomous driving.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the modeling and control of multiagent systems, focusing on crowd dynamics and interacting agent systems. By applying the mean-field limit, we derive a reduced-order model that captures the essential dynamics of large-scale systems. The proposed model is then used to design feedback control strategies for autonomous vehicles, which are employed to manipulate the crowd's behavior. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control approach in achieving desired crowd patterns and reducing congestion. The proposed framework can be extended to various applications, including smart traffic management and crowd control in public spaces. The mean-field limit approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing and controlling complex interacting agent systems, enabling the design of efficient and effective control strategies for real-world problems.", "label": 0}
