{"grounding": "While noise is generally associated with uncertainties and often has a negative connotation in engineering, living organisms have evolved to adapt to (and even exploit) such uncertainty to ensure the survival of a species or implement certain functions that would have been difficult or even impossible otherwise. In this article, we review the role and impact of noise in systems and synthetic biology, with a particular emphasis on its role in the genetic control of biological systems, an area we refer to as cybergenetics. The main modeling paradigm is that of stochastic reaction networks, whose applicability goes beyond biology, as these networks can represent any population dynamics system, including ecological, epidemiological, and opinion dynamics networks. We review different ways to mathematically represent these systems, and we notably argue that the concept of ergodicity presents a particularly suitable way to characterize their stability. We then discuss noise-induced properties and show that noise can be both an asset and a nuisance in this setting. Finally, we discuss recent results on (stochastic) cybergenetics and explore their relationships to noise. Along the way, we detail the different technical and biological constraints that need to be respected when designing synthetic biological circuits. Finally, we discuss the concepts, problems, and solutions exposed in the article; raise criticisms and concerns about current ideas and approaches; suggest current (open) problems with potential solutions; and provide some ideas for future research directions.", "generated_text": "Noise in biomolecular systems is a ubiquitous phenomenon that arises from the inherent stochastic nature of molecular interactions. This abstract reviews recent advances in modeling, analysis, and control implications of noise in biomolecular systems, with a focus on reaction networks and stochastic processes. Theoretical frameworks, such as stochastic differential equations and master equations, are employed to quantify and predict the effects of noise on biomolecular systems. The impact of noise on system behavior, including gene expression, protein folding, and metabolic pathways, is examined. The abstract also discusses the application of systems and control theory to mitigate the effects of noise, including feedback control strategies and stochastic optimization techniques. Furthermore, the intersection of noise in biomolecular systems with cybergenetics and synthetic biology is explored, highlighting the potential for noise-aware design and optimization of biological systems. The abstract concludes by highlighting the importance of considering noise in biomolecular systems, and the need for further research in this area to develop effective control strategies and design principles for robust and reliable biological systems. Recent advances in single-molecule techniques and high-throughput sequencing have enabled the experimental investigation of noise in biomolecular systems, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential applications. The abstract provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in this field, and highlights the potential for future research to address the complex challenges posed by noise in biomolecular systems.", "label": 1}
