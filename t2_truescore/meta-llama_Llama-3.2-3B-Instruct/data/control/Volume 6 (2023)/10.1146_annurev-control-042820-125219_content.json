{"grounding": "Cost, efficiency, and emissions concerns have motivated the application of advanced control techniques to multiple carrier energy systems. Research in energy management and control over the last two decades has shown that significant energy and CO2 emissions reductions can be achieved. Within the last decade, this work has expanded to the domain of interconnected energy systems. The interconnection control of multiple energy carriers, conversion devices, and energy storage provides increased flexibility and energy/CO2 reduction potential. The focus of this article is on outlining the control methods required for these systems over a range of energy consumption and timescales. Dynamic interactions between multicarrier systems occur over timescales ranging from 15 minutes to seasons. The constrained nature of the resulting control problems favors optimization-based approaches.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the control of multicarrier energy systems from buildings to networks, focusing on the integration of distributed and cooperative control strategies. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals the need for advanced control techniques to optimize energy efficiency and reliability in building energy systems. This research proposes a novel predictive control framework that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict energy demand and supply, enabling real-time adjustments to energy distribution. The proposed framework is evaluated using simulations and case studies, demonstrating significant improvements in energy efficiency and reduced strain on the grid. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of smart energy hubs and the future of building energy control.", "label": 0}
