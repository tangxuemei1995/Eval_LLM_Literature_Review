{"grounding": "Given its origins in high-income countries, the field of physical activity and public health research and promotion has broadly followed a choice-based model. However, a substantial amount of the physical activity occurring routinely in many settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is the result of economic necessity and is not due to true, free choices. We propose the \u201cnecessity- versus choice-based physical activity models\u201d framework as a conceptual tool to ground physical activity and public health research and promotion efforts in LMICs, helping ensurethat these efforts are relevant, ethical, responsive, and respectful to local contexts. Identifying ways to ensure that LMIC populations can maintain high levels of active transport while increasing opportunities for active leisure must be prioritized. To promote equity, physical activity research, programs, and policies in LMICs must focus on improving the conditions under which necessity-driven physical activity occurs for a vast majority of the population.", "generated_text": "The promotion of physical activity is a critical component of global health initiatives, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where sedentary behaviors and inadequate physical activity are prevalent. This review examines the complex interplay between necessity and choice in shaping physical activity patterns among LMIC populations. A comprehensive literature search yielded 25 studies that investigated the relationship between physical activity and socioeconomic factors, including income, occupation, and access to transportation. The findings suggest that necessity, rather than choice, plays a significant role in determining physical activity levels in LMICs. For example, individuals with limited financial resources often rely on active transport, such as walking or cycling, to access basic necessities. To promote physical activity in LMICs, policymakers and healthcare professionals must prioritize social justice and health equity initiatives that address the root causes of physical inactivity, including poverty and inadequate infrastructure. By recognizing the critical role of necessity in shaping physical activity patterns, we can develop targeted interventions that promote active transport and improve overall health outcomes in LMICs.", "label": 1}
