{"grounding": "Taking stock of environmental justice (EJ) is daunting. It is at once a scholarly field, an ongoing social movement, and an administrative imperative adopted by government agencies and incorporated into legislation. Moreover, within academia, it is multidisciplinary and multimethodological, comprising scholars who do not always speak to one another. Any review of EJ is thus necessarily restrictive.\nThis article explores several facets of EJ activism. One is its coalitional and \u201cinside-outside\u201d orientation. EJ activists are constantly forming alliances with other stakeholders, but these coalitions do not flout the importance of engaging with formal institutions. The review next turns to one set of such institutions\u2014the courts and regulatory agencies\u2014to see how well EJ claims have fared there. I then survey scientific findings that have been influenced by EJ. The review concludes with future directions for activists and scholars to consider: the changing nature of EJ coalitions, fragmentation within EJ and with other fields, the historical roots of environmental injustice, and opportunities for stronger infusion of the EJ lens.", "generated_text": "Environmental justice, a concept born out of the civil rights movement, has been a pressing concern for decades, with a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. This issue is deeply intertwined with environmental racism, where communities of color are subjected to pollution, toxic waste, and inadequate access to green spaces, leading to significant racial health disparities. Structural racism perpetuates these injustices, as policies and practices are often designed to maintain the status quo, rather than addressing the root causes of environmental degradation. Despite the progress made in recent years, environmental justice remains a contentious issue, with ongoing debates surrounding the role of health advocacy and activism in driving change. This abstract reviews the historical context of environmental justice, its relationship with environmental racism, and the current state of health disparities, highlighting the need for continued health activism and policy reform to address the systemic inequalities faced by marginalized communities.", "label": 1}
