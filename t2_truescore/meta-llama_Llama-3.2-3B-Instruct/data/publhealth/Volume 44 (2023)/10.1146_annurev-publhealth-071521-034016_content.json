{"grounding": "Mass incarceration is a sociostructural driver of profound health inequalities in the United States. The political and economic forces underpinning mass incarceration are deeply rooted in centuries of the enslavement of people of African descent and the genocide and displacement of Indigenous people and is inextricably connected to labor exploitation, racial discrimination, the criminalization of immigration, and behavioral health problems such as mental illness and substance use disorders. This article focuses on major public health crises and advances in state and federal prisons and discusses a range of practical strategies for health scholars, practitioners, and activists to promote the health and dignity of incarcerated people. It begins by summarizing the historical and sociostructural factors that have led to mass incarceration in the United States. It then describes the ways in which prison conditions create or worsen chronic, communicable, and behavioral health conditions, while highlighting priority areas for public health research and intervention to improve the health of incarcerated people, including decarceral solutions that can profoundly minimize\u2014and perhaps one day help abolish\u2014the use of prisons.", "generated_text": "The mass incarceration of individuals in the United States has led to a significant increase in the number of prisoners requiring healthcare services within correctional facilities. This phenomenon has sparked a growing concern regarding the prioritization of public health within the prison system. Decarceration efforts have been proposed as a potential solution to alleviate the burden on correctional healthcare services. However, the implementation of decarceration strategies poses significant challenges, including the need for adequate post-release support services and the potential for increased recidivism rates. This review aims to examine the current state of public health within prisons, with a focus on the priorities that must be addressed in the age of mass incarceration. The literature suggests that correctional healthcare services are often inadequate, leading to poor health outcomes among prisoners. Decarceration efforts must be accompanied by a comprehensive approach to addressing the social determinants of health that contribute to incarceration. By prioritizing public health within prisons, policymakers can work towards reducing recidivism rates and promoting the overall well-being of individuals within the correctional system.", "label": 1}
