{"grounding": "Extreme weather events are expected to increase due to climate change, which could pose an additional burden of morbidity and mortality. In recent decades, drought severity has increased in several regions around the world, affecting health by increasing the risk of water-, food-, and vector-borne diseases, malnutrition, cardiovascular and respiratory illness, mental health disorders, and mortality. Drought frequency and severity are expected to worsen across large regions as a result of a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature and atmospheric evaporative demand, posing a pressing challenge for public health. Variation in impacts among countries and communities is due to multiple factors, such as aging, socioeconomic status, access to health care, and gender, affecting population resilience. Integrative proactive action plans focused on risk management are required, and resources should be transferred to developing countries to reduce their vulnerability and risk.", "generated_text": "This critical review examines the public health implications of drought in a climate change context, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of human populations to drought-related health risks. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies on drought trends, human health, and drought risk management. The findings indicate that droughts exacerbate existing health inequalities, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the poor, elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. Climate change is projected to intensify drought frequency and severity, leading to increased mortality, morbidity, and displacement. Effective drought risk management strategies, including early warning systems, water conservation measures, and social protection programs, are essential to mitigate the public health impacts of drought. This review provides a critical framework for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to address the complex relationships between drought, climate change, and human health.", "label": 1}
