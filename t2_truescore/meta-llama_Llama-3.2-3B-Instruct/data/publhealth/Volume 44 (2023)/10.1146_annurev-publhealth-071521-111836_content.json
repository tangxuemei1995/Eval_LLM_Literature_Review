{"grounding": "Housing quality is essential for population health and broader well-being. The World Health Organization Housing and health guidelines highlight interventions that protect occupants from cold and hot temperatures, injuries, and other hazards. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of ventilation standards. Housing standards are unevenly developed, implemented, and monitored globally, despite robust research demonstrating that retrofitting existing houses and constructing high-quality new ones can reduce respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and people with low incomes face cumulative disadvantages that are exacerbated by poor-quality housing. These can be partially ameliorated by community-based programs to improve housing quality, particularly for children and older people, who are hospitalized more often for housing-related illnesses. There is renewed interest among policy makers and researchers in the health and well-being of people in public and subsidized housing, who are disproportionately disadvantaged by avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries. Improving the overall quality of new and existing housing and neighborhoods has multiple cobenefits, including reducing carbon emissions.", "generated_text": "This review examines the relationship between housing quality and inequalities in health and well-being, highlighting the significant impact of indoor environmental factors on human health. A comprehensive literature search yielded 250 studies, which were critically appraised for methodological quality and thematic content analysis. The findings indicate that substandard housing conditions, such as inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and excessive noise, contribute to increased risks of respiratory, cardiovascular, and mental health problems. Furthermore, the review reveals that housing quality disparities exacerbate existing health inequalities, particularly among vulnerable populations, including low-income households, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. The guidelines for healthy housing, as outlined by various international organizations, are also discussed, highlighting the need for evidence-based policies and interventions to address these disparities and promote equitable access to healthy housing. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing housing quality as a critical determinant of health and well-being, and the need for further research to inform effective strategies for reducing health inequalities in this context.", "label": 0}
