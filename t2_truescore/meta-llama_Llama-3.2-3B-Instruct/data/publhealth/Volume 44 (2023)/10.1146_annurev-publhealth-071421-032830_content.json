{"grounding": "Between the 2009 Great Recession and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US state and local governmental public health workforce lost 40,000 jobs. Tens of thousands of workers also left during the pandemic and continue to leave. As governmental health departments are now receiving multimillion-dollar, temporary federal investments to replenish their workforce, this review synthesizes the evidence regarding major challenges that preceded the pandemic and remain now. These include the lack of the field's ability to readily enumerate and define the governmental public health workforce as well as challenges with the recruitment and retention of public health workers. This review finds that many workforce-related challenges identified more than 20 years ago persist in the field today. Thus, it is critical that we look back to be able to then move forward to successfully rebuild the workforce and assure adequate capacity to protect the public's health and respond to public health emergencies.", "generated_text": "The US public health workforce faces significant challenges in terms of recruitment, retention, and workforce development. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals ongoing struggles to enumerate and track workforce data, hindering informed decision-making and strategic planning. Recruitment efforts are often hindered by limited funding, inadequate training programs, and a lack of clear career pathways. Retention issues are exacerbated by burnout, lack of autonomy, and limited opportunities for professional growth. To address these challenges, future directions should prioritize workforce development initiatives, including evidence-based training programs, mentorship opportunities, and career advancement pathways. Additionally, efforts to improve workforce enumeration and tracking are crucial to inform policy decisions and allocate resources effectively. By addressing these challenges, the US public health workforce can be strengthened, ensuring a more effective and sustainable response to public health needs.", "label": 1}
