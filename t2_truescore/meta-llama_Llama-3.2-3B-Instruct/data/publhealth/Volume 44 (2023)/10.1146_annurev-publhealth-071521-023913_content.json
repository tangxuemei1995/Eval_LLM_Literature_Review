{"grounding": "Current digital health approaches have not engaged diverse end users or reduced health or health care inequities, despite their promise to deliver more tailored and personalized support to individuals at the right time and the right place. To achieve digital health equity, we must refocus our attention on the current state of digital health uptake and use across the policy, system, community, individual, and intervention levels. We focus here on (a) outlining a multilevel framework underlying digital health equity; (b) summarizingfive types of interventions/programs (with example studies) that hold promise for advancing digital health equity; and (c) recommending future steps for improving policy, practice, and research in this space.", "generated_text": "This literature synthesis examines the multilevel determinants of digital health equity, a critical concern in the advancement of the field. A comprehensive review of existing research reveals that social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status and geographic location, significantly impact digital health access and outcomes. Health technology, including digital platforms and telemedicine, can both facilitate and exacerbate health inequities. The synthesis highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between digital health, social determinants, and health outcomes. By advancing the field, this study aims to inform evidence-based strategies to promote digital health equity and improve health disparities.", "label": 1}
