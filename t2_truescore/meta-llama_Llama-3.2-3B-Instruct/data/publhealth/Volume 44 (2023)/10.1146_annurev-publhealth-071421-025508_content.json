{"grounding": "Heat is a dangerous hazard that causes acute heat illness, chronic disease exacerbations, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a range of injuries. Risks are highest during extreme heat events (EHEs), which challenge the capacity of health systems and other critical infrastructure. EHEs are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is driving an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality, necessitating more investment in health protection. Climate-resilient health systems are better positioned for EHEs, and EHE preparedness is a form of disaster risk reduction. Preparedness activities commonly take the form of heat action plans (HAPs), with many examples at various administrative scales. HAP activities can be divided into primary prevention, most important in the pre-event phase; secondary prevention, key to risk reduction early in an EHE;and tertiary prevention, important later in the event phase. After-action reports and other postevent evaluation activities are central to adaptive management of this climate-sensitive hazard.", "generated_text": "Extreme heat events pose a significant threat to public health, particularly in vulnerable populations. As climate change exacerbates heatwaves, it is essential to develop effective public health preparedness strategies. This study examines the current state of public health preparedness for extreme heat events, highlighting the need for integrated heat action plans that incorporate disaster risk reduction measures. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that heat action plans are often fragmented and lack a clear framework for implementation. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates heat action plans with existing disaster risk reduction frameworks. Our findings suggest that this integrated approach can improve public health outcomes during extreme heat events, particularly for vulnerable populations. The proposed framework provides a foundation for policymakers and public health practitioners to develop effective heat action plans that prioritize disaster risk reduction and public health protection.", "label": 1}
