{"grounding": "The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events, are expected to increase and alter human migration and mobility. Climate-related mobility is not inherently a crisis; it can provide a pathway for adaptation to climate change. However, a growing body of research identifies health risks and some opportunities associated with climate-related mobility. This review examines recent research (published since 2018) on the climate change\u2013mobility\u2013health nexus; this research focuses largely on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. It considers the links between human mobility and anthropogenic climate change and documents the findings of empirical research that addresses the health consequences of displacement, planned relocation, migration, and migration into sites of climate risk. The findings highlight the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health care in a heating world.", "generated_text": "This study examines the interplay between climatic and environmental change, migration, and health, highlighting the complex relationships between these factors. Climate change-induced displacement and relocation have become increasingly prevalent, leading to significant health disparities among affected populations. The literature review reveals that environmental degradation, heat stress, and vector-borne diseases are among the primary health concerns associated with climate migration. Furthermore, the psychological impacts of displacement, including anxiety and depression, are also significant. The study suggests that addressing climate change and migration requires a comprehensive approach that incorporates health interventions, environmental mitigation strategies, and social support services. By exploring the intersections between climate change, migration, and health, this research aims to inform policy and practice, ultimately contributing to the development of effective strategies for mitigating the health consequences of climate migration.", "label": 1}
