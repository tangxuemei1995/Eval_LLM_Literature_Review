{"grounding": "Public health researchers are increasingly questioning the consequences of gentrification for population health and health equity, as witnessed in the rapid increase in public health publications on the health (equity) effects of gentrification. Despite methodological challenges, and mixed results from existing quantitative research, qualitative evidence to date points to the role of gentrification processes in exacerbating health inequities. Here we discuss past methodological and theoretical challenges in integrating the study of gentrification with public health research. We suggest taking an interdisciplinary approach, considering the conceptualization of gentrification in measurement techniques and conceiving this process as a direct exposure or as a part of broader neighborhood changes. Finally, we discuss existingpolicy approaches to mitigating and preventing gentrification and how these could be evaluated for effectiveness and as public health promotion and specifically as interventions to promote health equity.", "generated_text": "Gentrification, a process of urban renewal driven by affluent residents and investors, poses significant threats to health equity in urban areas. This theoretical and methodological guide explores the intersections of gentrification, displacement, and urban regeneration, highlighting the need to prevent or mitigate its adverse effects on vulnerable populations. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, this guide identifies key factors contributing to gentrification, including socioeconomic, demographic, and policy-driven drivers. It also discusses the consequences of gentrification on urban health, including increased stress, decreased access to affordable healthcare, and heightened risk of chronic diseases. By examining the complex relationships between gentrification, displacement, and health equity, this guide provides a framework for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to develop effective strategies for promoting health equity in the face of gentrification.", "label": 1}
