{"grounding": "This article reviews the evidence on the impacts of paid family and medical leave (PFML) policies on workers\u2019 health, family well-being, and employer outcomes. While an extensive body of research demonstrates the mostly beneficial effects of PFML taken by new parents on infant, child, and parental health, less is known about its impact on employees who need leave to care for older children, adult family members, or elderly relatives. The evidence on employers is similarly limited but indicates that PFML does not impose major burdens on them. Taken together, the evidence suggests that PFML policies are likely to have important short- and long-term benefits for population health, without generating large costs for employers. At thesame time, further research is needed to understand the effects of different policy parameters (e.g., wage replacement rate and leave duration) and of other types of leave beyond parental leave.", "generated_text": "This study examines the multifaceted impacts of paid family and medical leave (PFML) on worker health, family well-being, and employer outcomes. A mixed-methods approach combining survey data and employer interviews was employed to investigate the effects of PFML on employee well-being, job satisfaction, and productivity. Results indicate that PFML significantly improves worker health, reduces stress, and enhances family well-being. Employers also reported positive outcomes, including increased employee retention, reduced turnover rates, and improved morale. Furthermore, PFML was found to have a positive impact on employer outcomes, such as reduced absenteeism and presenteeism. The findings suggest that PFML is a valuable policy intervention that can have far-reaching benefits for both workers and employers. The study's results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of PFML in promoting work-life balance and supporting the well-being of employees and employers alike.", "label": 1}
