{"grounding": "Public health surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data and is closely integrated with the timely dissemination of information that the public needs to know and upon which the public should act. Public health surveillance is central to modern public health practice by contributing data and information usually through a national notifiable disease reporting system (NNDRS). Although early identification and prediction of future disease trends may be technically feasible, more work is needed to improve accuracy so that policy makers can use these predictions to guide prevention and control efforts. In this article, we review the advantages and limitations of the current NNDRS in most countries, discuss some lessons learned about prevention and control from the first wave of COVID-19, and describe some technological innovations in public health surveillance, including geographic information systems (GIS), spatial modeling, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the digital twin method. We conclude that the technology-driven innovative public health surveillance systems are expected to further improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of case reporting during outbreaks and also enhance feedback and transparency, whereby all stakeholders should receive actionable information on control and be able to limit disease risk earlier than ever before.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust and efficient public health surveillance systems to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. This review aims to summarize recent innovations in public health surveillance for emerging infections, with a focus on the integration of advanced technologies such as spatial modeling and artificial intelligence. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies that have developed and evaluated novel surveillance approaches, including the use of national notifiable disease reporting systems, machine learning algorithms, and geospatial analysis. The findings suggest that these innovations have improved the timeliness and accuracy of disease detection, enabling more effective public health responses. Spatial modeling techniques have been shown to enhance the identification of high-risk areas and facilitate the allocation of resources. Artificial intelligence has been used to analyze large datasets and identify patterns that may not be apparent through traditional surveillance methods. The integration of these technologies has the potential to revolutionize public health surveillance, enabling more effective prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases. By leveraging these innovations, public health systems can improve their ability to detect and respond to emerging threats, ultimately reducing the burden of infectious disease on communities worldwide.", "label": 1}
