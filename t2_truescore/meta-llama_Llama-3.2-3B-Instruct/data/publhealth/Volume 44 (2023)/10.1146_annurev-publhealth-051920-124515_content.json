{"grounding": "In many cases, implementation approaches (composed of one or more strategies) may need to change over time to work optimally. We use a literature review to inform a mechanistic analysis of such on-the-go adaptations. We suggest that such adaptations of implementation strategies consist of three necessary steps. The first component is the initial effect of the implementation approach on intended implementation, service delivery, or clinical outcomes. Second, these initial effects must in turn be used to modify, alter, intensify, or otherwise change the implementation approach. Third, the modified approach itself has effects. Conceiving of adaptation as all three steps implies that a full understanding of adaptation involves (a) a sense of initial effects, (b) conceptualizing and documenting content and rationale for changes in approach (e.g., alteration, intensification), and (c) the effects of the changed approach (including how the latter effects depend on initial effects). Conceptualizing these steps can help researchers ask questions about adaptation (e.g., thresholds for change, dosing, potentiation, sequencing) to advance our understanding of implementation strategies.", "generated_text": "The on-the-go adaptation of implementation approaches and strategies in health is a pressing concern, given the dynamic nature of healthcare environments and the need for effective interventions. This abstract highlights the emerging perspectives and research opportunities in this field, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. The literature review reveals that adaptation is a critical factor in the success of implementation strategies, with various approaches and frameworks being proposed to facilitate on-the-go adaptation. These include the use of flexible implementation frameworks, adaptive leadership, and real-time monitoring and evaluation. The abstract also discusses the importance of considering contextual factors, such as organizational culture and stakeholder engagement, in the adaptation process. Furthermore, the abstract identifies knowledge gaps and research opportunities, including the need for more studies on the effectiveness of on-the-go adaptation strategies and the development of tailored implementation approaches for diverse healthcare settings. Ultimately, this abstract aims to contribute to the growing body of research on implementation science and highlight the potential of on-the-go adaptation to improve healthcare outcomes.", "label": 0}
