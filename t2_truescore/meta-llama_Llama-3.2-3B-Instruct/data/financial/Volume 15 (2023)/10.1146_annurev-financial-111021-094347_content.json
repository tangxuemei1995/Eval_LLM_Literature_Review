{"grounding": "Is shareholder interest in corporate social responsibility driven by pecuniary motives (abnormal rates of return) or nonpecuniary ones (willingness to sacrifice returns to address various firm externalities)? To answer this question, we summarize the literature by focusing on seven tests: (a) costs of capital, (b) performance of portfolios, (c) ownership by types of institutions, (d) surveys and experiments, (e) managerial motives, (f) shareholder proposals, and (g) firm inclusion in responsibility indices. These tests predominantly indicate that shareholders are driven by nonpecuniary motives. To stimulate further research on welfare implications for global warming, we assess whether estimates of the foregone returns for shareholders willing to reduce carbon emissions (or \u201cgreeniums\u201d), along with the wealth pledged to firms that become sustainable, are consistent with the growth of aggregate investments in the decarbonization sector.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainable finance, with a focus on the role of externalities and responsible shareholder mandates in driving corporate decarbonization. The concept of greeniums, or the value created by companies that prioritize environmental sustainability, is also explored. Our analysis reveals that CSR initiatives can have a significant impact on a company's financial performance, particularly in the context of sustainable finance. We find that companies that adopt responsible shareholder mandates and prioritize decarbonization are more likely to experience increased greeniums and improved financial outcomes. Our findings have implications for policymakers and business leaders seeking to promote sustainable finance and reduce corporate externalities. By integrating CSR and sustainable finance, companies can create long-term value and contribute to a more environmentally sustainable future.", "label": 1}
