{"grounding": "We review macro-finance models featuring nonlinear dynamics that have recently been developed in the literature, including models with funding liquidity constraints, market liquidity frictions, and bank run frictions, and discuss the empirical evidence and challenges of this class of models. We also construct an illustrative model featuring financial frictions and nonlinear dynamics for readers who are unfamiliar with the literature. We solve the model using different solution techniques, including both global and perturbation solution methods, and comprehensively compare the accuracy of these solutions. Within this framework, we highlight that local linearization approximations omit important nonlinear dynamics and yield biased impulse responses.", "generated_text": "This study examines the application of nonlinear dynamics in macro-finance models, specifically dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, to capture systemic risk and endogenous jump risk. By incorporating financial constraints and liquidity considerations, we demonstrate that traditional DSGE models can be improved upon to better account for the complexities of financial systems. Our results show that nonlinear dynamics can effectively model the interactions between macroeconomic variables and financial shocks, leading to more accurate predictions of systemic risk and liquidity crises. The findings have significant implications for macro-finance modeling and policy-making.", "label": 0}
