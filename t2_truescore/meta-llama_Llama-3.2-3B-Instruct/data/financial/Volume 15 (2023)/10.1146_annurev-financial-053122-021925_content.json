{"grounding": "This survey discusses the state of the art in research in racetrack and lottery investment markets. Market efficiency and the pricing of various wagers are studied along with new developments since the Thaler & Ziemba (1988) review. The weak form inefficient market pricing approach using stochastic programming optimization models changed racetrack betting from handicapping to a financial market allowing professional syndicates to operate as hedge funds. Topics discussed include arbitrage and risk arbitrage, syndicates, betting exchange rebates, behavioral biases, and fundamental and mispricing information in racetrack and lottery markets. Similar models can be used to successfully trade stock market anomalies. \nSupplemental Materials\n are included online.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the efficiency of pari-mutuel betting markets at racetracks and lotteries, leveraging stochastic programming optimization models to analyze the impact of various biases, including the favorite-longshot bias. By incorporating data from multiple racetracks and lotteries, our analysis reveals that the efficiency of these markets is compromised by the presence of biases, leading to suboptimal outcomes for bettors. Our results suggest that incorporating lottery strategies and employing stochastic programming optimization models can mitigate these biases, ultimately leading to more efficient betting markets. The findings have implications for bettors, racetrack operators, and policymakers seeking to promote fair and transparent betting practices.", "label": 0}
