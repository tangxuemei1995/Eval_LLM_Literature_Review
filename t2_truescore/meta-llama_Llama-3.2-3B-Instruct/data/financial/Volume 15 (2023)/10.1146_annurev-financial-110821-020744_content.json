{"grounding": "The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to a large number of studies in household finance, using new high-frequency data in close to real time. In this article, we survey household behavior during the pandemic, with a focus on consumption, government policies, credit, and investment. The pandemic induced a rapid decline in consumption, which was affected by but largely preceded stay-at-home orders and was followed by a rapid rebound. Government stimulus was less effective in 2020 relative to other recessions, which is consistent with both shutdowns and precautionary savings. Delinquency rates fell, unlike in other recessions, likely due to government debt relief policies. Household investment behavior was affected by pandemic-induced changes in beliefs. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household behavior, focusing on consumption, credit, and investments. Analyzing data from a large-scale survey, we find that households adjusted their spending patterns in response to the pandemic-induced economic uncertainty. Notably, households increased their consumption of essential goods and services, while reducing discretionary spending. Additionally, households turned to credit to mitigate financial shocks, with a significant increase in credit utilization. Investments in assets such as stocks and real estate also experienced a surge. Our findings suggest that households employed various coping mechanisms to navigate the pandemic-induced economic environment, highlighting the importance of understanding household finance behavior during times of crisis.", "label": 0}
