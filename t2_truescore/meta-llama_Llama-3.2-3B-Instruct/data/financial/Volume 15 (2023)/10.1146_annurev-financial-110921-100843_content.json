{"grounding": "Open-end mutual funds offer investors same-day liquidity while holding assets that in some cases take several days to sell. This liquidity transformation creates a potentially destabilizing first-mover advantage: When asset prices fall, investors who exit a fund earlier may pass the liquidation costs generated by their share redemptions to investors who remain in the fund. This incentive becomes particularly acute in periods of market stress, and it can amplify fire-sale spillover losses to other market participants. Swing pricing is a liquidity management tool that targets this first-mover advantage. It allows a fund to adjust or \u201cswing\u201d its net asset value in response to large flows out of or into a mutual fund. This article discusses the industry and regulatory context for swing pricing, and it reviews theory and empirical evidence on the design and effectiveness of swing pricing. The article concludes with directions for further research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the phenomenon of swing pricing in the mutual fund industry, where liquidity transformation and fire sales are employed to manage fund liquidity. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that swing pricing can be a double-edged sword, providing liquidity benefits to fund managers while also increasing market volatility and potentially leading to fire sales. Empirical evidence from a sample of mutual funds is presented to illustrate the mechanics of swing pricing and its impact on market dynamics. The findings suggest that swing pricing can be an effective tool for liquidity management, but its use must be carefully calibrated to avoid destabilizing market conditions. The study contributes to the existing literature on liquidity management and highlights the need for further research on the optimal use of swing pricing in the mutual fund industry.", "label": 1}
