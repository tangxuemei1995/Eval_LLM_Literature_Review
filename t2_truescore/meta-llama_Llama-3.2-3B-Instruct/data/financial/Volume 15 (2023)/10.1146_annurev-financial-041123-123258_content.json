{"grounding": "The principles of financial economics provide equally important insights into the optimal choice of discount rates for both public and private sector decision-makers. However, most governments largely ignore those principles, taking their cost of capital for most purposes as their borrowing rate. This article reviews the arguments often made in support of status quo discounting practices, along with the counterarguments to them. Governments have a choice between several methodologies for risk adjustment, and the practical and conceptual reasons that favor a fair value approach are recapped. The limitations of a financial economics approach become apparent for decisions involving very long time horizons, such as for climate policies. For policies with long-term impacts, intergenerational concerns become paramount, projections of cash flows and discount rates become highly uncertain, and present value calculations are an intrinsically unreliable measure of value. No approach to discount rate selection can overcome those problems; alternative decision criteria need to be established. However, most government investments involve much shorter horizons, and the adoption of standard approaches to risk adjustment could significantly improve social welfare.", "generated_text": "This study examines the relationship between financial economics and the social discount rate, a concept central to government valuation and fair value accounting. The social discount rate is a critical component in budgetary accounting, as it determines the present value of future government expenditures and revenues. Financial economics provides a framework for understanding the social discount rate, but its limitations are also evident. This paper reviews the current literature on the social discount rate, highlighting the differences between government and private discount rates. It also discusses the implications of the social discount rate for fair value accounting and budgetary accounting. The study concludes that financial economics can provide valuable insights into the social discount rate, but its application is subject to limitations and requires careful consideration of government-specific factors. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers and financial practitioners seeking to accurately value government assets and liabilities.", "label": 1}
