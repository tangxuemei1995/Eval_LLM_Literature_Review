{"grounding": "This article surveys the recent empirical literature on historical banking crises, defined as events taking place before 1980. Advances in data collection and identification have provided new insights into the causes and consequences of crises both immediately and over the long run. We highlight three overarching threads that emerge from the literature: First, leverage in the financial system is a systematic precursor to crises; second, crises have sizable negative effects on the real economy; and third, government interventions can ameliorate these effects. Contrasting historical episodes reveals that the process of crisis formation and evolution varies significantly across time and space. Thus, we also highlight specific institutions, regulations, and historical contexts that give rise to these divergent experiences. We conclude by identifying important gaps in the literature and discussing avenues for future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the historical context of banking crises, with a focus on the role of intermediation, leverage, and the lender of last resort. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key factors that contribute to the outbreak of banking crises, including excessive leverage, inadequate regulation, and systemic instability. Our analysis reveals that historical banking crises, such as the Great Depression and the 2008 global financial crisis, share common characteristics, including a buildup of leverage, a decline in confidence, and a failure of the lender of last resort. By examining the historical lessons of these crises, policymakers and regulators can develop more effective strategies for maintaining financial stability and preventing future banking crises.", "label": 0}
