{"grounding": "This review revisits the literature on fiscal capacity using modern tools from asset pricing. We find that properly accounting for aggregate risk substantially reduces fiscal capacity. In this environment, the gap between the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate is not a sufficient statistic for fiscal capacity. To borrow at the risk-free rate when aggregate growth is risky, governments need to ask taxpayers to insure bondholders against aggregate risk, but governments in advanced economies tend to insure taxpayers against aggregate risk. We use this asset pricing perspective to review alternative mechanisms to boost fiscal capacity that have been explored in the literature.", "generated_text": "This study examines the relationship between fiscal capacity and asset prices from an asset pricing perspective. We investigate how changes in government debt maturity and term structure impact the convenience yield, a key component of fiscal policy. Our analysis reveals a significant positive relationship between fiscal capacity and asset prices, suggesting that investors perceive fiscal policy as a reliable source of returns. The findings have important implications for understanding the role of fiscal policy in shaping asset prices and the behavior of investors in the market for government securities.", "label": 0}
