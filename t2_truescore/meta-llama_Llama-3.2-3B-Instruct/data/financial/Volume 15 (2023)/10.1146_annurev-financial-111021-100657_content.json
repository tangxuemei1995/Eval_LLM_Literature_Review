{"grounding": "After two decades of low initial public offering (IPO) activity and a number of regulatory changes, the number of IPOs of both operating companies and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) boomed in the United States in 2021 before collapsing in 2022. In recent years, surging valuations have resulted in many private companies achieving \u201cunicorn\u201d status, a valuation of $1 billion or more, partly fueled by investments from mutual funds. Many of the unicorns that have gone public have done so with dual-class share structures. We compare three alternative mechanisms for going public, including traditional IPOs, mergers with SPACs, and direct listings. The most common exit for successful venture capital\u2013backed companies, however, continues to be by merging with a larger company.", "generated_text": "This study examines the recent trends and developments in the IPO and SPAC markets, with a focus on the impact of emerging trends on unicorn companies. The analysis reveals that SPACs have become a popular alternative to traditional IPOs, offering a more efficient and cost-effective route to market. Meanwhile, direct listings have gained traction, allowing companies to bypass the traditional IPO process. The use of dual-class shares has also become more prevalent, enabling companies to maintain control and flexibility. The study also explores the role of confidential filings and the implications for unicorn companies seeking to go public. The findings highlight the need for regulatory clarity and updated guidelines to accommodate the evolving IPO and SPAC landscape.", "label": 1}
