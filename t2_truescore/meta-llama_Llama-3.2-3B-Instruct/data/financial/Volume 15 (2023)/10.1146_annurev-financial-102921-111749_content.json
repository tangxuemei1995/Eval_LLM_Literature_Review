{"grounding": "Most Western countries use a single discount rate to evaluate public investments and policies. This ignores the differential cost of risk, in a world where most risk markets exhibit surprisingly large prices of risk. The current discounting guidelines generate a misallocation of capital that entails a large welfare cost. We claim that the well-established asset pricing literature provides a strong normative justification in favor of risk-adjusting discount rates. More specifically, project-specific discount rates should be increasing in the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. This will favor projects whose net benefit materializes preferentially in low-income states, thereby recognizing their insurance benefit ex ante. The intuition is simple, the welfare benefit of the reform is large, and the methodology only requires evaluators to estimate an income elasticity on top of what is required in the current approach. It is time to fix our public discounting systems.", "generated_text": "This study examines the current state of public discounting systems and proposes a framework for risk-adjusted discounting to mitigate the impact of carbon pricing on vulnerable populations. Our analysis reveals that traditional cost-benefit analysis methods often fail to account for the disproportionate effects of carbon pricing on low-income households. We develop a novel risk-adjusted discounting approach that incorporates socioeconomic data to estimate the true cost of carbon pricing on different demographic groups. Our results show that risk-adjusted discounting can significantly reduce the burden of carbon pricing on low-income households, while maintaining the overall effectiveness of carbon pricing in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed framework has implications for policymakers seeking to design more equitable and effective carbon pricing systems.", "label": 0}
