{"grounding": "Several recent trends have reshaped the nature of bargaining in Chapter 11. These include increasingly complex prebankruptcy capital structures, decreasing time in Chapter 11 due to prepacks and prenegotiated plans, growing use of restructuring support agreements (RSAs) and sales of substantially all assets, an increased number of defaulting private equity\u2013owned firms, and an increase in activity of specialized distressed debt investors. These trends have changed the balance of power in favor of senior secured lenders, who further shape the course of out-of-court negotiations. We examine evidence of the impact of these changes on important stakeholders, including creditors and workers.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolving landscape of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting recent trends and research findings. An analysis of distressed debt defaults and recovery rates reveals a shift towards increased private equity involvement and creditor rights. The rise of leveraged loans and 363 sales has also transformed the bankruptcy process. Notably, the study finds that private equity firms have become key players in restructuring and recovery efforts, often prioritizing asset sales over debt forgiveness. These insights offer valuable perspectives on the current state of Chapter 11 bankruptcy and its implications for creditors and debtors alike.", "label": 1}
