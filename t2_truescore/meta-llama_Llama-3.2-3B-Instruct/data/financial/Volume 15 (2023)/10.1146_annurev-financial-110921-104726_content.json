{"grounding": "The past half-century has seen major shifts in inflation expectations, how inflation comoves with the business cycle, and how stocks comove with Treasury bonds. Against this backdrop, we review the economic channels and empirical evidence on how inflation is priced in financial markets. Not all inflation episodes are created equal. Using a New Keynesian model, we show how \u201cgood\u201d inflation can be linked to demand shocks and \u201cbad\u201d inflation to cost-push shocks driving the economy. We then discuss asset pricing implications of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d inflation. We conclude by providing an outlook for inflation risk premia in the world of newly rising inflation.", "generated_text": "This study examines the relationship between inflation and asset returns, with a focus on the impact of monetary policy on bond return predictability. Using a sample of developed economies, we find that inflation has a significant and persistent effect on asset returns, with higher inflation leading to higher risk premia and lower bond returns. Our results also suggest that the relationship between inflation and asset returns is exacerbated during periods of stagflation, where both high inflation and economic stagnation coexist. The findings have implications for monetary policy and asset pricing models, highlighting the need for policymakers to consider the impact of inflation on financial markets.", "label": 0}
