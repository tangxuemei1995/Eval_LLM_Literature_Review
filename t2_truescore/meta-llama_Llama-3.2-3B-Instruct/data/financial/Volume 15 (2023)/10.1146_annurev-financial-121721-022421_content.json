{"grounding": "Discounting of deferred impacts of government policies is a long-established practice that has been the target of substantial litigation and continued philosophical debate. Legal challenges to the social rate of discount have resulted in general acceptance of the principle of discounting at a nonzero rate for both monetary and nonmonetary impacts. Courts have displayed a general familiarity with discounting and often require transparent justification for the selection of the discount rate based on established scientific principles. The philosophical issues are more wide-ranging and include whether nonmonetary impacts should be discounted, the use of the opportunity cost of capital or the social rate of time preference, the time frame that is pertinent for setting the discount rate, and determination of whose preferences should have standing. Intergenerational issues are particularly challenging, raising questions regarding which generation's preferences should be recognized, the potential for dynamic inconsistencies arising from preferential discount rates, and intertemporal inequities. Benefit-cost analyses that include appropriate recognition of benefits and costs for future generations serve a constructive function in providing a mechanism for recognizing future effects on social welfare.", "generated_text": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a widely used concept in benefit-cost analysis, intergenerational decision-making, and environmental economics. This concept refers to the rate at which future benefits are discounted to their present value. The SDR has been subject to intense debate and criticism, with various scholars arguing that it is a flawed and culturally relative concept. This paper provides an in-depth examination of the legal and philosophical underpinnings of the SDR, drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature. We analyze the historical development of the SDR, its theoretical foundations, and its application in different fields. Our analysis reveals that the SDR is deeply rooted in Western cultural and economic values, which may not be universally applicable. We also discuss the implications of the SDR for intergenerational justice, fairness, and the distribution of costs and benefits. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced and context-dependent approach to the SDR, one that takes into account the diverse values and preferences of different societies and cultures. Ultimately, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the SDR and its role in shaping our understanding of the future and our responsibilities towards it.", "label": 1}
