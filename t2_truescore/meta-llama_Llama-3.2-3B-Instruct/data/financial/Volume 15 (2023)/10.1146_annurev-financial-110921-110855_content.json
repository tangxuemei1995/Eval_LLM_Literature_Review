{"grounding": "The purpose of this article is to review the literature on inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives. The methodology for valuation and risk management of these securities is an application of the foreign currency extension of a standard HJM term structure model. The two \u201ccurrencies\u201d in the extended model are real and nominal prices. Currently, for their use in monetary policy, the empirical literature primarily uses these models to estimate both the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium. A literature investigating the efficiency of the inflation derivative markets and a comparison of the relevant valuation models is almost nonexistent and a fruitful area for future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of inflation on the term structure of interest rates, focusing on inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives. We employ the HJM model to analyze the dynamics of inflation-indexed instruments and derive a break-even inflation rate that captures the equilibrium relationship between nominal and inflation-adjusted yields. Our results indicate that inflation swaps and derivatives can effectively hedge against inflation risk, while inflation-adjusted bonds exhibit a unique term structure that reflects the expected inflation path. The findings have implications for investors seeking to manage inflation risk and policymakers aiming to stabilize the economy.", "label": 0}
