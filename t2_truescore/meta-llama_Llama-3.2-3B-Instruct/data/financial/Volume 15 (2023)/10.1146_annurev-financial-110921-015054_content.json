{"grounding": "The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the predominant family of global short-term rate benchmarks for the past 40 years, ceased to exist in June 2023. Given the low volumes of interbank loans on which LIBOR had been based, the revelations that LIBOR had been manipulated, and the risks that countless LIBOR-dependent financial instruments without fallback rates would be cast into limbo, regulators over the last decade pushed to replace LIBOR with risk-free overnight rate benchmarks. In the United States, the new benchmark, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), is an overnight rate based on US Treasury repo transactions: Use of term rates and derivatives on term rates is limited, and use of credit-sensitive term rates is discouraged. This article recounts the rise and fall of LIBOR; reviews the academic literature on the efficiency benefits of benchmarks, the LIBOR scandal, and the pros and cons of risk-free versus credit-sensitive rate benchmarks; and calls for further academic work on the current policy of entrenching a single-benchmark SOFR regime relative to the alternative of encouraging a two- or multi-benchmark regime of SOFR and one or more credit-sensitive term rates.", "generated_text": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative short-term rate benchmarks has significant implications for the financial markets. This study examines the performance of various post-LIBOR rate benchmarks, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the Securitized Overnight Index Average (SONIA), and the Bank of England's Sterling Overnight Repurchase Rate (BSYR), in replacing LIBOR. Our analysis reveals that SOFR and SONIA have emerged as the most suitable alternatives, with lower credit risk and improved risk-free characteristics. In contrast, Euribor and Ameribor have struggled to replicate LIBOR's performance, highlighting the need for more robust risk-free rate benchmarks. We also investigate the impact of these new benchmarks on interest rate derivatives, finding that BSYR and AXI have shown promising results in replicating LIBOR's characteristics. Our findings have important implications for financial market participants, policymakers, and regulators seeking to mitigate the risks associated with LIBOR's decline. By providing a comprehensive assessment of post-LIBOR rate benchmarks, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts to establish a more stable and resilient financial system.", "label": 1}
