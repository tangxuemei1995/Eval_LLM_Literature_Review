{"grounding": "Robo-advice uses big and open data to provide consumers with fully informed and rational-expectation benchmarks in all realms of household finance, including consumption, saving, investment, and debt management choices. It also minimizes the monetary, cognitive, and psychological costs that households face in economic transactions. We review recent research on the features and effects of robo-advice on individual and aggregate economic outcomes through the lens of its differences from traditional human advice. We discuss the distributional implications of robo-advice, its potential role in increasing the effectiveness of economic policies, the role of providers\u2019 incentives, and several questions that are still wide open for researchers in finance, economics, social psychology, and related fields.", "generated_text": "This study explores the potential of Robo-Advice in transforming households into rational economic agents by leveraging FinTech innovations. By analyzing the intersection of behavioral finance and household finance, we examine how Robo-Advice platforms can mitigate cognitive biases and optimize consumption, debt, and investment decisions. Our findings suggest that personalized financial recommendations and automated portfolio management can lead to improved financial outcomes, reduced debt, and increased investment returns. By bridging the gap between financial literacy and behavioral finance, Robo-Advice has the potential to democratize access to financial services and promote more rational economic decision-making among households.", "label": 1}
