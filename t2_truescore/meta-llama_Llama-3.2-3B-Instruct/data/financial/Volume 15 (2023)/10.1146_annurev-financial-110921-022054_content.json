{"grounding": "Unfunded public pension obligations represent the largest liability for state and local governments in the United States. As of fiscal year 2021, the total reported unfunded liabilities of these plans are $1.076 trillion. In contrast, the market value of the unfunded liability is approximately $6.501 trillion. As a result, the reported funding ratio of 82.5% falls to 43.8% under a market-based valuation. The market values reflect the fact that accrued pension promises are a form of government debt with strong statutory and contractual rights. The assumed discount rates are based on expected returns and remain elevated relative to risk-free rates, despite a decline since 2014. As a result, not only is the unfunded pension liability understated, but the yearly pension cost for newly accruing liabilities is also understated. In order to achieve high returns, pension funds have accumulated large exposure to risky assets, in particular alternative investments, which results in highly uncertain investment returns.", "generated_text": "This study examines the trends in state and local pension funds in the United States, with a focus on retirement policies, pension costs, and government debt. Analyzing data from 2010 to 2020, the research reveals a significant increase in pension costs for state and local governments, driven by rising actuarial assumptions and demographic changes. The findings indicate that state and local governments have been relying heavily on borrowing to finance pension liabilities, contributing to growing government debt. The study also explores the impact of pension reform policies on state and local pension funds, highlighting the challenges of balancing retirement security with fiscal sustainability. The research provides insights into the complex relationships between pension costs, government debt, and retirement policies, with implications for policymakers seeking to address the long-term fiscal challenges facing state and local governments.", "label": 0}
