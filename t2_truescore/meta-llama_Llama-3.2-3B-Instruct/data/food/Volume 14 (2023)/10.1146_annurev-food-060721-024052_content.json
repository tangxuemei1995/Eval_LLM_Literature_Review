{"grounding": "With the rising problems of food shortages, energy costs, and raw materials, the food industry must reduce its environmental impact. We present an overview of more resource-efficient processes to produce food ingredients, describing their environmental impact and the functional properties obtained. Extensive wet processing yields high purities but also has the highest environmental impact, mainly due to heating for protein precipitation and dehydration. Milder wet alternatives exclude, for example, low pH\u2013driven separation and are based on salt precipitation or water only. Drying steps are omitted during dry fractionation using air classification or electrostatic separation. Benefits of milder methods are enhanced functional properties. Therefore, fractionation and formulation should be focused on the desired functionality instead of purity. Environmental impact is also strongly reduced by milder refining. Antinutritional factors and off-flavors remain challenges in more mildly produced ingredients. The benefits of less refining motivate the increasing trend toward mildly refined ingredients.", "generated_text": "Mild fractionation is a novel approach to enhance the sustainability of food ingredients by optimizing the separation of plant proteins. This method combines mild wet separation techniques with dry fractionation to minimize energy consumption and preserve the functional properties of the resulting fractions. The use of mild wet separation allows for the efficient separation of proteins from other components, while dry fractionation enables the concentration of specific protein fractions. The resulting fractions exhibit improved functionality, including enhanced emulsification, gelation, and foaming properties. Compared to traditional fractionation methods, mild fractionation reduces resource use efficiency by up to 30% and minimizes the generation of waste. The application of mild fractionation to plant proteins has the potential to transform the food industry's approach to sustainable ingredient production, enabling the creation of more environmentally friendly and nutritious food products.", "label": 0}
