{"grounding": "With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the development and implementation of digital food systems are becoming increasingly possible. There is tremendous interest in using different AI applications, such as machine learning models, natural language processing, and computer vision to improve food safety. Possible AI applications are broad and include, but are not limited to, (a) food safety risk prediction and monitoring as well as food safety optimization throughout the supply chain, (b) improved public health systems (e.g., by providing early warning of outbreaks and source attribution), and (c) detection, identification, and characterization of foodborne pathogens. However, AI technologies in food safety lag behind in commercial development because of obstacles such as limited data sharing and limited collaborative research and development efforts. Future actions should be directed toward applying data privacy protection methods, improving data standardization, and developing a collaborative ecosystem to drive innovations in AI applications to food safety.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the food industry has the potential to significantly enhance food safety by identifying potential risks and anomalies in the supply chain. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets to detect patterns and anomalies in food production, processing, and distribution, enabling early warning systems for potential contamination. Computer vision technology can be employed to inspect food products for visible defects and contaminants, reducing the need for manual inspections. Predictive analytics can forecast the likelihood of foodborne illnesses, allowing for targeted interventions and resource allocation. This study examines the application of AI in improving food safety, with a focus on its potential to reduce foodborne illnesses and protect public health. The findings suggest that AI can be a valuable tool in the fight against foodborne illnesses, and its integration into food safety protocols is essential for ensuring the safety of the global food supply.", "label": 1}
