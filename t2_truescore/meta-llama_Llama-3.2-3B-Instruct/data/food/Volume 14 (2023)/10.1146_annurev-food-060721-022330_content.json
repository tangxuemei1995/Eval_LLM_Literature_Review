{"grounding": "Mechano-bactericidal (MB) nanopatterns have the ability to inactivate bacterial cells by rupturing cellular envelopes. Such biocide-free, physicomechanical mechanisms may confer lasting biofilm mitigation capability to various materials encountered in food processing, packaging, and food preparation environments. In this review, we first discuss recent progress on elucidating MB mechanisms, unraveling property\u2013activity relationships, and developing cost-effective and scalable nanofabrication technologies. Next, we evaluate the potential challenges that MB surfaces may face in food-related applications and provide our perspective on the critical research needs and opportunities to facilitate their adoption in the food industry.", "generated_text": "Mechano-bactericidal surfaces have emerged as a promising approach to prevent microbial contamination in food processing and packaging. These surfaces utilize mechanical stress to induce bactericidal effects, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. Nanofabrication techniques enable the creation of tailored surface structures and properties, enhancing antimicrobial activity. This review explores the mechanisms underlying mechano-bactericidal surfaces, recent advances in nanofabrication, and their potential applications in food processing and packaging, highlighting the prospects for improving food safety and reducing antimicrobial resistance.", "label": 1}
