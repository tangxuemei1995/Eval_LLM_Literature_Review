{"grounding": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides are of particular interest in recent years because of their unique prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. Among different types of strategies for the production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, enzymatic methods are preferred owing to the predictability and controllability of the structure and composition of the reaction products. Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have been proved to show excellent prebiotic effects as well as other benefits to intestinal health. They have exhibited great application potential as functional food ingredients for various food products with improved quality and physicochemical characteristics. This article reviews the research progress on the enzymatic production of several typical nondigestible functional oligosaccharides in the food industry, including galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, chito-oligosaccharides, and human milk oligosaccharides. Moreover, their physicochemical properties and prebiotic activities are discussed as well as their contributions to intestinal health and applications in foods.", "generated_text": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, particularly prebiotics, have garnered significant attention for their potential to promote intestinal health. This review focuses on the enzymatic production of functional oligosaccharides and their applications in food products. The synthesis of prebiotic oligosaccharides via enzymatic reactions, such as glycosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis, has been explored. The resulting oligosaccharides exhibit prebiotic effects, including the stimulation of beneficial gut microbiota and the enhancement of immune system function. Food applications of these oligosaccharides have been demonstrated, including their incorporation into dairy products, baked goods, and beverages. The prebiotic effects of these oligosaccharides have been shown to improve gut health, modulate the immune system, and even influence metabolic disorders. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on functional oligosaccharides, highlighting their potential as a valuable tool for promoting intestinal health and well-being.", "label": 1}
