{"grounding": "Microbubbles are largely unused in the food industry yet have promising capabilities as environmentally friendly cleaning and supporting agents within products and production lines due to their unique physical behaviors. Their small diameters increase their dispersion throughout liquid materials, promote reactivity because of their high specific surface area, enhance dissolution of gases into the surrounding liquid phase, and promote the generation of reactive chemical species. This article reviews techniques to generate microbubbles, their modes of action to enhance cleaning and disinfection, their contributions to functional and mechanical properties of food materials, and their use in supporting the growth of living organisms in hydroponics or bioreactors. The utility and diverse applications of microbubbles, combined with their low intrinsic ingredient cost, strongly encourage their increased adoption within the food industry in coming years.", "generated_text": "Microbubbles have emerged as a promising technology in food processing, offering enhanced food safety, improved nutritional content, and increased sustainability. The incorporation of microbubbles into food products can improve texture, flavor, and shelf life, while also reducing the need for additives and preservatives. This technology has significant implications for food security, particularly in developing countries where access to nutritious food is limited. Microbubbles can also enhance the bioavailability of nutrients, making them more easily absorbed by the body. Furthermore, the use of microbubbles in food production can reduce waste and minimize environmental impact. As a novel food technology, microbubbles have the potential to revolutionize the way we produce and consume food, ensuring a more sustainable and secure food supply for future generations.", "label": 0}
