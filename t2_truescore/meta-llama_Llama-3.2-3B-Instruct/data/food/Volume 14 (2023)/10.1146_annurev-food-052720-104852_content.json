{"grounding": "In contrast to traditional breeding, which relies on the identification of mutants, metabolic engineering provides a new platform to modify the oil composition in oil crops for improved nutrition. By altering endogenous genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways, it is possible to modify edible plant oils to increase the content of desired components or reduce the content of undesirable components. However, introduction of novel nutritional components such as omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids needs transgenic expression of novel genes in crops. Despite formidable challenges, significant progress in engineering nutritionally improved edible plant oils has recently been achieved, with some commercial products now on the market.", "generated_text": "This study focuses on the development of nutritionally improved edible plant oils through metabolic engineering. By introducing high oleic acid pathways and reducing levels of linoleic acid (LC-PUFA), these oils exhibit enhanced shelf life and improved fatty acid profiles. Additionally, the incorporation of plant sterols and carotenoids enhances cholesterol-lowering and antioxidant properties. Gene editing technologies enable precise control over oil composition, allowing for tailored nutritional profiles. The integration of vitamin E and other essential nutrients further enhances the health benefits of these engineered oils. These innovations have significant implications for the food industry and public health.", "label": 0}
