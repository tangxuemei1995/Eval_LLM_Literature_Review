{"grounding": "Edible nanoparticles are being developed for the oral delivery of nutrients to improve human health and well-being. Because of the extremely demanding conditions foods experience within the gastrointestinal tract, fundamental knowledge about the biological fate of encapsulated nutrients must be constantly revised. In this review, we first provide an overview of the fundamental absorption pathways of ingested foods and then discuss the evaluation models available to test and predict the biological fate of nutrient-loaded nanoparticles. Then, owing to their importance for human health, the impacts of nanoparticles on the gut microbiota are evaluated. Lastly, the limitations of current evaluation methods are highlighted and future research directions on the study and application of edible nanoparticles for the oral delivery of bioactive food compounds are discussed.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive review examines the application of nanoparticles in oral delivery of food ingredients, focusing on their biological fate, evaluation models, and influences on gut microbiota. Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising tool for enhancing the bioavailability and efficacy of food compounds, particularly in the context of functional foods and nutraceuticals. The review discusses the various types of nanoparticles used in oral delivery, including liposomes, nanoparticles, and nanoemulsions, and their corresponding advantages and limitations. Evaluation models, such as in vitro and in vivo studies, are also critically evaluated to assess the efficacy and safety of nanoparticles in oral delivery. Furthermore, the review highlights the impact of nanoparticles on gut microbiota, including their potential to modulate the gut microbiome and influence nutrient absorption. The findings of this review provide a framework for the development of nanoparticles for oral delivery in food, and highlight the need for further research to fully elucidate their biological fate and microbiota influences.", "label": 1}
