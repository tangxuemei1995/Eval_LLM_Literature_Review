{"grounding": "Despite the almost universal acceptance of the phrase \u201cyou are what you eat,\u201d investment in understanding diet-based nutrition to address human health has been dwarfed compared to that for medicine-based interventions. Moreover, traditional breeding has focused on yield to the detriment of nutritional quality, meaning that although caloric content has remained high, the incidence of nutritional deficiencies and accompanying diseases (so-called hidden hunger) has risen dramatically. We review how genome sequencing coupled with metabolomics can facilitate the screening of genebank collections in the search for superior alleles related to the nutritional quality of crops. We argue that the first examples are very promising, suggesting that this approach could benefit broader ranges of crops and compounds with known relevance for human health. We argue that this represents anapproach complementary to metabolic engineering by transgenesis or gene editing that could be used to reverse some of the losses incurred through a recent focus on breeding for yield, although we caution that ensuring such approaches are not (re)introducing antinutrients is also necessary.", "generated_text": "The Genebank collections, a vast repository of plant genetic resources, hold immense potential for uncovering novel metabolic signatures that can inform human health. Natural variation in plant metabolomics has been increasingly recognized as a valuable source of phytonutrients, which are essential for maintaining optimal nutrition and preventing chronic diseases. Recent advances in metabolomics technologies have enabled the comprehensive analysis of plant metabolite profiles, revealing a wealth of information on the biochemical pathways and molecular mechanisms underlying plant metabolism. This study aims to explore the underexploited resource of Genebank collections for human health applications, focusing on the identification of phytonutrient-rich plant varieties and their potential health benefits. By integrating plant metabolomics with nutritional and epidemiological data, we aim to elucidate the metabolic signatures of Genebank collections and their relevance to human health, ultimately contributing to the development of novel dietary interventions and preventive strategies for chronic diseases.", "label": 1}
