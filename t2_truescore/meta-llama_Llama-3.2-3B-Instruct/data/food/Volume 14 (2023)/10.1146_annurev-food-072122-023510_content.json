{"grounding": "Starch is one of the most abundant renewable biopolymers in nature and is the main constituent in the human diet and a raw material for the food industry. Native starches are limited in most industrial applications and often tailored by structural modification to enhance desirable attributes, minimize undesirable attributes, or create new attributes. Enzymatic approaches for structuring starch have become of interest to the food industry precisely because the reactions minimize the formation of undesirable by-products and coproducts and are therefore considered environmentally friendly methods for producing clean-label starches with better behavioral characteristics. Starches with improved functionalities for various applications are produced via enzyme hydrolysis and transfer reactions. Use of novel, multifunctional, starch-active enzymes to alter the structures of amylose and/or amylopectin molecules, and thus alter the starch's physiochemical attributes in a predictable and controllable manner, has been explored. This review provides state-of-the-art information on exploiting glycosyl transferases and glycosyl hydrolases for structuring starch to improve its functionalities. The characteristics of starch-active enzymes (including branching enzymes, amylomaltases, GH70 \u03b1-transglycosylases, amylosucrases, maltogenic amylases, cyclomaltodextrinases, neopullulanases, and maltooligosaccharide-forming amylases), structure\u2013functionality-driven processing strategies, novel conversion products, and potential industrial applications are discussed.", "generated_text": "The enzymatic modification of starch has emerged as a promising approach to enhance its functionality in various applications. This review focuses on the recent advancements in enzymatic strategies for structuring starch, with a particular emphasis on the molecular structure and its relationship with functionality. Enzymes such as alpha-amylase, glucoamylase, and starch synthases have been explored for their ability to modify the starch granule structure, leading to improved digestibility, texture, and rheological properties. The application of these enzymes in food processing, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology has been demonstrated to produce starch-based products with enhanced functionality. For instance, the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch can produce maltodextrins with improved solubility and bioavailability. Furthermore, the use of starch synthases has been shown to produce starches with tailored molecular structures, enabling the creation of novel starch-based materials with specific properties. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of the art in enzymatic starch modification, highlighting the potential applications and future directions of this technology.", "label": 1}
