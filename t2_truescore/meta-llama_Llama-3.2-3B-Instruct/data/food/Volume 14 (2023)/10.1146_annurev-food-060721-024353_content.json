{"grounding": "Lipids are a large group of essential nutrients in daily diets that provide energy and maintain various physiological functions. As the global population is rapidly expanding, there is an urgent need to enhance the production and quality of food lipids. The development of modern biotechnology allows the manipulation of oil production in plants and microorganisms and the improvement of the nutritional value of food lipids. Various metabolic engineering strategies have been exploited to increase oil production and produce value-added oils in traditional oil crops and other novel lipid sources (e.g., plant vegetative tissues, microalgae, and oleaginous microorganisms). Furthermore, natural lipid structures can be modified by lipases to prepare functional lipids, e.g., diacylglycerols, medium\u2013long\u2013medium-type structured triacylglycerols, human milk-fat substitutes, and structuralphospholipids, for specific nutritional demands. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in metabolic engineering of lipid production in plants and microorganisms, and the preparation of functional lipids via biocatalysis.", "generated_text": "The increasing global demand for sustainable and nutritious food sources has led to a growing interest in biotechnology for the production of future food lipids. Microbial lipids, such as those produced through metabolic engineering of microorganisms, offer a promising alternative to traditional lipid sources. Enzymatic modification of microbial lipids can enhance their nutritional and functional properties, including improved digestibility and increased bioavailability. Structural lipids, such as phospholipids, are also being engineered for specific applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. However, the production of these lipids is often limited by factors such as scalability, cost, and regulatory frameworks. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of biotechnology in future food lipids, highlighting opportunities and challenges in the production, processing, and application of microbial lipids. The potential of biotechnology to address the complex challenges facing the food industry is discussed, including sustainability, nutrition, and food security.", "label": 0}
