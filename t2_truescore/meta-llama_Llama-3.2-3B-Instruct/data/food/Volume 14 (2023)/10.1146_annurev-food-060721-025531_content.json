{"grounding": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a bioactive phytochemical abundant in cruciferous vegetables. One of its main in vivo metabolites is 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM), formed by the condensation of two molecules of I3C. Both I3C and DIM alter multiple signaling pathways and related molecules controlling diverse cellular events, including oxidation, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity. There is a growing body of evidence from both in vitro and in vivo models that these compounds possess strong potential to prevent several forms of chronic disease such as inflammation, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, neurodegenerative diseases, and osteoporosis. This article reviews current knowledge of the occurrence of I3C in nature and foods, along with the beneficial effects of I3C and DIM concerning prevention and treatment of human chronic diseases, focusing on preclinical studies and their mechanisms of action at cellular and molecular levels.", "generated_text": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a naturally occurring glucosinolate found in cruciferous vegetables, has been extensively studied for its potential health benefits. Upon hydrolysis, I3C is converted to 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM), a potent bioactive compound with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. This review aims to summarize the occurrence, health-beneficial properties, and cellular/molecular mechanisms of indole-3-carbinol. The occurrence of I3C and DIM in various plant species and their bioavailability in human tissues are discussed. The review also explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities of DIM, including its effects on cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and gene expression. The potential therapeutic applications of indole-3-carbinol and its derivatives are also discussed, highlighting the need for further research to fully elucidate their mechanisms of action and potential health benefits.", "label": 1}
