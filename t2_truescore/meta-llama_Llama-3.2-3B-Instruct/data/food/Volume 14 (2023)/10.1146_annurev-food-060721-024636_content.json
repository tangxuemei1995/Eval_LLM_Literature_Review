{"grounding": "Microgreens are edible young plants that have recently attracted interest because of their color and flavor diversity, phytonutrient abundance, short growth cycle, and minimal space and nutrient requirements. They can be cultivated in a variety of systems from simple home gardens to sophisticated vertical farms with automated irrigation, fertilizer delivery, and lighting controls. Microgreens have also attracted attention from space agencies hoping that their sensory qualities can contribute to the diet of astronauts in microgravity and their cultivation might help maintain crew physical and psychological health on long-duration spaceflight missions. However, many technical challenges and data gaps for growing microgreensboth on and off Earth remain unaddressed. This review summarizes recent studies on multiple aspects of microgreens, including nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, cultivation systems, operative conditions, innovative treatments, autonomous facilities, and potential space applications. It also provides the authors\u2019 perspectives on the challenges to stimulating more extensive interdisciplinary research.", "generated_text": "Microgreens have emerged as a promising crop for enhancing food security, particularly in home, commercial, and space farming settings. Recent advancements in microgreen production systems, including optimized growing conditions, precision irrigation, and IoT-enabled monitoring, have significantly improved crop yields and nutritional profiles. This comprehensive update reviews the latest developments in microgreen production, focusing on the integration of IoT technologies to optimize crop growth, reduce waste, and enhance food safety. The nutritional profile of microgreens is also examined, highlighting their high content of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Furthermore, the potential of microgreens for space farming is discussed, with a focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by this emerging field. The findings of this review provide valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders seeking to harness the potential of microgreens for sustainable food production.", "label": 1}
