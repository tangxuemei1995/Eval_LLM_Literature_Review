{"grounding": "Bacteriophages (or phages) represent one of the most persistent threats to food fermentations, particularly large-scale commercial dairy fermentations. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are used as starter cultures in dairy fermentations are well studied, and in recent years there have been significant advances in defining the driving forces of LAB\u2013phage coevolution. The means by which different starter bacterial species defend themselves against phage predation and the chromosomal or plasmid location of the genes encoding these defense mechanisms have dictated the technological approaches for the development of robust starter cultures. In this review, we highlight recent advances in defining phage\u2013host interactions and how phage resistance occurs in different bacterial species. Furthermore, we discuss how these insights continue to transform the dairy fermentation industry and how they also are anticipated to guide food fermentations involving plant-based alternatives in the future.", "generated_text": "Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, have been increasingly recognized as a significant factor in the dairy industry, particularly in food fermentations. The presence of phages can lead to phage-host interactions, resulting in the degradation of fermented products and economic losses for dairy manufacturers. Recent studies have investigated the mechanisms of phage resistance, including conjugation, which enables phages to transfer genes between bacterial strains, thereby conferring resistance. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of phage-bacterium interactions in dairy fermentations, with a focus on phage resistance mechanisms. The findings suggest that phage resistance is a complex trait influenced by multiple factors, including phage-host interactions, conjugation, and environmental factors. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of strategies to mitigate phage-related losses in the dairy industry, ultimately leading to the solution of this long-standing problem.", "label": 0}
