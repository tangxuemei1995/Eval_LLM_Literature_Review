{"grounding": "Sensory science is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses a wide variety of established and newly developed tests to document human responses to stimuli. Sensory tests are not limited to the area of food science but they find wide application within the diverse areas of the food science arena. Sensory tests can be divided into two basic groups: analytical tests and affective tests. Analytical tests are generally product-focused, and affective tests are generally consumer-focused. Selection of the appropriate test is critical for actionable results. This review addresses an overview of sensory tests and best practices.", "generated_text": "This study examines the application of best practices in sensory analysis and consumer preference assessment, focusing on descriptive analysis and consumer tests. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals the importance of standardized methods and rigorous data collection procedures in sensory evaluation. The findings highlight the need for trained assessors, controlled environments, and replicable protocols to ensure accurate and reliable results. By integrating these best practices, sensory analysis can provide actionable insights for product development and marketing strategies, ultimately informing consumer preferences and driving business success.", "label": 0}
