{"grounding": "It is important to have larger proportions of health-beneficial polyunsaturated lipids in foods, but these nutrients are particularly sensitive to oxidation, and dedicated strategies must be developed to prevent this deleterious reaction. In food oil-in-water emulsions, the oil\u2013water interface is a crucial area when it comes to the initiation of lipid oxidation. Unfortunately, most available natural antioxidants, such as phenolic antioxidants, do not spontaneously position at this specific locus. Achieving such a strategic positioning has therefore been an active research area, and various routes have been proposed: lipophilizing phenolic acids to confer them with an amphiphilic character; functionalizing biopolymer emulsifiers through covalent or noncovalent interactions with phenolics; or loading Pickering particles with natural phenolic compounds to yield interfacial antioxidant reservoirs. We herein review the principles and efficiency of these approaches to counteract lipid oxidation in emulsions as well as their advantages and limitations.", "generated_text": "Phenolic antioxidants play a crucial role in stabilizing emulsions and preventing lipid oxidation, particularly at the oil\u2013water interface. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of targeting the interfacial location of these antioxidants to enhance their efficacy. This review aims to summarize the current strategies for targeting phenolic antioxidants at the emulsion interface, including the design of phenolipids and the use of surfactants and emulsifiers. The benefits of these approaches, including improved antioxidant reservoirs and enhanced stability, are discussed. Additionally, the impact of interfacial location on the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds is examined, and the potential applications of these strategies in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries are explored. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on targeting phenolic antioxidants in emulsions and highlights the potential for future research in this area.", "label": 1}
