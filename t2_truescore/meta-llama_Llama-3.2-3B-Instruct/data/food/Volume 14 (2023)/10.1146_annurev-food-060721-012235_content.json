{"grounding": "The in vitro digestion model developed by the INFOGEST international consortium is widely used to simulate the physicochemical processes occurring inside the human gastrointestinal tract (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) during the digestion of foods. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the INFOGEST method and the procedures used to measure the digestion of macronutrients (lipids, proteins, and starch), the bioaccessibility of bioactive agents (vitamins, minerals, and nutraceuticals), and the changes in the structure and physical properties of foods under gastrointestinal conditions (particle size, charge, and location). We then review the application of the INFOGEST method for monitoring the gastrointestinal fate of different kinds of foods and beverages, including dairy, egg, meat, seafood, fruit, vegetable, cereal, and emulsified products. We also discuss the application of this method for studying the digestibility of next-generation plant-based foods, such as meat, seafood, dairy, and egg analogs. Finally, the benefits and limitations of this standardized in vitro digestion model are assessed.", "generated_text": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model is a widely used tool for simulating the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract. This review aims to provide an overview of the applications of the INFOGEST model to various foods, including functional foods. The model has been extensively validated and has been used to study the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of nutrients in foods. The effects of food matrix, processing, and cooking on nutrient digestion and absorption have been investigated using the INFOGEST model. The results have shown that the model can accurately predict the bioavailability of nutrients in foods, including vitamins, minerals, and proteins. The INFOGEST model has also been used to study the functional properties of foods, such as prebiotic and probiotic effects. Overall, the INFOGEST model is a valuable tool for researchers and food manufacturers to evaluate the nutritional quality of foods and to develop functional foods with improved nutritional profiles.", "label": 1}
