{"grounding": "Ferritins represent a class of iron storage proteins with detoxification functions. The importance of these proteins is reflected by their wide distribution throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. Ferritin has two forms: holo and apo. Holo ferritin can act as an efficient and safe factor for iron supplementation, whereas apo ferritin is able to serve as a promising delivery nanovehicle for nutrients and bioactive compounds. So far, the dual functions of ferritins from animal and plant sources have been extensively studied in several fields, such as food, nutrition, medicine, and materials. This review outlines the structure of animal and plant ferritin, the iron supplementation function of holo ferritin, and the delivery function of apo ferritin. Recent advances in iron supplementation and nutrient encapsulation and delivery are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future developments for multifunctional applications of ferritins are discussed.", "generated_text": "Ferritin, a protein that stores iron, exhibits dual functions in both animals and plants, with its holo form facilitating iron supplementation and its apo form serving as a delivery system. In animals, holo ferritin, containing iron, plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis and supporting various physiological processes. Conversely, apo ferritin, lacking iron, has been shown to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents, such as drugs and genes, to target tissues. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of apo ferritin as a versatile carrier for iron supplementation and drug delivery, offering a promising approach for treating iron-deficiency anemia and other diseases. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of ferritin's dual functions and its applications in iron supplementation and delivery systems, highlighting the potential for apo ferritin as a valuable therapeutic tool.", "label": 1}
