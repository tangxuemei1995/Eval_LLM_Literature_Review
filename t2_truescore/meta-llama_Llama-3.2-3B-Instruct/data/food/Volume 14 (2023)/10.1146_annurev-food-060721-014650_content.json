{"grounding": "Bovine colostrum harbors a diverse array of bioactive components suitable for the development of functional foods, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals with veterinary and human health applications. Bovine colostrum has a strong safety profile with applications across all age groups for health promotion and the amelioration of a variety of disease states. Increased worldwide milk production and novel processing technologies have resulted in substantial growth of the market for colostrum-based products. This review provides a synopsis of the bioactive components in bovine colostrum, the processing techniques used to produce high-value colostrum-based products, and recent studies utilizing bovine colostrum for veterinary and human health.", "generated_text": "Bovine colostrum, the first milk produced by cows after calving, has garnered significant attention for its potential benefits in both veterinary and human health applications. This critical review examines the bioactive proteins, immunoglobulins, and functional properties of bovine colostrum, highlighting its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The literature reveals its efficacy in supporting animal health, particularly in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, as well as its potential human health benefits, including enhanced immune function and reduced inflammation. The review also discusses the challenges and limitations of utilizing bovine colostrum in human health applications, emphasizing the need for further research and standardization.", "label": 1}
