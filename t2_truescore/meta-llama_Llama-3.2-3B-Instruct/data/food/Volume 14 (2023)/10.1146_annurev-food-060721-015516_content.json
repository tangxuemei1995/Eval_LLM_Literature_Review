{"grounding": "Inadequate dietary fiber consumption has become common across industrialized nations, accompanied by changes in gut microbial composition and a dramatic increase in chronic metabolic diseases. The human gut microbiome harbors genes that are required for the digestion of fiber, resulting in the production of end products that mediate gastrointestinal and systemic benefits to the host. Thus, the use of fiber interventions has attracted increasing interest as a strategy to modulate the gut microbiome and improve human health. However, considerable interindividual differences in gut microbial composition have resulted in variable responses toward fiber interventions. This variability has led to observed nonresponder individuals and highlights the need for personalized approaches to effectively redirect the gut ecosystem. In this review, we summarize strategies used to address the responder and nonresponder phenomenon in dietary fiber interventions and propose a targeted approach to identify predictive features based on knowledge of fiber metabolism and machine learning approaches.", "generated_text": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in modulating the response to dietary fiber interventions, with prebiotics serving as a key tool for influencing microbial composition and function. This review highlights the opportunities for personalized approaches to dietary fiber interventions, leveraging the unique characteristics of an individual's gut microbiome to optimize health outcomes. Recent advances in CAZyme analysis have enabled the identification of specific microbial enzymes associated with improved responses to dietary fiber. By tailoring prebiotic supplementation to an individual's unique gut microbiome, it is possible to modulate the gut microbiome and enhance the beneficial effects of dietary fiber. This personalized approach has the potential to improve the efficacy of dietary fiber interventions, leading to enhanced health benefits and reduced risk of chronic diseases. Further research is needed to fully realize the potential of precision nutrition in the context of dietary fiber interventions.", "label": 0}
