{"grounding": "Food proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols are natural ingredients with different functional attributes. For instance, many proteins are good emulsifiers and gelling agents, many polysaccharides are good thickening and stabilizing agents, and many polyphenols are good antioxidants and antimicrobials. These three kinds of ingredients can be combined into protein, polysaccharide, and/or polyphenol conjugates or complexes using covalent or noncovalent interactions to create novel multifunctional colloidal ingredients with new or improved properties. In this review, the formation, functionality, and potential applications of protein conjugates and complexes are discussed. In particular, the utilization of these colloidal ingredients to stabilize emulsions, control lipid digestion, encapsulate bioactive ingredients, modify textures, and form films is highlighted. Finally, future research needs in this area are briefly proposed. The rational design of protein complexes and conjugates may lead to the development of new functional ingredients that can be used to create more nutritious, sustainable, and healthy foods.", "generated_text": "The development of novel colloidal food ingredients has gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to enhance the nutritional value and shelf life of food products. This review focuses on protein complexes and conjugates, which are emerging colloidal ingredients that have been shown to exhibit improved bioavailability, solubility, and stability. Protein complexes, such as casein micelles and whey protein aggregates, have been engineered to improve their functionality and interactions with other food components. Polyphenol conjugates, including flavonoid-glycoside and polyphenol-phenolic acid conjugates, have been synthesized to enhance their antioxidant activity and bioavailability. The formation of these colloidal ingredients involves the use of various techniques, including co-precipitation, co-assembly, and conjugation reactions. This review provides an overview of the current state of the art in the development of protein complexes and polyphenol conjugates as novel colloidal food ingredients, highlighting their potential applications in the food industry and their impact on human health.", "label": 1}
