{"grounding": "This review examines the historical and contemporary factors driving immigrant worker precarity and the central role of race in achieving worker justice. We build from the framework of racial capitalism and historicize the legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession, which have cemented an exclusionary economic system in the United States and globally. We consider how racism and colonial legacies create migrant displacement and shape the experiences of immigrant workers. We also detail how racism permeates the immigration bureaucracy, driving migrant worker precarity. The traditional labor movement has played an important role in closing this gap, but increasingly so have worker centers and the immigrant rights movement as a whole. These partnerships have had to navigate coalitional tensions as they build new strategies for realizing immigrant worker rights.", "generated_text": "This study centers the experiences of low-wage immigrant laborers, highlighting the intersections of racism and immigration in the workplace. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with immigrant workers, this research reveals the ways in which racism and xenophobia shape their working conditions, job security, and access to rights and justice. The findings suggest that immigrant workers face unique forms of exploitation, including wage theft, harassment, and discriminatory hiring practices. The study argues that a critical examination of the relationships between racism, immigration, and labor is essential for promoting the rights and dignity of low-wage immigrant workers. By centering the voices and experiences of these workers, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the complex power dynamics at play in the global labor market.", "label": 0}
