{"grounding": "In this review, we explore the impact of technology on US and UK law firms, focusing in particular on the recent machine learning wave of artificial intelligence. Technology has not so far ushered the end of law firms as we know them. Adoption of artificial intelligence/machine learning is in its early stages in the sector, and its impact has been constrained by the scope of use cases for which it is so far well-suited. Technology is nevertheless transforming law firms, in the sense of leading to material changes to their current forms, in the following novel ways: (a) deployment not only in the back office but in the front office, affecting lawyers\u2019 core tasks of advising clients; (b) opportunities for lawyers to pursue alternative career paths with different skill sets across the profession; and (c) emerging options for law firms to adopt business models creating value from nonhuman capital and nonlegal human capital.", "generated_text": "The integration of technology in law firms has been a subject of intense debate, with some arguing that it is revolutionizing the legal profession, while others claim that it is merely augmenting traditional practices. This study examines the impact of technology on law firms, with a particular focus on the role of artificial intelligence in transforming the legal services industry. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data, we investigate the organizational complementarity between technology and traditional legal practices. Our findings suggest that the effective adoption of technology by law firms is contingent upon the development of complementary strategies that leverage the strengths of both traditional and digital approaches. The results highlight the need for law firms to adopt a nuanced and adaptive approach to technological transformation, one that balances the benefits of innovation with the need for organizational stability and continuity.", "label": 0}
