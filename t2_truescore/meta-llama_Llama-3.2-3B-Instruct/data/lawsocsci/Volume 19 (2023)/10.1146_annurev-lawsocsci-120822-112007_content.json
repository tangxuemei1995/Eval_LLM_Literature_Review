{"grounding": "This article offers a comprehensive overview of the academic literature concerning mandatory employment arbitration and existing empirical evidence. Proponents of mandatory employment arbitration contend mandatory arbitration provides access to justice to those excluded from the traditional civil litigation system. Conversely, opponents of mandatory employment arbitration assert that it is a coercive system that disproportionately benefits employers and disadvantages employees. Although these entrenched perceptions of mandatory employment arbitration are not new, an expanding body of recent empirical research provides fresh insights. The empirical literature reveals lower employee success rates and financial awards, longer case resolution times, and evidence of a repeat player effect in arbitration relative to civil litigation and, as a whole, tends to support arguments made by opponents of the forum. This article reviews the literature on the major debates surrounding employment arbitration and corresponding empirical evidence.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of mandatory employment arbitration on access to justice in the workplace. Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data, we analyze the effects of mandatory arbitration clauses on employees' ability to seek redress for employment-related grievances. Our findings suggest that mandatory arbitration can lead to a decrease in access to justice, as employees are forced to resolve disputes through private, often costly, and time-consuming arbitration processes. In contrast, alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation, can provide a more accessible and affordable means of resolving employment disputes. The study's results have implications for employment law and policy, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach to alternative dispute resolution in the workplace. Ultimately, our research underscores the importance of balancing the interests of employers and employees in the pursuit of access to justice.", "label": 1}
