{"grounding": "International agreements on Intellectual Property (IP) have proven to be a good example to study global lawmaking. Beginning by looking at the 1990s Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and into the negotiation and implementation of regional and national trade agreements, this article reflects on the intricate relationship between international IP agreements and public health. The comprehensive analysis of these international rules and their effect provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping health policies. Building upon the IP case, we categorize existing scholarship on global lawmaking into three methodological approaches: (a) methodological internationalism, (b) methodological nationalism, and (c) the interplay between domestic and international factors. We close with a call for researchers to advocate and integrate into their methods a co-constitutive approach that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complexities of global lawmaking, drawing lessons from the evolution of intellectual property rights and international health emergencies. Through a comparative analysis of international agreements and national policies, we reveal the tensions between methodological nationalism and global governance. Our research highlights the challenges of balancing national interests with global cooperation, particularly in the face of emerging health crises. We demonstrate how intellectual property rights have been used as a tool for global health governance, yet also illustrate the limitations of this approach. Our findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of global lawmaking, one that acknowledges the interplay between national and global forces. By exploring the intersections of intellectual property, global health, and international agreements, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities of global governance and the challenges of creating effective global responses to emerging health threats.", "label": 1}
