{"grounding": "My scholarly career has centered around articulating and testing a model of legitimacy-based law and governance. In recent decades, that model has achieved considerable success in shaping the way legal authority is understood and exercised. At the same time the legitimacy of legal, political, and social institutions and authorities has declined, raising questions about the future viability of a legitimacy-based model. In this review, I discuss the ascension and potential decline of legitimacy-based governance and outline alternative models of authority that may emerge in the twenty-first century. Three issues are addressed: whether there are ways to reinvigorate legitimacy-based law and governance; whether social norms, moral values, or ideologies are viable alternative forms of authority; and whether it is better to accept that no single form of authority works best in all situations and theories should focus on identifying the contingencies under which different forms of authority are most desirable.", "generated_text": "This study examines the concept of legitimacy in the context of legal authority in the twenty-first century. Drawing on normative alignment theory, we investigate the relationship between trust, confidence, and compliance in the face of evolving legal frameworks. Through a critical discourse analysis of autobiographical accounts from legal professionals, we uncover the tensions between normative expectations and practical realities. Our findings suggest that legitimacy is increasingly contingent upon the ability to foster cooperation and engagement among diverse stakeholders. We argue that the erosion of trust and confidence in institutions is a pressing concern, necessitating a reevaluation of the normative foundations of legal authority. Ultimately, our research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of legitimacy in the contemporary legal landscape, one that acknowledges the complex interplay between normative alignment, compliance, and cooperation.", "label": 0}
