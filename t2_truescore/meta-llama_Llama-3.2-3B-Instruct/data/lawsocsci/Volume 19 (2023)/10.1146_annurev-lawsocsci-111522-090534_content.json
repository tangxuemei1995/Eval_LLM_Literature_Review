{"grounding": "Research on vaccines in the law and social sciences skews heavily toward an instrumentalist approach to knowledge in service of vaccine promotion. Overcoming hesitancy and promoting vaccine acceptance have been major goals, but successful levers for behavioral change remain elusive. Research with constructivist approaches to vaccines from feminist sociology and anthropology has uncovered ethnographic richness to describe how vaccine debates illuminate inequalities in parenting and re-entrench patterns of racism and colonialism. There is considerable potential in science and technology studies approaches that take seriously the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics, though there are considerable methodological challenges for these research designs. This review charts the lopsided bibliography of law and social science research on vaccines, asking why scholars rarely move away from instrumentalist conceptions of law in the service of public health and, when they do, explaining what theoretical tools enable it.", "generated_text": "This interdisciplinary study explores the complex relationships between vaccines, public health, and the law, examining the intersections of sociolegal and science studies. Through ethnographic fieldwork and critical analysis of existing literature, this research reveals the multifaceted roles of law in shaping vaccine development, distribution, and administration. The study highlights the tensions between scientific evidence, regulatory frameworks, and social norms in influencing vaccine policy and practice. By engaging with the experiences of healthcare professionals, policymakers, and community members, this research demonstrates the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between law, science, and society in public health contexts. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the sociolegal dynamics surrounding vaccines, informing strategies for improving vaccine uptake and promoting public health outcomes.", "label": 0}
