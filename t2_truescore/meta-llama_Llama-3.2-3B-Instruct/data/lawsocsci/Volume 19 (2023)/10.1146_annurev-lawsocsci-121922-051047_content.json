{"grounding": "Feminists have long demonstrated the invisibility of women's reproductive labor, performed in bearing and raising children, maintaining households, and socially sustaining male labor. Every wave of feminist struggle from the late nineteenth century onward has actively queried the inequalities that characterize women's performance of such work, variously referred to as unpaid domestic and care work, domestic labor, or care work. Robust traditions of scholarship on women's unpaid work animate various disciplines, often spilling into political struggles for adequate recognition of this work. As the pandemic has rendered visible once again the reproductive labor of women the world over, this article offers an overview of social reproduction theory, feminist legal theorizations of reproductive labor, and how we might recuperate a rich tradition of theorizing on social reproduction to develop a materialist approach to law's regulation of reproductive labor across the marriage-market spectrum with a view to social and economic justice.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of social reproduction and law, focusing on the unpaid and domestic work that underpins capitalist societies. Drawing on materialist feminist theory and legal realism, we analyze the ways in which laws and policies perpetuate and regulate the reproduction of social relations. Through a critical examination of domestic work, care, and unpaid labor, we reveal how these activities are often excluded from the formal economy and subject to unequal distribution of resources and power. Our research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of social reproduction and its relationship to law, one that acknowledges the material and social conditions that shape the lives of individuals and communities. By centering the experiences of marginalized groups, we aim to inform policy and legal reforms that promote greater social justice and equality.", "label": 1}
