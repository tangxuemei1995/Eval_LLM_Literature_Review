{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a salient but polarizing issue of recent times. Actors around the world are engaged in building a governance regime around it. What exactly the \u201cit\u201d is that is being governed, how, by who, and why\u2014these are all less clear. In this review, we attempt to shine some light on those questions, considering literature on AI, the governance of computing, and regulation and governance more broadly. We take critical stock of the different modalities of the global governance of AI that have been emerging, such as ethical councils, industry governance, contracts and licensing, standards, international agreements, and domestic legislation with extraterritorial impact. Considering these, we examine selected rationales and tensions that underpin them, drawing attention to the interests and ideas driving these different modalities. As these regimes become clearer and more stable, we urge those engaging with or studying the global governance of AI to constantly ask the important question of all global governance regimes: Who benefits?", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into global governance structures raises fundamental questions regarding the modalities, rationales, and tensions surrounding its regulation. This interdisciplinary study examines the complex interplay between AI-driven decision-making and existing global governance frameworks. Through a critical analysis of algorithmic regulation and machine learning applications, we identify both opportunities and challenges for enhancing global cooperation and addressing pressing issues such as data sovereignty, bias, and accountability. Our research reveals that AI-driven governance modalities can facilitate more efficient and effective decision-making, yet also introduce novel risks and uncertainties. By exploring the intersection of AI and global governance, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the need for adaptive and inclusive regulatory frameworks that balance technological innovation with social responsibility and human values. Ultimately, our findings highlight the imperative for a multidisciplinary approach to AI regulation, one that prioritizes transparency, accountability, and human-centered design.", "label": 1}
