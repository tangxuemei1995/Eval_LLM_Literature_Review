{"grounding": "This review addresses three questions surrounding authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China. First, what is legality, and does it exist in China's Leninist single-party state? Scholars who characterize the system as order maintenance find the absence of legality. Those employing dual-state and instrumentalist views of law find partial legality. Scholars promoting the notion of bare legality find complete legality. Second, does authoritarian legality strengthen regime legitimacy? Scholars agree that the state seeks legitimation through its embrace of authoritarian legality. Empirical research tests this claim. Third, is China in transition from plan to market, and what is the role of law in state capitalism? The teleology of the transition paradigm overlooks illiberal underpinnings of property rights and factor markets. Answers to these questions help explain regime resilience, economic growth, economic crisis, and inequality in China. Both the institution of the dual state and the perpetuation of plan elements reinforce state power.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China, a country where the rule of law is often compromised in favor of state control. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and empirical evidence, this research explores the relationship between state capitalism and property rights, markets, and labor in China. The dual state framework is employed to understand the coexistence of state-led and market-oriented economic policies. The findings suggest that China's state capitalism has led to the erosion of property rights, particularly in the land sector, where state control and expropriation have become common practices. The labor market is also characterized by state intervention, with the government exerting significant control over employment and wages. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of China's economic development and its impact on the rule of law, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of state capitalism in China.", "label": 1}
