{"grounding": "Over the past decade, the disparity between the value of the cosmic expansion rate determined directly from measurements of distance and redshift and that determined instead from the standard Lambda cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) cosmological model, calibrated by measurements from the early Universe, has grown to a level of significance requiring a solution. Proposed systematic errors are not supported by the breadth of available data (and unknown errors are untestable by lack of definition). Simple theoretical explanations for this Hubble tension that are consistent with the majority of the data have been surprisingly hard to come by, but in recent years, attention has focused increasingly on models that alter the early or pre-recombination physics of \u039bCDM as the most feasible. Here, we describe the nature of this tension and emphasize recent developments on the observational side. We then explain why early-Universe solutions are currently favored and the constraints that any such model must satisfy. We discuss one workable example, early dark energy, and describe how it can be tested with future measurements. Given an assortment of more extended recent reviews on specific aspects of the problem, the discussion is intended to be fairly general and understandable to a broad audience.", "generated_text": "The Hubble tension, a discrepancy between the observed Hubble constant and the value predicted by the Planck satellite, has sparked intense debate in the cosmological community. This tension is particularly pronounced when considering the early Universe, where the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation provides a unique window into the epoch of recombination. Recent studies have suggested that the early Universe may have been characterized by a period of rapid expansion, driven by a mysterious form of dark energy. This phenomenon, known as early dark energy, would have had a profound impact on the CMB, potentially explaining the observed Hubble tension. In this review, we examine the current state of knowledge regarding early dark energy and its potential implications for our understanding of the early Universe. We discuss the latest CMB data and theoretical models, highlighting the key challenges and opportunities for resolving the Hubble tension. Our analysis suggests that early dark energy may be a viable explanation for the observed discrepancy, and we outline a framework for future research directions. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of early dark energy and its role in the early Universe holds the key to resolving the Hubble tension and refining our understanding of the cosmos.", "label": 1}
