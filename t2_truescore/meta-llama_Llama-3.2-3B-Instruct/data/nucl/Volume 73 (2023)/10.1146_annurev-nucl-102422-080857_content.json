{"grounding": "Neutron captures produce the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron in the Universe. Beyond the classical slow (s) and rapid (r) processes, there is observational evidence for neutron-capture processes that operate at neutron densities in between, at different distances from the valley of \u03b2 stability. Here, we review the main properties of the s process within the general context of neutron-capture processes and the nuclear physics input required to investigate it. We describe massive stars and asymptotic giant branch stars as the s-process astrophysical sites and discuss the related physical uncertainties. We also present current observational evidence for the s process and beyond, which ranges from stellar spectroscopic observations to laboratory analysis of meteorites.", "generated_text": "This review article delves into the complex nuclear reactions that occur in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and beyond, with a focus on the s-process and its implications for our understanding of massive stars and meteoritic anomalies. We discuss the key steps involved in the s-process, including neutron captures and the role of these reactions in shaping the elemental abundances of AGB stars. We also explore the connections between s-process nucleosynthesis and the formation of meteorites, highlighting the potential for these objects to serve as cosmic laboratories for studying the early universe. By integrating insights from stellar spectroscopy and nuclear physics, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the s-process and its far-reaching consequences for our understanding of stellar evolution and the origins of the elements.", "label": 1}
