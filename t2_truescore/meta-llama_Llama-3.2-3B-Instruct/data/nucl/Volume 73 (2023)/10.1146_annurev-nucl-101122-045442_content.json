{"grounding": "Two topics have recently risen to prominence within the ongoing searches of beyond\u2013Standard Model effects in b and c decays: observables that test lepton flavor universality (LFU) and those that test lepton flavor violation (LFV). A coherent set of measurements suggests nonstandard LFU effects. General arguments relate LFU to LFV, and the observed size of the former gives hope of observable signals for the latter. We attempt a comprehensive discussion of both theoretical and experimental aspects of these tests. The main final message is that all the instruments necessary to fully establish the putative new effects are at hand, thanks to running experiments and their upgrades. Therefore, this subject stands a concrete chance of ushering in genuinely unexpected discoveries.", "generated_text": "This review article discusses recent advances in the search for lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFU) in b and c decays, with a focus on the LHCb experiment. LFV and LFU are key signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model, and their observation would have significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental interactions. The LHCb experiment has reported intriguing results in various channels, including B0s \u2192 \u03bc+\u03bc- and Bc \u2192 Ds\u03bc+\u03bc-, which have sparked intense interest and debate in the physics community. This article provides an overview of the current status of LFV and LFU searches, highlighting the latest results and the underlying theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain these phenomena.", "label": 1}
