{"grounding": "Live (not decayed) radioisotopes on the Earth and Moon are messengers from recent nearby astrophysical explosions. Measurements of 60Fe in deep-sea samples, Antarctic snow, and lunar regolith reveal two pulses about 3 Myr and 7 Myr ago. Detection of 244Pu in a deep-sea crust indicates a recent r-process event. We review the ultrasensitive accelerator mass spectrometry techniques that enable these findings. We then explore the implications for astrophysics, including supernova nucleosynthesis, particularly the r-process, as well as supernova dust production and the formation of the Local Bubble that envelops the Solar System. The implications go beyond nuclear physics and astrophysics to include studies of heliophysics, astrobiology, geology, and evolutionary biology.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the presence of deep-sea and lunar radioisotopes resulting from nearby astrophysical explosions, specifically supernovae. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) analysis of deep-sea sediments and lunar samples reveals the presence of r-process elements, indicative of explosive nucleosynthesis. The isotopic signatures of these elements are compared to those produced in supernovae, suggesting a connection between these events and the formation of the Earth's crust. The findings provide new insights into the astrophysical origins of the Earth's heavy elements and the potential for AMS to be used as a tool for tracing the history of our planet's formation.", "label": 1}
