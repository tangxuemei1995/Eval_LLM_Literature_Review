{"grounding": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides an intense, high-quality source of neutrinos from pion decay at rest. This source was recently used for the first measurements of coherent elastic neutrino\u2013nucleus scattering (CEvNS) by the COHERENT Collaboration, which resulted in new constraints of physics beyond the Standard Model. The SNS neutrino source will enable further CEvNS measurements, exploration of inelastic neutrino\u2013nucleus interactions of particular relevance for understanding supernova neutrinos, and searches for accelerator-produced sub-GeV dark matter. Taking advantage of this unique facility, COHERENT's suite of detectors in Neutrino Alley at the SNS is accumulating more data to address a broad physics program at the intersection of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. This review describes COHERENT's first two CEvNS measurements, their interpretation, and the potential of a future physics program at the SNS.", "generated_text": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) using a low-background setup. This process is a promising tool for detecting supernova neutrinos and potentially probing dark matter. By analyzing the scattering of neutrinos off a target material, the COHERENT collaboration seeks to constrain models of neutrino interactions and dark matter. The experiment's unique combination of high neutrino flux, low background rates, and precise energy resolution enables the detection of subtle signals that could be indicative of new physics. Preliminary results from the COHERENT experiment have shown promising signs of CEvNS, with implications for our understanding of neutrino physics and the search for dark matter.", "label": 1}
