{"grounding": "The cross sections for neutrino interactions with nucleons have been measured directly in accelerator experiments and through the zenith-angle and energy dependence of neutrino events at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Fluxes of high-energy neutrinos are produced at the Large Hadron Collider and by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. High-energy neutrinos also come from astrophysical and cosmic sources. The theory of neutrino interactions is reviewed. Current cross-section measurements and prospects for the future are discussed. The focus here is on neutrino interactions for energies larger than 1 TeV.", "generated_text": "This review article explores the current understanding of high-energy to ultrahigh-energy neutrino interactions, a realm where the Standard Model of particle physics is expected to be challenged. Neutrino astrophysics has emerged as a vibrant field, with observations of neutrino bursts from supernovae and active galactic nuclei providing insights into the most energetic astrophysical processes. We discuss the latest theoretical models and experimental searches for ultrahigh-energy neutrino production and detection, highlighting the potential for neutrinos to reveal the universe's most extreme phenomena.", "label": 0}
