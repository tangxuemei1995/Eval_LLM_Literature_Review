{"grounding": "Applying dimensional analysis to the Higgs mass leads one to predict new physics interactions that generate this mass at a scale of the order of 1 TeV. The question of what these interactions could be is known as the gauge hierarchy problem. Resolving this question has been a central aim of particle physics for the past few decades. Traditional solutions introduce new particles with masses below 1 TeV, but that prediction is now challenged by experiment. In this article, I review recent new approaches to the problem that do not require new particles at the TeV mass scale. I first discuss the relaxation approach, whereby the Higgs mass is made dynamical and is small at the absolute minimum of its potential. I then discuss the historical approach, whereby details about inflation and/or reheating after inflation cause the Higgs mass to be smaller than otherwise expected. Finally, I discuss solutions that use conditional probability, whereby conditioning on the fact that the cosmological constant is small automatically leads one to select vacua where the Higgs mass is also small.", "generated_text": "The gauge hierarchy problem is a long-standing challenge in particle physics, where the large mass of the Higgs boson is difficult to reconcile with the small masses of gauge bosons. Recent advances in theoretical frameworks and experimental discoveries have led to the development of novel solutions to this problem. This review article provides an overview of the latest approaches to addressing the gauge hierarchy problem, with a focus on the relaxation of naturalness constraints. We discuss the role of new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as extra dimensions and modified gravity, in resolving the hierarchy problem. Additionally, we examine the implications of the Higgs boson's properties, including its mass and couplings, on our understanding of the gauge hierarchy. Our analysis highlights the potential of a more nuanced understanding of naturalness and the importance of considering alternative frameworks for resolving the gauge hierarchy problem. By exploring these new solutions, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and shed light on the long-standing challenge of the gauge hierarchy problem.", "label": 1}
