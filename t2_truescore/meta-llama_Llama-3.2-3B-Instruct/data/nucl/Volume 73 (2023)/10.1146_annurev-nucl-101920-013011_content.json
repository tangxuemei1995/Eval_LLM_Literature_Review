{"grounding": "This article is a pedagogical review of searches for long-lived particles at the LHC. It is primarily aimed at experimentalists and theorists seeking to initiate and/or deepen their research in this field. We cover the general theoretical motivation and some example models, the main experimental techniques employed in searches for long-lived particles, and some of the important subtleties involved in estimating signal efficiencies and background rates.", "generated_text": "This review provides an overview of the theoretical frameworks and experimental strategies for detecting long-lived particles at the Large Hadron Collider. Long-lived particles, such as sterile neutrinos and hidden sector particles, can evade detection through conventional decay modes, necessitating innovative approaches. We discuss the implications of long-lived particles on particle physics and the LHC's potential to constrain or discover these exotic particles through novel decay channels and advanced analysis techniques.", "label": 1}
