{"grounding": "Detection of low-energy nuclear recoil events plays a central role in searches for particle dark matter interactions with atomic matter and studies of coherent neutrino scatters. Precise nuclear recoil calibration data allow the responses of these dark matter and neutrino detectors to be characterized and enable in situ evaluation of an experiment's sensitivity to anticipated signals. This article reviews the common methods for detection of nuclear recoil events and the wide variety of techniques that have been developed to calibrate detector response to nuclear recoils. We summarize the main experimental factors that are critical for accurate nuclear recoil calibrations, investigate mitigation strategies for different backgrounds and biases, and discuss how the presentation of calibration results can facilitate comparison between experiments. Lastly, we discuss the challenges for future nuclear recoil calibration efforts and the physics opportunities they may enable.", "generated_text": "The detection of low-energy nuclear recoils is a crucial aspect of experiments searching for dark matter and neutrino scattering. These events are notoriously difficult to distinguish from background processes, necessitating precise calibration and detection techniques. This review article focuses on the latest advancements in the detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils for dark matter and neutrino scattering experiments. We discuss the underlying physics of these interactions, including the role of neutron scattering and the challenges associated with low-energy calibration. Recent experimental results and theoretical frameworks are examined, highlighting the importance of precise calibration in distinguishing signal from background.
