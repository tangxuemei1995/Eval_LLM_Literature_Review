{"grounding": "Vector boson scattering is a key production process to probe the electroweak symmetry breaking of the Standard Model and is one of the most important topics of the physics program for the HL-LHC since it involves both self-couplings of vector bosons and their coupling with the Higgs boson. If the Higgs mechanism is not the sole source of electroweak symmetry breaking, the scattering amplitude deviates from the Standard Model prediction at high scattering energy. Moreover, deviations may be detectable even if a New Physics scale is higher than the reach of direct searches. In this review, the most recent experimental measurements of the production cross sections of vector boson pairs in association with two jets in proton\u2013proton collisions at  TeV at the LHC are reported, using data sets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors. Applications to searches for New Physics, as well as prospects for measuring the electroweak vector boson scattering processes with larger data samples, are also summarized.", "generated_text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been instrumental in probing the fundamental nature of matter and the universe, with a particular focus on boson-boson interactions. This review article delves into the realm of diboson production, a process in which two vector bosons (WW, ZZ, or \u00e0A) interact with each other. Theoretical frameworks, such as the Standard Model of particle physics, predict the existence of these interactions, which are crucial for understanding the electroweak force. Experimental searches at the LHC have been conducted to detect diboson production, with the aim of confirming or ruling out these predictions. This article discusses the current state of diboson physics at the LHC, highlighting recent results and the implications for our understanding of the electroweak force. The interplay between theoretical models and experimental data is also explored, shedding light on the complex interplay between boson-boson interactions and the fundamental forces of nature.", "label": 1}
