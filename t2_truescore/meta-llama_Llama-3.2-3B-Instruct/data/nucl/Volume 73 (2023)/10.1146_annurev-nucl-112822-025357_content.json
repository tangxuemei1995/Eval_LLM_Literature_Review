{"grounding": "Ultra-high-energy (UHE, >0.1 PeV) \u03b3-ray astronomy is rapidly evolving into an expanding branch of \u03b3-ray astronomy with the surprising discovery of 12 PeVatrons and the detection of a handful of photons above 1 PeV. Nearly all known celestial object types that have emissions in the TeV band are found also to emit UHE photons. UHE \u03b3-rays have a well-defined horizon inside our Galaxy due to the absorption of infrared and cosmic microwave backgrounds in the Universe. In the last 30 years, traditional cosmic ray (CR) measurement techniques have enabled the detection of UHE \u03b3-rays and opened the last observation window. For leptonic sources, UHE radiation is in the deep Klein\u2013Nishina regime, which is largely suppressed. Therefore, UHE \u03b3-ray detection will be helpful in locating and identifying hadronic radiation sources, tracing the historic pursuit for the origin of CRs around the knee of the spectrum. The Crab Nebula is the focus of attention with measured photon emissions up to 1 PeV. In the absence of hadronic processes, these emissions may indicate the existence of an extreme accelerator of e\n+\ne\n\u2212. Use of CR extensive air shower detection techniques broadens the field of view of the source observations, enabling measurement of UHE radiation surrounding the sources. These observations can probe the particle propagation inside and outside the accelerators and the subsequent injection/escape into the interstellar medium.", "generated_text": "The study of ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the discovery of PeVatron sources, which emit gamma-rays with energies exceeding 1 PeV. The Large High-Angle Shower Array (LHAASO) is a cutting-edge observatory designed to detect these high-energy gamma-rays and provide insights into their origins. This research focuses on the detection of gamma-rays from the Crab Nebula, a well-studied source of high-energy radiation. Utilizing the LHAASO array, we have observed extensive air showers induced by gamma-rays with energies ranging from 10^18 to 10^20 eV. The muon content of these showers was measured, revealing a significant correlation between muon production and gamma-ray energy. The results indicate that the Crab Nebula is a powerful source of ultra-high-energy gamma-rays, with a spectral index of approximately 2.5. The data also suggest that the gamma-rays are produced by the acceleration of charged particles in the nebula's magnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the physics of PeVatron sources and the mechanisms that govern the acceleration of charged particles to ultra-high energies. The LHAASO array has proven to be a valuable tool for the study of ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, and future observations will continue to shed light on the origins of these enigmatic sources.", "label": 1}
