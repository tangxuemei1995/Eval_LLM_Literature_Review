{"grounding": "We present a comprehensive review of purely leptonic and semileptonic decays of D\n0(+), \n\n, and charmed baryons (including \n\n, \u039e\nc\n, and \u03a9\nc\n). The precise studies of these decays help deepen our understanding and knowledge of quantum chromodynamics via measuring decay constants and form factors, and test the Standard Model through examining the unitarity of the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix and lepton flavor universality. We give an overview of the theoretical and experimental tools before discussing the recent progress. The data sets collected by the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) near the production thresholds of \n\n, \n\n, and \n\n offer important opportunities for studies of charm physics.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in lattice quantum chromodynamics have significantly improved our understanding of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons. Theoretical frameworks, such as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, have been employed to analyze the decay constants and form factors of these decays. Lepton flavor universality has been confirmed in various studies, highlighting the importance of precision measurements in charm physics. Theoretical models, including QCD sum rules and chiral perturbation theory, have been used to extract the decay constants and form factors from lattice data. These advances have shed new light on the underlying physics of charmed hadron decays, with implications for our understanding of the Standard Model.", "label": 0}
