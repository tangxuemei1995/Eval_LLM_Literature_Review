{"grounding": "Since its start, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has helped advance both theory and experiment on the production and properties of the heaviest fundamental particle, the top quark. This review focuses on a selected set of measurements and associated searches for new physics, which have opened the door for unprecedented precision in this area of high-energy physics. Fundamental parameters of the theory such as mt\n, \u03b1S, Vtb\n, and yt\n are measured from top quark events with relative uncertainties that are smaller than 0.5%, 1.8%, 2%, and 10%, respectively, and that are expected to improve with more data, better experimental methods, and more accurate theory predictions. Several results, even if statistically limited, already significantly constrain the phase space of new physics: measurements of associated production with bosons, processes with four top quarks, and searches for rare decays, among others. It is expected that until the completion of the LHC program, top quark physics will keep providing unique insights regarding the consistency of the Standard Model and the energy scale of new physics.", "generated_text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has revolutionized our understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics by providing unprecedented insights into the properties of the top quark, the heaviest known particle. This review appraises the current state of knowledge on the top quark, focusing on its production and decay modes, cross-section measurements, and implications for the Standard Model. The LHC data have consistently confirmed the predictions of the Standard Model, with precise measurements of the top quark mass and width. However, the search for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions, remains an active area of research. The upcoming LHC upgrades and future colliders, such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), will provide new opportunities to probe the strong and electroweak interactions, as well as the Higgs boson sector, in unprecedented detail. This appraisal and outlook highlights the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the physics of the top quark at the LHC, and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries in the years to come.", "label": 1}
