{"grounding": "The study of high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider has evolved from a qualitative understanding to the precise extraction of the properties of the quantum chromodynamics medium at extremely high temperatures. Jet quenching has offered unique insights into the transport properties of the quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP) created in these energetic collisions. Apart from medium modification of jets, jet-induced medium excitation constitutes another crucial aspect of jet\u2013QGP interaction and is indispensable in understanding the soft components of jets. We review recent theoretical and phenomenological developments regarding medium response to jet energy loss, including an overview of both weakly and strongly coupled approaches for describing the thermalization and propagation of energy deposition from jets, effects of medium response on jet observables, and exploration of its unique signatures in jet\u2013hadron correlations. Jet-induced medium excitation is shown to be an essential component in probing the in-medium dynamics of jets and a critical step toward precise extraction of the QGP properties.", "generated_text": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have been used to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in these collisions. Medium response and jet-hadron correlations are crucial probes of the QGP's interaction with jets, which are high-energy quanta of gluons. This review article focuses on the latest experimental and theoretical developments in the study of medium response and jet-hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We discuss the experimental results from RHIC and LHC, including the measurement of jet-quenching and jet-induced medium excitation. We also review the theoretical frameworks that describe these phenomena, including the use of effective theories and numerical simulations. The review highlights the importance of medium response and jet-hadron correlations in understanding the QGP's properties and the jet-quenching mechanism, and discusses future directions for experimental and theoretical research in this area.", "label": 0}
