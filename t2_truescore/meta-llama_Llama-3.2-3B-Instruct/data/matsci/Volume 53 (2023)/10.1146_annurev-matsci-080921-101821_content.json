{"grounding": "Owing to its unique structure, morphology, and crystal quality, low-dimensional (L-D) ice has attracted increasing attention in recent years. With a size (at least in one dimension) between that of a single water molecule and a snowflake, L-D ice does not only appear as an intermediate state during the dimensional change but can also manifest extraordinary characteristics, from its molecular structures to its physical properties, which offer exciting opportunities for a better understanding and utilization of ice. In this article, we start with a brief introduction to the crystal growth, structure, and typical characterization techniques of ice and then review recent progress in the study of crystal growth, molecular structures, phase morphologies, and physical properties of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional (0-, 1-, and 2D) ice. Extraordinary behaviors of ice in low dimensions and extreme conditions are highlighted. Finally, the future outlook for the physical study and technological applications of L-D ice is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the unique properties of low-dimensional and confined ice, which exhibit distinct morphological and optical characteristics compared to their bulk counterparts. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we characterized the crystal growth and interface morphology of ice in confined geometries, revealing a high degree of anisotropy and interface-mediated effects on its optical and mechanical properties. Our results show that the confined ice exhibits enhanced optical reflectivity and reduced mechanical strength compared to bulk ice, due to the increased surface-to-volume ratio and interface-mediated interactions. Furthermore, we observed a significant impact of the confinement geometry on the ice's morphology, with the formation of novel, low-dimensional structures that display unique optical and mechanical properties. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the behavior of ice in confined environments, such as in cryogenic systems and biological tissues, and may lead to the development of novel materials and applications.", "label": 0}
