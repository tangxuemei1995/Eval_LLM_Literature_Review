{"grounding": "The increasing consumption of nonrenewable materials urgently calls for the design and fabrication of sustainable alternatives. New generations of materials should be derived from renewable sources, processed using environmentally friendly methods, and designed considering their full life cycle, especially their end-of-life fate. Here, we review recent advances in developing sustainable polymers from biological matter (biomatter), including progress in the extraction and utilization of bioderived monomers and polymers, as well as the emergence of polymers produced directly from unprocessed biomatter (entire cells or tissues). We also discuss applications of sustainable polymers in bioplastics, biocomposites, and cementitious biomaterials, with emphasis on relating their performance to underlying fundamental mechanisms. Finally, we provide a future outlook for sustainable material development, highlighting the need for more accurate and accessible tools for assessing life-cycle impacts and socioeconomic challenges as this field advances.", "generated_text": "The increasing demand for sustainable materials has driven research into the development of polymers derived from biological matter. Biopolymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional petrochemical-based polymers. These biopolymers offer a sustainable solution for various applications, including packaging, textiles, and biomedical devices. Biocomposites, comprising biopolymers and natural fibers, have also been explored for their enhanced mechanical properties and reduced environmental impact. Furthermore, the use of biological matter in cementitious materials has been investigated, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional cement production. This review highlights the progress made in the development of sustainable polymers from biological matter, emphasizing the potential of biopolymers and biocomposites in reducing the environmental footprint of various industries. The future directions of this field are also discussed, including the scaling up of bioproduction processes and the integration of biopolymers into existing supply chains.", "label": 1}
