{"grounding": "Hydrous transition metal oxides (TMOs) are redox-active materials that confine structural water within their bulk, organized in 1D, 2D, or 3D networks. In an electrochemical cell, hydrous TMOs can interact with electrolyte species not only via their outer surface but also via their hydrous inner surface, which can transport electrolyte species to the interior of the material. Many TMOs operating in an aqueous electrochemical environment transform to hydrous TMOs, which then serve as the electrochemically active phase. This review summarizes the physicochemical properties of hydrous TMOs and recent mechanistic insights into their behavior in electrochemical reactions of interest for energy storage, conversion, and environmental applications. Particular focus is placed on first-principles calculations and operando characterization to obtain an atomistic view of their electrochemical mechanisms. Hydrous TMOs represent an important class of energy and environmental materials in aqueous and nonaqueous environments. Further understanding of their interaction with electrolyte species is likely to yield advancements in electrochemical reactivity and kinetics for energy and environmental applications.", "generated_text": "Hydrous transition metal oxides (HTMOs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in electrochemical energy and environmental systems. These materials exhibit unique structural properties, including the incorporation of water molecules, which influence their electrochemical behavior. The insertion of water into the oxide lattice can lead to the formation of hydrated ions, enhancing the material's electrochemical activity. HTMOs have been explored as electrodes in various energy storage and conversion applications, including batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. The structural water in HTMOs can also be exploited for environmental remediation, such as the removal of heavy metals and pollutants from contaminated water. This review provides an overview of the current state of research on HTMOs, highlighting their electrochemical properties, structural water, and potential applications in energy and environmental systems. The findings of this review aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of HTMOs in addressing the pressing needs of sustainable energy and environmental sustainability.", "label": 1}
