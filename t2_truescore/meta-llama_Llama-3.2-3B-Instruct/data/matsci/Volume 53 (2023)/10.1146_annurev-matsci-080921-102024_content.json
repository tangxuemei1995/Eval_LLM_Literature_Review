{"grounding": "Most heterogeneous catalytic processes occur between combinations of gases, liquids, and solids at elevated temperatures. They play a critical role for society in energy production, health care, a cleaner environment, industrial products, food, fuel cells, battery technologies, and photocatalysis. Dynamic gas\u2013solid catalyst reactions take place at the atomic level, with active catalyst structures forming, and often also progressively and competitively deactivating, under reaction conditions. There is increasing evidence that single atoms and small clusters of atoms can act as primary active sites in catalytic reactions. Understanding and directing the reactions at the atomic level under controlled operating conditions are crucial for the development of improved materials and processes. We review advances in dynamic in situ microscopy for directly probing heterogeneous catalysis at the atomic level in live action and real time. Benefits include new knowledge and improved management of process fundamentals for greater efficiency and sustainability.", "generated_text": "The integration of dynamic in situ electron microscopy with single-atom catalysis has revolutionized our understanding of chemical reactions at the atomic scale. By providing real-time visualizations of catalytic processes, this approach enables researchers to elucidate the intricate mechanisms governing single-atom catalysis. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of in situ electron microscopy in observing the dynamic behavior of single atoms on surfaces, revealing novel insights into the role of atomic-scale defects and the impact of environmental conditions on catalytic activity. These findings have significant implications for the development of more efficient and selective catalytic systems, with potential applications in fields such as energy production and environmental remediation. The intersection of single-atom catalysis and dynamic in situ electron microscopy has opened a new frontier in chemical research, offering a powerful tool for probing the intricate dynamics of catalytic processes at the atomic scale.", "label": 0}
