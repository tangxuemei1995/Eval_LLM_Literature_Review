{"grounding": "Soft robotics aims to close the performance gap between built and biological machines through materials design. Soft robots are constructed from soft, actuatable materials to be physically intelligent, or to have traits that living organisms possess such as passive adaptability and morphological computation through their compliant, deformable bodies. However, materials selection for physical intelligence often involves low-performance and/or energy-inefficient, stimuli-responsive materials for actuation. Additional challenges in soft robot sensorization and control further limit the practical utility of these machines. Recognizing that electrically controllable materials are crucial for the development of soft machines that are both physically and computationally intelligent, we review progress in the development of electroprogrammable materials for soft robotic actuation. We focus on thermomechanical, electrostatic, and electrochemical actuation strategies that are directly controlled by electric currents and fields. We conclude with an outlook on the design and fabrication of next-generation robotic materials that will facilitate true bioinspired autonomy.", "generated_text": "The development of electrically controllable materials for soft, bioinspired machines has revolutionized the field of soft robotics, enabling the creation of multifunctional devices with unprecedented flexibility and adaptability. These materials, inspired by nature's own designs, exhibit unique properties such as high elasticity, toughness, and conductivity, allowing for precise control over shape, size, and function. Recent advances in polymer chemistry and nanotechnology have led to the synthesis of novel materials with tailored mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, facilitating the design of soft actuators and robotic components. Bioinspired machines, such as artificial muscles and grippers, have been successfully developed, demonstrating the potential for soft robotics to transform industries from healthcare to manufacturing. This review provides an overview of the current state of electrically controllable materials for soft, bioinspired machines, highlighting their applications, challenges, and future directions for innovation and practical implementation.", "label": 0}
