{"grounding": "If variety is the spice of life, then abnormal grain growth (AGG) may be the materials processing equivalent of sriracha sauce. Abnormally growing grains can be prismatic, dendritic, or practically any shape in between. When they grow at least an order of magnitude larger than their neighbors in the matrix\u2014a state we call extreme AGG\u2014we can examine the abnormal/matrix interface for clues to the underlying mechanism. Simulating AGG for various formulations of the grain boundary (GB) equation of motion, we show that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy leave a characteristic fingerprint in the abnormal/matrix boundary. Except in the case of prismatic growth, the morphological signature of most reported instances of AGG is consistent with a certain degree of GB mobility variability. Open questions remain, however, concerning the mechanism by which the corresponding growth advantage is established and maintained as the GBs of abnormal grains advance through the matrix.", "generated_text": "Extreme abnormal grain growth (EAGG) is a phenomenon where grains exhibit accelerated growth rates, leading to the formation of a coarse-grained microstructure. This process is often driven by the interplay between grain boundary energy, mobility, and Zener pinning. In this review, we synthesize the current understanding of EAGG mechanisms, highlighting the critical roles of grain boundary energy and mobility in governing grain growth rates. We also discuss the impact of Zener pinning on grain growth, including its ability to suppress or enhance grain growth depending on the pinning strength and grain boundary characteristics. Furthermore, we examine the microstructural outcomes of EAGG, including the formation of grain size distributions, texture evolution, and the resulting mechanical properties. By connecting the dots between EAGG mechanisms and microstructural outcomes, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of materials undergoing extreme abnormal grain growth.", "label": 1}
