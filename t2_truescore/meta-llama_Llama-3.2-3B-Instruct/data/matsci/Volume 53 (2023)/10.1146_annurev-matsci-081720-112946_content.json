{"grounding": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have found a role in crystal morphology engineering and control by specific binding to crystal surfaces through stereo-chemical recognition. The utility of TMAs, however, has been largely limited to crystal growth from solutions. In this review, we illustrate examples where TMAs have been used to influence the growth of crystals during cooling of their melts. In solution, the crystal growth driving force is governed by solute supersaturation, which corresponds to the deviation from equilibrium. In growth from melts, however, undercooling is the important thermodynamic parameter responsible for crystallization outcomes, a key difference that can influence the manner in which TMAs affect growth kinetics, crystal morphology, nucleation, enantioselective surface recognition, and the determination of the absolute sense of polar axes. When the crystallization driving force in a melt is small and diffusion is comparatively high, TMAs can exert their influence on well-faceted single crystals with the stereochemical richness observed in solution growth. Under high supercooling, where the driving force is large, ensembles of crystals can grow radially, masking stereochemical information and requiring new optical tools for understanding the influence of TMAs on emerging crystals.", "generated_text": "The development of tailor-made additives for melt-grown molecular crystals has garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to control crystal morphology, chirality, and polarity. Melt-grown crystals, such as spherulites and twisted crystals, exhibit unique properties that make them suitable for various applications, including optoelectronics and pharmaceuticals. However, the lack of control over crystal structure and defects can lead to inconsistent material properties. Tailor-made additives, such as chiral molecules and polymers, have been shown to influence crystal growth and morphology, enabling the creation of crystals with desired properties. This review aims to discuss the current state of research on tailor-made additives for melt-grown molecular crystals, highlighting their potential benefits and limitations. The role of additives in controlling crystal chirality, polarity, and morphology is examined, as well as the challenges associated with their incorporation into melt-grown crystal systems. By understanding the complex interactions between additives and crystal growth, researchers can develop more efficient methods for creating tailor-made molecular crystals with tailored properties.", "label": 1}
