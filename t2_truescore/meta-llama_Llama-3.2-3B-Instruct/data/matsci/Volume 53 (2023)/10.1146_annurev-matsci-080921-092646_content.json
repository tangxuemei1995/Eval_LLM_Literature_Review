{"grounding": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is one of the most powerful characterization tools in materials science research. Due to instrumentation developments such as highly coherent electron sources, aberration correctors, and direct electron detectors, STEM experiments can examine the structure and properties of materials at length scales of functional devices and materials down to single atoms. STEM encompasses a wide array of flexible operating modes, including imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and 3D tomography experiments. This review outlines many common STEM experimental methods with a focus on quantitative data analysis and simulation methods, especially those enabled by open source software. The hope is to introduce both classic and new experimental methods to materials scientists and summarize recent progress in STEM characterization. The review also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the various STEM methodologies and briefly considers promising future directions for quantitative STEM research.", "generated_text": "Quantitative Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has revolutionized the field of materials science by enabling the acquisition of high-resolution images, diffraction patterns, spectroscopic information, and 3D tomographic reconstructions of materials at the nanoscale. By leveraging advanced computational models and machine learning algorithms, STEM can provide quantitative analysis of material properties, such as composition, crystal structure, and defects. This abstract reviews the current state of the art in quantitative STEM, highlighting its applications in materials characterization, simulation, and modeling. The integration of STEM with other analytical techniques, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, has expanded its capabilities for materials analysis. The future of quantitative STEM holds great promise for advancing our understanding of materials science and driving innovation in fields such as energy, electronics, and biomedicine.", "label": 1}
