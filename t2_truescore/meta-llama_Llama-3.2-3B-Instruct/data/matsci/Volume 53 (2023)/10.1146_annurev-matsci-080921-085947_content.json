{"grounding": "High-throughput data generation methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms have given rise to a new era of computational materials science by learning the relations between composition, structure, and properties and by exploiting such relations for design. However, to build these connections, materials data must be translated into a numerical form, called a representation, that can be processed by an ML model. Data sets in materials science vary in format (ranging from images to spectra), size, and fidelity. Predictive models vary in scope and properties of interest. Here, we review context-dependent strategies for constructing representations that enable the use of materials as inputs or outputs for ML models. Furthermore, we discuss how modern ML techniques can learn representations from data and transfer chemical and physical information between tasks. Finally, we outline high-impact questions that have not been fully resolved and thus require further investigation.", "generated_text": "The representation of materials is a crucial aspect of machine learning, as it directly impacts the performance of predictive models in materials science. This review article focuses on the recent advancements in feature engineering for materials, with a particular emphasis on the use of generative models to learn complex material representations. We discuss the importance of crystal structure in determining material properties and its role in feature engineering. Our analysis highlights the potential of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to learn compact and informative representations of materials. We also explore the application of these models in various materials science tasks, including material classification, property prediction, and material discovery. By integrating insights from materials science and machine learning, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for the development of more accurate and efficient material representation models.", "label": 1}
