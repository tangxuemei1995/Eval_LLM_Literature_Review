{"grounding": "We review the class of materials known as polar metals, in which polarity and metallicity coexist in the same phase. While the notion of polar metals was first invoked more than 50 years ago, their practical realization has proved challenging since the itinerant carriers required for metallicity tend to screen any polarization. Huge progress has been made in the last decade, with many mechanisms for combining polarity and metallicity proposed and the first examples, LiOsO3 and WTe2, identified experimentally. The availability of polar metallic samples has opened a new paradigm in polar metal research, with implications in the fields of topology, ferroelectricity, magnetoelectricity, spintronics, and superconductivity. Here, we review the principles and techniques that have been developed to design and engineer polar metals and describe some of their interesting properties, with a focus on the most promising directions for future work.", "generated_text": "Polar metals, a class of ferroelectric materials, have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique properties and potential applications. These materials exhibit improper ferroelectricity, a phenomenon where the electric polarization is induced by the spin or orbital degrees of freedom rather than the traditional lattice strain. Perovskites, a class of materials with a general formula of ABO3, are a prominent example of polar metals. The principles underlying the polarization mechanism in polar metals are rooted in the interplay between the crystal structure, electronic properties, and magnetic interactions. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of polar metals, focusing on the theoretical frameworks, experimental techniques, and emerging prospects for their applications in next-generation electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage devices. The potential of polar metals to revolutionize the field of materials science is discussed, highlighting the need for further research and development to unlock their full potential.", "label": 1}
