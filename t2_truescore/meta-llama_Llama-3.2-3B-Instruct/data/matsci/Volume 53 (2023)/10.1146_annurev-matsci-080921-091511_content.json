{"grounding": "Grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials migrate to reduce the total excess energy. It has recently been found that the factors governing migration rates of boundaries in bicrystals are insufficient to explain boundary migration in polycrystals. We first review our current understanding of the atomistic mechanisms of grain boundary migration based on simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. We then review our current understanding at the continuum scale based on simulations and observations using high-energy diffraction microscopy. We conclude that detailed comparisons of experimental observations with atomistic simulations of migration in polycrystals (rather than bicrystals) are required to better understand the mechanisms of grain boundary migration, that the driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals must include factors other than curvature, and that current simulations of grain growth are insufficient for reproducing experimental observations, possibly because of an inadequate representation of the driving force.", "generated_text": "Grain boundary migration in polycrystals is a complex process that involves the movement of grain boundaries, resulting in changes to the microstructure and properties of the material. This phenomenon is crucial in understanding the evolution of polycrystalline materials under various thermal and mechanical conditions. The migration of grain boundaries can lead to the formation of new grains, grain coarsening, and the creation of defects such as grain boundary misorientations and vacancies. Recent studies have shown that grain boundary migration is influenced by factors such as grain size, temperature, and strain rate. Theoretical models, including grain boundary mobility and diffusion-controlled models, have been developed to describe the grain boundary migration process. Experimental studies have also been conducted to investigate the effects of grain boundary migration on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials, including strength, ductility, and toughness. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of grain boundary migration in polycrystals, highlighting the key factors and mechanisms involved in this process.", "label": 1}
