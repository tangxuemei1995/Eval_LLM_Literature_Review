{"grounding": "Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) materials feature an exciting array of functionalities such as nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and topological spin textures (skyrmions). While NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions display two different sets of physical properties, their design strategies are deeply connected in terms of atomic-scale precision, structural customization, and electronic tunability. Despite impressive progress in studying these systems separately, a joint road map for navigating the chemical principles for NCS materials remains elusive. This review unites two subtopics of NCS systems, NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions, offering a multifaceted narrative of how to translate the often-abstract fundamentals to the targeted functionalities while inviting innovative approaches from the community. We outline the design principles central to the desired properties by exemplifying relevant examples in the field. We supplement materials chemistry with pertinent electronic structures to demonstrate the power of the fundamentals to create systems integration relevant to foreseeable societal impacts in frequency-doubling instrumentation and spin-based electronics.", "generated_text": "Noncentrosymmetric materials have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique properties, including nonlinear optical responses, magnetism, and topological protection. These materials exhibit skyrmion behavior, which is a topological phenomenon that arises from the interplay between spin and orbital angular momentum. The electronic structure of noncentrosymmetric materials is crucial in understanding their properties, as it determines the arrangement of electrons and the resulting physical phenomena. This review article provides an overview of the design principles for noncentrosymmetric materials, with a focus on their electronic structure and the resulting nonlinear optical responses, magnetic properties, and topological protection. We discuss the role of crystal symmetry, electron-electron interactions, and lattice distortions in shaping the electronic structure and properties of these materials. Our analysis highlights the potential of noncentrosymmetric materials for novel applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and topological quantum computing. By understanding the design principles for these materials, we can unlock their full potential and explore new frontiers in materials science and physics.", "label": 1}
