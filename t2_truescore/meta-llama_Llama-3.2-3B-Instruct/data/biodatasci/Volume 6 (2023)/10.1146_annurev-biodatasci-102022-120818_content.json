{"grounding": "Despite monumental advances in molecular technology to generate genome sequence data at scale, there is still a considerable proportion of heritability in most complex diseases that remains unexplained. Because many of the discoveries have been single-nucleotide variants with small to moderate effects on disease, the functional implication of many of the variants is still unknown and, thus, we have limited new drug targets and therapeutics. We, and many others, posit that one primary factor that has limited our ability to identify novel drug targets from genome-wide association studies may be due to gene interactions (epistasis), gene\u2013environment interactions, network/pathway effects, or multiomic relationships. We propose that many of these complex models explain much of the underlying genetic architecture of complex disease. In this review, we discuss the evidence from multiple research avenues, ranging from pairs of alleles to multiomic integration studies and pharmacogenomics, that supports the need for further investigation of gene interactions (or epistasis) in genetic and genomic studies of human disease. Our goal is to catalog the mounting evidence for epistasis in genetic studies and the connections between genetic interactions and human health and disease that could enable precision medicine of the future.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationships between genes and their interactions in human disease have garnered significant attention in recent years. Epistasis, the phenomenon of gene-gene interactions, plays a crucial role in shaping the genetic architecture of complex human diseases. Recent advances in multiomics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have enabled researchers to uncover the complex interactions between genes and their regulatory networks. These studies have provided evidence for the importance of epistasis in modulating disease susceptibility and progression. For instance, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic variants that interact with each other to influence disease risk. Furthermore, computational models have been developed to predict the functional impact of these interactions on disease pathways. The integration of multiomics data with machine learning algorithms has also enabled the identification of novel epistatic interactions that may contribute to human disease. As precision medicine continues to evolve, a deeper understanding of gene interactions is essential for the development of targeted therapies and the prediction of individual disease risk. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on epistasis in human disease studies and its implications for precision medicine.", "label": 1}
