{"grounding": "Admixed populations constitute a large portion of global human genetic diversity, yet they are often left out of genomics analyses. This exclusion is problematic, as it leads to disparities in the understanding of the genetic structure and history of diverse cohorts and the performance of genomic medicine across populations. Admixed populations have particular statistical challenges, as they inherit genomic segments from multiple source populations\u2014the primary reason they have historically been excluded from genetic studies. In recent years, however, an increasing number of statistical methods and software tools have been developed to account for and leverage admixture in the context of genomics analyses. Here, we provide a survey of such computational strategies for the informed consideration of admixture to allow for the well-calibrated inclusion of mixed ancestry populations in large-scale genomics studies, and we detail persisting gaps in existing tools.", "generated_text": "The increasing availability of genomic data from admixed populations presents a unique challenge for the analysis of complex traits. Admixed individuals possess a mixture of genetic variants from different ancestral populations, which can lead to increased genetic heterogeneity and reduced power to detect associations with complex traits. This review aims to provide an overview of strategies for the genomic analysis of admixed populations, including the use of statistical methods to account for population structure and ancestry. We discuss the application of techniques such as principal component analysis, mixed-model association analysis, and machine learning-based approaches to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits in admixed populations. Additionally, we highlight the importance of considering the effects of admixture on genetic association studies and provide recommendations for the optimal analysis of genomic data from admixed populations.", "label": 0}
