{"grounding": "Alternative splicing is pivotal to the regulation of gene expression and protein diversity in eukaryotic cells. The detection of alternative splicing events requires specific omics technologies. Although short-read RNA sequencing has successfully supported a plethora of investigations on alternative splicing, the emerging technologies of long-read RNA sequencing and top-down mass spectrometry open new opportunities to identify alternative splicing and protein isoforms with less ambiguity. Here, we summarize improvements in short-read RNA sequencing for alternative splicing analysis, including percent splicing index estimation and differential analysis. We also review the computational methods used in top-down proteomics analysis regarding proteoform identification, including the construction of databases of protein isoforms and statistical analyses of search results. While many improvements in sequencing and computational methods will result from emerging technologies, there should be future endeavors to increase the effectiveness, integration, and proteome coverage of alternative splicing events.", "generated_text": "Alternative splicing is a critical process in gene expression that generates diverse transcript variants and isoforms, leading to increased functional diversity of proteins. Recent advances in sequencing technologies, including short-read RNA-seq and long-read RNA-seq, have enabled the comprehensive identification of splice variants and isoforms. Top-down mass spectrometry approaches have also been developed to analyze protein isoforms and proteoforms, providing insights into post-translational modifications and protein post-translational regulation. This review highlights the current state of research on the identification of splice variants and isoforms in transcriptomics and proteomics, with a focus on the integration of sequencing and mass spectrometry technologies. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach and their potential applications in understanding the complex regulation of gene expression and protein function.", "label": 1}
