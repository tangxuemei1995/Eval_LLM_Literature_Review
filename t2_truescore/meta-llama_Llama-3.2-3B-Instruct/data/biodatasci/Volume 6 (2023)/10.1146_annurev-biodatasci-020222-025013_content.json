{"grounding": "Drug development is a wide scientific field that faces many challenges these days. Among them are extremely high development costs, long development times, and a small number of new drugs that are approved each year. New and innovative technologies are needed to solve these problems that make the drug discovery process of small molecules more time and cost efficient, and that allow previously undruggable receptor classes to be targeted, such as protein\u2013protein interactions. Structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs) have become a leading contender in this context. In this review, we give an introduction to the foundations of SBVSs and survey their progress in the past few years with a focus on ultralarge virtual screenings (ULVSs). We outline key principles of SBVSs, recent success stories, new screening techniques, available deep learning\u2013based docking methods, and promising future research directions. ULVSs have an enormous potential for the development of new small-molecule drugs and are already starting to transform early-stage drug discovery.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in computational chemistry and machine learning have significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches in drug discovery. By leveraging deep learning algorithms and GPU acceleration, researchers can now rapidly process vast libraries of molecules, enabling the identification of potential lead compounds. Structure-based virtual screenings, which utilize molecular docking and free energy simulations, have also been refined to better predict binding affinities and ligand-receptor interactions. The integration of machine learning models with these computational methods has further enhanced the accuracy and speed of virtual screening, allowing for the identification of promising candidates with reduced experimental costs. This review highlights the recent developments in ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches, with a focus on their applications in drug discovery and the future directions for this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
