{"grounding": "Viruses evolve to evade prior immunity, causing significant disease burden. Vaccine effectiveness deteriorates as pathogens mutate, requiring redesign. This is a problem that has grown worse due to population increase, global travel, and farming practices. Thus, there is significant interest in developing broad-spectrum vaccines that mitigate disease severity and ideally inhibit disease transmission without requiring frequent updates. Even in cases where vaccines against rapidly mutating pathogens have been somewhat effective, such as seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), designing vaccines that provide broad-spectrum immunity against routinely observed viral variation remains a desirable but not yet achieved goal. This review highlights the key theoretical advances in understanding the interplay between polymorphism and vaccine efficacy, challenges in designing broad-spectrum vaccines, and technology advances and possible avenues forward. We also discuss data-driven approaches for monitoring vaccine efficacy and predicting viral escape from vaccine-induced protection. In each case, we consider illustrative examples in vaccine development from influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)\u2014three examples of highly prevalent rapidly mutating viruses with distinct phylogenetics and unique histories of vaccine technology development.", "generated_text": "The rapid evolution of viruses poses significant challenges to the development of effective vaccines. Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV are prime examples of viruses that have adapted to evade host immune responses, necessitating the design of broad-spectrum vaccines that can provide universal protection. Recent advances in broadly neutralizing antibody (bNA) technology have shown promise in eliciting broad-spectrum immunity against these viruses. However, the complexity of viral genomes and the high mutation rates of rapidly evolving viruses pose significant hurdles to vaccine design. This review aims to discuss the current challenges and progress in designing broad-spectrum vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses. We examine the latest strategies for eliciting broad-spectrum immunity, including the use of bNA, mRNA-based vaccines, and viral vector-based vaccines. We also discuss the challenges associated with manufacturing and scaling up these vaccines, as well as the need for continued research and development to overcome the limitations of current vaccine technologies. Ultimately, the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses holds the key to preventing future pandemics and protecting global public health.", "label": 1}
