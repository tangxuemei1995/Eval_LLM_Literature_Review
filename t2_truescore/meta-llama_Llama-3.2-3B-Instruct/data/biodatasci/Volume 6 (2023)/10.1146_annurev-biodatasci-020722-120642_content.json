{"grounding": "Organismal aging exhibits wide-ranging hallmarks in divergent cell types across tissues, organs, and systems. The advancement of single-cell technologies and generation of rich datasets have afforded the scientific community the opportunity to decode these hallmarks of aging at an unprecedented scope and resolution. In this review, we describe the technological advancements and bioinformatic methodologies enabling data interpretation at the cellular level. Then, we outline the application of such technologies for decoding aging hallmarks and potential intervention targets and summarize common themes and context-specific molecular features in representative organ systems across the body. Finally, we provide a brief summary of available databases relevant for aging research and present an outlook on the opportunities in this emerging field.", "generated_text": "Aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by the accumulation of distinct cellular and molecular alterations, collectively referred to as aging hallmarks. Recent advances in single-cell analysis have enabled the deciphering of these hallmarks at the cellular level, revealing intricate mechanisms underlying aging progression. This study leverages cutting-edge analytical tools and a comprehensive data resource to investigate the expression and dynamics of aging hallmarks in human cells. By identifying key intervention targets and elucidating the underlying mechanisms, our findings provide novel insights into the aging process, paving the way for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related diseases.", "label": 1}
