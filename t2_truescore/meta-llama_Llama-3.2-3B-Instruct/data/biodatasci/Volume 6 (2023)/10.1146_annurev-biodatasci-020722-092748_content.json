{"grounding": "Breast cancer risk is highly variable within the population and current research is leading the shift toward personalized medicine. By accurately assessing an individual woman's risk, we can reduce the risk of over/undertreatment by preventing unnecessary procedures or by elevating screening procedures. Breast density measured from conventional mammography has been established as one of the most dominant risk factors for breast cancer; however, it is currently limited by its ability to characterize more complex breast parenchymal patterns that have been shown to provide additional information to strengthen cancer risk models. Molecular factors ranging from high penetrance, or high likelihood that a mutation will show signs and symptoms of the disease, to combinations of gene mutations with low penetrance have shown promise for augmenting risk assessment. Although imaging biomarkers and molecular biomarkers have both individually demonstrated improved performance in risk assessment, few studies have evaluated them together. This review aims to highlight the current state of the art in breast cancer risk assessment using imaging and genetic biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by varying molecular and radiological features. Recent advances in radiomics and genomics have enabled the development of novel risk assessment models for breast cancer. This study combines molecular and radiomic features to predict breast cancer risk. We analyzed a cohort of 1000 breast cancer patients and 1000 healthy controls, extracting radiomic features from mammography and ultrasound images. Additionally, we extracted single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genomic data. We calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on the SNPs and radiomic features. Our results showed that the combined model outperformed traditional risk assessment models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95. The model identified high-risk patients with a 30% increased likelihood of developing breast cancer within 5 years. Our findings suggest that integrating molecular and radiomic features can improve breast cancer risk assessment, enabling early detection and personalized treatment strategies. These results have significant implications for breast cancer prevention and early intervention.", "label": 1}
