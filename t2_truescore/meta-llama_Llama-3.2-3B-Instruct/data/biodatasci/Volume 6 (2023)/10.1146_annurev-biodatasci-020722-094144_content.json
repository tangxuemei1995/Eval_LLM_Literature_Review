{"grounding": "Prenatal screening using sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA has transformed obstetric care over the past decade and significantly reduced the number of invasive diagnostic procedures like amniocentesis for genetic disorders. Nonetheless, emergency care remains the only option for complications like preeclampsia and preterm birth, two of the most prevalent obstetrical syndromes. Advances in noninvasive prenatal testing expand the scope of precision medicine in obstetric care. In this review, we discuss advances, challenges, and possibilities toward the goal of providing proactive, personalized prenatal care. The highlighted advances focus mainly on cell-free nucleic acids; however, we also review research that uses signals from metabolomics, proteomics, intact cells, and the microbiome. We discuss ethical challenges in providing care. Finally, we look to future possibilities, including redefining disease taxonomy and moving from biomarker correlation to biological causation.", "generated_text": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has revolutionized the field of prenatal care by enabling the detection of genetic abnormalities in fetal cells circulating in maternal blood. Recent advances in liquid biopsy technologies have improved the accuracy and efficiency of NIPT, leveraging circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) as biomarkers. The use of machine learning algorithms and next-generation sequencing has enhanced the detection of rare genetic variants and improved the resolution of NIPT results. However, challenges persist, including the need for standardized protocols, the impact of maternal health on cfDNA and cfRNA quality, and the potential for false positives. Despite these challenges, NIPT holds great promise for improving prenatal care, enabling early intervention, and reducing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing NIPT protocols and expanding its applications to diverse populations.", "label": 1}
