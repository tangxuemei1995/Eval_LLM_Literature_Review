{"grounding": "Since the first publication a decade ago describing the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the context of cancer, over 200 datasets and thousands of scRNA-seq studies have been published in cancer biology. scRNA-seq technologies have been applied across dozens of cancer types and a diverse array of study designs to improve our understanding of tumor biology, the tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic responses, and scRNA-seq is on the verge of being used to improve decision-making in the clinic. Computational methodologies and analytical pipelines are key in facilitating scRNA-seq research. Numerous computational methods utilizing the most advanced tools in data science have been developed to extract meaningful insights. Here, we review the advancements in cancer biology gained by scRNA-seq and discuss the computational challenges of the technology that are specific to cancer research.", "generated_text": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the field of cancer research by enabling the comprehensive analysis of tumor heterogeneity and the characterization of rare cell populations. By analyzing the transcriptome of individual cancer cells, scRNA-seq provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression, including the identification of novel cancer stem cells and the elucidation of the tumor microenvironment. Bioinformatics tools have been developed to facilitate the analysis of scRNA-seq data, allowing researchers to reconstruct cell trajectories, identify differentially expressed genes, and predict the functional roles of individual cells. The application of scRNA-seq in cancer research has also facilitated the development of personalized immunotherapies, enabling the identification of cancer-specific antigens and the design of targeted therapies. This review highlights the current state of scRNA-seq in cancer research and its potential for advancing our understanding of human cancers.", "label": 1}
