{"grounding": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revolutionized our understanding of common genetic variation and its impact on common human disease and traits. Developed and adopted in the mid-2000s, GWAS led to searchable genotype\u2013phenotype catalogs and genome-wide datasets available for further data mining and analysis for the eventual development of translational applications. The GWAS revolution was swift and specific, including almost exclusively populations of European descent, to the neglect of the majority of the world's genetic diversity. In this narrative review, we recount the GWAS landscape of the early years that established a genotype\u2013phenotype catalog that is now universally understood to be inadequate for a complete understanding of complex human genetics. We then describe approaches taken to augment the genotype\u2013phenotype catalog, including the study populations, collaborative consortia, and study design approaches aimed to generalize and then ultimately discover genome-wide associations in non-European descent populations. The collaborations and data resources established in the efforts to diversify genomic findings undoubtedly provide the foundations of the next chapters of genetic association studies with the advent of budget-friendly whole-genome sequencing.", "generated_text": "The increasing recognition of the importance of diversity in precision medicine has led to a growing need to assess the generalizability of genetic associations across ancestry groups. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous variants associated with disease susceptibility, but the majority of these studies have been conducted in predominantly European cohorts. This limitation raises concerns about the applicability of these findings to diverse populations. Recent advances in polygenic risk scores (PRS) have enabled the prediction of disease susceptibility based on an individual's genetic makeup. However, the generalizability of PRS across ancestry groups remains uncertain. This review aims to discuss the current state of knowledge on the importance of diversity in precision medicine, with a focus on the generalizability of genetic associations across ancestry groups. We will examine the current evidence on the impact of ancestry on GWAS findings and the development of PRS, highlighting the need for increased diversity in research cohorts and consortia to improve the accuracy of disease susceptibility predictions. Ultimately, this review seeks to inform strategies for improving the generalizability of genetic associations across ancestry groups and enhancing the effectiveness of precision medicine in diverse populations.", "label": 1}
