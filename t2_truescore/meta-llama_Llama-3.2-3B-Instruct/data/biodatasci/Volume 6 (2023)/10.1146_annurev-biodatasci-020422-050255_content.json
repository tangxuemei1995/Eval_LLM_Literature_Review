{"grounding": "Advances in single-cell proteomics technologies have resulted in high-dimensional datasets comprising millions of cells that are capable of answering key questions about biology and disease. The advent of these technologies has prompted the development of computational tools to process and visualize the complex data. In this review, we outline the steps of single-cell and spatial proteomics analysis pipelines. In addition to describing available methods, we highlight benchmarking studies that have identified advantages and pitfalls of the currently available computational toolkits. As these technologies continue to advance, robust analysis tools should be developed in tandem to take full advantage of the potential biological insights provided by these data.", "generated_text": "Single-cell proteomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by enabling the comprehensive analysis of protein expression at the single-cell level. Computational methods play a crucial role in this field, facilitating the integration of mass cytometry and spatial proteomics data. This abstract reviews recent advances in data analysis, clustering, and trajectory inference for single-cell proteomics. We discuss the application of machine learning algorithms, dimensionality reduction techniques, and spatial modeling to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in single-cell proteomic data. By leveraging these computational methods, researchers can gain insights into cellular behavior, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex biological systems.", "label": 1}
