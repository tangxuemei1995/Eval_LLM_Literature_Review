{"grounding": "Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental delay that affects at least 1 in 44 children. Like many neurological disorder phenotypes, the diagnostic features are observable, can be tracked over time, and can be managed or even eliminated through proper therapy and treatments. However, there are major bottlenecks in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and longitudinal tracking pipelines for autism and related neurodevelopmental delays, creating an opportunity for novel data science solutions to augment and transform existing workflows and provide increased access to services for affected families. Several efforts previously conducted by a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress toward improved digital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review the literature on digital health methods for autism behavior quantification and beneficial therapies using data science. We describe both case\u2013control studies and classification systems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and therapeutics that integrate machine learning models of autism-related behaviors, including the factors that must be addressed for translational use. Finally, we describe ongoing challenges and potential opportunities for the field of autism data science. Given the heterogeneous nature of autism and the complexities of the relevant behaviors, this review contains insights that are relevant to neurological behavior analysis and digital psychiatry more broadly.", "generated_text": "Autism is a complex and heterogeneous neuropsychiatric phenotype characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. The increasing availability of digital health data and advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new avenues for the development of digital phenotyping tools and personalized interventions for autism. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in data science and ML for autism, highlighting the potential of digital phenotyping, crowdsourcing, and digital psychiatry in improving diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for individuals with autism. We discuss the various types of digital data that can be leveraged, including electronic health records, wearable devices, and social media platforms, and review the existing literature on ML algorithms and techniques used for autism diagnosis, prediction, and monitoring. A roadmap for future research is also presented, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, standardization of data and methods, and the development of evidence-based digital interventions. By integrating data science and ML into autism research, we can accelerate the development of more effective and personalized treatments, ultimately improving the lives of individuals with autism and their families.", "label": 0}
