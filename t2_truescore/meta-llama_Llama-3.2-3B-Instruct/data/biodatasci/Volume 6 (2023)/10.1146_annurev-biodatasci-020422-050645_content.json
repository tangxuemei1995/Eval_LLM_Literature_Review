{"grounding": "Single-cell RNA sequencing methods have led to improved understanding of the heterogeneity and transcriptomic states present in complex biological systems. Recently, the development of novel single-cell technologies for assaying additional modalities, specifically genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial data, allows for unprecedented insight into cellular biology. While certain technologies collect multiple measurements from the same cells simultaneously, even when modalities are separately assayed in different cells, we can apply novel computational methods to integrate these data. The application of computational integration methods to multimodal paired and unpaired data results in rich information about the identities of the cells present and the interactions between different levels of biology, such as between genetic variation and transcription. In this review, we both discuss the single-cell technologies for measuring these modalities and describe and characterize a variety of computational integration methods for combining the resulting data to leverage multimodal information toward greater biological insight.", "generated_text": "Single-cell multiomics is an emerging field that integrates multiple 'omics' technologies to analyze the complex interactions within individual cells. By combining next-generation sequencing, imaging, and other modalities, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and its impact on disease. This abstract reviews the current state of single-cell multiomics, highlighting the computational challenges and innovative approaches that enable the integration of diverse data types. We discuss the applications of single-cell multiomics in understanding cellular development, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. The integration of multimodal data also enables the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our review highlights the potential of single-cell multiomics to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and its translation to clinical applications.", "label": 1}
