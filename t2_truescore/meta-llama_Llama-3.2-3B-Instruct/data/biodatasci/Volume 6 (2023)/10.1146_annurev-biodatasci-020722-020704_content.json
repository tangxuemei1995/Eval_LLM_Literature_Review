{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and other data-driven technologies hold great promise to transform healthcare and confer the predictive power essential to precision medicine. However, the existing biomedical data, which are a vital resource and foundation for developing medical AI models, do not reflect the diversity of the human population. The low representation in biomedical data has become a significant health risk for non-European populations, and the growing application of AI opens a new pathway for this health risk to manifest and amplify. Here we review the current status of biomedical data inequality and present a conceptual framework for understanding its impacts on machine learning. We also discuss the recent advances in algorithmic interventions for mitigating health disparities arising from biomedical data inequality. Finally, we briefly discuss the newly identified disparity in data quality among ethnic groups and its potential impacts on machine learning.", "generated_text": "The biomedical data landscape is plagued by inequality, with subpopulations often underrepresented or misrepresented, leading to biased models and poor health outcomes. This disparity can be addressed through the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly multiethnic machine learning and transfer learning. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on diverse datasets, AI can learn to recognize patterns and relationships that are specific to underrepresented subpopulations. Our research explores the potential of AI to mitigate data inequality by developing models that can adapt to shifting subpopulation demographics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in reducing bias and improving model performance on multiethnic datasets. Our findings have significant implications for healthcare, highlighting the need for diverse and representative datasets to ensure equitable AI-driven decision-making. By addressing data inequality, AI can help bridge the health disparities gap and promote health equity.", "label": 1}
