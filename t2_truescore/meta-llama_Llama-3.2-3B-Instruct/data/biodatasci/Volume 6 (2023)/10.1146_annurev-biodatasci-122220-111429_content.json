{"grounding": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that can regulate all steps of gene expression (induction, transcription, and translation). Several virus families, primarily double-stranded DNA viruses, encode small RNAs (sRNAs), including miRNAs. These virus-derived miRNAs (v-miRNAs) help the virus evade the host's innate and adaptive immune system and maintain an environment of chronic latent infection. In this review, the functions of the sRNA-mediated virus\u2013host interactions are highlighted, delineating their implication in chronic stress, inflammation, immunopathology, and disease. We provide insights into the latest viral RNA\u2013based research\u2014in silico approaches for functional characterization of v-miRNAs and other RNA types. The latest research can assist toward the identification of therapeutic targets to combat viral infections.", "generated_text": "Virus-derived small RNAs and microRNAs play a crucial role in modulating host gene expression, influencing the progression of various diseases. This study focuses on the analysis of v-miRNAs, a class of microRNAs encoded by viruses, including the Epstein-Barr virus. Utilizing bioinformatics tools and resources, we investigated the prevalence and functional significance of v-miRNAs in different viral infections. Our results reveal that v-miRNAs can regulate host immune responses, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we discuss the development of viral RNA bioinformatics resources, enabling researchers to explore the vast repertoire of v-miRNAs and their implications in human health and disease.", "label": 0}
