{"grounding": "SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is silent or benign in most infected individuals, but causes hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia in about 10% of cases. We review studies of the human genetics of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on both rare and common variants. Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified more than 20 common loci robustly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia with modest effect sizes, some implicating genes expressed in the lungs or leukocytes. The most robust association, on chromosome 3, concerns a haplotype inherited from Neanderthals. Sequencing studies focusing on rare variants with a strong effect have been particularly successful, identifying inborn errors of type I interferon (IFN) immunity in 1\u20135% of unvaccinated patients with critical pneumonia, and their autoimmune phenocopy, autoantibodies against type I IFN, in another 15\u201320% of cases. Our growing understanding of the impact of human genetic variation on immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is enabling health systems to improve protection for individuals and populations.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of human genomics in understanding the complex interactions between viral pathogens and host immune systems. This study investigates the contributions of rare and common variants to COVID-19 pneumonia, a severe manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified associations between genetic variants and the risk of developing severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Notably, variants in genes involved in type I interferon signaling, a key component of innate immunity, were significantly associated with increased susceptibility to severe disease. Furthermore, rare variants in genes encoding proteins involved in inborn errors of immunity were also found to contribute to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings highlight the critical role of genetic factors in modulating the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore the importance of personalized medicine approaches in the management of COVID-19. The identification of genetic variants associated with severe disease may also inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
