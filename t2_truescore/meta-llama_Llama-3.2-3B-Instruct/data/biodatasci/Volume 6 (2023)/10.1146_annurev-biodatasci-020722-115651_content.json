{"grounding": "Following the widespread use of deep learning for genomics, deep generative modeling is also becoming a viable methodology for the broad field. Deep generative models (DGMs) can learn the complex structure of genomic data and allow researchers to generate novel genomic instances that retain the real characteristics of the original dataset. Aside from data generation, DGMs can also be used for dimensionality reduction by mapping the data space to a latent space, as well as for prediction tasks via exploitation of this learned mapping or supervised/semi-supervised DGM designs. In this review, we briefly introduce generative modeling and two currently prevailing architectures, we present conceptual applications along with notable examples in functional and evolutionary genomics, and we provide our perspective on potential challenges and future directions.", "generated_text": "Deep generative models have revolutionized the field of functional and evolutionary genomics by enabling the generation of high-quality, synthetic genomic data. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are two prominent architectures that have been successfully applied to various genomics-related tasks, including gene expression prediction, chromatin state inference, and species classification. These models have been shown to outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, deep generative models have been used to analyze large-scale genomic datasets, providing insights into functional and evolutionary relationships between genes and their regulatory elements. This review provides an overview of the current state of deep generative models in functional and evolutionary genomics, highlighting their potential and limitations, and discussing future directions for research in this field.", "label": 0}
