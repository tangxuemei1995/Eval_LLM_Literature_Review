{"grounding": "The human microbiome is complex, variable from person to person, essential for health, and related to both the risk for disease and the efficacy of our treatments. There are robust techniques to describe microbiota with high-throughput sequencing, and there are hundreds of thousands of already-sequenced specimens in public archives. The promise remains to use the microbiome both as a prognostic factor and as a target for precision medicine. However, when used as an input in biomedical data science modeling, the microbiome presents unique challenges. Here, we review the most common techniques used to describe microbial communities, explore these unique challenges, and discuss the more successful approaches for biomedical data scientists seeking to use the microbiome as an input in their studies.", "generated_text": "The human microbiome is a complex ecosystem comprising trillions of microorganisms that inhabit the human body, playing a crucial role in maintaining health and contributing to the development of various diseases. Biomedical data scientists can leverage advanced sequencing technologies, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), to analyze the microbiome's composition and function. This abstract reviews the current state of microbiome research, highlighting the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding the relationships between the microbiome and human health. By integrating microbiome data with other biomedical datasets, data scientists can develop novel predictive models and therapeutic strategies to combat microbiome-related diseases, ultimately improving human health outcomes.", "label": 1}
