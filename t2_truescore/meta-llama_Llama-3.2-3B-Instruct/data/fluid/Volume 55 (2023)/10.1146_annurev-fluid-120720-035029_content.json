{"grounding": "Although face masks have been used for over a century to provide protection against airborne pathogens and pollutants, close scrutiny of their effectiveness has peaked in the past two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The simplicity of face masks belies the complexity of the physical phenomena that determine their effectiveness as a defense against airborne infections. This complexity is rooted in the fact that the effectiveness of face masks depends on the combined effects of respiratory aerodynamics, filtration flow physics, droplet dynamics and their interactions with porous materials, structural dynamics, physiology, and even human behavior. At its core, however, the face mask is a flow-handling device, and in the current review, we take a flow physics\u2013centric view of face masks and the key phenomena that underlie their function. We summarize the state of the art in experimental measurements, as well as the growing body of computational studies that have contributed to our understanding of the factors that determine the effectiveness of face masks. The review also lays out some of the important open questions and technical challenges associated with the effectiveness of face masks.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of face masks in reducing the transmission of respiratory infections. However, the underlying physics of face mask performance remains poorly understood. This study investigates the flow physics of face masks, focusing on the impact of mask design, fit, and user behavior on airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Using computational fluid dynamics and experimental measurements, we analyzed the airflow patterns around different types of face masks, including surgical masks, cloth masks, and respirators. Our results show that mask fit and seal play a critical role in reducing airborne transmission, with masks that fit snugly around the face exhibiting significantly lower airflow rates and increased turbulence. We also found that user behavior, such as mask tightening and breathing patterns, can significantly impact mask performance. These findings have important implications for the design and use of face masks, highlighting the need for standardized mask designs and user guidelines to maximize their effectiveness in reducing airborne transmission of respiratory infections. By elucidating the flow physics of face masks, this study contributes to the development of evidence-based strategies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses.", "label": 1}
