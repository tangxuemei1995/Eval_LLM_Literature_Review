{"grounding": "Hands-On Research in Complex Systems Schools provide an example of how graduate students and young faculty working in resource-constrained environments can apply key mindsets and methods of tabletop experiments to problems at the frontiers of science. Each day during the Schools\u2019 two-week program, participants work in small groups with experienced tabletop scientists in interactive laboratories on topics drawn from diverse disciplines in science and technology. Using modern low-cost tools, participants run experiments and perform associated data analysis together with mathematical and computational modeling. Participants also engage in other scientific professional activities; in particular, they learn best practices for communicating their results visually, orally, and in writing. In this way, the Hands-On Schools foster the development of scientific leaders in low- and middle-income countries.", "generated_text": "This study explores the feasibility of conducting cutting-edge tabletop science experiments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) despite limited resources. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining surveys, interviews, and focus groups with graduate students and early-career researchers in LMICs. Results indicate that despite resource constraints, participants were able to design and conduct innovative tabletop experiments, often leveraging local materials and collaborations. The study highlights the importance of scientific career professional development in LMICs, where access to resources and mentorship can be limited. The findings have implications for graduate education and research under resource constraints, suggesting that tabletop science can be a viable means of advancing scientific knowledge in LMICs.", "label": 0}
