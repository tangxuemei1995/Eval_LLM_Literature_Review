{"grounding": "Understanding inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid flows requires mathematical and computational tools that are tailored to such flows and distinct from methods used to understand the canonical problem of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. We review some recent developments in the theory of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, placing special emphasis on several kinds of quasi-linear approximations and their corresponding statistical formulations. Aspects of quasi-linear theory that have received insufficient attention in the literature are discussed, and open questions are framed.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in theoretical frameworks have significantly expanded our understanding of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, a complex phenomenon characterized by spatial and directional heterogeneity. Quasi-linear theories have been employed to investigate the statistical properties of these turbulent systems, revealing intricate relationships between velocity fluctuations and spatial gradients. These findings have important implications for our comprehension of turbulent flows in various natural and engineered systems, including atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, and fluid-structure interactions.", "label": 0}
