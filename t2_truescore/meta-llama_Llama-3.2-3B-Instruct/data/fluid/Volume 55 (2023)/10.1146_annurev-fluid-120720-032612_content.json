{"grounding": "A rotating detonation engine (RDE) is a realization of pressure-gain combustion, wherein a traveling detonation wave confined in a chamber provides shock-based compression along with chemical heat release. Due to the high wave speeds, such devices can process high mass flow rates in small volumes, leading to compact and unconventional designs. RDEs involve unsteady and multiscale physics, and their operational characteristics are determined by an equilibrium between large- and small-scale processes. While RDEs can provide a significant theoretical gain in efficiency, achieving this improvement requires an understanding of the multiscale coupling. Specifically, unavoidable nonidealities, such as unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and multiple competing waves associated with practical designs, need to be understood and managed. The secondary combustion processes arise from fuel/air injection and unsteady and incomplete mixing, and can create spurious losses. In addition, a combination of multiple detonation and secondary waves compete and define the dynamical behavior of mixing, heat release distribution, and the overall mode of operation of the device. This review discusses the current understanding of such nonidealities and describes the tools and techniques used to gain insight into the extreme unsteady environment in such combustors.", "generated_text": "Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to achieve high-pressure gain combustion and efficient energy conversion. However, the complex interplay of nonidealities in RDEs can lead to significant deflagration loss and reduced engine performance. This study investigates the effects of unsteady mixing and secondary combustion on the detonation wave dynamics in RDEs. A comprehensive numerical analysis is performed using a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, incorporating the effects of secondary waves and multiple competing detonation waves. The results show that the secondary combustion process can lead to a significant increase in deflagration loss, while the unsteady mixing process can result in a reduction in pressure gain combustion. The interaction between the primary and secondary waves is found to be a critical factor in determining the overall engine performance. The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering nonidealities in RDEs and provide valuable insights for the optimization of RDE design and operation. The results have significant implications for the development of more efficient and reliable RDEs for future aerospace applications.", "label": 1}
