{"grounding": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) are versatile and efficient computational techniques to solve flow problems in complex geometric configurations that retain the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian structured meshes. Although these methods became known in the 1970s and gained credibility only in the new millennium, they had already been conceived and implemented at the beginning of the 1960s, even if the early computers of those times did not allow researchers to exploit their potential. Nowadays IBMs are established numerical schemes employed for the solution of many complex problems in which fluid mechanics may account for only part of the multiphysics dynamics. Despite the indisputable advantages, these methods also have drawbacks, and each problem should be carefully analyzed before deciding which particular IBM implementation is most suitable and whether additional modeling is necessary. High\u2013Reynolds number flows constitute one of the main limitations of IBMs owing to the resolution of thin wall shear layers, which cannot benefit from anisotropic grid refinement at the boundaries. To alleviate this weakness, researchers have developed IBM-compliant wall models and local grid refinement strategies, although in these cases possible pitfalls must also be considered.", "generated_text": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems in various fields, including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and structural mechanics. This review provides a historical perspective on the development of IBMs, tracing their origins to the early 20th century and highlighting key milestones, such as the work of von Mises and von Karman. The review also discusses the evolution of IBMs over the years, with a focus on advances in numerical methods, wall models, and multiphysics formulations. IBMs have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including turbulent flows, boundary layers, and coupled thermal-fluid problems. The review highlights the strengths and limitations of IBMs, including their ability to capture complex flow phenomena and their potential for parallelization. Future outlooks for IBMs include the development of new numerical methods, such as machine learning-based approaches, and the integration of IBMs with other computational methods, such as meshfree methods. Overall, IBMs have established themselves as a valuable tool for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems, and their continued development is expected to drive advances in various fields of engineering and science.", "label": 1}
