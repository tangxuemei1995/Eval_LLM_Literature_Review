{"grounding": "Advances in measuring and understanding separated, nominally two-dimensional (2D) shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions (STBLI) have triggered recent campaigns focused on three-dimensional (3D) STBLI, which display far greater configuration diversity. Nonetheless, unifying properties emerge for semi-infinite interactions, taking the form of conical asymptotic behavior where shock-generator specifics become insignificant. The contrast between 2D and 3D separation is substantial; the skewed vortical structure of 3D STBLI reflects the essentially 2D influence of the boundary layer on the 3D character of the swept shock. As with 2D STBLI, conical interactions engender prominent spectral content below that of the turbulent boundary layer. However, the uniform separation length scale, which is crucial to normalizing the lowest-frequency dynamics in 2D STBLI, is absent. Comparatively, the spectra of 3D STBLI are more representative of the mid-frequency, convective, shear-layer dynamics in 2D, while phenomena associated with 2D separation-shock breathing are muted. Asymptotic behavior breaks down in many regions important to 3D-STBLI dynamics, occurring in a configuration-dependent manner. Aspects of inceptive regions near shock generators and symmetry planes are reviewed. Focused efforts toward 3D modal and nonmodalanalyses, moving-shock/boundary-layer interactions, fluid/structure interactions, and flow control are suggested as directions for future work.", "generated_text": "The interaction between three-dimensional shock waves and boundary layers is a complex phenomenon that can lead to significant changes in flow behavior, including turbulence, separation, and instability. This interaction can have far-reaching consequences for fluid/structure interactions, flow control, and overall aerodynamic performance. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of considering the three-dimensional nature of these interactions, which can lead to the formation of shear layers and altered stability characteristics. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions, with a focus on the underlying physical mechanisms and the impact on fluid/structure interactions. The review will cover the key aspects of shock wave generation, boundary layer development, and the resulting interactions, including the role of turbulence, separation, and shear layer stability. The discussion will also highlight the challenges and opportunities for flow control and the potential for advanced numerical and experimental techniques to improve our understanding of these complex interactions.", "label": 1}
