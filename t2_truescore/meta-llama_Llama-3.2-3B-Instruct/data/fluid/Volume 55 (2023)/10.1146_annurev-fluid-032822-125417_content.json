{"grounding": "Gas-liquid foams are important in applications ranging from oil recovery and mineral flotation to food science and microfluidics. Beyond their practical use, they represent an intriguing prototype of a soft material with a complex, viscoelastic rheological response. Crucially, foams allow detailed access to fluid-dynamical processes on the mesoscale of bubbles underlying the large-scale material behavior. This review emphasizes the importance of the geometry and interaction of mesoscale structural elements for the description of the dynamics of entire foams. Using examples including bulk flow of foam under steady shear, interfacial instabilities, and foam fracture through bubble rupture, this article highlights the wide variety of available theoretical descriptions, ranging from network modeling approaches coupling structural element equations of motion to full continuum models with elastoviscoplastic constitutive relations. Foams offer the opportunity to develop rigorous links between such disparate descriptions, providing a blueprint for physical modeling of dynamical multiscale systems with complex structure.", "generated_text": "Gas-liquid foams are complex systems exhibiting unique structural and dynamic properties, arising from the interplay between gas bubbles and liquid matrix. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the underlying mechanics governing foam behavior, from the structural elements of individual bubbles to continuum descriptions of foam-scale phenomena. Interfacial mechanics plays a crucial role in determining foam stability, rheology, and flow properties. Theoretical models, computational simulations, and experimental studies have been employed to elucidate the relationships between bubble size, shape, and distribution, as well as the effects of surfactants, temperature, and pressure on foam dynamics. The review highlights the importance of thin film dynamics in foam formation and stability, and discusses the implications of these findings for applications in various fields, including materials science, chemical engineering, and biomedicine. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding gas-liquid foam dynamics.", "label": 1}
