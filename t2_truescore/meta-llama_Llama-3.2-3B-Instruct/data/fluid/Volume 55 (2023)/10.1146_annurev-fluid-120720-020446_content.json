{"grounding": "Rotation with thermally induced buoyancy governs many astrophysical and geophysical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, sun, and Earth's liquid-metal outer core. Rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection (RRBC) is an experimental system that has features of rotation and buoyancy, where a container of height H and temperature difference \u0394 between its bottom and top is rotated about its vertical axis with angular velocity \u03a9. The strength of buoyancy is reflected in the Rayleigh number (\u223cH\n3\u0394) and that of the Coriolis force in the Ekman and Rossby numbers (\u223c\u03a9\u22121). Rotation suppresses the convective onset, introduces instabilities, changes the velocity boundary layers, modifies the shape of thermal structures from plumes to vortical columns, affects the large-scale circulation, and can decrease or enhance global heat transport depending on buoyant and Coriolis forcing. RRBC is an extremely rich system, with features directly comparable to geophysical and astrophysical phenomena. Here we review RRBC studies, suggest a unifying heat transport scaling approach for the transition between rotation-dominated and buoyancy-dominated regimes in RRBC, and discuss non-Oberbeck\u2013Boussinesq and centrifugal effects.", "generated_text": "Turbulent rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection is a complex phenomenon that involves the interplay between buoyancy-driven fluid motion, rotation, and turbulent heat transport. In this context, the interfacial layer between the rotating fluid and the surrounding environment plays a crucial role in modulating the flow and heat transfer characteristics. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been employed to investigate the effects of rotation on turbulent Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection, revealing a significant impact on the flow structure, turbulence statistics, and heat transport. The results indicate that rotation can lead to the formation of rotating vortices, which in turn modulate the turbulent flow and heat transfer. Furthermore, the DNS simulations demonstrate that the rotation-induced anisotropy in the turbulent flow can result in a non-uniform heat transport, with the heat flux being enhanced near the rotating fluid interface. The findings of this study provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of turbulent rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection and have important implications for the design of rotating systems in various engineering applications, including heat exchangers and fluid processors.", "label": 1}
