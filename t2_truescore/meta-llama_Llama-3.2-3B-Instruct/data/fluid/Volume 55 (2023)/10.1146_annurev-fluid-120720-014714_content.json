{"grounding": "A common feature of many free surface flows\u2014drop/bubble breakup or coalescence and film/sheet rupture\u2014is the occurrence of hydrodynamic singularities. Accurately computing such flows with continuum mechanical, multidimensional free surface flow algorithms is a challenging task given these problems\u2019 multiscale nature, which necessitates capturing dynamics occurring over disparate length scales across 5\u20136 orders of magnitude. In drop breakup, the thinning of fluid threads that form and eventually pinch-off must be simulated until the thread's radius is about 10 nm. When two drops approach one another, the thickness of the fluid film separating them must fall below 10 nm before coalescence is said to have occurred. If the initial drop radii are 1 mm, simulations must remain faithful to the physics as thread radius or film thickness falls from 10\u22123 m to below 10\u22128 m. Here we review significant findings in interfacial flows with hydrodynamic singularities spearheaded by sharp interface algorithms. These multidimensional algorithms can achieve resolution that to date has only been possible with the use of simple 1D evolution equations.", "generated_text": "This study presents a novel approach to simulating and analyzing free surface flows with singularities, focusing on the complex phenomena of breakup and coalescence in microfluidic systems. A sharp interface method is developed to capture the intricate dynamics of ink jet printing, sprays, and microfluidic devices, where singularities play a crucial role in the formation of droplets, jets, and filaments. The proposed method employs a finite element-based approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, incorporating a sharp interface capture technique to accurately represent the free surface and singularities. The results demonstrate the ability of the method to accurately predict the breakup and coalescence of droplets, jets, and filaments in various microfluidic configurations. The study provides a significant contribution to the understanding of free surface flows with singularities, with potential applications in ink jet printing, microfluidics, and other fields where complex fluid dynamics are involved.", "label": 0}
