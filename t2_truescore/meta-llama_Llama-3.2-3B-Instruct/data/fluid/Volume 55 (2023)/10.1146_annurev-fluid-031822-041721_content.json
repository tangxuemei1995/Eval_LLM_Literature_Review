{"grounding": "In the past few decades various particle image\u2013based volumetric flow measurement techniques have been developed that have demonstrated their potential in accessing unsteady flow properties quantitatively in various experimental applications in fluid mechanics. In this review, we focus on physical properties and circumstances of 3D particle\u2013based measurements and what knowledge can be used for advancing reconstruction accuracy and spatial and temporal resolution, as well as completeness. The natural candidate for our focus is 3D Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT), which allows for position, velocity, and acceleration to be determined alongside a large number of individual particle tracks in the investigated volume. The advent of the dense 3D LPT technique Shake-The-Box in the past decade has opened further possibilities for characterizing unsteady flows by delivering input data for powerful data assimilation techniques that use Navier\u2013Stokes constraints. As a result, high-resolution Lagrangian and Eulerian data can be obtained, including long particle trajectories embedded in time-resolved 3D velocity and pressure fields.", "generated_text": "Three-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking is a crucial technique in fluid mechanics for accurately measuring velocity fields and pressure distributions in complex flows. This method involves tracking the motion of particles in a fluid over time, allowing for the reconstruction of velocity gradients and pressure fields. In this study, we employ an iterative particle reconstruction approach, inspired by the Shake-The-Box method, to improve the accuracy of 3D particle tracking velocimetry. By combining one-point and multipoint statistics, we derive a velocity gradient tensor that provides a comprehensive description of the flow. The results are validated using data assimilation techniques, which enable the estimation of 3D pressure fields from sparse measurement data. The proposed method demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness in tracking complex flows, making it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers in the field of fluid mechanics.", "label": 1}
