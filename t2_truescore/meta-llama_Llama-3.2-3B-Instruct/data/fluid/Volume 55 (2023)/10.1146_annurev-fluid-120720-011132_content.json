{"grounding": "Density stratification due to temperature or salinity variations greatly influences the flow around and the sedimentation of objects such as particles, drops, bubbles, and small organisms in the atmosphere, oceans, and lakes. Density stratification hampers the vertical flow and substantially affects the sedimentation of an isolated object, the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of objects, and the collective behavior of suspensions in various ways, depending on the relative magnitude of stratification, inertia (advection), and viscous (diffusion) effects. This review discusses these effects and their hydrodynamic mechanisms in some commonly observed fluid\u2013particle transport phenomena in oceans and the atmosphere. Physical understanding of these mechanisms can help us better model these phenomena and, hence, predict their geophysical, engineering, ecological, and environmental implications.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of motion in stratified fluids, focusing on the interactions between particles, drops, and bubbles, as well as microorganisms, within a pycnocline. The pycnocline, a distinct layering of fluids with varying densities, is a critical feature of stratified flows. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and numerical simulations, we examine the effects of particle-laden flows on the motion of particles, drops, and bubbles within the pycnocline. Our analysis reveals the intricate relationships between particle size, density, and flow velocity, as well as the impact of microorganisms on the stratified flow dynamics. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of stratified fluid flows and their applications in various fields, including environmental science, engineering, and biology.", "label": 0}
