{"grounding": "Since the seminal studies by Osborne Reynolds in the nineteenth century, pipe flow has served as a primary prototype for investigating the transition to turbulence in wall-bounded flows. Despite the apparent simplicity of this flow, various facets of this problem have occupied researchers for more than a century. Here we review insights from three distinct perspectives: (a) stability and susceptibility of laminar flow, (b) phase transition and spatiotemporal dynamics, and (c) dynamical systems analysis of the Navier\u2014Stokes equations. We show how these perspectives have led to a profound understanding of the onset of turbulence in pipe flow. Outstanding open points, applications to flows of complex fluids, and similarities with other wall-bounded flows are discussed.", "generated_text": "The transition to turbulence in pipe flow is a complex phenomenon characterized by the emergence of chaotic and turbulent structures. This study investigates the role of transient growth and directed percolation in the onset of turbulence. By analyzing high-resolution simulations of pipe flow, we find that transient growth, which refers to the temporary increase in kinetic energy, plays a crucial role in the development of turbulent structures. Furthermore, we observe that directed percolation, a process where clusters of fluid particles are connected in a specific manner, contributes to the formation of turbulent puffs and slugs. Our results suggest that the interplay between transient growth and directed percolation is essential for the transition to turbulence in pipe flow, and that understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting and controlling turbulent flows in various engineering applications.", "label": 0}
