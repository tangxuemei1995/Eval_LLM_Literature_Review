{"grounding": "Particles floating at interfaces are commonly observed in nature, as well as in industrial processes. When the particles are non-Brownian particles, large deformations of the interface are created that induce long-ranged capillary interactions and lead to the formation of particle rafts with unique characteristics. In this review we discuss recent efforts in investigating particle raft formation and the role of the rafts\u2019 own weight during dynamic clustering. Under specific conditions, these rafts can ultimately collapse and sink. When subjected to external or internal forces, the raft undergoes large deformations that test the mechanical characteristics of this interfacial composite material. It can behave as a continuous elastic sheet under compression, although its discrete nature can also trigger its fragmentation via interparticle interactions. Finally, armored droplets, drops covered by a protective shell of particles, can lose their integrity when submitted to dynamic deformations, resulting in the ejection of particles or the fracturing of the armor. Open questions to understand the properties of this material are highlighted and future research to understand the fundamental physics of particle rafts, the customization of the cluster formation, or the disassembly of this collective material is suggested.", "generated_text": "Particle rafts and armored droplets are complex systems that exhibit unique properties at the interface between two immiscible liquids. These systems arise from the self-assembly of particles at the interface, which can lead to the formation of stable, buoyant structures that resist deformation and breakup. The interplay between particle-laden interfaces, capillarity, and interfacial rheology plays a crucial role in determining the morphology and stability of these systems. Recent studies have demonstrated that the addition of particles to an interface can significantly alter the surface tension and viscosity of the system, leading to the formation of particle rafts and armored droplets. These structures can exhibit enhanced elasticity and resistance to deformation, making them of interest for applications in fields such as microfluidics, biomedicine, and materials science. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of particle rafts and armored droplets, including their formation mechanisms, morphological characteristics, and potential applications. The interplay between particle-laden interfaces, buoyancy, and interfacial rheology is discussed in detail, highlighting the complex interactions that govern the behavior of these systems.", "label": 1}
