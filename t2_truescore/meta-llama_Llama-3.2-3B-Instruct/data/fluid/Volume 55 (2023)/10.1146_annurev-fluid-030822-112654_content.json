{"grounding": "Volumes of this journal typically include one or two historical articles, many of which celebrate the life and impact in fluid mechanics of a recently deceased contributor to the field. The Editorial Committee recently stepped beyond this model to examine whom might have been missed over the years. Naturally, even when a candidate is identified, the passing of time makes it hard to find authors with living memory of the subject. Fortunately, in the case of Professor Dr. Irmgard Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz there is a rare opportunity: An appropriate article appeared in the collection Women in Mathematics, coauthored by her first PhD student John Spreiter and her husband Wilhelm Fl\u00fcgge, both her colleagues at Stanford University. We republish this article to share her remarkable story and contributions in fluid mechanics, as she worked with Prandtl, led a research group at ONERA (Office national d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches a\u00e9rospatiales), and eventually became the first woman professor of engineering at Stanford.", "generated_text": "This biography of Irmgard Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz, a pioneering female researcher in fluid mechanics, highlights her groundbreaking contributions to the field of flow computation, particularly in the realm of compressible boundary layers. Born in 1903, Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz pursued her academic career at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where she was mentored by renowned aerodynamics expert Ludwig Prandtl. Her work on flow computation and aerodynamics control theory laid the foundation for modern computational fluid dynamics. Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz's research focused on the development of numerical methods for solving complex fluid flow problems, including compressible boundary layers. Her pioneering work paved the way for future generations of female researchers in fluid mechanics, challenging the male-dominated field and inspiring a new era of women in science. This biography provides an in-depth examination of Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz's life, work, and legacy, shedding light on her remarkable achievements and their lasting impact on the field of aerodynamics.", "label": 1}
