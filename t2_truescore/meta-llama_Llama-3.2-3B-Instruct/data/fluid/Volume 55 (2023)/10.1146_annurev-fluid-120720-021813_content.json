{"grounding": "Transitional\u2013turbulent spots bridge the deterministic laminar state with the stochastic turbulent state and affect the transition zone length in engineering flows. Turbulent spot research over the past four decades has expanded from incompressible flat-plate boundary layer and pipe flow to hypersonic boundary layer flow, turbomachinery flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, and a range of more complex flows. Progress has been made on the origination, composition, demarcation, growth, mutual interaction, reproduction, sustainability, and self-organization of turbulent spots. The hypothesis that transitional\u2013turbulent spots are a basic module of the fully turbulent boundary layer has been proven through the discovery of locally generated turbulent\u2013turbulent spots dominating the wall layer. Splitting of transitional\u2013turbulent spots in pipe flow has been linked to a life cycle localized in the spot frontal section. This review discusses these advances and outlines future research directions.", "generated_text": "Turbulent spots are localized regions within turbulent flows that exhibit distinct characteristics, such as enhanced mixing and shear rates, compared to the surrounding turbulent regions. Recent studies have shed new light on the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, with a focus on the role of turbulent spots in the development of turbulence. In pipe flow, channel flow, and plane Couette flow, turbulent spots have been observed to form at the onset of turbulence, and their presence is associated with increased mixing and reduced shear stress. Theoretical models, such as the Smagin model, have been developed to describe the formation and evolution of turbulent spots. Furthermore, experimental studies have investigated the role of turbulent spots in hypersonic flow and turbomachinery flow, highlighting their importance in these complex flow regimes. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of turbulent spots and their role in turbulent flows.", "label": 1}
