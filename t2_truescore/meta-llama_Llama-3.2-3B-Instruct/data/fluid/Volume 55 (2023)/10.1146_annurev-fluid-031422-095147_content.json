{"grounding": "Oceanic motions with spatial scales of 200 m\u201320 km, called submesoscales, are ubiquitous in the upper ocean and serve as a key intermediary between larger-scale balanced dynamics and unbalanced turbulence. Here, we introduce the fluid dynamics of submesoscales and contrast them with motions at larger and smaller scales. We summarize the various ways in which submesoscales develop due to instabilities that extract potential or kinetic energy from larger-scale balanced currents; some instabilities have counterparts at larger scales, while others are distinct to the submesoscale regime. Submesoscales modify the density stratification in the upper ocean and redistribute energy between scales. These energy transfers are complex, having both up-scale and down-scale components. Submesoscale eddies and fronts also contribute to a spatially heterogeneous distribution of shear and restratification that leave an imprint on upper ocean turbulence. The impact of submesoscales on the Earth's climate remains an exciting research frontier.", "generated_text": "Submesoscale dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the upper ocean's physical and biological processes, influencing climate patterns and marine ecosystems. This research focuses on the submesoscale dynamics of turbulence, eddies, and fronts in the upper ocean, exploring their interactions and impacts on ocean circulation and climate. Using a combination of numerical modeling and observational data, we investigate the formation and evolution of submesoscale features, including turbulence and eddies, and their role in modulating ocean fronts and mixed layer depth. Our results highlight the importance of submesoscale dynamics in regulating ocean heat transport and carbon sequestration, with implications for climate modeling and prediction. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between submesoscale dynamics, ocean circulation, and climate, and have significant implications for the development of more accurate climate models and oceanographic research.", "label": 0}
