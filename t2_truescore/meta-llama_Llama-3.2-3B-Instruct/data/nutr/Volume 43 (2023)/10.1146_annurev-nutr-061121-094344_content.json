{"grounding": "Amino acids derived from protein digestion are important nutrients for the growth and maintenance of organisms. Approximately half of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids can be synthesized by mammalian organisms, while the other half are essential and must be acquired from the nutrition. Absorption of amino acids is mediated by a set of amino acid transporters together with transport of di- and tripeptides. They provide amino acids for systemic needs and for enterocyte metabolism. Absorption is largely complete at the end of the small intestine. The large intestine mediates the uptake of amino acids derived from bacterial metabolism and endogenous sources. Lack of amino acid transporters and peptide transporter delays the absorption of amino acids and changes sensing and usage of amino acids by the intestine. This can affect metabolic health through amino acid restriction, sensing of amino acids, and production of antimicrobial peptides.", "generated_text": "Intestinal amino acid transport plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic health by regulating the absorption of essential amino acids from the diet. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of epithelial cell membrane transporters in modulating amino acid uptake and utilization. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of intestinal amino acid transport and its relationship to metabolic health. We discuss the key players involved in amino acid transport, including the SLC and SLC41 families of membrane transporters, and their role in regulating amino acid homeostasis. Protein restriction has been shown to alter intestinal amino acid transport, leading to changes in metabolic health outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying intestinal amino acid transport is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in this field, highlighting the potential for targeted interventions to improve metabolic health.", "label": 1}
