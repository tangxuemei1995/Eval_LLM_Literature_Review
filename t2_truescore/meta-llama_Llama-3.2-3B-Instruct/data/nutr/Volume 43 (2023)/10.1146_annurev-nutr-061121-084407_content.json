{"grounding": "Riboflavin, in its cofactor forms flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), plays fundamental roles in energy metabolism, cellular antioxidant potential, and metabolic interactions with other micronutrients, including iron, vitamin B6, and folate. Severe riboflavin deficiency, largely confined to low-income countries, clinically manifests as cheilosis, angular stomatitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and severe anemia with erythroid hypoplasia. Subclinical deficiency may be much more widespread, including in high-income countries, but typically goes undetected because riboflavin biomarkers are rarely measured in human studies. There are adverse health consequences of low and deficient riboflavin status throughout the life cycle, including anemia and hypertension, that could contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. This review considers the available evidence on causes, detection, and consequences of riboflavin deficiency, ranging from clinical deficiency signs to manifestations associated with less severe deficiency, and the related research, public health, and policy priorities.", "generated_text": "Riboflavin deficiency is a nutritional disorder that can lead to various clinical sequelae, including anemia and hypertension. The activation coefficient of erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGRac) is a sensitive indicator of riboflavin status, as it is essential for the enzyme's activity. Studies have shown that riboflavin deficiency can impair EGRac, leading to increased oxidative stress and cellular damage. Furthermore, riboflavin plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy erythrocytes, and deficiency can result in anemia characterized by reduced hemoglobin levels and increased red blood cell breakdown. Additionally, riboflavin has been linked to blood pressure regulation, and deficiency has been associated with hypertension. The dietary reference intakes for riboflavin are often not met, particularly in populations with limited access to nutrient-dense foods. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the causes and clinical sequelae of riboflavin deficiency, highlighting the importance of adequate riboflavin intake for maintaining optimal health.", "label": 1}
