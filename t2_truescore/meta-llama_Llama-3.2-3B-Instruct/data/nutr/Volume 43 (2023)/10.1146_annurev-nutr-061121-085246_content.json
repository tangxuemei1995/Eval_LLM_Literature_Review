{"grounding": "The placenta is the gatekeeper between the mother and the fetus. Over the first trimester of pregnancy, the fetus is nourished by uterine gland secretions in a process known as histiotrophic nutrition. During the second trimester of pregnancy, placentation has evolved to the point at which nutrients are delivered to the placenta via maternal blood (hemotrophic nutrition). Over gestation, the placenta must adapt to these variable nutrient supplies, to alterations in maternal physiology and blood flow, and to dynamic changes in fetal growth rates. Numerous questions remain about the mechanisms used to transport nutrients to the fetus and the maternal and fetal determinants of this process. Growing data highlight the ability of the placenta to regulate this process. As new technologies and omics approaches are utilized to study this maternofetal interface, greater insight into this unique organ and its impact on fetal development and long-term health has been obtained.", "generated_text": "The placenta is a complex, dynamic organ that serves as the primary interface between the maternal and fetal circulations, facilitating the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products. The syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated layer of trophoblast cells, plays a crucial role in histiotrophic nutrition, where it directly absorbs nutrients from the maternal bloodstream. In contrast, hemotrophic nutrition, mediated by the cytotrophoblast, involves the uptake of nutrients from the maternal blood through the formation of microvilli. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of placental mosaicism, where genetic variations within the placental tissue can impact fetal development and health. The expression of nutrient transporters, such as glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and folate receptor 1 (FR1), is essential for the efficient transfer of essential nutrients across the placental barrier. This review aims to provide an overview of the placenta's role in maternofetal nutrition, highlighting the complex interplay between histiotrophic and hemotrophic nutrition and the critical functions of nutrient transporters in maintaining fetal health.", "label": 1}
