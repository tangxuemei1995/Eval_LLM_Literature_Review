{"grounding": "Childhood undernutrition is a major global health burden that is only partially resolved by nutritional interventions. Both chronic and acute forms of child undernutrition are characterized by derangements in multiple biological systems including metabolism, immunity, and endocrine systems. A growing body of evidence supports a role of the gut microbiome in mediating these pathways influencing early life growth. Observational studies report alterations in the gut microbiome of undernourished children, while preclinical studies suggest that this can trigger intestinal enteropathy, alter host metabolism, and disrupt immune-mediated resistance against enteropathogens, each of which contribute to poor early life growth. Here, we compile evidence from preclinical and clinical studies and describe the emerging pathophysiological pathways by which the early life gut microbiome influences host metabolism, immunity, intestinal function, endocrine regulation, and other pathways contributing to child undernutrition. We discuss emerging microbiome-directed therapies and consider future research directions to identify and target microbiome-sensitive pathways in child undernutrition.", "generated_text": "Malnourished Microbes: Host\u2013Microbiome Interactions in Child UndernutritionChild undernutrition is a pervasive global health issue, characterized by stunting and wasting, resulting from inadequate nutrient intake and impaired host\u2013microbiome interactions. The human microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis, regulating nutrient absorption, and influencing metabolic pathways. In malnourished children, alterations in the microbiome composition and function have been observed, leading to impaired nutrient utilization and increased susceptibility to infections. This review synthesizes existing evidence on the host\u2013microbiome interactions in child undernutrition, highlighting the complex relationships between the microbiome, nutrient availability, and growth outcomes. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the malnourished microbiome, including changes in microbial diversity, gene expression, and metabolic activity. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing targeted interventions to prevent and treat child undernutrition, and to promote healthy growth and development in vulnerable populations.", "label": 1}
