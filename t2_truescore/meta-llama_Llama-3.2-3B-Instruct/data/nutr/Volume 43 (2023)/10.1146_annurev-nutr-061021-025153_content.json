{"grounding": "As dietary guidance for populations shifts from preventing deficiency disorders to chronic disease risk reduction, the biology supporting such guidance becomes more complex due to the multifactorial risk profile of disease and inherent population heterogeneity in the diet\u2013disease relationship. Diet is a primary driver of chronic disease risk, and population-based guidance should account for individual responses. Cascading effects on evidentiary standards for population-based guidance are not straightforward. Precision remains a consideration for dietary guidance to prevent deficiency through the identification of population subgroups with unique nutritional needs. Reducing chronic disease through diet requires greater precision in (a) establishing essential nutrient needs throughout the life cycle in both health and disease; (b) considering effects of nutrients and other food substances on metabolic, immunological, inflammatory, and other physiological responses supporting healthy aging; and (c) considering healthy eating behaviors. Herein we provide a template for guiding population-based eating recommendations for reducing chronic diseases in heterogenous populations.", "generated_text": "Precision nutrition, a concept emphasizing tailored dietary approaches based on individual genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, has gained significant attention in recent years. However, the scientific evidence supporting its application in public health recommendations for the prevention of chronic disease is limited and often exaggerated. A critical review of existing literature reveals that the complexity of human biology and the variability in nutrient requirements among individuals pose significant challenges to the development of personalized nutrition plans. Furthermore, the lack of standardization in genetic testing and the limited understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors hinder the translation of genetic data into actionable dietary recommendations. As a result, public health recommendations for the prevention of chronic disease should be grounded in evidence-based guidelines that prioritize a balanced and varied diet, rather than relying on unproven precision nutrition approaches.", "label": 0}
