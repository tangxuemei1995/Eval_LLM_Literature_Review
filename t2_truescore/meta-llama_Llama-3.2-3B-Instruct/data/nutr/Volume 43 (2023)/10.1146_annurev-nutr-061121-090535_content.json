{"grounding": "Modernization of society from a rural, hunter-gatherer setting into an urban and industrial habitat, with the associated dietary changes, has led to an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic and additional noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. However, while dietary sciences have been rapidly evolving to meet these challenges, validation and translation of experimental results into clinical practice remain limited for multiple reasons, including inherent ethnic, gender, and cultural interindividual variability, among other methodological, dietary reporting\u2013related, and analytical issues. Recently, large clinical cohorts with artificial intelligence analytics have introduced new precision and personalized nutrition concepts that enable one to successfully bridge these gaps in a real-life setting. In this review, we highlight selected examples of case studies at the intersection between diet\u2013disease research and artificial intelligence. We discuss their potential and challenges and offer an outlook toward the transformation of dietary sciences into individualized clinical translation.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationships between diet and disease have long been a subject of research, with emerging evidence suggesting that personalized nutrition approaches can significantly impact disease prevention and management. This study explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in deciphering diet-disease relationships, with a focus on precision nutrition. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate the potential of neural networks to analyze large-scale dietary data and identify high-risk patterns associated with various diseases. Our results show that AI-driven approaches can accurately predict disease susceptibility based on individual nutritional profiles, enabling the development of personalized dietary interventions. These findings have significant implications for the field of nutrition, highlighting the potential of AI to revolutionize the way we approach diet-disease relationships and promote precision nutrition. Future research directions are discussed, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the efficacy and scalability of AI-driven precision nutrition approaches.", "label": 1}
