{"grounding": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic fatty liver disease worldwide, particularly in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals. Currently, there are no therapies for NAFLD that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Herein, we examine the rationale for using \u03c93 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in NAFLD therapy. This focus is based on the finding that NAFLD severity is associated with a reduction of hepatic C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs. Because C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs are pleiotropic regulators of cell function, loss of C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs has the potential to significantly impact hepatic function. We describe NAFLD prevalence and pathophysiology as well as current NAFLD therapies. We also present evidence from clinical and preclinical studies that evaluated the capacity of C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs to treat NAFLD. Given the clinical and preclinical evidence, dietary C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFA supplementation has the potential to decrease human NAFLD severity by reducing hepatosteatosis and liver injury.", "generated_text": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health concern worldwide, characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver of individuals who consume minimal or no alcohol. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been identified as potential therapeutic agents in the management of NAFLD. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on NAFLD involve anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic pathways. DHA has been shown to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduce oxidative stress, and inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells, thereby mitigating liver inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical studies have demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can improve liver function, reduce liver enzymes, and slow disease progression in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and steatosis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of action and to establish the optimal dosage and duration of omega-3 fatty acid therapy for the treatment of NAFLD.", "label": 1}
