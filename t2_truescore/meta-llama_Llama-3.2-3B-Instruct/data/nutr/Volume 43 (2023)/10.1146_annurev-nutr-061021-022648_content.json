{"grounding": "Amino acid dysregulation has emerged as an important driver of disease progression in various contexts. l-Serine lies at a central node of metabolism, linking carbohydrate metabolism, transamination, glycine, and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism to protein synthesis and various downstream bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways. l-Serine is produced locally in the brain but is sourced predominantly from glycine and one-carbon metabolism in peripheral tissues via liver and kidney metabolism. Compromised regulation or activity of l-serine synthesis and disposal occurs in the context of genetic diseases as well as chronic disease states, leading to low circulating l-serine levels and pathogenesis in the nervous system, retina, heart, and aging muscle. Dietary interventions in preclinical models modulate sensory neuropathy, retinopathy, tumor growth, and muscle regeneration. A serine tolerance test may provide a quantitative readout of l-serine homeostasis that identifies patients who may be susceptible to neuropathy or responsive to therapy.", "generated_text": "Serine is a non-essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including nutrition, health, and disease. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of serine sources, sinks, and metabolic flux in the context of human health and disease. Serine is synthesized from glycine and pyruvate through the serine hydroxymethyltransferase reaction, and its metabolic pathways are tightly regulated by various enzymes and transcription factors. Abnormal serine metabolism has been implicated in the development of neuropathy and diabetes, highlighting the importance of serine in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recent advances in metabolomics have enabled the identification of serine-related biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new avenues for the prevention and treatment of serine-related disorders. This review will discuss the current state of knowledge on serine metabolism, its implications for human health, and potential therapeutic strategies for serine-related diseases.", "label": 1}
