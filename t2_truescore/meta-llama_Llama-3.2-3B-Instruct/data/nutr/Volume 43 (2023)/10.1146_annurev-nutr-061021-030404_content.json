{"grounding": "Pregnancy entails a large negative balance of iron, an essential micronutrient. During pregnancy, iron requirements increase substantially to support both maternal red blood cell expansion and the development of the placenta and fetus. As insufficient iron has long been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, universal iron supplementation is common practice before and during pregnancy. However, in high-resource countries with iron fortification of staple foods and increased red meat consumption, the effects of too much iron supplementation during pregnancy have become a concern because iron excess has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we address physiologic iron homeostasis of the mother, placenta, and fetus and discuss perturbations in iron homeostasis that result in pathological pregnancy. As many mechanistic regulatory systems have been deduced from animal models, we also discuss the principles learned from these models and how these may apply to human pregnancy.", "generated_text": "Iron homeostasis is a critical process during pregnancy, as maternal iron stores are depleted and the fetus requires increasing amounts of iron for growth and development. Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, is upregulated during pregnancy, leading to decreased iron absorption and increased iron sequestration in the placenta. The placenta plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis, producing hepcidin and regulating iron transfer to the fetus. Maternal inflammation, which is common during pregnancy, also affects iron homeostasis, exacerbating hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration. Fetal iron requirements are met through a complex interplay of placental and maternal mechanisms, including the transfer of iron from the mother to the fetus via the placenta. Dysregulation of iron homeostasis during pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency, which has significant consequences for maternal and fetal health. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of iron homeostasis during pregnancy is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent and treat iron deficiency in pregnant women.", "label": 1}
