{"grounding": "Fatty acid\u2013binding proteins (FABPs) are small lipid-binding proteins abundantly expressed in tissues that are highly active in fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Ten mammalian FABPs have been identified, with tissue-specific expression patterns and highly conserved tertiary structures. FABPs were initially studied as intracellular FA transport proteins. Further investigation has demonstrated their participation in lipid metabolism, both directly and via regulation of gene expression, and in signaling within their cells of expression. There is also evidence that they may be secreted and have functional impact via the circulation. It has also been shown that the FABP ligand binding repertoire extends beyond long-chain FAs and that their functional properties also involve participation in systemic metabolism. This article reviews the present understanding of FABP functions and their apparent roles in disease, particularly metabolic and inflammation-related disorders and cancers.", "generated_text": "The multifunctional family of mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and transport. These proteins, comprising 15 members, are involved in the binding, transport, and storage of fatty acids, as well as their regulation in various cellular processes. FABPs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Additionally, alterations in FABP expression have been linked to cancer development and progression. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of FABPs in lipid transport and metabolism, suggesting that they may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic disorders and cancer. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of FABPs, their functions, and their implications in human disease, highlighting the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying their role in lipid metabolism and disease.", "label": 0}
