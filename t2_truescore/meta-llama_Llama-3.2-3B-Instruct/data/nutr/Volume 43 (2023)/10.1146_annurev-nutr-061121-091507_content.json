{"grounding": "Gluconeogenesis is a critical biosynthetic process that helps maintain whole-body glucose homeostasis and becomes altered in certain medical diseases. We review gluconeogenic flux in various medical diseases, including common metabolic disorders, hormonal imbalances, specific inborn genetic errors, and cancer. We discuss how the altered gluconeogenic activity contributes to disease pathogenesis using data from experiments using isotopic tracer and spectroscopy methodologies. These in vitro, animal, and human studies provide insights into the changes in circulating levels of available gluconeogenesis substrates and the efficiency of converting those substrates to glucose by gluconeogenic organs. We highlight ongoing knowledge gaps, discuss emerging research areas, and suggest future investigations. A better understanding of altered gluconeogenesis flux may ultimately identify novel and targeted treatment strategies for such diseases.", "generated_text": "Gluconeogenesis is a vital metabolic pathway that generates glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, playing a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. However, dysregulation of gluconeogenesis has been implicated in various metabolic diseases, including insulin resistance and cancer. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of gluconeogenesis flux in metabolic disease, with a focus on the impact of insulin resistance, hormone dysregulation, and enzyme deficiency on gluconeogenic pathways. We also discuss the potential therapeutic strategies targeting gluconeogenesis in metabolic disorders, including the development of novel inhibitors and modulators of key enzymes involved in this pathway. Understanding the complex interplay between gluconeogenesis and metabolic disease is essential for the development of effective treatments and interventions.", "label": 1}
