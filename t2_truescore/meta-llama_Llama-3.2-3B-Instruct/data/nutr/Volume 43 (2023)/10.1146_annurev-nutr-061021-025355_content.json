{"grounding": "The prenatal and early postnatal periods are stages during which dynamic changes and the development of the brain and gut microbiota occur, and nutrition is one of the most important modifiable factors that influences this process. Given the bidirectional cross talk between the gut microbiota and the brain through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA), there is growing interest in evaluating the potential effects of nutritional interventions administered during these critical developmental windows on gut microbiota composition and function and their association with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We review recent preclinical and clinical evidence from animal studies and infant/child populations. Although further research is needed, growing evidence suggests that different functional nutrients affect the establishment and development of the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis and could have preventive and therapeutic use in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, more in-depth knowledge regarding the effect of nutrition on the MGBA during critical developmental windows may enable the prevention of later neurocognitive and behavioral disorders and allow the establishment of individualized nutrition-based programs that can be used from the prenatal to the early and middle stages of life.", "generated_text": "The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is a complex interplay between the gut microbiome, the gut epithelium, and the central nervous system, influencing various physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of maternal and infant nutrition in shaping the MGBA. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to impact the development of the infant's gut microbiota, with adequate intake of essential fatty acids, prebiotics, and probiotics promoting a healthy gut microbiome. The presence of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) components in breast milk also plays a crucial role in modulating the infant's gut microbiota. The incorporation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) into the infant's diet has been linked to improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Conversely, a diet high in processed foods and low in fiber and polyunsaturated fats may disrupt the MGBA, leading to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the impact of maternal and infant nutrition on the MGBA, highlighting the importance of evidence-based dietary recommendations for optimal infant development and long-term health outcomes.", "label": 1}
