{"grounding": "Together, loss- and gain-of-function experiments have identified the bone-derived secreted molecule osteocalcin as a hormone with a broad reach in rodents and primates. Following its binding to one of three receptors, osteocalcin exerts a profound influence on various aspects of energy metabolism as well as steroidogenesis, neurotransmitter biosynthesis and thereby male fertility, electrolyte homeostasis, cognition, the acute stress response, and exercise capacity. Although this review focuses mostly on the regulation of energy metabolism by osteocalcin, it also touches on its other functions. Lastly, it proposes what could be a common theme between the functions of osteocalcin and between these functions and the structural functions of bone.", "generated_text": "Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, has emerged as a multifaceted regulator of energy metabolism and bone homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted its role in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism, with implications for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Additionally, osteocalcin has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, making it a potential danger repellent against various diseases. The undercarboxylation of osteocalcin, a post-translational modification, has been implicated in its biological activity, suggesting a complex interplay between its structure and function. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying osteocalcin's multifaceted roles in human health and disease.", "label": 1}
