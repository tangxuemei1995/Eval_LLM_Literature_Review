{"grounding": "Myeloid cells represent a dominant cellular compartment of tumor lesions and play key roles in tumor inception, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), which include dendritic cells and macrophages, are unique among myeloid cells, as they not only shape both the broader composition and state of the tumor microenvironment but can also specifically instruct cancer-specific, T cell\u2013mediated tumor cell killing, making them especially attractive targets for cancer treatment. Although MNPs remain difficult to modulate therapeutically, our understanding of MNP biology in the antitumor immune response has expanded significantly, offering hope for new possibilities in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the recent advances in our study of the cellular identity, molecular diversity, and spatial organization of MNPs in tumors, and we discuss the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to incorporate these new insights into cancer treatment design.", "generated_text": "Macrophages and dendritic cells play pivotal roles in the tumor microenvironment, modulating immune responses and influencing cancer progression. These mononuclear phagocytes can either promote or suppress tumor growth, depending on their polarization state and the presence of specific signals. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting macrophages and dendritic cells as a therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. By modulating the function of these cells, therapies can enhance anti-tumor immune responses, inhibit tumor angiogenesis, and suppress metastasis. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the biology of macrophages and dendritic cells in cancer, and discuss the therapeutic modulation of these cells as a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. The potential applications and limitations of this approach are also discussed, highlighting the need for further research in this area.", "label": 1}
