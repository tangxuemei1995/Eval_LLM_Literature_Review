{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a new opportunity for cancer treatment; however, resistance can occur due to intrinsic (T cells), extrinsic (tumors), or acquired (tumors) factors. In many cases, the knowledge of these mechanisms comes from clinical observations of patients treated with CAR T cells. In addition, the structure of the CAR molecule and the manufacturing process can impact CAR T cell efficacy. Extrinsic factors such as the mutations in the tumor cell, or cells in the tumor microenvironment, can also play a role. Tumor cells may exhibit acquired antigen loss or heterogeneity that enables resistance to CAR T cell killing; additionally, myeloid cells, T regulatory cells, and fibroblasts can exert an immunosuppressive effect and abrogate CAR T cell antitumor efficacy. We will discuss these mechanisms of resistance and the novel approaches being used to overcome them to improve the widespread use of this promising cancer therapy.", "generated_text": "CAR T cell therapies have revolutionized the treatment of various hematological malignancies by harnessing the power of adoptive T cell immunotherapy. However, the emergence of resistance to CAR T cells poses a significant challenge to the long-term efficacy of these treatments. Intrinsic resistance mechanisms, such as genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations, can render CAR T cells ineffective against tumor cells. Extrinsic resistance mechanisms, including immune suppression and tumor microenvironment-mediated immune evasion, can also hinder the therapeutic effects of CAR T cells. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance to CAR T cell therapies, with a focus on intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms. By elucidating the complex interactions between CAR T cells and the tumor microenvironment, this review seeks to identify potential therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance and improve the clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapies.", "label": 1}
