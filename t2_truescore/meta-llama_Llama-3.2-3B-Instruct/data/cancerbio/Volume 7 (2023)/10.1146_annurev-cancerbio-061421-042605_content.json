{"grounding": "With the significant successes of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cellular therapy, immunotherapy has now become an established treatment option to effectively treat cancer. However, the full potential of this treatment modality has yet to be realized, as there are many additional mechanisms whereby tumors continue to evade immune destruction. To this end, metabolic reprogramming by cancer cells serves not only to promote their own growth but also to create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The tumor metabolic microenvironment not only inhibits antitumor effector function but also supports the differentiation and function of suppressive immune cells. In this review, we delineate the major metabolic programs of cancer cells and immune cells. Furthermore, we discuss the role of so-called metabolic checkpoints that promote immune evasion and tumor growth. Finally, we review current and potential future strategies to target metabolism in order to not simply inhibit tumor growth but also enhance antitumor immune responses. Such strategies have the great potential to enhance the breadth and depth of immunotherapy for cancer by targeting metabolic checkpoints.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between immune cell metabolism and the tumor microenvironment is a critical area of research in immuno-oncology. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of metabolic reprogramming in immune cells, enabling them to effectively target and eliminate cancerous cells. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of immune cell metabolism and its role in immuno-oncology. We discuss the key metabolic pathways involved in immune cell function, including glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and fatty acid metabolism. We also examine the impact of targeting metabolism on the tumor microenvironment, including the modulation of immune cell infiltration and the suppression of immunosuppressive pathways. Furthermore, we explore the therapeutic potential of metabolic targeting in cancer treatment, including the use of metabolic inhibitors and the development of immunotherapies that exploit metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the complex interactions between immune cell metabolism and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the promise of metabolic targeting in the development of novel immuno-oncological therapies.", "label": 0}
