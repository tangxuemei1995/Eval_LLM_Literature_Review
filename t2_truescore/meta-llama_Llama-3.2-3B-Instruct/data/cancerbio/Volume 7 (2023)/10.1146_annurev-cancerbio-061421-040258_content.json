{"grounding": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors induce significant and durable treatment responses in about 20% of all cancers, but many patients have natural resistance to current immunotherapies. The past decade of technological advances has resulted in large-scale profiling of many cancers and their tumor microenvironments, rapidly expanding our understanding of the mechanisms utilized by tumors to create immune-resistant microenvironments. In this review, we discuss key factors that create immune resistance and emerging concepts that are redefining how we view immune resistance, as well as highlight novel strategies that aim to convert immune-resistant into immune-sensitive tumors.", "generated_text": "This study investigates novel strategies for heating up cold tumors to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. By modulating the tumor microenvironment, these approaches aim to increase the expression of tumor antigens and activate immune cells. Preclinical models demonstrate improved therapeutic outcomes following the application of targeted heating techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation and photothermal therapy. These findings have significant implications for the clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting potential synergies between tumor heating and immunotherapy.", "label": 0}
