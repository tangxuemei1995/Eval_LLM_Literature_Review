{"grounding": "Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with tumor progression in several clinical and experimental settings and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Its relation to cancer immunosurveillance is complex. Clonally heterogeneous tumors are associated with decreased immunosurveillance and are less responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition, but the mechanistic basis underlying these observations remains unclear. One possibility is that tumors that are under active immunosurveillance are relatively homogeneous because immunosurveillance prevents the outgrowth of immunogenic subclones. Alternatively, high ITH might directly impair immunosurveillance due to lower dosages of subclonal antigens, competition between antigens and immunodominance, the induction of detrimental T cell differentiation programs, or negative feedback loops. Here we review the evidence for these scenarios and outline hypotheses that could underlie the negative association between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance.", "generated_text": "Clonal heterogeneity within a tumor refers to the coexistence of distinct subpopulations of cancer cells with varying genetic and epigenetic profiles. This phenomenon significantly impacts cancer immunosurveillance, the body's ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Research has shown that intratumor heterogeneity can lead to the development of immune-escape mechanisms, allowing cancer cells to evade immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies. This study investigates the relationship between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance, highlighting the importance of considering tumor heterogeneity in the design and implementation of immunotherapies. The findings suggest that targeting heterogeneity may be a crucial strategy for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer treatment.", "label": 0}
