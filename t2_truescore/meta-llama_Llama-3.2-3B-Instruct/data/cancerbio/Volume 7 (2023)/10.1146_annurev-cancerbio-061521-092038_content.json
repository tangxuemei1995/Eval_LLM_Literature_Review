{"grounding": "Histopathology plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and subtyping of solid tumors and has become a cornerstone of modern precision oncology. Histopathological evaluation is typically performed manually by expert pathologists due to the complexity of visual data. However, in the last ten years, new artificial intelligence (AI) methods have made it possible to train computers to perform visual tasks with high performance, reaching similar levels as experts in some applications. In cancer histopathology, these AI tools could help automate repetitive tasks, making more efficient use of pathologists\u2019 time. In research studies, AI methods have been shown to have an astounding ability to predict genetic alterations and identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers directly from routine tissue slides. Here, we give an overview of these recent applications of AI in computational pathology, focusing on new tools for cancer research that could be pivotal in identifying clinical biomarkers for better treatment decisions.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in computational pathology of cancer has the potential to revolutionize diagnostic workflows and improve clinical outcomes. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning have enabled the development of robust algorithms that can accurately analyze large volumes of histopathological images and identify biomarkers associated with cancer. These AI-powered tools can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis, particularly in cases where histopathological features are subtle or difficult to interpret. By automating the analysis of tumor morphology and biomarker expression, AI can also facilitate the development of personalized treatment strategies and improve patient stratification for clinical trials. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of AI in computational pathology of cancer, highlighting its potential applications, limitations, and future directions for research and clinical implementation.", "label": 1}
