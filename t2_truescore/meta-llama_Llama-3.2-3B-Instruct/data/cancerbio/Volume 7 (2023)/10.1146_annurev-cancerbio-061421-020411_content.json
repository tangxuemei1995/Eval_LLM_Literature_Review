{"grounding": "The principle of independent drug action proposes that responses to drug combinations result from responses to one or the other of two combining agents, but not both. Explorations of biological pathway interactions in signal transduction and immunobiology as synergy have not been connected to mathematical demonstrations of above\u2013independent action activity, which would define pharmacologic synergy. We review independent action as the explanation for cancer drug combinations and find no evidence for pharmacologic synergy. Rather, a measure of correlation of response (\u03c1) when positive can explain below\u2013independent action results, and negative correlation can explain above\u2013independent action results. Anticorrelated responses may be a mathematical demonstration of collateral sensitivity, which can achieve above\u2013independent action activity. Inappropriate use of biological concepts of synergy may be contributing to high failure rates for immuno-oncology clinical trials, indicating a need for more rigorous applications of independent action to the development of cancer drug combination therapy.", "generated_text": "The increasing complexity of cancer treatment necessitates the exploration of combination therapies to enhance efficacy and minimize toxicity. This review examines the rationales underlying the combination of therapies, including independent action, response correlation, and collateral sensitivity versus synergy. Specifically, we focus on the role of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in combination with other treatments. Our analysis reveals that combination therapies can exploit the independent actions of individual agents, while also leveraging response correlation and collateral sensitivity to enhance therapeutic outcomes. However, the potential for synergy must be carefully balanced against the risk of collateral sensitivity, which can lead to adverse effects. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of combination therapies, including the use of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in conjunction with other treatments. By understanding the underlying mechanisms and rationales, clinicians can optimize combination therapies to improve patient outcomes and reduce treatment-related toxicity.", "label": 1}
