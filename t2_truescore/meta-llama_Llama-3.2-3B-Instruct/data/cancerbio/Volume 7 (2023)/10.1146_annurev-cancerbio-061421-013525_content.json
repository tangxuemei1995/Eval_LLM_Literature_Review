{"grounding": "Estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 is expressed in the vast majority of breast cancers and is one of the most successfully prosecuted drug targets in oncology, with multiple classes of endocrine therapies approved for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer. These existing agents are highly active, both as single agents and as combination partners for other targeted therapies, and have significantly benefited patients. However, each of these standard-of-care (SOC) therapies has liabilities that allow for the reengagement of ER signaling as a mechanism of resistance. Data supporting the continued dependence of tumors on ER signaling following exposure to SOC agents have underpinned an extraordinary reenergizing of academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical groups pursuing next-generation ER-targeted therapies. The hypothesis that there remains an opportunity to bring further meaningful benefit to patients through fully optimized ER-targeted therapies is currently being investigated in the clinic.", "generated_text": "The estrogen receptor (ER) plays a crucial role in the development and progression of breast cancer, with approximately 70-80% of ER-positive cases exhibiting tumor growth in response to estrogen. To combat this, next-generation estrogen receptor-targeted therapeutics have emerged as a promising approach. Selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs) have shown significant potential in selectively inhibiting or degrading ER activity, thereby reducing tumor growth and promoting patient outcomes. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of ER-targeted therapeutics, highlighting the latest advances in SERM and SERD development, as well as their mechanisms of action, efficacy, and clinical implications. By exploring the latest research and clinical findings, this review seeks to inform the development of future ER-targeted therapies and ultimately improve treatment options for ER-positive breast cancer patients.", "label": 1}
