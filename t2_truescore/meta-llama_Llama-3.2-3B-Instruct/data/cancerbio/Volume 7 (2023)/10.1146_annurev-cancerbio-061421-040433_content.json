{"grounding": "The blood-brain barrier is critically important for the treatment of both primary and metastatic cancers of the central nervous system (CNS). Clinical outcomes for patients with primary CNS tumors are poor and have not significantly improved in decades. As treatments for patients with extracranial solid tumors improve, the incidence of CNS metastases is on the rise due to suboptimal CNS exposure of otherwise systemically active agents. Despite state-of-the art surgical care and increasingly precise radiation therapy, clinical progress is limited by the ability to deliver an effective dose of a therapeutic agent to all cancerous cells. Given the tremendous heterogeneity of CNS cancers, both across cancer subtypes andwithin a single tumor, and the range of diverse therapies under investigation, a nuanced examination of CNS drug exposure is needed. With a shared goal, common vocabulary, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the field is poised for renewed progress in the treatment of CNS cancers.", "generated_text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge for the development of effective cancer therapeutics targeting central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The BBB restricts the passage of therapeutic agents, leading to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of understanding BBB dynamics and its impact on drug delivery and pharmacokinetics. Experimental cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies, have shown limited success in crossing the BBB, resulting in poor treatment outcomes for CNS tumors. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the BBB and its implications for therapeutic development. We discuss the mechanisms underlying BBB function, the challenges associated with drug delivery, and the strategies being explored to overcome these limitations. By elucidating the complex interactions between the BBB and cancer therapeutics, this review seeks to inform the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for CNS tumors.", "label": 1}
