{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been a great success in CD19+ hematological diseases. Natural killer (NK) CAR cells offer an alternative to CAR T cells with an intrinsic potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. The choice of cell type and the choice of CAR are both relevant for the feasibility, effectivity, engraftment, persistence, side effects, and safety of the cell therapy. Until recently CAR NK cells have proven difficult to develop into therapeutic products. Here, we give an overview of the source of CAR NK cells, gene transfer methods, and the manufacture of CAR NK cells for clinical application. We discuss improvements, as well as future options and problems that need to be addressed.", "generated_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cells represent a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy, offering a potent and flexible tool for targeting and eliminating malignant cells. By integrating CAR technology with NK cells, researchers have created a novel class of cell therapies that can be manufactured in large quantities, making them ideal for off-the-shelf products. These CAR NK cells have demonstrated impressive antitumor efficacy in preclinical models, exhibiting enhanced killing capabilities against a range of cancer types. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the safety and efficacy of CAR NK cells in humans, with encouraging results. The future of cancer treatment may indeed be 'now', with CAR NK cells poised to revolutionize the field of immunotherapy.", "label": 0}
