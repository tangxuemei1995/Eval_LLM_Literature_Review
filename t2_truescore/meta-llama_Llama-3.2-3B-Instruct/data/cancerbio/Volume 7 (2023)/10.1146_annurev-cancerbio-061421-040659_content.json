{"grounding": "Organoid models have revolutionized cancer research through their ability to capture the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of a tumor in 3D culture. Patient-derived organoids can also mirror responses to therapy in vitro, opening the doors to personalized medicine that can direct clinical decision-making. As cancer immunotherapy has flourished and efforts to develop novel immunotherapies have increased, models that incorporate immune cells into organoid coculture to recapitulate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment faithfully are in high demand. To this end, a wide variety of organoid immune coculture methods have been developed, each differing in the source of immune cells used, types of immune cells maintained in culture, and their specific utility. This review aims to organize these methods into a framework that will aid researchers in choosing the appropriate system for their experimental needs. We also highlight several nonimmune cell types that have been successfully incorporated into organoid culture and the biology these coculture models are poised to interrogate.", "generated_text": "The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in shaping the immune response and disease progression in cancer. To better understand the complex interactions between tumor cells and immune cells, researchers have developed organoid models that mimic the in vivo tumor environment. This study employs a novel coculture system to engineer patient-derived tumor organoids with functional immune cells, thereby recapitulating the tumor immune microenvironment. By coculturing tumor organoids with immune cells, such as T cells and dendritic cells, we observed a dynamic interplay between these cell types that influenced tumor growth, immune cell activation, and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. These findings have significant implications for the development of immunotherapies and cancer vaccines, and provide a valuable tool for studying the tumor immune microenvironment in a highly controlled and relevant system. The use of coculture organoids offers a promising approach for personalized cancer research and therapy.", "label": 1}
