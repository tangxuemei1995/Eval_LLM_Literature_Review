{"grounding": "Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that promotes tissue homeostasis by identifying damaged cells for immune-mediated clearance. Thus, the ability to evade senescence and the ensuing immune surveillance is a hallmark of cancer. Reactivation of senescence programs can result in profound immune-mediated tumor regressions or sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, although the aberrant persistence of senescent cells can promote tissue decline and contribute to the side effects of some cancer therapies. In this review, we first briefly describe the discovery of senescence as a tumor-suppressive program. Next, we highlight the dueling good and bad effects of the senescence-associated secretory program (SASP) in cancer, including SASP-dependent immune effects. We then summarize the beneficial and deleterious effects of senescence induction by cancer therapies and strategies in development to leverage senescence therapeutically. Finally, we highlight challenges and unmet needs in understanding senescence in cancer and developing senescence-modulating therapies.", "generated_text": "Cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, has emerged as a critical regulator of cancer development and progression. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) enables senescent cells to modulate their microenvironment, influencing tumor growth, immune surveillance, and therapy response. Recent studies have highlighted the paradoxical role of senescence in cancer, where it can both suppress and promote tumor progression. The 'one-two punch' therapy, combining senolytic and immunotherapeutic approaches, has shown promise in targeting senescent cells and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of cellular senescence in cancer, focusing on the complex interplay between SASP, immune surveillance, and therapy-induced senescence. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying senescence in cancer, this review seeks to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies that harness the dual benefits of senolytic and immunotherapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
