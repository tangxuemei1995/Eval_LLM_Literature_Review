{"grounding": "Normal tissues progressively acquire mutations. Some mutations are positively selected, driving clonal expansions that may colonize the majority of a tissue by old age. In several cases mutant clonal expansion is due to biasing stem cell fate toward proliferation. However, the expansionary phase is transient and is followed by reversion toward wild-type behavior so that normal tissue integrity is retained. Here we consider the implications of these findings for carcinogenesis. We propose that to be considered a cancer driver, a mutant gene should be more prevalent in tumors than the normal lineage from which it emerged. Cancer risk is not dependent on mutational burden, but rather may reflect the relative frequency of pro- and anti-oncogenic mutants within a tissue. Understanding the basis of mutant clonal advantage over wild-type cells allows interventions to halt the expansion or even deplete oncogenic mutants from normal tissue, potentially lowering cancer risk.", "generated_text": "Somatic mutations in normal tissues have long been recognized as a critical step in the development of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying early carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. Recent studies have highlighted the role of stem cells in maintaining tissue homeostasis and their susceptibility to mutagenic stress. As cells age, the accumulation of mutations in stem cells can lead to the acquisition of oncogenic properties. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of somatic mutations in normal tissues, with a focus on the interplay between aging, stem cells, and carcinogenesis. We discuss the impact of carcinogens on stem cells and the potential for cancer prevention strategies targeting these cells. By integrating insights from stem cell biology, aging, and cancer genetics, this review seeks to shed new light on the early stages of carcinogenesis and identify promising avenues for cancer prevention and intervention.", "label": 1}
