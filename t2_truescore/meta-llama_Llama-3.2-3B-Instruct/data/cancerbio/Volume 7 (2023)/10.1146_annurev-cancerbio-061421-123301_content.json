{"grounding": "During tumor evolution, cancer cells can acquire the ability to proliferate, invade neighboring tissues, evade the immune system, and spread systemically. Tracking this process remains challenging, as many key events occur stochastically and over long times, which could be addressed by studying the phylogenetic relationships among cancer cells. Several lineage tracing approaches have been developed and employed in many tumor models and contexts, providing critical insights into tumor evolution. Recent advances in single-cell lineage tracing have greatly expanded the resolution, scale, and readout of lineage tracing toolkits. In this review, we provide an overview of static lineage tracing methods, and then focus on evolving lineage tracing technologies that enable reconstruction of tumor phylogenies at unprecedented resolution. We also discuss in vivo applications of these technologies to profile subclonal dynamics, quantify tumor plasticity, and track metastasis. Finally, we highlight outstanding questions and emerging technologies for building comprehensive cancer evolution roadmaps.", "generated_text": "The dynamic nature of cancer progression necessitates the development of innovative tools for lineage tracing in vivo. Recent advances in single-cell analysis and cell barcoding have enabled researchers to dissect the complex heterogeneity of tumors, elucidating the intricate relationships between cancer cells and their microenvironment. This study leverages these cutting-edge technologies to investigate the evolution of cancer lineages in vivo, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity and metastasis. By employing a novel, high-throughput cell barcoding strategy, we have successfully tracked the clonal expansion and dissemination of cancer cells in a mouse model of breast cancer. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of tumor evolution and have significant implications for the development of targeted therapies and personalized cancer treatment strategies.", "label": 0}
