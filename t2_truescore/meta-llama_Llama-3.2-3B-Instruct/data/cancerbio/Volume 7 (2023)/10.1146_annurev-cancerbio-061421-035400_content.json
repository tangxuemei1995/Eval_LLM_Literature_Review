{"grounding": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are present in all malignancies. Arguably, in none are they as prevalent as they are in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where they often outnumber cancer cells. The origin and function of CAFs are still not completely understood, and attempts to target this cell population as a component of combination therapy have so far not succeeded. Our understanding of pancreatic CAFs is in rapid evolution. Heterogeneity of CAFs is the key concept to understand this cell population. We discuss heterogeneity of origin, with recent findings challenging the notion that CAFs uniformly derive from pancreatic stellate cells, and instead suggesting that multiple types of resident fibroblasts contribute to CAF expansion. Heterogeneity in gene expression divides CAFs in different subpopulations. Most importantly, heterogeneity in function underlies the complexity of CAFs. CAFs deposit components of the extracellular matrix, contributing to the high interstitial pressure in pancreatic cancer. CAFs serve as \u201cfeeder\u201d cells for cancer cells by providing metabolites, thus mitigating the effect of the low-nutrient environment of PDAC. At the same time, CAFs regulate the function of the immune system, inhibiting antitumor immune responses. Understanding the functional role of different CAF populations and the drivers of each of their functional roles is key to devising new ways to target this cell population in PDAC.", "generated_text": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer, contributing to the development and progression of the disease. Desmoplasia, a characteristic feature of pancreatic tumors, is largely composed of CAFs that secrete various growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins, creating a hostile environment for anti-tumor immune responses. The heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer is further exacerbated by the diverse population of CAFs, which can be classified into distinct subtypes based on their gene expression profiles and functional characteristics. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of CAFs in modulating tumor heterogeneity, promoting resistance to chemotherapy, and facilitating metastasis. Understanding the complex interactions between CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on CAFs in pancreatic cancer, with a focus on their role in tumor microenvironment, desmoplasia, and tumor heterogeneity, and to discuss the potential implications for cancer therapy. By elucidating the mechanisms by which CAFs contribute to pancreatic cancer progression, this review seeks to provide insights into the development of innovative therapeutic approaches targeting CAFs in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.", "label": 1}
