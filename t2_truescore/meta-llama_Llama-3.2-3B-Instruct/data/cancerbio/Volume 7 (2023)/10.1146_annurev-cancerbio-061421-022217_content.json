{"grounding": "Ultrahigh\u2013dose rate FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a potentially paradigm-shifting treatment modality that holds the promise of expanding the therapeutic index for nearly any cancer. At the heart of this exciting technology comes the capability to ameliorate major normal tissue complications without compromising the efficacy of tumor killing. This combination of benefits has now been termed the FLASH effect and relies on an in vivo validation to rigorously demonstrate the absence of normal tissue toxicity. The FLASH effect occurs when the overall irradiation time is extremely short (<500 ms), and in this review we attempt to understand how FLASH-RT can kill tumors but spare normal tissues\u2014likely the single most pressing question confronting the field today.", "generated_text": "The advent of FLASH radiotherapy, characterized by ultrahigh dose rates, has revolutionized the field of radiobiology. By exploiting the transient enhancement of relative biological effectiveness, FLASH radiotherapy offers enhanced tumor killing capabilities while minimizing damage to normal tissues. This paradigm shift has significant implications for conventional radiotherapy, where normal tissue sparing remains a major challenge. Recent studies have demonstrated that FLASH radiotherapy can achieve isoefficient tumor killing, where the dose required to achieve a certain level of tumor control is comparable to that of conventional radiotherapy. This abstract reviews the current state of FLASH radiotherapy, its underlying mechanisms, and its potential to reinvent radiobiology and improve cancer treatment outcomes.", "label": 1}
