{"grounding": "T cell reactivity to tumor-specific neoantigens can drive endogenous and therapeutically induced antitumor immunity. However, most tumor-specific neoantigens are unique to each patient (private) and targeting them requires personalized therapy. A smaller subset of neoantigens includes epitopes that span recurrent mutation hotspots, translocations, or gene fusions in oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors, as well as epitopes that arise from viral oncogenic proteins. Such antigens are likely to be shared across patients (public), uniformly expressed within a tumor, and required for cancer cell survival and fitness. Although a limited number of these public neoantigens are naturally immunogenic, recent studies affirm their clinical utility. In this review, we highlight efforts to target mutant KRAS, mutant p53, and epitopes derived from oncogenic viruses using T cells engineered with off-the-shelf T cell receptors. We also discuss the challenges and strategies to achieving more effective T cell therapies, particularly in the context of solid tumors.", "generated_text": "The development of targeted immunotherapies has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment, focusing on the elimination of driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens. Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) utilizing T cell receptors (TCRs) has shown significant potential in recognizing and targeting tumor-specific antigens. By leveraging the specificity and affinity of TCRs, ACT can selectively engage and eliminate cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of TCR-based ACT in various cancer types, including melanoma, lung cancer, and leukemia. The use of TCRs has also been shown to enhance the recognition of public neoantigens, which are shared among multiple cancer patients, thereby facilitating the development of universal immunotherapies. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of TCR-based ACT for targeting driver oncogenes and public neoantigens, highlighting its clinical potential and future directions for optimization and expansion.", "label": 1}
