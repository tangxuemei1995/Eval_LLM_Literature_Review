{"grounding": "Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis across many individuals at single-cell resolution. Compared with bulk RNA sequencing, which averages gene expression across cell types and cell states, single-cell assays capture the transcriptional states of individual cells, including fine-grained, transient, and difficult-to-isolate populations at unprecedented scale and resolution. Single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) mapping can identify context-dependent eQTLs that vary with cell states, including some that colocalize with disease variants identified in genome-wide association studies. By uncovering the precise contexts in which these eQTLs act, single-cell approaches can unveil previously hidden regulatory effects and pinpoint important cell states underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. Here, we present an overview of recently deployed experimental designs in sc-eQTL studies. In the process, we consider the influence of study design choices such as cohort, cell states, and ex vivo perturbations. We then discuss current methodologies, modeling approaches, and technical challenges as well as future opportunities and applications.", "generated_text": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for elucidating the complex relationships between gene regulation and cellular state. By leveraging single-cell sequencing technologies, researchers can now investigate the dynamic interactions between noncoding variants, gene expression, and cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the methods and insights gained from sc-eQTL analysis, highlighting the potential of this approach to uncover novel regulatory variants and their functional consequences. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for cell state-specific gene regulation and noncoding variant effects in eQTL analyses, and provide a framework for integrating sc-eQTL data with other omics datasets to gain a deeper understanding of gene regulation and cellular heterogeneity. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of gene regulation and cellular state, and highlight the potential of sc-eQTL analysis as a powerful tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.", "label": 1}
