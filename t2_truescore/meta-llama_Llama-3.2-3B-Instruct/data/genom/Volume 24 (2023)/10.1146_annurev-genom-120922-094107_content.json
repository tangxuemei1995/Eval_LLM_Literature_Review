{"grounding": "The transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play a pivotal role in bone development and skeletal health. More than 30 different types of skeletal dysplasia are now known to be caused by pathogenic variants in genes that belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and/or regulate TGF-\u03b2/BMP bioavailability. This review describes the latest advances in skeletal dysplasia that is due to impaired TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling and results in short stature (acromelic dysplasia and cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome) or tall stature (Marfan syndrome). We thoroughly describe the clinical features of the patients, the underlying genetic findings, and the pathomolecular mechanisms leading to disease, which have been investigated mainly using patient-derived skin fibroblasts and mouse models. Although no pharmacological treatment is yet available for skeletal dysplasia due to impaired TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling, in recent years advances in the use of drugs targeting TGF-\u03b2 have been made, and we also discuss these advances.", "generated_text": "Skeletal dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormal bone development, leading to variations in stature. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play crucial roles in regulating bone growth and development. Recent studies have implicated dysregulation of these pathways in skeletal dysplasias, resulting in short and tall stature phenotypes. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling pathways in skeletal dysplasia, with a focus on their role in regulating bone growth and development. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of these pathways in skeletal dysplasias, and explore the implications for our understanding of the underlying biology of these disorders. The review also highlights the potential therapeutic strategies for targeting these pathways in the treatment of skeletal dysplasias, with a focus on improving outcomes for individuals with short and tall stature phenotypes.", "label": 1}
