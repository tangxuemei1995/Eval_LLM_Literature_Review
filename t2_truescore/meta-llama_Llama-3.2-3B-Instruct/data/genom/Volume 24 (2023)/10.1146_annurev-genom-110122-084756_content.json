{"grounding": "Continued advances in precision medicine rely on the widespread sharing of data that relate human genetic variation to disease. However, data sharing is severely limited by legal, regulatory, and ethical restrictions that safeguard patient privacy. Federated analysis addresses this problem by transferring the code to the data\u2014providing the technical and legal capability to analyze the data within their secure home environment rather than transferring the data to another institution for analysis. This allows researchers to gain new insights from data that cannot be moved, while respecting patient privacy and the data stewards\u2019 legal obligations. Because federated analysis is a technical solution to the legal challenges inherent in data sharing, the technology and policy implications must be evaluated together. Here, we summarize the technical approaches to federated analysis and provide a legal analysis of their policy implications.", "generated_text": "This primer provides a comprehensive overview of federated analysis for privacy-preserving data sharing, a crucial approach in the era of big data and genomics. By leveraging decentralized architectures and advanced cryptographic techniques, federated analysis enables the collaborative analysis of private data without compromising individual privacy. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection frameworks emphasize the need for robust privacy measures, making federated analysis an attractive solution. This primer delves into the technical and legal aspects of federated analysis, exploring its applications in genomics and other domains. It discusses the key challenges, benefits, and limitations of federated analysis, as well as its potential to facilitate data sharing while maintaining user privacy. By providing a thorough understanding of federated analysis, this primer aims to inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the development of privacy-preserving data sharing solutions.", "label": 1}
