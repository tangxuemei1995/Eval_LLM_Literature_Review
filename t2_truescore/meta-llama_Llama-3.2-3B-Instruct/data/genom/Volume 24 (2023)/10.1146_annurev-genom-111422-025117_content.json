{"grounding": "Genetic data contain a record of our evolutionary history. The availability of large-scale datasets of human populations from various geographic areas and timescales, coupled with advances in the computational methods to analyze these data, has transformed our ability to use genetic data to learn about our evolutionary past. Here, we review some of the widely used statistical methods to explore and characterize population relationships and history using genomic data. We describe the intuition behind commonly used approaches, their interpretation, and important limitations. For illustration, we apply some of these techniques to genome-wide autosomal data from 929 individuals representing 53 worldwide populations that are part of the Human Genome Diversity Project. Finally, we discuss the new frontiers in genomic methods to learn about population history. In sum, this review highlights the power (and limitations) of DNA to infer features of human evolutionary history, complementing the knowledge gleaned from other disciplines, such as archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics.", "generated_text": "The integration of genomic data has revolutionized the field of population genetics, enabling researchers to reconstruct complex demographic histories and infer ancestral relationships with unprecedented accuracy. This review synthesizes recent advances in methods for assessing population relationships and history using genomic data, with a focus on demographic inference, admixture, ancestry, effective population size, and molecular clocks. We discuss the theoretical foundations and empirical applications of these methods, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The use of genomic data to infer population size, migration patterns, and genetic drift is examined, as well as the application of molecular clocks to estimate divergence times. The review also highlights the importance of considering multiple lines of evidence and the need for rigorous validation of methodological approaches. By integrating insights from population genetics, phylogenetics, and computational methods, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics shaping human and non-human populations.", "label": 1}
