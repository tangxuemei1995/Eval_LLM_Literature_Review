{"grounding": "The axial length of the eye is critical for normal visual function by enabling light to precisely focus on the retina. The mean axial length of the adult human eye is 23.5 mm, but the molecular mechanisms regulating ocular axial length remain poorly understood. Underdevelopment can lead to microphthalmia (defined as a small eye with an axial length of less than 19 mm at 1 year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood) within the first trimester of pregnancy. However, continued overgrowth can lead to axial high myopia (an enlarged eye with an axial length of 26.5 mm or more) at any age. Both conditions show high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity associated with significant visual morbidity worldwide. More than 90 genes can contribute to microphthalmia, and several hundred genes are associated with myopia, yet diagnostic yields are low. Crucially, the genetic pathways underpinning the specification of eye size are only now being discovered, with evidence suggesting that shared molecular pathways regulate under- or overgrowth of the eye. Improving our mechanistic understanding of axial length determination will help better inform us of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations in both microphthalmia and myopia, dissect gene\u2013environment interactions in myopia, and develop postnatal therapies that may influence overall eye growth.", "generated_text": "The genetic determinants of axial length play a crucial role in the development of refractive errors, including microphthalmia and high myopia, in childhood. Axial length, a key parameter in determining refractive power, is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Research has identified several genetic variants associated with altered axial length, including those involved in the regulation of growth and development. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway have been implicated in the regulation of axial length, with mutations in these pathways leading to microphthalmia and high myopia, respectively. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies have identified novel genetic variants associated with axial length, highlighting the importance of genetic predisposition in the development of refractive errors. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the genetic determinants of axial length, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying microphthalmia and high myopia in childhood. The implications of this research for the prevention and treatment of refractive errors are discussed, highlighting the need for further investigation into the genetic and environmental factors influencing axial length development.", "label": 1}
