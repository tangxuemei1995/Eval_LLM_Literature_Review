{"grounding": "Elucidating spatiotemporal changes in gene expression has been an essential goal in studies of health, development, and disease. In the emerging field of spatially resolved transcriptomics, gene expression profiles are acquired with the tissue architecture maintained, sometimes at cellular resolution. This has allowed for the development of spatial cell atlases, studies of cell\u2013cell interactions, and in situ cell typing. In this review, we focus on padlock probe\u2013based in situ sequencing, which is a targeted spatially resolved transcriptomic method. We summarize recent methodological and computational tool developments and discuss key applications. We also discuss compatibility with other methods and integration with multiomic platforms for future applications.", "generated_text": "Padlock probe-based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) is a powerful tool for spatially resolved transcriptomics, enabling the creation of high-resolution spatial cell atlases and in situ cell typing. This method utilizes padlock probes to capture and amplify specific transcripts in situ, allowing for the detailed analysis of gene expression patterns across different cell types and tissues. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) and subsequent sequencing of the amplified fragments provide comprehensive transcriptomic information. Spatially resolved ISS has numerous applications in various fields, including cancer research, developmental biology, and neurology, facilitating the identification of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.", "label": 1}
