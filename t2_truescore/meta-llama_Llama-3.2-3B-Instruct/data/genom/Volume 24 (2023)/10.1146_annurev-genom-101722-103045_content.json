{"grounding": "DNA sequencing has revolutionized medicine over recent decades. However, analysis of large structural variation and repetitive DNA, a hallmark of human genomes, has been limited by short-read technology, with read lengths of 100\u2013300 bp. Long-read sequencing (LRS) permits routine sequencing of human DNA fragments tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in size, using both real-time sequencing by synthesis and nanopore-based direct electronic sequencing. LRS permits analysis of large structural variation and haplotypic phasing in human genomes and has enabled the discovery and characterization of rare pathogenic structural variants and repeat expansions. It has also recently enabled the assembly of a complete, gapless human genome that includes previously intractable regions, such as highly repetitive centromeres and homologous acrocentric short arms. With the addition of protocols for targeted enrichment, direct epigenetic DNA modification detection, and long-range chromatin profiling, LRS promises to launch a new era of understanding of genetic diversity and pathogenic mutations in human populations.", "generated_text": "Long-read DNA sequencing has revolutionized the field of genomics by enabling the detection of structural variants, repetitive DNA, and pathogenic mutations with unprecedented accuracy. Recent advances in sequencing technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, have pushed the boundaries of long-read sequencing, allowing for the characterization of complex genomic structures and the resolution of repetitive regions. However, despite these advances, long-read sequencing still faces significant challenges, including the interpretation of structural variants, the detection of epigenetic modifications, and the integration of long-read data with short-read data. Furthermore, the high cost and limited availability of long-read sequencing technologies hinder their widespread adoption. This review aims to provide an overview of the recent advances in long-read DNA sequencing, discuss the remaining challenges, and highlight the potential applications of this technology in the field of genomics and beyond.", "label": 1}
