{"grounding": "The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is striving to build an open community that is inclusive of all researchers adhering to its principles and as open as possible with respect to data access and use. However, open data sharing can pose certain challenges. For instance, being a global initiative, the HCA must contend with a patchwork of local and regional privacy rules. A notable example is the implementation of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which caused some concern in the biomedical and genomic data-sharing community. We examine how the HCA's large, international group of researchers is investing tremendous efforts into ensuring appropriate sharing of data. We describe the HCA's objectives and governance, how it defines open data sharing, and ethico-legal challenges encountered early in its development; in particular, we describe the challenges prompted by the GDPR. Finally, we broaden the discussion to address tools and strategies that can be used to address ethical data governance.", "generated_text": "The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has significantly impacted the field of open science, particularly in the context of large-scale biomedical datasets such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA). This study examines the challenges and opportunities arising from the application of GDPR to open data in genomics. We analyze the HCA's data sharing policies and practices, highlighting the tensions between the need for open access to genomic data and the need to protect individual privacy. Our analysis reveals that the HCA has successfully implemented measures to ensure data protection while promoting open science. We discuss the lessons learned from the HCA's experience and provide recommendations for other biomedical research initiatives seeking to balance data sharing and data protection in the GDPR era. Our findings have implications for the development of effective data governance frameworks in open science.", "label": 1}
