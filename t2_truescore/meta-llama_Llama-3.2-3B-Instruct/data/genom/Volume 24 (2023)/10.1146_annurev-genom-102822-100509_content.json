{"grounding": "DECIPHER (Database of Genomic Variation and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources) shares candidate diagnostic variants and phenotypic data from patients with genetic disorders to facilitate research and improve the diagnosis, management, and therapy of rare diseases. The platform sits at the boundary between genomic research and the clinical community. DECIPHER aims to ensure that the most up-to-date data are made rapidly available within its interpretation interfaces to improve clinical care. Newly integrated cardiac case\u2013control data that provide evidence of gene\u2013disease associations and inform variant interpretation exemplify this mission. New research resources are presented in a format optimized for use by a broad range of professionals supporting the delivery of genomic medicine. The interfaces within DECIPHER integrate and contextualize variant and phenotypic data, helping to determine a robust clinico-molecular diagnosis for rare-disease patients, which combines both variant classification and clinical fit. DECIPHER supports discovery research, connecting individuals within the rare-disease community to pursue hypothesis-driven research.", "generated_text": "DECIPHER is a novel approach to improving genetic diagnosis by dynamically integrating genomic and clinical data. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and a comprehensive knowledge base, DECIPHER enables the accurate interpretation of rare genetic variants and their correlation with clinical phenotypes. This integration of genotype-phenotype correlation facilitates the identification of novel disease-causing mutations and enhances the precision of genetic diagnosis. DECIPHER's dynamic framework allows for the incorporation of diverse data types, including genomic sequencing data, clinical notes, and family histories. By addressing the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, DECIPHER has the potential to revolutionize the field of genetic diagnosis, enabling healthcare professionals to provide more accurate and personalized care for individuals with rare genetic disorders. The DECIPHER framework offers a promising solution for the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, and its application has far-reaching implications for the field of genetic medicine.", "label": 1}
