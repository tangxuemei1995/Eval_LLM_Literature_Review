{"grounding": "This article reviews evolving legal implications for clinicians and researchers as genomics is used more widely in both the clinic and in translational research, reflecting rapid changes in scientific knowledge as well as the surrounding cultural and political environment. Professionals will face new and changing duties to make or act upon a genetic diagnosis, address direct-to-consumer genetic testing in patient care, consider the health implications of results for patients\u2019 family members, and recontact patients when test results change over time. Professional duties in reproductive genetic testing will need to be recalibrated in response to disruptive changes to reproductive rights in the United States. We also review the debate over who controls the flow of genetic information and who is responsible for its protection, considering the globally influential European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the rapidly evolving data privacy law landscape of the United States.", "generated_text": "The rapid advancement of genomics has led to an increasingly complex landscape of legal considerations, with significant implications for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. This abstract reviews the current state of liability and data privacy in the genomics field, highlighting key challenges and emerging trends. The duty to warn and inform patients about the potential risks and benefits of genetic testing is a critical concern, particularly in the context of rare genetic disorders and precision medicine. Meanwhile, data privacy concerns surrounding genomic data storage, sharing, and analysis continue to pose significant challenges. This review synthesizes existing literature on liability and data privacy in genomics, with a focus on the intersection of these issues and their implications for the evolving genomics landscape. By examining the current state of the law and emerging trends, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for navigating the complex legal landscape of genomics.", "label": 1}
