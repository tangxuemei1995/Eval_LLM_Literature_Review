{"grounding": "While the neural crest cell population gives rise to an extraordinary array of derivatives, including elements of the craniofacial skeleton, skin pigmentation, and peripheral nervous system, it is today increasingly recognized that Schwann cell precursors are also multipotent. Two mammalian paralogs of the SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) chromatin-remodeling complexes, BAF (Brg1-associated factors) and PBAF (polybromo-associated BAF), are critical for neural crest specification during normal mammalian development. There is increasing evidence that pathogenic variants in components of the BAF and PBAF complexes play central roles in the pathogenesis of neural crest\u2013derived tumors. Transgenic mouse models demonstrate a temporal window early in development where pathogenic variants in Smarcb1 result in the formation of aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors, such as rhabdoid tumors. By contrast, later in development, homozygous inactivation of Smarcb1 requires additional pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor genes to drive the development of differentiated adult neoplasms derived from the neural crest, which have a comparatively good prognosis in humans.\n", "generated_text": "The SWI/SNF complex is a chromatin remodeling enzyme complex that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during neural crest cell development. Neural crest cells are a transient, multipotent population that gives rise to diverse cell types, including Schwann cells, melanocytes, and glial cells. Mutations in the NF2 gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin 2, have been implicated in the development of schwannomas, a type of tumor that arises from Schwann cell precursors. Smarcb1, the gene encoding the tumor suppressor protein SMARCB1, is also frequently mutated in rhabdoid tumors, which are aggressive neoplasms that arise from neural crest-derived cells. This review highlights the importance of the SWI/SNF complex in regulating neural crest cell development and highlights the role of NF2 and Smarcb1 mutations in the development of schwannomas and rhabdoid tumors, respectively. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
