{"grounding": "Genome sequencing is increasingly used in research and integrated into clinical care. In the research domain, large-scale analyses, including whole genome sequencing with variant interpretation and curation, virtually guarantee identification of variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic and actionable. Multiple guidelines recommend that findings associated with actionable conditions be offered to research participants in order to demonstrate respect for autonomy, reciprocity, and participant interests in health and privacy. Some recommendations go further and support offering a wider range of findings, including those that are not immediately actionable. In addition, entities covered by the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be required to provide a participant's raw genomic data on request. Despite these widely endorsed guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. This article analyzes the ethical and legal foundations for researcher duties to offer adult participants their interpreted results and raw data as the new normal in genomic research.", "generated_text": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing has revolutionized genomic research, enabling the detection of rare genetic variants and secondary findings that may have significant implications for patient health. However, the return of results to individuals and their families raises complex research ethics concerns. This review aims to discuss the current landscape of return of results in genomic research, focusing on the detection of incidental findings and secondary variants. We examine the current guidelines and frameworks governing the return of results, including the use of return of results policies, consent forms, and secondary use agreements. Our analysis highlights the need for a nuanced approach to return of results, one that balances individual patient autonomy with the potential benefits of genomic research. Ultimately, we argue that a new normal for return of results in genomic research requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating input from ethicists, clinicians, and researchers to ensure that the rights and interests of all stakeholders are protected.", "label": 1}
