{"grounding": "The trajectory of human aging varies widely from one individual to the next due to complex interactions between the genome and the environment that influence the aging process. Such differences in age-specific mortality and disease risk among same-aged individuals reflect variation in the pace of biological aging. Certain mechanisms involved in the progression of biological aging originate in the epigenome, where chemical modifications to the genome are able to alter gene expression without modifying the underlying DNA sequence. The epigenome serves as an interface for environmental signals, which are able to \u201cget under the skin\u201d to influence health and aging. A number of the molecular mechanisms involved in the aging process have been identified, although few aging phenotypes have been definitively traced to their underlying molecular causes thus far. In this review, we discuss variation in human biological aging and the epigenome's role in promoting heterogeneity in human longevity and healthspan.", "generated_text": "The interplay between environmental factors and epigenetic mechanisms has been increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of the pace of human aging. Research has shown that exposure to environmental toxins, lifestyle choices, and socioeconomic conditions can lead to epigenetic alterations that accelerate biological aging. The epigenetic clock, a measure of epigenetic age, has been found to be a strong predictor of age-related disease, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cognitive decline. Conversely, environmental interventions, such as dietary modifications and exercise, have been shown to slow epigenetic aging and improve health outcomes. This review aims to synthesize the current evidence on the relationship between environment, epigenetics, and aging, highlighting the potential for environmental interventions to modulate epigenetic aging and mitigate age-related disease. Understanding this complex interplay is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related disease.", "label": 1}
