{"grounding": "In this Perspective article, I am able to draw the various strands of my intellectual thinking and practice in archaeology and European prehistory into a complex narrative of changing themes. In this narrative, I draw attention to the inspirational triggers of these transformations to be found in works and words of colleagues and events within and outside my immediate discipline. A group of events between 1988 and 1993 disrupted (in a good way) the trajectory of my professional life and provided a convenient anchor around which my themes pivoted and regrouped with very different standpoints. But some trends in my way of working remained constant and contributed, I hope, to a career of cumulative knowledge. Along the way, I show the significance, in terms of my personal intellectual context as well as archaeological practice in general, of my published works as well as more obscure and some unpublished works that are cited here for the first time.", "generated_text": "This study undertakes a critical examination of the intersections between feminist practice of archaeology and digital archaeology, with a focus on the construction of the past through autobiographical narratives. Drawing on a middle-range research approach, this investigation explores the ways in which shifting and pivoting viewpoints in Neolithic European prehistory have been influenced by the author's own experiences and inspirations throughout their lifetime. Through a qualitative analysis of autobiographical accounts and digital archaeological projects, this research reveals the complex dynamics between personal and professional perspectives in shaping our understanding of the past. By acknowledging the role of autobiographical narratives in the construction of historical narratives, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the intersections between feminist practice, digital archaeology, and the history of archaeology, ultimately informing more nuanced and contextualized approaches to the study of European prehistory.", "label": 0}
