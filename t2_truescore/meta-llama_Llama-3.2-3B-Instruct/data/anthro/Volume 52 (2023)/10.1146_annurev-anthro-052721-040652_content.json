{"grounding": "This review examines the discourses and practices that have produced a lively literature on museum decolonization created by scholars of museum practices and curators. We consider the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, focusing especially on the care of Native North American heritage, with comparison to similar trajectories internationally. We begin with a discussion of decolonizing moments in theory and practice, with particular attention to 1990s critique of ethnographic museums and developments after the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Following this discussion is a review of works on concerns regarding Native American representation and public displays, involvement in collections care, and the varied collaborations that are changing museum practices. The final section foregrounds the fluorescence of tribal museums and their contributions to the decolonization and indigenization of museums, as well as emerging paradigm shifts in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums.", "generated_text": "Decolonizing museums is a critical imperative for the preservation and representation of Indigenous cultures and histories. This paradigm shift requires a fundamental transformation of museum practices, moving away from Eurocentric and colonialist narratives to prioritize Native American scholarship and perspectives. By centering Indigenous voices and knowledge, museums can dismantle the power dynamics that have historically marginalized and erased Native American communities. This shift involves not only the repatriation of cultural artifacts and the development of Indigenous-led exhibitions but also a fundamental reevaluation of the role of museums in society. By embracing decolonization and indigenization, museums can become sites of reconciliation, healing, and cultural revitalization, ultimately contributing to a more just and equitable representation of Indigenous peoples and their histories.", "label": 0}
