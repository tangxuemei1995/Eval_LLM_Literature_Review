{"grounding": "In this article, we explore critical university studies (CUS), an interdisciplinary body of scholarship that interrogates structures of higher education and their entanglements with national and global institutions and political movements. Favoring an expansive definition of CUS, we draw from scholars who trace the origins of the American university to the slave trade, racial science, and Native American ethnic cleansing projects, as well as scholars who bring abolitionist and decolonial stances to highlight how the university continues to perpetuate state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness. We then bring the lens of CUS to bear on critical work by anthropologists on higher education and on the discipline more broadly. We explore the challenges of advocating for antiracist and anti-imperial anthropology without attending to the structures of Western/white superiority that have enabled its institutionalization. We conclude by considering interventions by the emerging field of abolitionist anthropology.", "generated_text": "This study contributes to the growing body of research on Critical University Studies (CUS), a framework that seeks to decolonize and democratize higher education. Drawing on the intersections of critical pedagogy, Black studies, and abolitionist thought, this research examines the ways in which CUS can be used to challenge dominant power structures and promote social justice within university settings. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this study highlights the importance of centering marginalized voices and perspectives in university curricula and pedagogy. It also explores the potential for CUS to inform abolitionist efforts to dismantle the prison-industrial complex and promote a more equitable and just society. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the transformative potential of Critical University Studies and its role in shaping a more just and equitable future.", "label": 1}
