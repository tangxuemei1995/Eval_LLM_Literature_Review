{"grounding": "In this review, we call for heightened attention to the labor of interpreters to think more reflexively about our own professional ethics and the paradoxes of global capitalism within which both interpreters and anthropologists work. Like other forms of communicative labor, interpretation is often devalued, unrecognized, and uncompensated\u2014a form of invisible labor. Professional language ideologies, some paradoxically perpetuated by the profession itself, contribute to interpreters\u2019 invisibility in their workplaces. Global and multilingual organizations depend on ideologies of transparency and the assumption that language transmission is easy; examining interpreters\u2019 labor ethnographically troubles these assumptions. Interpreters also confront an ethical tension in their position that mirrors a tension in anthropology: namely, between ideals of professional neutrality and analytic distance versus intentional advocacy. The study of interpreters offers ways to critically assess anthropologists\u2019 own professional practices and dig deeply into the contradictions of global capitalism.", "generated_text": "This study examines the invisible labor and ethics of interpreting in the context of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Through a critical discourse analysis of existing literature and case studies, this research reveals the often-overlooked contributions of interpreters in shaping the narratives and policies of international organizations. The invisible labor of interpreters is characterized by the suppression of their own voice and agency, as they are relegated to the background of decision-making processes. This research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the power dynamics at play in interpreting, and the importance of recognizing the ethical implications of interpreter labor. By centering the voices and perspectives of interpreters, this study aims to contribute to a more equitable and just global order, one that values the contributions of all individuals involved in interpreting and translation.", "label": 0}
