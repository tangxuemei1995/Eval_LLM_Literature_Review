{"grounding": "This review sketches a linguistic anthropology of images. While linguistic anthropology has not historically focalized images as a central theoretical object of concern, linguistic anthropologists\u2019 research has increasingly concerned images of various sorts. Furthermore, in its critique of structuralist reductions of language, the field has advanced an analytic vocabulary for thinking about the image in discourse. In this article, I review scholarship in linguistic anthropology on prototypic images to show how these advances (e.g., entextualization, performativity, perspective, and enregisterment) can be leveraged to theorize images more generally. In doing so, I argue against any hard distinction between language and image. I conclude by expanding out from a linguistic anthropology of images to what I call \u201ca linguistic anthropology of\u2026,\u201d a field characterized by an open-ended horizon of objects and modes of inquiry, all linked together as linguistic anthropology.", "generated_text": "This study undertakes a linguistic anthropology of images, examining the complex interplay between visual representation and linguistic meaning. Through a critical discourse analysis of semiotic images, the research explores the process of entextualization, where images are inscribed with linguistic meaning and become part of a larger discursive field. The findings highlight the performative potential of images, which can enact social norms and reinforce power dynamics. Furthermore, the study reveals the concept of enregisterment, where images are imbued with specific linguistic features and become part of a particular register or genre. The research demonstrates how linguistic anthropology can provide a nuanced understanding of the role of images in shaping social meaning and cultural identity. By examining the intersections of language, image, and power, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between visual representation and linguistic expression.", "label": 1}
