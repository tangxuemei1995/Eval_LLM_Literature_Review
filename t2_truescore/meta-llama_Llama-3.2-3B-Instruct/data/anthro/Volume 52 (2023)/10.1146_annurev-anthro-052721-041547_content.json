{"grounding": "Anthropological expeditions seeking out algorithms frequently return empty-handed. They are confronted with the challenge of the object: what to study when studying algorithms? In this article, I draw together a number of literatures to outline one possible answer to the question of how to study algorithms in social science. I argue that what we should study are algorithmic ecologies. I sketch five modalities of algorithmic ecologies and review concomitant literatures: (a) imaginaries, (b) infrastructures, (c) interfaces, (d) identities, and (e) investments and interests. The speculative propositions offered here are that algorithms are immanent to ecologies and that they are enacted across all the modalities of algorithmic ecologies.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of algorithms and ecology, examining the infrastructure and social imaginaries that underpin the development and deployment of smart technologies. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, we identify the interfaces between algorithmic systems and the natural environment, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the ecological implications of algorithmic decision-making. By investigating the ways in which algorithms shape our relationships with technology and the environment, this research contributes to the emerging field of 'ecology of algorithms,' offering insights into the potential consequences of algorithmic governance on ecological systems and human societies.", "label": 0}
