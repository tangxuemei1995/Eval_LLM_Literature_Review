{"grounding": "\u201cIntervention\u201d is central to global health, but the significance and effects of how intervention is practiced are often taken for granted. This review takes interventions into health and medicine as subjects for ethnographic inquiry. We highlight three lines of anthropological contributions: studies of global health interventions that serve imperial and military objectives, studies of \u201cmagic bullet\u201d interventions arising from laboratory science, and studies of interventions based on deterministic modeling techniques. We then outline examples of \u201cintervention otherwise,\u201d in which people build relations of solidarity and care through global health programming, design interventions to be interactive and adaptable, and use data and modeling to support health justice. Whereas many global health interventions reproduce Western power hierarchies, intervention otherwise draws attention to alternative forms of knowledge, action, and expertise. Our analysis of lively and multivalent practices of intervention has implications for debates about the im/possibility of decolonizing global health.", "generated_text": "This study critiques the dominant paradigm of global health interventions, which posits that military-led aid delivery is an effective solution to address health disparities worldwide. Through an anthropological lens, we examine the'magic bullet' approach, where a single intervention is assumed to be the panacea for complex health issues. Our analysis reveals that this deterministic model overlooks the intricate web of social, economic, and cultural factors that shape health outcomes. We argue that a more nuanced understanding of global health interventions is necessary, one that acknowledges the agency of local populations and the need for context-specific solutions. By exploring alternative approaches to global health, including those that prioritize community-led initiatives and participatory governance, we aim to challenge the status quo and foster a more equitable and effective global health agenda.", "label": 0}
