{"grounding": "This article reviews the anthropological scholarship that engages with religious conversion as a political phenomenon, broadly defined. It develops the idea of making a difference as an overarching framework with a double meaning. First, this idiom captures how, by framing religious conversion in political terms, anthropologists have claimed to have substantially intervened\u2014have made a difference, so to speak\u2014in the discussion of conversion. Second, the article sets aside the prevalent problematization of conversion as a category of change, showing instead how anthropologists have sought to establish how religious change makes a difference\u2014in the interweaved realities of individuals, collectives, and polities. I scrutinize and contextualize the belated consolidation of this area of inquiry, map its major strands, and identify the interrelated theoretical developments within anthropology. Seeing these strands as a generative domain of inquiry, I conclude with a number of suggestions for future research, such as paying closer attention to political conversions and to the links between religious conversion and political crises.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex interplay between religious conversion and politics, exploring how individuals and groups navigate the tensions between personal faith and public difference. Through a critical discourse analysis of media reports and policy documents, this research reveals how religious conversion is often framed as a source of political difference, with converts frequently stigmatized or marginalized. Conversely, the study also highlights instances where religious conversion is leveraged as a tool of social change, with individuals and groups using their faith to challenge dominant power structures. By analyzing the intersections of religion, politics, and identity, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the ways in which religious conversion shapes and is shaped by the political landscape. Ultimately, the study aims to shed light on the complex dynamics of making a difference through religious conversion in the context of politics and social change.", "label": 0}
