{"grounding": "Human habitation and adaptation to extreme environments have a deep history in anthropological research. Anthropologists\u2019 understanding of these ecological pressures and how humans respond to them has grown substantially over the last 100+ years. This review covers long-standing knowledge on adaptation to classic extreme conditions of heat, cold, and high altitude, while also updating the areas in which recent research has broadened our understanding of human adaptation, acclimatization, and resilience. Unfortunately, the intersecting stresses of structural inequality and climate change have made these extremes more extreme, with drastic negative impacts on health and well-being. Future research will need to explore how extreme environments, structural inequality, and climate change are embodied as well as mitigated so that humans are better prepared to face a rapidly changing world.", "generated_text": "Human bodies have evolved to adapt to diverse environments, but extreme conditions pose significant challenges to thermoregulation, metabolism, and overall survival. This review examines the physiological and biochemical responses of humans in extreme environments, including high-altitude, arctic, and desert conditions. Research highlights the importance of metabolic adaptations, such as increased brown adipose tissue activity, to cope with cold temperatures. In contrast, heat stress triggers heat shock proteins and vasodilation to maintain core temperature. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Structural inequality in access to resources, healthcare, and infrastructure further exacerbates the disparities in human adaptation to extreme environments. Understanding these adaptations is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote human resilience in extreme environments.", "label": 1}
