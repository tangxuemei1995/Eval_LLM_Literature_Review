{"grounding": "Water links the environment, culture, and biology. An integrative approach is needed to attain a complete picture of how water affects human biology due to its inherent interdisciplinary nature. First, this review describes advances in human water needs, thirst, and hydration strategies from a biocultural perspective. Second, it provides a critical appraisal of the literatures on water insecurity (WI) experiences and coping strategies used to mitigate WI to illustrate how they intersect to affect human biology through the embodiment framework. Deviations from water needs and heightened WI can alter hydration and coping strategies, which have implications for a suite of psychological and physiological outcomes. These disruptions are embodied in cellular damage, dehydration, nutrition, stress, mental health, cognitive impairment, aging-related effects, cardiometabolic health, and kidney function. Disrupting forces such as lifestyle changes and climate change have important implications for water needs, WI, coping and hydration strategies, and the embodiment of each.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate relationships between water needs, water insecurity, and human biology, with a focus on the embodied experiences of individuals in the face of climate change. Through a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative data, we investigate how water insecurity affects human hydration and coping strategies. Our findings suggest that water insecurity is closely linked to physiological responses, including increased thirst and dehydration, which can have long-term consequences for human health. We also explore the role of embodiment in shaping individual responses to water insecurity, highlighting the importance of considering the intersection of environmental, social, and biological factors. The study's results have significant implications for understanding the human dimensions of water insecurity and informing strategies to address this pressing global issue, particularly in the context of climate change.", "label": 1}
