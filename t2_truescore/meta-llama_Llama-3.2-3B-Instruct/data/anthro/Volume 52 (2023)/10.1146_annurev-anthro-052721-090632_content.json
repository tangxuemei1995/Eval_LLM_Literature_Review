{"grounding": "Contesting ideas about what is \u201cnormal\u201d human behavior or biology is a core contribution of anthropology. In efforts to provide more inclusive views of what it means to be human, anthropologists challenge judgments about diverse ways of being, which include assumptions about what it means to be normal. Meanings of the term normal encompass the descriptive (statistical) and the evaluative (normative), i.e., judgments about a given characteristic. In biomedicine, \u201chealthy\u201d is often the value ascribed to normal, but embedded in healthy are biases that derive from particular cultural and historical contexts. Here I review how the term normal is understood and used in anthropological and related studies of human biology and biological variation. I propose the biological normalcy framework for understanding how the statistical and normative meanings of normal mutually inform each other and their consequences for human population biology. Several examples provide illustrations of the framework.", "generated_text": "This study examines the concept of biological normalcy in the context of human biology, exploring how cultural norms and statistical variation influence our understanding of what is considered 'normal'. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, we reveal how normative views of human biology are shaped by societal expectations and statistical averages. Our research highlights the limitations of relying solely on statistical data to define biological normalcy, as it neglects the inherent variation and diversity within human populations. By challenging traditional notions of normalcy, this study aims to promote a more nuanced understanding of human biology, one that acknowledges the complexities and variations that exist within and between populations. Ultimately, our findings have implications for how we approach health, medicine, and the human experience, encouraging a more inclusive and accepting definition of biological normalcy.", "label": 1}
