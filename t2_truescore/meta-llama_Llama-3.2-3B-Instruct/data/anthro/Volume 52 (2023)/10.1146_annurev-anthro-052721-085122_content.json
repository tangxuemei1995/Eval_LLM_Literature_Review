{"grounding": "Although microbiome science is relatively young, our knowledge of human-microbiome interactions is growing rapidly and has already begun to transform our understanding of human ecology and evolution. Here we summarize our current understanding of three-way interactions between the gut microbiota, human ecology, and human evolution. We review the factors driving microbiome variation within and between individuals and populations, as well as comparative data from nonhuman primates that allow a more direct examination of microbial relationships with host ecology and evolution. Collectively, these data sets can help illuminate generalizable principles governing host-microbiome-environment interactions, the processes contributing to bidirectional influences between the human gut microbiota and the human ecological niche, and past changes in the human microbiome that may have harbored consequences for human adaptation. Developing richer insight into host-microbiome-environment interactions will ultimately broaden our view of human biology and its response to changing environments.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationships between the human gut microbiome and host ecology and evolution have garnered significant attention in recent years. This complex interplay is characterized by dynamic interactions between the microbiota, host immune system, and environmental factors, ultimately influencing phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. Nonhuman primate models have provided valuable insights into the evolutionary origins of human microbiota and the mechanisms underlying host-microbial co-evolution. Studies have shown that changes in gut microbiota composition are associated with adaptations to different diets, environments, and lifestyles, highlighting the critical role of the microbiome in shaping human health and disease. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the intersections between gut microbial ecology, human ecology, and evolution, with a focus on the nonhuman primate model, to elucidate the complex relationships between the human microbiome and its host environment.", "label": 1}
