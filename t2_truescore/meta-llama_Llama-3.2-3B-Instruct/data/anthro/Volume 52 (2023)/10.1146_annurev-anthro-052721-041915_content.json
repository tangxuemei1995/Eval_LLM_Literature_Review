{"grounding": "This review surveys studies of men and masculinities in anthropology and ethnography from other disciplines, as well as theoretical frameworks and debates among anthropologists and other relevant scholars in the field. It also aims to assess developments in these studies since an earlier Annual Review of Anthropology article was published on this subject. By considering the ethnographic boom in men and masculinities studies across the globe since 2000, increasingly authored by anthropologists from the Global South, this review considers anthropology's singular contributions topically and conceptually\u2014for example, masculinity and militarism, men and public health, gender inequalities, and trans* social movements\u2014including through innovative research in biological and linguistic anthropology and archaeology. Throughout, this article reflects on the extent to which anthropologists have moved (and if they should have moved) beyond the study of women or men to instead explore gender, sex, and sexuality of humans and nonhuman animals in less binary frameworks.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the concept of masculinity through an anthropological lens, challenging dominant narratives and reexamining the unmarked assumptions that underpin traditional notions of male identity. Drawing on ethnographic research with men from diverse backgrounds, this work seeks to uncover the complexities and nuances of masculinity, highlighting the ways in which societal expectations and power dynamics shape individual experiences. By exploring the intersections of masculinity with other social categories, such as gender, sexuality, and inequality, this research aims to shed light on the ways in which masculinity is both performed and performed upon. Ultimately, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of masculinity as a dynamic and multifaceted construct, one that is subject to change and transformation in response to shifting social and cultural contexts.", "label": 1}
