{"grounding": "The world's eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) contribute disproportionately to global ocean productivity and provide critical ecosystem services to human society. The impact of climate change on EBUSs and the ecosystems they support is thus a subject of considerable interest. Here, we review hypotheses of climate-driven change in the physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology of EBUSs; describe observed changes over recent decades; and present projected changes over the twenty-first century. Similarities in historical and projected change among EBUSs include a trend toward upwelling intensification in poleward regions, mitigatedwarming in near-coastal regions where upwelling intensifies, and enhanced water-column stratification and a shoaling mixed layer. However, there remains significant uncertainty in how EBUSs will evolve with climate change, particularly in how the sometimes competing changes in upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification will affect productivity and ecosystem structure. We summarize the commonalities and differences in historical and projected change in EBUSs and conclude with an assessment of key remaining uncertainties and questions. Future studies will need to address these questions to better understand, project, and adapt to climate-driven changes in EBUSs.", "generated_text": "Eastern boundary upwelling systems, such as the California Current and the Humboldt Current, play a crucial role in regulating regional climate and marine ecosystems. However, these systems are vulnerable to climate change, which is projected to alter ocean circulation patterns and temperature regimes. This study examines the impacts of climate change on eastern boundary upwelling systems, with a focus on changes in upwelling intensity, ocean productivity, and marine biodiversity. Using a combination of observational data and climate modeling, we find that climate change is expected to weaken upwelling in these systems, leading to reduced ocean productivity and changes in marine species distributions. Our results highlight the need for continued monitoring and research into the impacts of climate change on eastern boundary upwelling systems, and the importance of preserving these critical ecosystems in the face of global warming. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between climate change, ocean circulation, and marine ecosystems.", "label": 1}
