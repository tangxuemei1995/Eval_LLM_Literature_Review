{"grounding": "To thrive in nutrient-poor waters, coral reefs must retain and recycle materials efficiently. This review centers microbial processes in facilitating the persistence and stability of coral reefs, specifically the role of these processes in transforming and recycling the dissolved organic matter (DOM) that acts as an invisible currency in reef production, nutrient exchange, and organismal interactions. The defining characteristics of coral reefs, including high productivity, balanced metabolism, high biodiversity, nutrient retention, and structural complexity, are inextricably linked to microbial processing of DOM. The composition of microbes and DOM in reefs is summarized, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of biogeochemical processes carried out by microorganisms in diverse reef habitats are explored in a variety of key reef processes, including decomposition, accretion, trophictransfer, and macronutrient recycling. Finally, we examine how widespread habitat degradation of reefs is altering these important microbe\u2013DOM interactions, creating feedbacks that reduce reef resilience to global change.", "generated_text": "Coral reefs are complex ecosystems that rely on the interactions between coral polyps, microorganisms, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) for their function and resilience. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of microbial communities in decomposing DOM, releasing essential nutrients, and mitigating the effects of deoxygenation on coral reefs. The decomposition of DOM by coral-associated microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea, is a key process that regulates the availability of nutrients for coral growth and survival. Furthermore, the microbiomes of coral reefs play a crucial role in modulating the effects of deoxygenation, which can have devastating consequences for coral reefs. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the interactions between microbial communities, DOM, and ecosystem function in coral reefs, highlighting the importance of preserving the integrity of these complex interactions for the long-term health and resilience of coral reef ecosystems.", "label": 1}
