{"grounding": "Exchange of material across the nearshore region, extending from the shoreline to a few kilometers offshore, determines the concentrations of pathogens and nutrients near the coast and the transport of larvae, whose cross-shore positions influence dispersal and recruitment. Here, we describe a framework for estimating the relative importance of cross-shore exchange mechanisms, including winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling. For each mechanism, we define an exchange velocity as a function of environmental conditions. The exchange velocity applies for organisms that keep a particular depth due to swimming or buoyancy. A related exchange diffusivity quantifies horizontal spreading of particles without enough vertical swimming speed or buoyancy to counteract turbulent velocities. This framework provides a way to determinewhich processes are important for cross-shore exchange for a particular study site, time period, and particle behavior.", "generated_text": "The nearshore region is a critical area where exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles occurs, influencing coastal ecosystems and water quality. This study investigates the cross-shore exchange of these entities across the nearshore region, focusing on the roles of wind, surface waves, and internal waves. Turbulence plays a pivotal role in mediating these exchanges, with varying intensities affecting particle transport and deposition. Our research reveals that wind-driven surface waves and internal waves contribute significantly to the cross-shore transport of plankton, pollutants, and particles. The study also highlights the importance of turbulence in modulating these exchanges, with high-turbulence conditions leading to increased particle deposition and reduced plankton transport. The findings of this study have implications for understanding coastal ecosystem dynamics and informing strategies for mitigating the impacts of pollution and climate change in nearshore regions.", "label": 1}
