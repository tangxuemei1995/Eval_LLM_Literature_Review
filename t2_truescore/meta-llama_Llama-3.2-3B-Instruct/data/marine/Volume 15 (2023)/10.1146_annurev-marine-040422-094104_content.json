{"grounding": "Lipids are structurally diverse biomolecules that serve multiple roles in cells. As such, they are used as biomarkers in the modern ocean and as paleoproxies to explore the geological past. Here, I review lipid geochemistry, biosynthesis, and compartmentalization; the varied uses of lipids as biomarkers; and the evolution of analytical techniques used to measure and characterize lipids. Advancements in high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry have revolutionized the lipidomic and metabolomic fields, both of which are quickly being integrated into marine meta-omic studies. Lipidomics allows us to analyze tens of thousands of features, providing an open analytical window and the ability to quantify unknown compounds that can be structurally elucidated later. However, lipidome annotation is not a trivial matter and represents one of the biggest challenges for oceanographers, owing in part to the lack of marine lipids in current in silico databases and data repositories. A case study reveals the gaps in our knowledge and open opportunities to answer fundamental questions about molecular-level control of chemical reactions and global-scale patterns in the lipidscape.", "generated_text": "Lipid biogeochemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the complex interactions between microorganisms, their environment, and the global carbon cycle. Recent advances in lipidomic techniques have revolutionized the field, enabling the comprehensive analysis of lipid biomarkers in various environmental samples. This review synthesizes the current state of lipid biogeochemistry and highlights the applications of modern lipidomic techniques in microbial oceanography. We discuss the importance of lipid biomarkers in tracing the fate of organic matter, assessing microbial community composition, and reconstructing past environmental conditions. Meta-omics approaches have also been employed to integrate lipidomic data with other omics technologies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of lipid biogeochemical processes. The review highlights the potential of lipidomics in addressing key questions in biogeochemistry, including the role of lipids in the ocean's carbon cycle and the impact of climate change on lipid biogeochemical processes. By integrating lipidomic data with other scientific disciplines, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and their environment.", "label": 1}
