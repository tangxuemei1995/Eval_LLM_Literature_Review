{"grounding": "Gender equity, providing for full participation of people of all genders in the oceanographic workforce, is an important goal for the continued success of the oceanographic enterprise. Here, we describe historical obstructions to gender equity; assess recent progress and the current status of gender equity in oceanography by examining quantitative measures of participation, achievement, and recognition; and review activities to improve gender equity. We find that women receive approximately half the oceanography PhDs in many parts of the world and are increasing in parity in earlier levels of academic employment. However, continued progress toward gender parity is needed, as reflected by metrics such as first-authored publications, funded grants, honors, and conference speaker invitations. Finally we make recommendations for the whole oceanographic community to continue to work together to create a culture where oceanographers of all genders can thrive, including eliminating harassment, reexamining selection and evaluation procedures, and removing structural inequities.", "generated_text": "The oceanography field has historically been male-dominated, with women underrepresented in research, academia, and professional positions. This disparity has significant implications for the advancement of oceanographic knowledge and the effective management of marine resources. A review of existing literature reveals that gender equity in oceanography is influenced by various factors, including societal norms, institutional barriers, and individual biases. Women in oceanography often face challenges related to career advancement, mentorship, and representation in decision-making positions. To address these issues, this study examines the current state of gender equity in oceanography, with a focus on the experiences of women in research and academia. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, such as mentorship programs, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and policy changes, to promote gender equity and advance the field of oceanography.", "label": 1}
