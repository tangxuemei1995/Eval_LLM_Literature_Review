{"grounding": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) is rapidly attracting interest, as climate change is putting ecosystems at risk and endangering human communities globally. Due to the centrality of the ocean in the global carbon cycle, augmenting the carbon sequestration capacity of the ocean could be a powerful mechanism for the removal of legacy excess emissions. However, OCDR requires careful assessment due to the unique biophysical characteristics of the ocean and its centrality in the Earth system and many social systems. Using a sociotechnical system lens, this review identifies the sets of considerations that need to be included within robust assessments for OCDR decision-making. Specifically, it lays out the state of technical assessments of OCDR approaches along with key financial concerns, social issues (including public perceptions), and the underlying ethical debates and concerns that would need to be addressed if OCDR were to be deployed as a carbon dioxide removal strategy.", "generated_text": "This study examines the sociotechnical considerations surrounding ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) as a potential strategy for mitigating climate change. Drawing on environmental ethics, public perception, and climate finance, we analyze the complex interplay between technological, social, and economic factors influencing the adoption of OCDR. Our analysis reveals that public perception of OCDR is shaped by concerns about environmental justice, ecosystem disruption, and the potential for unequal distribution of benefits and risks. Climate finance is also a critical factor, as the cost of implementing OCDR technologies and the associated risks and uncertainties must be addressed. We argue that a nuanced understanding of these sociotechnical considerations is essential for developing effective policies and strategies that balance the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the need to ensure equitable and sustainable development. Our findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to OCDR that incorporates insights from environmental ethics, public policy, and climate change mitigation.", "label": 1}
