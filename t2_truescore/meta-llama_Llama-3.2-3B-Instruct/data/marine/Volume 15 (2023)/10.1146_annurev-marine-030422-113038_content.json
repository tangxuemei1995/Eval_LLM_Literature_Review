{"grounding": "The regular movements of waves and tides are obvious representations of the oceans\u2019 rhythmicity. But the rhythms of marine life span across ecological niches and timescales, including short (in the range of hours) and long (in the range of days and months) periods. These rhythms regulate the physiology and behavior of individuals, as well as their interactions with each other and with the environment. This review highlights examples of rhythmicity in marine animals and algae that represent important groups of marine life across different habitats. The examples cover ecologically highly relevant species and a growing number of laboratory model systems that are used to disentangle key mechanistic principles. The review introduces fundamental concepts of chronobiology, such as the distinction between rhythmic and endogenous oscillator\u2013driven processes. It also addresses the relevance of studying diverse rhythms and oscillators, as well as their interconnection, for making better predictions of how species will respond to environmental perturbations, including climate change. As the review aims to address scientists from the diverse fields of marine biology, ecology, and molecular chronobiology, all of which have their own scientific terms, we provide definitions of key terms throughout the article.", "generated_text": "Marine organisms have evolved complex internal biological clocks to synchronize their physiological processes with environmental cycles, ensuring optimal survival and reproduction. Endogenous oscillators, such as circadian, circatidal, circalunar, and circannual rhythms, play a crucial role in regulating various physiological and behavioral responses in marine species. These internal rhythms are influenced by external environmental cues, including light-dark cycles, tidal cycles, lunar cycles, and seasonal changes. Climate change, however, poses a significant threat to the integrity of these internal biological clocks, as altered environmental conditions can disrupt the synchronization of these rhythms. For instance, changes in temperature and daylight patterns can affect the circadian rhythms of marine animals, leading to disruptions in feeding behavior, migration patterns, and reproductive cycles. In contrast, some marine algae have evolved unique strategies to maintain their circadian rhythms in response to environmental changes. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the complex interactions between endogenous oscillators and environmental cycles in marine organisms, with a focus on the impacts of climate change on these internal biological clocks.", "label": 1}
