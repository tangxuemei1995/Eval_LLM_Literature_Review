{"grounding": "The modes of Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV), traditionally defined as statistical patterns of variance, reflect to first order the ocean's integration (i.e., reddening) of atmospheric forcing that arises from both a shift and a change in strength of the climatological (time-mean) atmospheric circulation. While these patterns concisely describe PDV, they do not distinguish among the key dynamical processes driving the evolution of PDV anomalies, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks with similar spatial structures that operate on different timescales. In this review, we synthesize past analysis using an empirical dynamical model constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies drawn from several reanalysis products, showing that the PDV modes of variance result from two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes: the North Pacific\u2013central Pacific (NP-CP) and Kuroshio\u2013Oyashio Extension (KOE) modes. Both eigenmodes highlight how two-way tropical\u2013extratropical teleconnection dynamics are the primary mechanisms energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale footprint of PDV. While the NP-CP mode captures interannual- to decadal-scale variability, the KOE mode is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV on decadal to multidecadal timescales, including contributions from the South Pacific.", "generated_text": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDSV) refers to the long-term fluctuations in climate patterns across the Pacific Ocean, with significant implications for global climate change. This variability is characterized by complex modes and mechanisms, including the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a well-known driver of PDSV. Research has shown that PDSV is influenced by various ocean-atmosphere teleconnections, including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO). The PDO, in particular, has been linked to changes in ocean temperatures, sea ice coverage, and atmospheric circulation patterns, which in turn impact global climate patterns. This variability also has significant impacts on regional climate conditions, including droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. Understanding the modes and mechanisms of PDSV is crucial for predicting future climate change and developing effective strategies for mitigating its impacts. This review aims to synthesize the current knowledge on PDSV, highlighting the key drivers, mechanisms, and regional impacts of this complex climate phenomenon.", "label": 1}
