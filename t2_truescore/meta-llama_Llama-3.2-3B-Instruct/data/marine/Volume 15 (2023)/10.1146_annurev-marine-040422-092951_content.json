{"grounding": "Tidal marshes and mangroves are increasingly valued for nature-based mitigation of coastal storm impacts, such as flooding and shoreline erosion hazards, which are growing due to global change. As this review highlights, however, hazard mitigation by tidal wetlands is limited to certain conditions, and not all hazards are equally reduced. Tidal wetlands are effective in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves, but long-period storm surges, which elevate sea levels up to several meters for up to more than a day, are attenuated less effectively, or in some cases not at all, depending on storm conditions, wetland properties, and larger-scale coastal landscape geometry. Wetlands often limit erosion, but storm damage to vegetation (especially mangrove trees) can be substantial, and recovery may take several years. Longer-term wetland persistence can be compromised when combined with other stressors, such as climate change and human disturbances. Due to these uncertainties, nature-based coastal defense projects need to adopt adaptive management strategies.", "generated_text": "Marshes and mangroves have long been recognized as vital components of coastal ecosystems, providing essential ecosystem services that mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events, including cyclones and hurricanes. These nature-based coastal storm buffers play a crucial role in reducing flood risk and protecting coastal infrastructure. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this study examines the effectiveness of marshes and mangroves in buffering against storm surges and sea-level rise. The findings highlight the importance of preserving and restoring these ecosystems, which not only provide natural flood protection but also support biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. The study also discusses the potential for integrating nature-based solutions with traditional coastal engineering approaches to enhance the overall resilience of coastal communities. By leveraging the unique characteristics of marshes and mangroves, this research aims to inform policy and practice, promoting the adoption of nature-based coastal storm buffers as a key strategy for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events.", "label": 0}
