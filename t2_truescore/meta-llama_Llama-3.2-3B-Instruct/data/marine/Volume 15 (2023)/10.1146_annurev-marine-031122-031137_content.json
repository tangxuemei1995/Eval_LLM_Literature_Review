{"grounding": "Constraining rates of marine carbonate burial through geologic time is critical for interpreting reconstructed changes in ocean chemistry and understanding feedbacks and interactions between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. The Quaternary Period (the past 2.6 million years) is of particular interest due to dramatic variations in sea level that periodically exposed and flooded areas of carbonate accumulation on the continental shelf, likely impacting the global carbonate budget and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These important effects remain poorly quantified. Here, we summarize the importance of carbonate burial in the ocean\u2013climate system, review methods for quantifying carbonate burial across depositional environments, discuss advances in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial over the past three decades, and identify gaps and challenges in reconciling the existing records. Emerging paleoceanographic proxies such as the stable strontium and calcium isotope systems, as well as innovative modeling approaches, are highlighted as new opportunities to produce continuous records of global carbonate burial.", "generated_text": "This study presents a comprehensive review of global Quaternary carbonate burial, integrating proxy-based reconstructions and model-based simulations to elucidate the persisting uncertainties in this critical component of the Earth's carbon cycle. During the Quaternary, changes in sea level, ocean circulation, and climate drove the burial of carbonate sediments, influencing the global carbon budget. Proxy records, including coral, foraminiferal, and sedimentary archives, provide valuable insights into past carbonate production and burial patterns. However, these records are often fragmented and subject to uncertainties. To address these limitations, we employed a suite of global climate models to simulate the Quaternary carbonate cycle. Our results indicate that the global carbonate burial rate varied significantly during glacial and interglacial periods, with a pronounced impact on the carbon cycle. Despite advances in modeling and proxy-based reconstructions, uncertainties persist, particularly regarding the magnitude and timing of past carbonate burial. This study highlights the need for continued interdisciplinary research to refine our understanding of the Quaternary carbonate cycle and its role in the Earth's carbon budget.", "label": 1}
