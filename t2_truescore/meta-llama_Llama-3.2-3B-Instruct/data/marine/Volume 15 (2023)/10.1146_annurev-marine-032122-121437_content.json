{"grounding": "Climatic extremes are becoming increasingly common against a background trend of global warming. In the oceans, marine heatwaves (MHWs)\u2014discrete periods of anomalously warm water\u2014have intensified and become more frequent over the past century, impacting the integrity of marine ecosystems globally. We review and synthesize current understanding of MHW impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. We then examine how these impacts affect broader ecosystem services and discuss the current state of research on biological impacts of MHWs. Finally, we explore current and emergent approaches to predicting the occurrence andimpacts of future events, along with adaptation and management approaches. With further increases in intensity and frequency projected for coming decades, MHWs are emerging as pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems globally. A deeper mechanistic understanding of their biological impacts is needed to better predict and adapt to increased MHW activity in the Anthropocene.", "generated_text": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are a growing concern due to their significant impacts on marine ecosystems and ecosystem services. Rising ocean temperatures, primarily caused by climate change, lead to increased frequency and severity of MHWs. These extreme events can cause widespread damage to marine life, alter species distributions, and disrupt the delicate balance of marine food webs. Studies have shown that MHWs can lead to coral bleaching, reduced fish populations, and changes in phytoplankton communities. Furthermore, MHWs can also have cascading effects on coastal ecosystems, including increased erosion and reduced water quality. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on the biological impacts of MHWs, highlighting the need for further research on the long-term consequences of these events and the development of effective conservation strategies to mitigate their effects. Understanding the biological impacts of MHWs is crucial for developing effective management plans to protect marine ecosystems and ecosystem services.", "label": 1}
