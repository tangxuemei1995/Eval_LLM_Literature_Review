{"grounding": "Genetically engineered corn and cotton that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used to manage insect pests in the United States and elsewhere. In some cases, this has led to regional suppression of pest populations and pest eradication within the United States, and these outcomes were associated with reductions in conventional insecticides and increased profits for farmers. In other instances, pests evolved resistance to multiple Bt traits, compromising the capacity of Bt crops to manage pests and leading to increased feeding injury to crops in the field. Several aspects of pest biology and pest\u2013crop interactions were associated with cases where pests remained susceptible versus instances where pests evolved resistance. The viability of future transgenic traits can be improved by learning from these past outcomes. In particular, efforts should be made to delay resistance by increasing the prevalence of refuges and using integrated pest management.", "generated_text": "The management of insect pests with Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) crops has been a crucial aspect of agricultural practices in the United States. Bt crops, which produce a toxin that kills certain insect species, have been widely adopted for the control of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera pests, including the European corn borer and the cotton bollworm. However, the overuse of Bt crops has led to the development of insect resistance, necessitating the implementation of refuge strategies to maintain the effectiveness of these crops. Refuge strategies involve planting non-Bt crops alongside Bt crops to provide a source of susceptible insects, thereby maintaining the genetic diversity of the pest population and slowing the development of resistance. This review examines the current state of insect resistance management in Bt crops, including the use of refuge strategies, and discusses the implications for sustainable agricultural practices in the United States.", "label": 1}
