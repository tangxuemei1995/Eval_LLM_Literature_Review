{"grounding": "The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), is a well-known agricultural pest in its native range, North and South America, and has become a major invasive pest around the globe in the past decade. In this review, we provide an overview to update what is known about S. frugiperda in its native geographic ranges. This is followed by discussion of studies from the invaded areas to gain insights into S. frugiperda's ecology, specifically its reproductive biology, host plant use, status of insecticide resistance alleles, and biocontrol methods in native and invasive regions. We show that reference to host strains is uninformative in the invasive populations because multidirectional introduction events likely underpinned its recent rapid spread. Given that recent genomic analyses show that FAW is much more diverse than was previously assumed, and natural selection forces likely differ geographically, region-specific approaches will be needed to control this global pest.", "generated_text": "Spodoptera frugiperda, the fall armyworm, is a highly invasive and destructive pest species that has spread across the Americas, causing significant economic losses to agriculture. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the ecology, evolution, and management options of S. frugiperda, highlighting the complexities of its taxonomy, population genetics, and host plant use. Our analysis reveals that strain hybridization and mate attraction play crucial roles in the species' reproductive success, while insecticide resistance has emerged as a major concern. The review also discusses the evolutionary history of S. frugiperda, including its origins and dispersal patterns. Effective management strategies, including integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, are discussed, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of the species' ecology and evolution. By integrating insights from population genetics, host plant use, and mate attraction, researchers and policymakers can develop targeted management strategies to mitigate the impacts of S. frugiperda on agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.", "label": 1}
