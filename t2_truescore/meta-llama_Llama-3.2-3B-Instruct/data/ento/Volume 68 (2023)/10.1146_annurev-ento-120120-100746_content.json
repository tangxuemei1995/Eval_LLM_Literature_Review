{"grounding": "Insect eggs are exposed to a plethora of abiotic and biotic threats. Their survival depends on both an innate developmental program and genetically determined protective traits provided by the parents. In addition, there is increasing evidence that (a) parents adjust the egg phenotype to the actual needs, (b) eggs themselves respond to environmental challenges, and (c) egg-associated microbes actively shape the egg phenotype. This review focuses on the phenotypic plasticity of insect eggs and their capability to adjust themselves to their environment. We outline the ways in which the interaction between egg and environment is two-way, with the environment shaping the egg phenotype but also with insect eggs affecting their environment. Specifically, insect eggs affect plant defenses, host biology (in the case of parasitoid eggs), and insect oviposition behavior. We aim to emphasize that the insect egg, although it is a sessile life stage, actively responds to and interacts with its environment.", "generated_text": "Insect eggs exhibit adaptive plasticity in response to environmental challenges, allowing them to survive and thrive in diverse ecological conditions. This phenomenon is mediated by complex interactions between the egg's developmental biology, microbial communities, and plant hosts. Research has shown that insect eggs can modulate their phenotypic traits in response to changes in temperature, humidity, and microbial composition, thereby enhancing their defense against pathogens and predators. For instance, certain insect eggs have been found to produce antimicrobial peptides that inhibit the growth of microorganisms, while others can alter their cuticle composition to reduce water loss. Furthermore, eggs can also interact with plant hosts to acquire essential nutrients and shelter. These adaptive plasticity mechanisms enable insect eggs to colonize and establish populations in a wide range of environments, highlighting the intricate relationships between insect eggs, microorganisms, and their plant hosts. Understanding these interactions is crucial for predicting the impacts of environmental changes on insect populations and ecosystems.", "label": 0}
