{"grounding": "The use of the functional feeding group\u2013damage type system for analyzing arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants has transformed our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages by providing data, analyses, and interpretation of the local, regional, and global patterns of a 420-Myr history. The early fossil record can be used to answer major questions about the oldest evidence for herbivory, the early emergence of herbivore associations on land plants, and later expansion on seed plants. The subsequent effects of the Permian\u2013Triassic ecological crisis on herbivore diversity, the resulting formation of biologically diverse herbivore communities on gymnosperms, and major shifts in herbivory ensuing from initial angiosperm diversification are additional issues that need to be addressed. Studies ofherbivory resulting from more recent transient spikes and longer-term climate trends provide important data that are applied to current global change and include herbivore community responses to latitude, altitude, and habitat. Ongoing paleoecological themes remaining to be addressed include the antiquity of modern interactions, differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms, and origins of modern tropical forests. The expansion of databases that include a multitude of specimens; improvements in sampling strategies; development of new analytical methods; and, importantly, the ability to address conceptually stimulating ecological and evolutionary questions have provided new impetus in this rapidly advancing field.", "generated_text": "The evolution of herbivory on land is a pivotal event in the history of life on Earth, with significant implications for the development of ecosystems and the fossil record. This study examines the impact of arthropods and pathogens on fossil and modern plants, with a focus on the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. By analyzing damage types and functional feeding groups, we investigate the role of arthropods and pathogens in shaping plant evolution and diversity. Our research spans the Cretaceous-Paleogene ecologic crisis, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, and the Permian-Triassic ecologic crisis, three critical periods in Earth's history marked by significant environmental upheaval. We find that arthropods and pathogens played a crucial role in the development of herbivory on land, with evidence of damage to fossil plants dating back to the Early Paleozoic era. Our results suggest that the evolution of herbivory was a complex and multifaceted process, driven by a combination of factors including climate change, geological events, and the interactions between plants and animal herbivores. By exploring the origins and evolution of herbivory on land, this study provides new insights into the history of life on Earth and the complex relationships between plants and animals.", "label": 0}
