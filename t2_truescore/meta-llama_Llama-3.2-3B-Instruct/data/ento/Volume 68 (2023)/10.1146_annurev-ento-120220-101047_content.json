{"grounding": "Although it is generally more adaptive for insects to produce additional generations than to have longer life cycles, some insects produce one or fewer generations per year (univoltine or semivoltine life cycles, respectively). Some insects with the potential to produce multiple generations per year produce a univoltine life cycle in response to environmental conditions. Obligatory univoltine insects have a single long diapause or multiple diapauses in different seasons. Semivoltine insects have multiple diapauses in different years, a prolonged diapause for more than a year, or diapause controlled by a circannual rhythm. Diapause in these insects greatly varies among species both in the physiological mechanism and in the evolutionary background, and there is no general rule defining it. In this review, we survey the physiological control of univoltine and semivoltine insects\u2019 diapause and discuss the adaptive significance of the long life cycles. Although constraints such as slow development are sometimes responsible for these life cycles, the benefits of these life cycles can be explained by bet-hedging in many cases. We also discuss the effect of climate warming on these life cycles as a future area of research.", "generated_text": "Climate warming has been shown to disrupt the delicate balance of life cycles in various organisms, leading to changes in the timing and duration of diapause, a state of dormancy that allows individuals to survive adverse environmental conditions. This study examines the impact of climate warming on univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, focusing on the phenomenon of prolonged diapause. We review the current literature on the mechanisms underlying diapause, including the role of circannual rhythms, phenotypic plasticity, and bet-hedging strategies. Our analysis reveals that climate warming can lead to extended diapause periods, allowing individuals to delay reproduction and increase their chances of survival. However, this adaptation comes at a cost, as prolonged diapause can also lead to reduced fitness and altered phenotypes. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions between climate change, life cycle strategies, and phenotypic plasticity in understanding the impacts of warming on ecosystems. By exploring the dynamics of diapause in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the adaptive responses of organisms to climate change.", "label": 1}
