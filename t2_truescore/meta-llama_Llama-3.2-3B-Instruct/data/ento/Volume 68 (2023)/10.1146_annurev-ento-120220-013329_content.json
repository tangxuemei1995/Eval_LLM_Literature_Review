{"grounding": "Mites are masters at attaching to larger animals, often insects, in a temporary symbiosis called phoresy that allows these tiny animals to exploit patchy resources. In this article, we examine phoresy in the Acari, including those that feed on their carriers in transit, from a broad perspective. From a phylogenetic perspective, phoresy has evolved several times from free-living ancestors but also has been lost frequently. Rotting logs appear to be the first patchy resource exploited by phoretic mites, but the evolution of rapid life cycles later permitted exploitation of short-lived resources. As phoresy is a temporary symbiosis, most species have off-host interactions with their carrier. These relationships can be highly complex and context dependent but often are exploitative of the carrier's resources or progeny. Transitions from phoresy to parasitism seem widespread, but evidence for transitions from obligate phoretic parasitism to permanent parasitism is weak.", "generated_text": "Phoresy, a form of symbiotic association where one organism, the phoretic organism, rides on another, the host organism, has long been recognized as a crucial mechanism of dispersal in various Acari species. However, the nature of this relationship is often misunderstood as purely parasitic, with the phoretic organism deriving benefits at the expense of the host. This abstract reviews recent studies on phoresy in Acari, highlighting the complexity of host-pheretic relationships and the conditional nature of these associations. We discuss the various benefits that phoretic organisms can derive from host-pheretic relationships, including enhanced dispersal, increased access to new habitats, and improved survival rates. Furthermore, we examine the ways in which phoretic organisms can influence host behavior and ecology, and vice versa. Our review reveals that phoresy is a multifaceted phenomenon that challenges traditional notions of parasitism and highlights the intricate interdependencies between host and phoretic organisms.", "label": 1}
