{"grounding": "The economic and environmental threats posed by non-native forest insects are ever increasing with the continuing globalization of trade and travel; thus, the need for mitigation through effective biosecurity is greater than ever. However, despite decades of research and implementation of preborder, border, and postborder preventative measures, insect invasions continue to occur, with no evidence of saturation, and are even predicted to accelerate. In this article, we review biosecurity measures used to mitigate the arrival, establishment, spread, and impacts of non-native forest insects and possible impediments to the successful implementation of these measures. Biosecurity successes are likely under-recognized because they are difficult to detect and quantify, whereas failures are more evident in the continued establishment of additional non-native species. There are limitations in existing biosecurity systems at global and country scales (for example, inspecting all imports is impossible, no phytosanitary measures are perfect, knownunknowns cannot be regulated against, and noncompliance is an ongoing problem). Biosecurity should be a shared responsibility across countries, governments, stakeholders, and individuals.", "generated_text": "Forest insect biosecurity is a critical component of forest management, aiming to prevent the introduction and spread of non-native insect species that can cause significant economic and ecological harm. This review synthesizes existing knowledge on the processes, patterns, and predictions of forest insect biosecurity, highlighting the pitfalls and challenges associated with eradication efforts. We examine the various pathways through which non-native insect species can enter forests, including human activity, climate change, and international trade. Phytosanitary measures, such as surveillance and monitoring, are essential for early detection and rapid response to invasive species. However, the effectiveness of these measures is often hindered by inadequate funding, limited resources, and insufficient coordination among stakeholders. Our analysis reveals that a comprehensive approach to forest insect biosecurity, incorporating multiple strategies and stakeholders, is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with biological invasions. By understanding the complex dynamics of forest insect biosecurity, we can develop more effective prevention and eradication strategies to protect forest ecosystems and economies.", "label": 1}
