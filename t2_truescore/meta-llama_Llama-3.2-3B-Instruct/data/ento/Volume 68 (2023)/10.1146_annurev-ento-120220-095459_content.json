{"grounding": "Communication by substrate-borne mechanical waves is widespread in insects. The specifics of vibrational communication are related to heterogeneous natural substrates that strongly influence signal transmission. Insects generate vibrational signals primarily by tremulation, drumming, stridulation, and tymbalation, most commonly during sexual behavior but also in agonistic, social, and mutualistic as well as defense interactions and as part of foraging strategies. Vibrational signals are often part of multimodal communication. Sensilla and organs detecting substrate vibration show great diversity and primarily occur in insect legs to optimize sensitivity and directionality. In the natural environment, signals from heterospecifics, as well as social and enemy interactions within vibrational communication networks, influence signaling and behavioral strategies. The exploitation of substrate-borne vibrational signaling offers a promising application for behavioral manipulation in pest control.", "generated_text": "Vibrational signaling systems play a crucial role in insect communication, enabling the exchange of information between individuals and facilitating complex social behaviors. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the functional diversity of vibrational signaling systems in insects, highlighting the various substrates, modes, and contexts in which these signals are generated and perceived. From substrate-borne vibrations to air-borne sound waves, we examine the evolution of vibrosensory systems and their integration with other sensory modalities. Our analysis reveals the importance of multimodal signaling in pest management, where vibrational cues can be leveraged to disrupt insect social behavior and communication networks. By elucidating the functional diversity of vibrational signaling systems, this review contributes to our understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying insect communication and behavior.", "label": 1}
