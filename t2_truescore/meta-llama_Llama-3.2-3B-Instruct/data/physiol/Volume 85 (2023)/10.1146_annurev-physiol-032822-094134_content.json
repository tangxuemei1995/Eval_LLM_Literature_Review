{"grounding": "Liver regeneration occurs in response to diverse injuries and is capable of functionally reestablishing the lost parenchyma. This phenomenon has been known since antiquity, encapsulated in the Greek myth where Prometheus was to be punished by Zeus for sharing the gift of fire with humanity by having an eagle eat his liver daily, only to have the liver regrow back, thus ensuring eternal suffering and punishment. Today, this process is actively leveraged clinically during living donor liver transplantation whereby up to a two-thirds hepatectomy (resection or removal of part of the liver) on a donor is used for transplant to a recipient. The donor liver rapidly regenerates to recover the lost parenchymal mass to form a functional tissue. This astonishing regenerative process and unique capacity of the liver are examined in further detail in this review.", "generated_text": "The mammalian liver is a complex organ characterized by its unique zonation and heterogeneity, which enable it to maintain homeostasis and regenerate in response to acute and chronic injury. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cellular plasticity in liver regeneration, where hepatocytes and other liver cells undergo significant changes in gene expression and function to restore liver function. This process is mediated by a network of signaling pathways that coordinate the activation of stem cells, the proliferation of hepatocytes, and the reorganization of liver tissue. Understanding the multiple facets of cellular homeostasis and regeneration in the liver is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for liver injury and disease, including liver transplantation and regenerative medicine. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying liver regeneration has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of liver-related disorders and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 0}
