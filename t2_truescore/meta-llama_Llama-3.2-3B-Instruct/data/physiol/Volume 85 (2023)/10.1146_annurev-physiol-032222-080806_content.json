{"grounding": "The endothelium is one of the largest organ systems in the body, and data continue to emerge regarding the importance of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction in vascular aging and a range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Over the last two decades and as a process intimately related to EC dysfunction, an increasing number of studies have also implicated endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) as a potentially disease-causal pathobiologic process that is involved in a multitude of differing CVDs. However, EndMT is also involved in physiologic processes (e.g., cardiac development), and transient EndMT may contribute to vascular regeneration in certain contexts. Given that EndMT involves a major alteration in the EC-specific molecular program, and that it potentially contributes to CVD pathobiology, the clinical translation opportunities are significant, but further molecular and translational research is needed to see these opportunities realized.\n", "generated_text": "Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) is a process by which endothelial cells undergo a phenotypic transformation into mesenchymal cells, playing a critical role in both physiological and pathological conditions. In the context of cardiovascular health, EndMT has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, where it contributes to the formation of fibrous plaques and vascular remodeling. Conversely, in disease states such as heart failure and hypertension, EndMT has been linked to increased vascular stiffness and reduced vascular function. Recent studies have also highlighted the potential of EndMT as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of EndMT in health and disease, with a focus on its role in cardiovascular biology and the potential for therapeutic intervention. The implications of EndMT for cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment are discussed in detail.", "label": 1}
