{"grounding": "Insulin action is impaired in type 2 diabetes. The functions of the hormone are an integrated product of insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and insulin clearance by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation, mostly in liver (hepatocytes) and, to a lower extent, in extrahepatic peripheral tissues. Substantial evidence indicates that genetic or acquired abnormalities of insulin secretion or action predispose to type 2 diabetes. In recent years, along with the discovery of the molecular foundation of receptor-mediated insulin clearance, such as through the membrane glycoprotein CEACAM1, a consensus has begun to emerge that reduction of insulin clearance contributes to the disease process. In this review, we consider the evidence suggesting a pathogenic role for reduced insulin clearance in insulin resistance, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and type 2 diabetes.", "generated_text": "Insulin clearance, a critical determinant of glucose homeostasis, is influenced by various factors including age, ethnicity, and underlying health conditions. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, leads to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, exacerbating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This review synthesizes the current literature on insulin clearance in health and disease, highlighting the complex interplay between insulin action, insulin resistance, and NAFLD. We examine the impact of age and ethnicity on insulin clearance, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and NAFLD. Understanding the determinants of insulin clearance is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and manage insulin-related disorders, ultimately mitigating the risk of NAFLD and related metabolic complications.", "label": 1}
