{"grounding": "Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are components of plasma membranes and an efficient fuel source and also serve as metabolic regulators through FA signaling mediated by membrane FA receptors. Impaired tissue FA uptake has been linked to major complications of obesity, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Fatty acid interactions with a membrane receptor and the initiation of signaling can modify pathways related to nutrient uptake and processing, cell proliferation or differentiation, and secretion of bioactive factors. Here, we review the major membrane receptors involved in FA uptake and FA signaling. We focus on two types of membrane receptors for long-chain FAs: CD36 and the G protein\u2013coupled FA receptors FFAR1 and FFAR4. We describe key signaling pathways and metabolic outcomes for CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 and highlight the parallels that provide insight into FA regulation of cell function.", "generated_text": "Fatty acid transport and signaling play crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating physiological processes. The process of fatty acid uptake and transport is mediated by various membrane proteins, including CD36, fatty acid-binding proteins, and caveolin. The G protein-coupled receptors FFAR1 and FFAR4, also known as GPR40 and GPR120, respectively, are key players in fatty acid signaling, modulating metabolic pathways and influencing cellular responses to fatty acids. The activation of these receptors triggers a cascade of downstream signaling events, including the regulation of \u03b2-oxidation, lipid metabolism, and tissue repair. Dysregulation of fatty acid transport and signaling has been implicated in various diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of fatty acid transport and signaling is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.", "label": 0}
