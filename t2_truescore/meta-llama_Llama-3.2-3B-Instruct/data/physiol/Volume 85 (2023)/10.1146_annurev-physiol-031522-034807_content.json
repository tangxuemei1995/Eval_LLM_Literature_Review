{"grounding": "Pericytes, attached to the surface of capillaries, play an important role in regulating local blood flow. Using optogenetic tools and genetically encoded reporters in conjunction with confocal and multiphoton imaging techniques, the 3D structure, anatomical organization, and physiology of pericytes have recently been the subject of detailed examination. This work has revealed novel functions of pericytes and morphological features such as tunneling nanotubes in brain and tunneling microtubes in heart. Here, we discuss the state of our current understanding of the roles of pericytes in blood flow control in brain and heart, where functions may differ due to the distinct spatiotemporal metabolic requirements of these tissues. We also outline the novel concept of electro-metabolic signaling, a universal mechanistic framework that links tissue metabolic state with blood flow regulation by pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, with capillary KATP and Kir2.1 channels as primary sensors. Finally, we present major unresolved questions and outline how they can be addressed.", "generated_text": "Pericytes, a subtype of mural cells surrounding blood vessels, play a crucial role in regulating blood flow and metabolism in both the brain and heart. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in modulating neurovascular coupling, a process by which changes in neural activity influence blood flow and metabolic demand. In the brain, pericytes interact with astrocytes and endothelial cells to regulate the release of neurotransmitters and ions, including calcium and potassium, which are essential for neuronal function. In the heart, pericytes have been shown to influence cardiac function by modulating the activity of ion channels and affecting calcium handling. Electro-metabolic signaling pathways, involving the exchange of ions and metabolites between neurons and blood vessels, are also critical for pericyte function. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of pericyte-mediated control of blood flow and metabolism in the brain and heart, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes.", "label": 1}
