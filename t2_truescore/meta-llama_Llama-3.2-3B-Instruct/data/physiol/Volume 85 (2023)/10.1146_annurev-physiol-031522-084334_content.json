{"grounding": "Polycystin subunits can form hetero- and homotetrameric ion channels in the membranes of various compartments of the cell. Homotetrameric polycystin channels are voltage- and calcium-modulated, whereas heterotetrameric versions are proposed to be ligand- or autoproteolytically regulated. Their importance is underscored by variants associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and by vital roles in fertilization and embryonic development. The diversity in polycystin assembly and subcellular distribution allows for a multitude of sensory functions by this class of channels. In this review, we highlight their recent structural and functional characterization, which has provided a molecular blueprint to investigate the conformational changes required for channel opening in response to unique stimuli. We consider each polycystin channel type individually, discussing how they contribute to sensory cell biology, as well as their impact on the physiology of various tissues.", "generated_text": "Polycystin channel complexes, comprising polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, are crucial components of primary cilia and play a pivotal role in maintaining ciliary function and overall kidney health. Mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, encoding polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively, lead to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common inherited disorder characterized by the development of cysts in the kidneys. Recent studies have elucidated the gating mechanism of polycystin channel complexes, revealing a complex interplay between the channel's pore-forming properties and its role in mechanosensation. The primary cilium, a microtubule-based structure protruding from the cell surface, is a key site of polycystin channel complex assembly and function. Disruption of polycystin channel complexes has been implicated in various ciliopathies, highlighting the importance of these complexes in maintaining cellular homeostasis and overall health. Understanding the gating mechanism and function of polycystin channel complexes is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ADPKD and other ciliopathies.", "label": 1}
