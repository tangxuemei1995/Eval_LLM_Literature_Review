{"grounding": "Information processing imposes urgent metabolic demands on neurons, which have negligible energy stores and restricted access to fuel. Here, we discuss metabolic recruitment, the tissue-level phenomenon whereby active neurons harvest resources from their surroundings. The primary event is the neuronal release of K+ that mirrors workload. Astrocytes sense K+ in exquisite fashion thanks to their unique coexpression of NBCe1 and \u03b12\u03b22 Na+/K+ ATPase, and within seconds switch to Crabtree metabolism, involving GLUT1, aerobic glycolysis, transient suppression of mitochondrial respiration, and lactate export. The lactate surge serves as a secondary recruiter by inhibiting glucose consumption in distant cells. Additional recruiters are glutamate, nitric oxide, and ammonium, which signal over different spatiotemporal domains. The net outcome of these events is that more glucose, lactate, and oxygen are made available. Metabolic recruitment works alongside neurovascular coupling and various averaging strategies to support the inordinate dynamic range of individual neurons.", "generated_text": "Metabolic recruitment in brain tissue refers to the dynamic interplay between neurons and astrocytes in regulating energy metabolism. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the brain, play a crucial role in maintaining the metabolic homeostasis of neurons through the exchange of glucose, lactate, and oxygen. Glycolysis, the primary energy-producing pathway in neurons, is supported by the presence of mitochondria, which are also essential for the removal of lactate produced by neurons. Recent studies have shown that astrocytes can regulate the activity of neurons by modulating the availability of glucose and oxygen, thereby influencing neuronal activity and function. This metabolic recruitment mechanism is critical for maintaining proper brain function, particularly under conditions of stress or injury. Understanding the complex interactions between neurons and astrocytes in metabolic recruitment is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.", "label": 0}
