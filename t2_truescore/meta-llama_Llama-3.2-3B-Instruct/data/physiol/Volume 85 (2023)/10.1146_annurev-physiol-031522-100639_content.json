{"grounding": "Numerous trafficking and quality control pathways evolved to handle the diversity of proteins made by eukaryotic cells. However, at every step along the biosynthetic pathway, there is the potential for quality control system failure. This review focuses on the mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis. Inspired by diseases caused by misfolded proteins in the kidney (mucin 1 and uromodulin), we outline the general principles of protein biosynthesis, delineate the recognition and degradation pathways targeting misfolded proteins, and discuss the role of cargo receptors in protein trafficking and lipid homeostasis. We also discuss technical approaches including live-cell fluorescent microscopy, chemical screens to elucidate trafficking mechanisms, multiplexed single-cell CRISPR screening platforms to systematically delineate mechanisms of proteostasis, and the advancement of novel tools to degrade secretory and membrane-associated proteins. By focusing on components of trafficking that go awry, we highlight ongoing efforts to understand fundamental mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis and implications for the treatment of human proteinopathies.", "generated_text": "Protein trafficking and quality control are crucial processes in maintaining renal function and overall health. The kidney's secretory pathway, involving the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes, is responsible for the proper maturation and secretion of proteins. However, dysregulation of these processes can lead to kidney disease. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of transporters, such as the transmembrane protein family (TMED), in regulating cargo transport between compartments. The vesicular system, including endosomes and lysosomes, also plays a vital role in protein quality control and degradation. Aberrant trafficking and quality control mechanisms have been implicated in various kidney diseases, including nephrotic syndrome and chronic kidney disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying protein trafficking and quality control in the kidney and beyond is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat kidney disease. Elucidating the complex interactions between the secretory pathway, vesicles, and lysosomes will provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of kidney disease and potential therapeutic targets.", "label": 0}
