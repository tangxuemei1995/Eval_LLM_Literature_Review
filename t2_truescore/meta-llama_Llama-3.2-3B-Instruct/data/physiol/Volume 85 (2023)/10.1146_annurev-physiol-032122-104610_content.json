{"grounding": "Membrane contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM), or ER-PM junctions, are found in all eukaryotic cells. In excitable cells they play unique roles in organizing diverse forms of Ca2+ signaling as triggered by membrane depolarization. ER-PM junctions underlie crucial physiological processes such as excitation-contraction coupling, smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, and various forms of activity-dependent signaling and plasticity in neurons. In many cases the structure and molecular composition of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells comprise important regulatory feedback loops linking depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling at these sites to the regulation of membrane potential. Here, we describe recent findings on physiological roles and molecular composition of native ER-PM junctions in excitable cells. We focus on recent studies that provide new insights into canonical forms of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling occurring at junctional triads and dyads of striated muscle, as well as the diversity of ER-PM junctions in these cells and in smooth muscle and neurons.", "generated_text": "Endoplasmic reticulum\u2013plasma membrane junctions (ERPMJs) play a crucial role in regulating Ca2+ signaling in excitable cells. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ERPMJs as sites of depolarization-induced Ca2+ release, which can modulate various cellular processes. In skeletal muscle, ERPMJs facilitate the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, regulating muscle contraction. In cardiac muscle, ERPMJs contribute to the regulation of Ca2+ handling and contractility. Smooth muscle ERPMJs modulate Ca2+ entry and contraction, while in neurons, ERPMJs regulate neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. The ERPMJ-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway involves the activation of ion channels and the release of second messengers, such as inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and calcium-dependent protein kinase (CaMK). Understanding the mechanisms underlying ERPMJ-mediated Ca2+ signaling is essential for elucidating the molecular basis of excitable cell function and dysfunction, with implications for the treatment of various cardiovascular and muscular disorders.", "label": 1}
