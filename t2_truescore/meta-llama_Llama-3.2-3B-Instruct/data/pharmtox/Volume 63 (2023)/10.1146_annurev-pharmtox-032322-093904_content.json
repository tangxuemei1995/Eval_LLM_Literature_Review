{"grounding": "The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, which comprises 22 structurally related proteins, plays diverse roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and metabolism. Among them, two classical members (FGF1 and FGF4) and two endocrine members (FGF19 and FGF21) are important regulators of whole-body energy homeostasis, glucose/lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of these FGFs for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Several genetically engineered FGF19 and FGF21 analogs with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties have been developed and progressed into various stages of clinical trials. These FGF analogs are effective in alleviating hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients, whereas their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects are mildand vary greatly in different clinical trials. This review summarizes recent advances in biopharmaceutical development of FGF-based therapies against obesity-related metabolic complications, highlights major challenges in clinical implementation, and discusses possible strategies to overcome these hurdles.", "generated_text": "Obesity-related metabolic complications, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, pose a significant burden on global health. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic function. Recent studies have explored the therapeutic potential of FGF-based pharmacotherapies for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic complications. Agonistic antibodies targeting FGF receptors have shown promise in preclinical models, demonstrating improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Protein therapeutics based on FGFs have also been developed, offering a novel approach to modulate metabolic function. This review aims to summarize the current state of FGF-based pharmacotherapies for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic complications, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges of these novel therapies. The development of FGF-based treatments holds promise for the management of metabolic disorders, and further research is needed to translate these findings into clinical practice.", "label": 1}
