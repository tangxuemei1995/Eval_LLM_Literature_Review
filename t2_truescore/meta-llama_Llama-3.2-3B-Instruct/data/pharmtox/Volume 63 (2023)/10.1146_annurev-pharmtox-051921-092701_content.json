{"grounding": "Antiplatelet therapy is used in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Clopidogrel is the most widely used antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitor in clinical practice. Genetic variation in CYP2C19 may influence its enzymatic activity, resulting in individuals who are carriers of loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles and thus have reduced active clopidogrel metabolites, high on-treatment platelet reactivity, and increased ischemic risk. Prospective studies have examined the utility of CYP2C19 genetic testing to guide antiplatelet therapy, and more recently published meta-analyses suggest that pharmacogenetics represents a key treatment strategy to individualize antiplatelet therapy. Rapid genetic tests, including bedside genotyping platforms that are validated and have high reproducibility, are available to guide selection of P2Y12 inhibitors in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the background and rationale for the role of a guided antiplatelet approach to enhance patient care.", "generated_text": "The pharmacogenetics of antiplatelet therapy has emerged as a crucial aspect of precision medicine, enabling tailored treatment strategies for individuals with varying genetic profiles. This field focuses on the genetic determinants of platelet function and response to antiplatelet medications, particularly the CYP2C19 enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in metabolizing clopidogrel and prasugrel. Variants in the CYP2C19 gene have been identified as significant predictors of treatment response and adverse outcomes in patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy. Guided antiplatelet therapy, informed by pharmacogenomic testing, has been shown to improve clinical outcomes by reducing the risk of adverse events and enhancing efficacy. By integrating pharmacogenetics into clinical practice, healthcare providers can optimize antiplatelet therapy, minimize unnecessary treatment burden, and improve patient outcomes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the pharmacogenetic determinants of antiplatelet therapy and to translate these findings into clinical practice.", "label": 1}
