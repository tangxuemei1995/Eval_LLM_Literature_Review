{"grounding": "Pharmacology and toxicology are part of a much broader effort to understand the relationship between chemistry and biology. While biomedicine has necessarily focused on specific cases, typically of direct human relevance, there are real advantages in pursuing more systematic approaches to characterizing how health and disease are influenced by small molecules and other interventions. In this context, the zebrafish is now established as the representative screenable vertebrate and, through ongoing advances in the available scale of genome editing and automated phenotyping, is beginning to address systems-level solutions to some biomedical problems. The addition of broader efforts to integrate information content across preclinical model organisms and the incorporation of rigorous analytics, including closed-loop deep learning, will facilitate efforts to create systems pharmacology and toxicology with the ability to continuously optimize chemical biological interactions around societal needs. In this review, we outline progress toward this goal.", "generated_text": "Zebrafish have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional mammalian models in in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology. Their transparent nature, rapid breeding, and genetic tractability enable high-throughput screening and efficient testing of compounds. This study investigates the scalability of zebrafish as a mainstream model for in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology. We demonstrate the feasibility of using zebrafish to model human diseases and predict compound efficacy and toxicity. Our results show that zebrafish can accurately recapitulate human disease mechanisms and respond to therapeutic interventions. The use of zebrafish in in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional models, enabling the rapid identification of lead compounds and the optimization of drug development pipelines. These findings support the integration of zebrafish into mainstream in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology.", "label": 1}
