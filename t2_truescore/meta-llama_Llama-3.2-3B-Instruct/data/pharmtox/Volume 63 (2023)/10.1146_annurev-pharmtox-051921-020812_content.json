{"grounding": "Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and particulate matter, with adsorbed organic and inorganic contaminants, to which exposure is lifelong. Epidemiological studies increasingly associate air pollution with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, findings supported by experimental animal models. This breadth of neurotoxicity across these central nervous system diseases and disorders likely reflects shared vulnerability of their inflammatory and oxidative stress\u2013based mechanisms and a corresponding ability to produce brain metal dyshomeo-stasis. Future research to define the responsible contaminants of air pollution underlying this neurotoxicity is critical to understanding mechanisms of these diseases and disorders and protecting public health.", "generated_text": "Exposure to air pollution, particularly ultrafine particles and PM2.5, has been linked to various neurotoxic effects across the life span. Research has shown that early life exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ADHD and autism. Long-term exposure has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Air pollution-induced brain metal dyshomeostasis, characterized by disruptions in metal ion homeostasis, is thought to contribute to these neurotoxic effects. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the relationship between air pollution and neurotoxicity, highlighting the need for further research on the mechanisms underlying these effects.", "label": 1}
