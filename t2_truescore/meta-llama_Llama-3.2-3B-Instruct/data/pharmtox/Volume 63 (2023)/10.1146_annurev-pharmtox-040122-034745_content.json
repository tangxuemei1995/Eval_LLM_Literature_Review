{"grounding": "Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), an important intracellular second messenger, mediates cellular functional responses in all vital organs. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is one of the 11 members of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) family that specifically targets cGMP generated by nitric oxide\u2013driven activation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil and tadalafil, are widely used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and certain urological disorders. Preclinical studies have shown promising effects of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, cancer and anticancer-drug-associated cardiotoxicity, diabetes, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and other aging-related conditions. Many clinical trials with PDE5 inhibitors have focused on the potential cardiovascular, anticancer, and neurological benefits. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on PDE5 inhibitors and their potential therapeutic indications for various clinical disorders beyond erectile dysfunction.", "generated_text": "Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, particularly cGMP-specific PDE5 inhibitors, have been widely recognized for their efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction (ED). However, emerging evidence suggests that these compounds may also possess therapeutic potential for other clinical disorders. The endothelial dysfunction associated with ED is closely linked to impaired nitric oxide (NO) signaling, which is also relevant to cardioprotection and metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that cGMP-Specific PDE5 inhibitors can exert cardioprotective effects by enhancing NO-mediated vasodilation and reducing inflammation. Furthermore, these compounds have been investigated for their anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer properties, with potential applications in the treatment of various cancers. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the therapeutic potential of cGMP-Specific PDE5 inhibitors beyond ED, with a focus on endothelial dysfunction, cardioprotection, metabolic disorders, aging, and cancer.", "label": 1}
