{"grounding": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to poor functional outcomes. Methods for assessment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are now well established. In addition, there has been increasing appreciation in recent years of the additional role of social cognitive impairment in driving functional outcomes and of the contributions of sensory-level dysfunction to higher-order impairments. At the neurochemical level, acute administration of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists reproduces the pattern of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia, encouraging the development of treatments targeted at both NMDAR and its interactome. At the local-circuit level, an auditory neurophysiological measure, mismatch negativity, has emerged both as a veridical index of NMDAR dysfunction and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in schizophrenia and as a critical biomarker for early-stage translational drug development. Although no compounds have yet been approved for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, several candidates are showing promise in early-phase testing.", "generated_text": "Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, which significantly affects an individual's quality of life and functional outcomes. Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is associated with alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission, particularly in the NMDA receptor system, which plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and learning. Mismatch negativity, a neurophysiological marker of cognitive processing, is often impaired in individuals with schizophrenia. The dopamine system, which is often targeted in antipsychotic treatment, also contributes to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Recent studies have investigated the relationship between glutamate, NMDA receptor, and dopamine systems in the context of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, with a focus on the role of glutamate, NMDA receptor, and dopamine systems. The findings of this review have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve cognitive function in individuals with schizophrenia.", "label": 1}
