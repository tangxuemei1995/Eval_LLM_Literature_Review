{"grounding": "Modern antiretroviral therapy safely, potently, and durably suppresses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that, if left untreated, predictably causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which has been responsible for tens of millions of deaths globally since it was described in 1981. In one of the most extraordinary medical success stories in modern times, a combination of pioneering basic science, innovative drug development, and ambitious public health programming resulted in access to lifesaving, safe drugs, taken as an oral tablet daily, for most of the world. However, substantial challenges remain in the fields of prevention, timely access to diagnosis, and treatment, especially in pediatric and adolescent patients. As HIV-positive adults age, treating their comorbidities will require understanding the course of different chronic diseases complicated by HIV-related and antiretroviral toxicities and finding potential treatments. Finally, new long-acting antiretrovirals on the horizon promise exciting new options in both the prevention and treatment fields.", "generated_text": "The 90-90-90 initiative, a key strategy for achieving universal access to HIV treatment, aims to diagnose 90% of all people living with HIV, treat 90% of those diagnosed, and retain 90% of those on treatment. However, significant barriers to reconstitution of antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This roadmap outlines a comprehensive approach to overcome these challenges and ensure universal access to effective ART. By leveraging existing infrastructure, improving diagnostic capacity, and enhancing treatment adherence, we can accelerate the reconstitution of ART and achieve the 90-90-90 targets. Our strategy emphasizes the importance of community engagement, provider training, and policy support, highlighting the need for sustained investment and collaboration to ensure equitable access to life-saving antiretroviral treatment for all.", "label": 0}
