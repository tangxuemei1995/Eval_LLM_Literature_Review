{"grounding": "The actions of estrogens and related estrogenic molecules are complex and multifaceted in both sexes. A wide array of natural, synthetic, and therapeutic molecules target pathways that produce and respond to estrogens. Multiple receptors promulgate these responses, including the classical estrogen receptors of the nuclear hormone receptor family (estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2), which function largely as ligand-activated transcription factors, and the 7-transmembrane G protein\u2013coupled estrogen receptor, GPER, which activates a diverse array of signaling pathways. The pharmacology and functional roles of GPER in physiology and disease reveal important roles in responses to both natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds in numerous physiological systems. These functions have implications in the treatment of myriad disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. This review focuses on the complex pharmacology of GPER and summarizes major physiological functions of GPER and the therapeutic implications and ongoing applications of GPER-targeted compounds.", "generated_text": "G Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor GPER plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune functions. This receptor is activated by estrogen and mediates rapid signaling events, influencing cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular pharmacology of GPER, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for various diseases. In the context of cancer, GPER has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, while in cardiovascular diseases, it may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Conversely, GPER activation has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Moreover, its role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent for metabolic disorders. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of GPER's molecular pharmacology and its therapeutic applications, with a focus on its implications for cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.", "label": 1}
