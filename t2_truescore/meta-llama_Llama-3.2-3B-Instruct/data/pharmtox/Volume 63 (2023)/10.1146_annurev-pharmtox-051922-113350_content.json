{"grounding": "Early human life is considered a critical window of susceptibility to external exposures. Infants are exposed to a multitude of environmental factors, collectively referred to as the exposome. The chemical exposome can be summarized as the sum of all xenobiotics that humans are exposed to throughout a lifetime. We review different exposure classes and routes that impact fetal and infant metabolism and the potential toxicological role of mixture effects. We also discuss the progress in human biomonitoring and present possiblemodels for studying maternal\u2013fetal transfer. Data gaps on prenatal and infant exposure to xenobiotic mixtures are identified and include natural biotoxins, in addition to commonly reported synthetic toxicants, to obtain a more holistic assessment of the chemical exposome. We highlight the lack of large-scale studies covering a broad range of xenobiotics. Several recommendations to advance our understanding of the early-life chemical exposome and the subsequent impact on health outcomes are proposed.", "generated_text": "The chemical exposome refers to the aggregate of chemicals to which an individual is exposed throughout their lifetime, influencing health outcomes. During fetal development and early childhood, exposure to chemicals can have profound effects on growth, development, and long-term health. This review synthesizes existing literature on the chemical exposome during critical periods of development, focusing on prenatal exposure and early childhood. Xenobiotics and natural contaminants, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and endocrine disruptors, are identified as key contributors to the chemical exposome. The placenta plays a crucial role in mediating prenatal exposure, with evidence suggesting that maternal exposure to certain chemicals can alter fetal development and programming. Early childhood exposure to chemicals has also been linked to adverse health outcomes, including neurodevelopmental and respiratory problems. Understanding the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood is essential for informing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of chemical exposure and promote healthy development.", "label": 1}
