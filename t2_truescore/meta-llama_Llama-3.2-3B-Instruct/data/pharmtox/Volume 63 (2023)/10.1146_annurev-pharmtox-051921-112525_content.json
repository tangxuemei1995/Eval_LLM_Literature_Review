{"grounding": "With the worldwide increase in life span, surgical patients are becoming older and have a greater propensity for postoperative cognitive impairment, either new onset or through deterioration of an existing condition; in both conditions, knowledge of the patient's preoperative cognitive function and postoperative cognitive trajectory is imperative. We describe the clinical utility of a tablet-based technique for rapid assessment of the memory and attentiveness domains required for executive function. The pathogenic mechanisms for perioperative neurocognitive disorders have been investigated in animal models in which excessive and/or prolonged postoperative neuroinflammation has emerged as a likely contender. The cellular and molecular species involved in postoperative neuroinflammation are the putative targets for future therapeutic interventions that are efficacious and do not interfere with the surgical patient's healing process.", "generated_text": "Age-related perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCDs) pose a significant risk to postoperative outcomes, particularly in elderly patients. Experimental models have demonstrated that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the development of PNCDs, characterized by cognitive impairment and delirium. This review highlights the current understanding of PNCDs, focusing on neuroinflammation and cognitive assessment. We discuss the potential druggable targets, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapies, that may mitigate the risk of PNCDs. Furthermore, we examine the importance of care pathways in preventing and managing PNCDs, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and multidisciplinary collaboration. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions, this review aims to inform the development of effective strategies for promoting perioperative brain health and reducing the burden of PNCDs.", "label": 1}
