{"grounding": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are endogenous lipid mediators that are synthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during the acute phase or resolution phase of inflammation. Synthetic SPMs possess broad safety profiles and exhibit potent actions in resolving inflammation in preclinical models. Accumulating evidence in the past decade has demonstrated powerful analgesia of exogenous SPMs in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain. Furthermore, endogenous SPMs are produced by sham surgery and neuromodulation (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation). SPMs produce their beneficial actions through multiple G protein\u2013coupled receptors, expressed by immune cells, glial cells, and neurons. Notably, loss of SPM receptors impairs the resolution of pain. I also highlight the emerging role of SPMs in the control of itch. Pharmacological targeting of SPMs or SPM receptors has the potential to lead to novel therapeutics for pain and itch as emerging approaches in resolution pharmacology.", "generated_text": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, have emerged as key players in the resolution phase of inflammation, exhibiting potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activities. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of SPMs as resolution pharmacology for the control of pain and itch, two complex and multifaceted disorders. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly EPA and DHA, are precursors to SPMs and have been shown to modulate nociceptive sensory neurons, reducing pain and itch perception. TRP channels, involved in pain and itch sensation, are also targeted by SPMs, further supporting their therapeutic potential. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of SPMs in pain and itch resolution, with a focus on their mechanisms of action, neuroimmune modulation, and potential therapeutic applications. The integration of SPMs into pain and itch management strategies may offer novel and effective approaches to treating these debilitating conditions.", "label": 1}
