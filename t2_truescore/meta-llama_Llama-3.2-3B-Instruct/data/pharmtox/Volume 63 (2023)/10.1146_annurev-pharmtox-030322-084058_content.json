{"grounding": "The coordinated movement of organic anions (e.g., drugs, metabolites, signaling molecules, nutrients, antioxidants, gut microbiome products) between tissues and body fluids depends, in large part, on organic anion transporters (OATs) [solute carrier 22 (SLC22)], organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) [solute carrier organic (SLCO)], and multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) [ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C (ABCC)]. Depending on the range of substrates, transporters in these families can be considered multispecific, oligospecific, or (relatively) monospecific. Systems biology analyses of these transporters in the context of expression patterns reveal they are hubs in networks involved in interorgan and interorganismal communication. The remote sensing and signaling theory explains how the coordinated functions of drug transporters, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and regulatory proteins play a role in optimizing systemic and local levels of important endogenous small molecules. We focus on the role of OATs, OATPs, and MRPs in endogenous metabolism and how their substrates (e.g., bile acids, short chain fatty acids, urate, uremic toxins) mediate interorgan and interorganismal communication and help maintain and restore homeostasis in healthy and disease states.", "generated_text": "The overexpression of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) and organic anion transporting polypeptides (OAT) along with the involvement of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in the remote sensing and signaling theory has been a subject of extensive research. This theory proposes that these transporters play a crucial role in the cellular sensing and signaling pathways, influencing various physiological and pathological processes. The OATP/OAT family, including OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, has been implicated in the transport of endogenous compounds and drugs, such as bilirubin and warfarin, respectively. In contrast, the ABCC2 and ABCC4 proteins, along with the solute carrier family 22 member 6 (SLC22A6) and SLC22A8, have been shown to be involved in the transport of a wide range of compounds, including drugs and endogenous substances. The SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes encode for the liver-specific organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3, respectively, which play a critical role in the disposition of drugs such as cyclosporine and midazolam. The MRP2 and MRP4 proteins, along with BCRP, have been implicated in the transport of a variety of compounds, including drugs and endogenous substances, and have been shown to be involved in the development of multidrug resistance. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the remote sensing and signaling theory and the role of OATP/OAT and MRP transporters in this context.", "label": 1}
