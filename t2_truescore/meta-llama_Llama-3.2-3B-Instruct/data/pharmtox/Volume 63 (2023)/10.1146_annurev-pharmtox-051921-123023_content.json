{"grounding": "Ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cellular metabolism to electrical activity in multiple tissues; their unique assembly as four Kir6 pore-forming subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits has resulted in a large armory of selective channel opener and inhibitor drugs. The spectrum of monogenic pathologies that result from gain- or loss-of-function mutations in these channels, and the potential for therapeutic correction of these pathologies, is now clear. However, while available drugs can be effective treatments for specific pathologies, cross-reactivity with the other Kir6 or SUR subfamily members can result in drug-induced versions of each pathology and may limit therapeutic usefulness. This review discusses the background to KATP channel physiology, pathology, and pharmacology and considers the potential for more specific or effective therapeutic agents.", "generated_text": "Kir6.2 and Kir6.1 subunits, encoded by the ABCC8 and KCNJ2 genes, respectively, form the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel, a critical regulator of insulin secretion. Mutations in these genes have been implicated in various KATP-dependent pathologies, including congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant\u00fa syndrome. Recent advances in genetic analysis and gene editing technologies have enabled the development of personalized therapeutics for these disorders. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of KATP channel function and dysfunction, and discuss the potential of targeted therapies, including gene therapy and small molecule modulators, for the treatment of KATP-dependent pathologies. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders, we can develop effective and tailored interventions to improve patient outcomes.", "label": 0}
