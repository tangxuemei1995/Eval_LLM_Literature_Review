{"grounding": "Arsenic is a naturally occurring hazardous element that is environmentally ubiquitous in various chemical forms. Upon exposure, the human body initiates an elimination pathway of progressive methylation into relatively less bioreactive and more easily excretable pentavalent methylated forms. Given its association with decreasing the internal burden of arsenic with ensuing attenuation of its related toxicities, biomethylation has been applauded for decades as a pure route of arsenic detoxification. However, the emergence of detectable trivalent species with profound toxicity has opened a long-standing debate regarding whether arsenic methylation is a detoxifying or bioactivating mechanism. In this review, we approach the topic of arsenic metabolism from both perspectives to create a complete picture of its potential role in the mitigation or aggravation of various arsenic-related pathologies.", "generated_text": "Arsenic metabolism is a complex process involving the transformation of inorganic arsenic into its more toxic and less soluble forms, which can lead to severe health consequences. The duality of arsenic metabolism is characterized by the interplay between methylation and demethylation reactions, with methylation being the primary detoxification pathway. However, aberrant methylation patterns can result in the formation of highly toxic methylated arsenic species, such as monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid. This review highlights the impact of arsenic metabolism on human health, with a focus on the role of speciation and the consequences of disrupted detoxification mechanisms. Understanding the intricacies of arsenic metabolism is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate arsenic-induced toxicity and promote human health.", "label": 0}
