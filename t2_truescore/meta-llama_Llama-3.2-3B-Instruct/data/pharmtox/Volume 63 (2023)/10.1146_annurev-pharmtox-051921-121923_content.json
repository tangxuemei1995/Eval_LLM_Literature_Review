{"grounding": "Phosphatases and kinases maintain an equilibrium of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins, respectively, that are required for critical cellular functions. Imbalance in this equilibrium or irregularity in their function causes unfavorable cellular effects that have been implicated in the development of numerous diseases. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) catalyze the dephosphorylation of protein substrates on tyrosine residues, and their involvement in cell signaling and diseases such as cancer and inflammatory and metabolic diseases has made them attractive therapeutic targets. However, PTPs have proved challenging in therapeutics development, garnering them the unfavorable reputation of being undruggable. Nonetheless, great strides have been made toward the inhibition of PTPs over the past decade. Here, we discuss the advancement in small-molecule inhibition for the PTP subfamily known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs). We review strategies and inhibitor discovery tools that have proven successful for small-molecule inhibition of the MKPs and discuss what the future of MKP inhibition potentially might yield.", "generated_text": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases: No Longer Undruggable?Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases (MKPs) are a family of enzymes that regulate the activity of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), crucial components of cell signaling pathways. Traditionally considered undruggable due to their complex structures and high specificity, recent advances in structural biology and medicinal chemistry have opened new avenues for the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting MKPs. Dual specificity protein phosphatases (DUSPs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are also MKP family members that have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorders. The discovery of allosteric sites on MKPs has enabled the design of novel, non-competitive inhibitors that can modulate their activity. This review highlights the recent progress in MKP inhibition, with a focus on the design and optimization of small molecule inhibitors, and discusses the potential therapeutic applications of MKP-targeting therapies in various diseases. The development of MKP inhibitors has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cell signaling and disease mechanisms, and may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of complex diseases.", "label": 1}
