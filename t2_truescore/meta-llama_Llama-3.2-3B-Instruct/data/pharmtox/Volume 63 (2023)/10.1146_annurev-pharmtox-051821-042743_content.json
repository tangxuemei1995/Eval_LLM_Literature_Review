{"grounding": "Chronic diseases that affect our society are made more complex by comorbidities and are poorly managed by the current pharmacology. While all present inflammatory etiopathogeneses, there is an unmet need for better clinical management of these diseases and their multiple symptoms. We discuss here an innovative approach based on the biology of the resolution of inflammation. Studying endogenous pro-resolving peptide and lipid mediators, how they are formed, and which target they interact with, can offer innovative options through augmenting the expression or function of pro-resolving pathways or mimicking their actions with novel targeted molecules. In all cases, resolution offers innovation for the treatment of the primary cause of a given disease and/or for the management of its comorbidities, ultimately improving patient quality of life. By implementing resolution pharmacology, we harness the whole physiology of inflammation, with the potential to bring a marked change in the management of inflammatory conditions.", "generated_text": "The resolution of inflammation is a critical process that follows the resolution of acute inflammation, characterized by the clearance of inflammatory cells and the restoration of tissue homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (sPLMs) and annexin A1 peptides in this process. Annexin A1, a protein that regulates the inflammatory response, has been shown to induce the production of sPLMs, which in turn promote the resolution of inflammation. This review focuses on the role of annexin A1 and sPLMs, including lipoxins, protectins, and resolvins, in the resolution of inflammation. We discuss the therapeutic potential of these molecules, including their use in treating inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Our review highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms of action of annexin A1 and sPLMs, and their potential as novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.", "label": 0}
