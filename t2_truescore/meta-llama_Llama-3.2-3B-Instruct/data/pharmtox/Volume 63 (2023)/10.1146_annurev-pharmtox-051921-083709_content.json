{"grounding": "After a traumatic childhood in Europe during the Second World War, I found that scientific research in Israel was a pleasure beyond my expectations. Over the last 65 year, I have worked on the chemistry and pharmacology of natural products. During the last few decades, most of my research has been on plant cannabinoids, the endogenous cannabinoids arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, and endogenous anandamide-like compounds, all of which are involved in a wide spectrum of physiological reactions. Two plant cannabinoids, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, are approved drugs. However, the endogenous cannabinoids and the anandamide-like constituents have not yet been well investigated in humans. For me, intellectual freedom\u2014the ability to do research based on my own scientific interests\u2014has been the most satisfying part of my working life. Looking back over the 91 years of my long life, I conclude that I have been lucky, very lucky, both personally and scientifically.", "generated_text": "This review delves into the intricate world of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid chemistry and pharmacology, tracing the evolutionary journey of these compounds from their discovery to their current understanding. The endocannabinoid system, comprising anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), plays a pivotal role in maintaining physiological homeostasis. The introduction of synthetic cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), has expanded our knowledge of the system's complexity. Recent studies have also shed light on the existence of endocannabinoid-like compounds, which exhibit similar pharmacological properties to their endogenous counterparts. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid research, highlighting the significance of these compounds in various physiological processes and their potential therapeutic applications. By exploring the intersection of chemistry, pharmacology, and biology, this review seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the endocannabinoid system and its role in maintaining human health.", "label": 0}
