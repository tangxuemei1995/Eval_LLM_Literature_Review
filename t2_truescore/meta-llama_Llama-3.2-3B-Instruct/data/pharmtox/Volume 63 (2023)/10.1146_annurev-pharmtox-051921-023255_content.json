{"grounding": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in pharmaceutical research and development has to date focused on research: target identification; docking-, fragment-, and motif-based generation of compound libraries; modeling of synthesis feasibility; rank-ordering likely hits according to structural and chemometric similarity to compounds having known activity and affinity to the target(s); optimizing a smaller library for synthesis and high-throughput screening; and combining evidence from screening to support hit-to-lead decisions. Applying AI/ML methods to lead optimization and lead-to-candidate (L2C) decision-making has shown slower progress, especially regarding predicting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology properties. The present review surveys reasons why this is so, reports progress that has occurred in recent years, and summarizes some of the issues that remain. Effective AI/ML tools to derisk L2C and later phases of development are important to accelerate the pharmaceutical development process, ameliorate escalating development costs, and achieve greater success rates.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has revolutionized the lead-to-candidate decision-making process in drug discovery, enabling the prediction of decision quality and the identification of optimal candidates. By leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms, AI-ML models can accurately forecast the efficacy and safety of potential drug candidates, reducing the reliance on traditional high-throughput screening methods. Furthermore, computational toxicology has been significantly enhanced through the application of AI-ML, allowing for the prediction of adverse effects and the identification of potential toxicities. This synergy between AI-ML and computational toxicology has the potential to accelerate the drug discovery process, improve decision quality, and ultimately lead to the development of safer and more effective medications. By harnessing the power of AI-ML, researchers can optimize the lead-to-candidate decision-making process and drive innovation in the field of drug discovery.", "label": 0}
