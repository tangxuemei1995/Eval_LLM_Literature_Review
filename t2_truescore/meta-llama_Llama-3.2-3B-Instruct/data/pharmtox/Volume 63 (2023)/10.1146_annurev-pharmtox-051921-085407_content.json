{"grounding": "Inflammation and its timely resolution are critical to ensure effective host defense and appropriate tissue repair after injury and or infection. Chronic, unresolved inflammation typifies many prevalent pathologies. The key mediators that initiate and drive the inflammatory response are well defined and targeted by conventional anti-inflammatory therapeutics. More recently, there is a growing appreciation that specific mediators, including arachidonate-derived lipoxins, are generated in self-limiting inflammatory responses to promote the resolution of inflammation and endogenous repair mechanisms without compromising host defense. We discuss the proresolving biological actions of lipoxins and recent efforts to harness their therapeutic potential through the development of novel, potent lipoxin mimetics generated via efficient, modular stereoselective synthetic pathways. We consider the evidence that lipoxin mimetics may have applications in limiting inflammation and reversing fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms.", "generated_text": "Lipoxins, naturally occurring anti-inflammatory mediators, have been recognized for their potent role in resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair. Recent studies have focused on the development of lipoxin mimetics, synthetic compounds designed to replicate the biological activities of lipoxins. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of lipoxin mimetics, particularly AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT, in resolving inflammation and mitigating fibrosis. By modulating the inflammatory response and promoting the resolution of inflammation, lipoxin mimetics have shown promise in treating various inflammatory diseases, including asthma, arthritis, and cardiovascular disorders. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of action and optimize the therapeutic potential of these compounds, but the existing evidence suggests that lipoxin mimetics may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.", "label": 1}
