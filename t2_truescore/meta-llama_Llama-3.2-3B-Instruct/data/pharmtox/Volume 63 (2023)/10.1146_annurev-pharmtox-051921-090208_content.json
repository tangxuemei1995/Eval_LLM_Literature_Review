{"grounding": "The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are found in seafood, supplements, and concentrated pharmaceutical preparations. Prospective cohort studies demonstrate an association between higher intakes of EPA+DHA or higher levels of EPA and DHA in the body and lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and of cardiovascular mortality in the general population. The cardioprotective effect of EPA and DHA is due to the beneficial modulation of a number of risk factors for CVD. Some large trials support the use of EPA+DHA (or EPA alone) in high-risk patients, although the evidence is inconsistent. This review presents key studies of EPA and DHA in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD, briefly describes potential mechanisms of action, and discusses recently published RCTs and meta-analyses. Potential adverse aspects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in relation to CVD are discussed.", "generated_text": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their potential benefits on cardiovascular health. The consumption of LC-PUFAs, commonly found in fish oil supplements, has been associated with reduced risk of heart disease, improved lipid profiles, and decreased inflammation. However, the evidence also suggests potential drawbacks, including increased risk of bleeding, interactions with anticoagulant medications, and adverse effects on fetal development during pregnancy. Furthermore, the variability in EPA and DHA content among different fish oil products and the lack of standardization in dosing regimens have raised concerns about the efficacy and safety of LC-PUFA supplements. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the pros and cons of LC-PUFAs in cardiovascular health, highlighting the need for further research to establish optimal dosing and supplementation guidelines.", "label": 1}
