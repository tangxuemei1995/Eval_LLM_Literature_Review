{"grounding": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a chemically diverse group of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) that target the endocannabinoid system, triggering a plethora of actions (e.g., elevated mood sensation, relaxation, appetite stimulation) that resemble, but are more intense than, those induced by cannabis. Although some of these effects have been explored for therapeutic applications, anticipated stronger psychoactive effects than cannabis and reduced risk perception have increased the recreational use of SCs, which have dominated the NPS market in the United States and Europe over the past decade. However, rising SC-related intoxications and deaths represent a major public health concern and embody a major challenge for policy makers.\nHere, we review the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs. A thorough characterization of SCs\u2019 pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics is important to better understand the main mechanisms underlying acute and chronic effects of SCs, interpret the clinical/pathological findings related to SC use, and improve SC risk awareness.", "generated_text": "Synthetic cannabinoids, also known as designer drugs or Spice, have gained significant attention in recent years due to their increasing prevalence and associated health risks. These novel psychoactive substances (NPS) mimic the effects of the endocannabinoid system, but with unpredictable and often severe pharmacological and toxicological profiles. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological mechanisms and toxicological effects of synthetic cannabinoids, highlighting their potential for abuse and dependence. The literature reveals that these substances can cause a range of adverse effects, including psychosis, seizures, and cardiovascular instability. Furthermore, the lack of regulation and quality control in the production of synthetic cannabinoids has led to a proliferation of contaminated products, exacerbating substance use disorders. This review aims to provide a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge on synthetic cannabinoids, informing evidence-based strategies for prevention, treatment, and policy development.", "label": 1}
