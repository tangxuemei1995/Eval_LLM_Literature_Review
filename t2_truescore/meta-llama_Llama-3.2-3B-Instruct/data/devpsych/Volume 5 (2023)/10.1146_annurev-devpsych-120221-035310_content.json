{"grounding": "Cognitive flexibility, or the ability to mentally switch between tasks according to changing environmental demands, supports optimal life outcomes, making it an important executive function to study across development. Here we review the literature examining the development of cognitive flexibility, with an emphasis on studies using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The neuroimaging literature suggests that key brain regions important for cognitive flexibility include the inferior frontal junction and regions within the midcingulo-insular network, including the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices. We further discuss challenges surrounding studying cognitive flexibility during neurodevelopment, including inconsistent terminology, the diversity of fMRI task paradigms, difficulties with isolating cognitive flexibility from other executive functions, and accounting for developmental changes in cognitive strategy. Future directions include assessing how developmental changes in brain network dynamics enable cognitive flexibility and examining potential modulators of cognitive flexibility including physical activity and bilingualism.", "generated_text": "Cognitive flexibility, a critical component of executive function, refers to the ability to adapt to changing situations and switch between tasks. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have enabled researchers to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility in development. This review updates the current state of knowledge on the developmental trajectory of cognitive flexibility, from infancy to adolescence, and highlights the key brain regions and networks involved. Functional task-based fMRI studies have shown that cognitive flexibility is associated with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex. The findings suggest that cognitive flexibility develops in a step-wise manner, with significant improvements during childhood and adolescence. Future directions for research include the examination of individual differences in cognitive flexibility, the investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility in neurodevelopmental disorders, and the development of novel fMRI-based interventions to enhance cognitive flexibility in clinical populations.", "label": 1}
