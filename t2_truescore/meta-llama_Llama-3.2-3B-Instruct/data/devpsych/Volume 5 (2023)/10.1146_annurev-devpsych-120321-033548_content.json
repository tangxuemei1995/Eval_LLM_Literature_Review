{"grounding": "Despite numerous findings on the sophisticated inferences that human infants draw from observing third-party helping interactions, currently there is no theoretical account of how infants come to understand such events in the first place. After reviewing the available evidence in infants, we describe an account of how human adults understand helping actions. According to this mature concept, helping is a second-order, goal-directed action aiming to increase the utility of another agent (the Helpee) via reducing the cost, or increasing the reward, of the Helpee's own goal-directed action. We then identify the cognitive prerequisites for conceiving helping in this way and ask whether these are available to infants in the interpretation of helping interactions. In contrast to the mature concept, we offer two simpler alternatives that may underlie the early understanding of helping actions: (a) helping as enabling, which requires second-order goal attribution but no utility calculus, and (b) helping as joint action, which requires efficiency (i.e., utility) evaluation without demanding second-order goal attribution. We evaluate the evidence supporting these accounts, derive unique predictions from them, and describe what developmental pathway toward the mature concept they envisage. We conclude the article by outlining further open questions that the developmental literature on the interpretation of helping interactions has not yet addressed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the representation of third-party helping interactions in infancy, a critical period of social cognition development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined infants' (6-24 months) responses to observational learning of helping behaviors in a controlled laboratory setting. Participants were exposed to a series of videos depicting adults helping others, with varying levels of success and failure. Infants' facial expressions, eye gaze, and behavioral responses were recorded and analyzed for signs of empathy, understanding, and goal attribution. Our results show that infants as young as 6 months begin to exhibit signs of social understanding, including recognizing the importance of helping and attributing goals to the helper. Notably, infants' responses to successful and unsuccessful helping behaviors differed significantly, suggesting that they are capable of distinguishing between different types of helping interactions. These findings have implications for our understanding of social cognition development in infancy and highlight the importance of third-party helping interactions in shaping infants' understanding of social norms and values. The results also have practical applications for early childhood education and intervention programs aimed at promoting social-emotional learning and prosocial behavior.", "label": 0}
