{"grounding": "In the United States, race is a critical factor in determining how children experience and navigate their social worlds. Developmental scientists have examined the complexities and nuances of how children develop an understanding of what race means for them and others as well as their attitudes toward people of other racial groups. We provide an overview of the literature on two approaches to understanding children's racial learning\u2014sociocognitive approaches, which focus on various aspects of children's understanding of, beliefs about, and attitudes toward race and racial groups, and socialization perspectives, which examine the messages that socialization agents transmit to children about race. Throughout, we highlight the ways in which the persistence of structural and interpersonal racism in the United States forms the background context for children's racial learning.", "generated_text": "This study integrates research on cognitive mechanisms and socialization to examine how children learn and internalize racial attitudes and stereotypes. Drawing on theories of socialization and cognitive development, we investigate the role of ethnic-racial socialization in shaping children's racial learning. Our analysis of existing literature reveals that children's racial learning is influenced by both cognitive processes, such as schema formation and categorization, and socialization experiences, including interactions with family members and peers. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of racial socialization and its impact on children's racial attitudes and behaviors. The study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between cognitive mechanisms and socialization in the context of ethnic-racial socialization.", "label": 0}
