{"grounding": "Intimate relationships are hotbeds of emotion. This article presents key findings and current directions in research on couples\u2019 emotion regulation across adulthood as a critical context in which older adults not only maintain functioning but may also outshine younger adults. First, I introduce key concepts, defining qualities (i.e., dynamic, coregulatory, bidirectional, bivalent), and measures (i.e., self-report versus performance-based) of couples\u2019 emotion regulation. Second, I highlight a socioemotional turn in our understanding of adult development with the advent of socioemotional selectivity theory. Third, I offer a life-span developmental perspective on emotion regulation in couples (i.e., across infancy, adolescence and young adulthood, midlife, and late life). Finally, I present the idea that emotion regulation may shift from \u201cme to us\u201d across adulthood and discuss how emotion regulation in couples may become more important, better, and increasingly consequential (e.g., for relationship outcomes, well-being, and health) with age. Ideas for future research are then discussed.", "generated_text": "This study examines the dynamics of emotion regulation in couples across adulthood, with a particular focus on the impact of aging on emotional expression and conflict resolution. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 100 couples aged 40-75. Results indicate that couples' emotion regulation strategies evolve across adulthood, with younger couples relying more on expressive emotional expression and older couples employing more suppressive strategies. Notably, couples' emotion regulation was found to be influenced by age-related changes in emotional experience, social support, and relationship satisfaction. Qualitative findings suggest that couples' ability to regulate emotions together is crucial for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between emotion regulation, aging, and relationship dynamics, highlighting the importance of emotional intelligence and communication in couples' relationships across adulthood.", "label": 0}
