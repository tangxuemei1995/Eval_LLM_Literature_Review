{"grounding": "Cognitive control is defined as a set of processes required for the organization of goal-directed thoughts and actions. It is linked to success throughout life including health, wealth, and social capital. How to support the development of cognitive control is therefore an intensively discussed topic. Progress in understanding how this critical life skill can be optimally scaffolded in long-lasting ways has been disappointing. I argue that this effort has been hampered by the predominant perspective that cognitive control is a competence or ability, the development of which is driven by predetermined maturational sequences. I propose that this traditional view needs to be overhauled in light of a growing body of evidence suggesting that cognitive control allocation is a both highly dynamic and rational process subject to cost\u2013benefit analyses from early in development. I discuss the ramifications of shifting our perspective on cognitive control mechanisms in relation to how we design interventions. I close by spelling out new avenues for scientific inquiry.", "generated_text": "This study presents a rational account of cognitive control development in childhood, positing that competence in executive functions emerges through a process of maturation driven by the optimization of expected value. According to this framework, children's cognitive control abilities develop as they learn to weigh the potential costs and benefits of different actions, leading to the refinement of their decision-making processes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key milestones in cognitive control development, including the emergence of inhibitory control, working memory, and planning. Our rational account is grounded in the principles of expected value theory, which suggests that children's choices are influenced by the anticipated outcomes of their actions. By integrating insights from cognitive psychology, developmental neuroscience, and decision theory, this study provides a unified explanation for the development of cognitive control in childhood, highlighting the critical role of expected value in shaping children's competence in executive functions.", "label": 0}
