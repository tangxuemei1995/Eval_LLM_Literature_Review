{"grounding": "Poverty is associated with changes in brain development and elevates the risk for psychopathology in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Although the field is rapidly expanding, there are methodological challenges that raise questions about the validity of current findings. These challenges include the interrelated issues of reliability, effect size, interindividual heterogeneity, and replicability. To address these issues, we propose a multipronged approach that spans short-, medium-, and long-term solutions, including changes to data pipelines along with more comprehensive data acquisition of environment, brain, and mental health. Additional suggestions are to use open science approaches, more robust statistical analyses, and replication testing. Furthermore, we propose increased integration between advanced analytical approaches using large samples and neuroscience models in intervention research to enhance the interpretability of findings. Collectively, these approaches will expand the application of neuroimaging findings and provide a foundation for eventual policy changes designed to improve conditions for children in poverty.", "generated_text": "Poverty, a pervasive and complex social issue, has been increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of brain development and mental health outcomes. Research has consistently shown that individuals from impoverished backgrounds exhibit altered brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in emotional regulation, stress response, and cognitive control. Neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between poverty and mental health, highlighting the role of adversity in shaping brain development. However, concerns regarding the replicability and reproducibility of these findings have hindered the translation of research into effective interventions. This review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge on the intersection of poverty, brain development, and mental health, with a focus on identifying progress, challenges, and potential paths forward for addressing these complex issues. By examining the empirical evidence and methodological limitations, this review seeks to inform the development of evidence-based interventions that can mitigate the negative effects of poverty on brain development and mental health outcomes.", "label": 1}
