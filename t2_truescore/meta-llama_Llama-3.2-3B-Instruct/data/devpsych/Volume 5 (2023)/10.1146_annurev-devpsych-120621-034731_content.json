{"grounding": "All human societies are permeated by collectively shared entities that govern daily social interactions and promote coordination and cooperation: norms. While the study of norm development is not new to developmental psychology, it has only recently been the target of an interdisciplinary wave of research using new methodologies and (often) complementary theoretical accounts to describe and explain the origins and potentially species-unique aspects of human norm psychology. Here we review recent developmental research showing that young children swiftly acquire and infer norms in a variety of social contexts. Moreover, children actively enforce these norms, even as unaffected bystanders, when third parties do things the wrong way. This research suggests that the foundations of human norm psychology can be found in early childhood. Deeper insights into the ontogenetic roots of norm psychology may contribute to understanding the evolutionary emergence of human cooperation and its maintenance in the contemporary world.", "generated_text": "This study examines the acquisition and application of norms in young children, exploring the role of social-cognitive development in shaping their understanding of moral and social expectations. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative data from a sample of 100 children aged 3-6 years. Results indicate that children's understanding of norms develops rapidly during this period, with significant improvements in norm recognition and application between 4-6 years of age. Observational data revealed that children's behavior is influenced by both explicit and implicit norms, with explicit norms (e.g., rules) playing a more significant role in early childhood. The findings have implications for our understanding of social-cognitive development and the role of normativity in shaping children's moral and social behaviors. The study contributes to the existing literature on norm psychology and social-cognitive development, highlighting the importance of considering both explicit and implicit norms in understanding children's acquisition and application of norms.", "label": 0}
