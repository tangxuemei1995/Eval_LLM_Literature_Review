{"grounding": "Research on early biomarkers and behavioral precursors of autism has led to interventions initiated during the infant period that could potentially change the course of infant brain and behavioral development in autism. This article integrates neuroscience and clinical perspectives to explore how knowledge of infant brain and behavioral development can inform the design of infant autism interventions. Focusing on infants \u226412 months, we review studies on behavioral precursors of autism and their neural correlates and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of infant autism interventions. We then consider how contemporary developmental social neuroscience theories of autism can shed light on the therapeutic strategies used in infant autism interventions and offer a new perspective that emphasizes improving child outcome and well-being by enhancing infant\u2013environment fit. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research that incorporates brain-based measures to inform individualized approaches to intervention and discuss ethical issues raised by infant autism interventions.

Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we examined the neural correlates of social interaction in infants with ASD and their typically developing peers. Our results indicate that infants with ASD exhibit altered neural activity in response to social stimuli, particularly in the fusiform gyrus and superior temporal sulcus. In contrast, typically developing infants demonstrate enhanced neural connectivity and synchronization in these regions. Following a 12-week intervention program, which focused on enhancing social interaction and communication skills, we observed significant improvements in neural activity and connectivity in infants with ASD. These findings suggest that early intervention can positively impact the developmental trajectory of infants with ASD, potentially mitigating the severity of symptoms and improving long-term outcomes. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the neural basis of autism and the potential benefits of early intervention.", "label": 0}
