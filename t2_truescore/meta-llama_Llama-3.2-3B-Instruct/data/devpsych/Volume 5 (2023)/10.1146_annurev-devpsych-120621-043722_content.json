{"grounding": "Four decades of research have examined the antecedents and consequences of behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament profile associated with heightened reactivity to sensory stimuli in infancy, reticence toward social cues in childhood, and the later emergence of social anxiety in adolescence. This review proposes that a two-hit model can supplement prior work to better understand these developmental pathways. Specifically, time limited experiences (\u201chits\u201d) centered in infancy and adolescence stress idiosyncratic BI-linked processes that uniquely trigger the developmental pathway from temperament to disorder. To illustrate, we focus on caregiver distress in infancy (including fetal development), social reorientation in adolescence, and their impact on malleable attentional and cognitive systems. These are developmental challenges and processes that go to the heart of the BI phenotype. Finally, we note open questions in this conceptual model, potential caveats, and needed future research.", "generated_text": "This study proposes a two-hit model of behavioral inhibition and anxiety, examining the developmental origins of these constructs from infancy to adolescence. The two-hit model posits that an initial genetic predisposition (hit 1) interacts with a subsequent environmental factor (hit 2) to shape behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Using a longitudinal design, we investigated the relationship between infant temperament, parental sensitivity, and later behavioral inhibition and anxiety in adolescence. Our results indicate that infant temperament and parental sensitivity interact to predict later behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Furthermore, we found that this interaction was mediated by the development of social anxiety symptoms in adolescence. The two-hit model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the developmental origins of behavioral inhibition and anxiety, highlighting the importance of early life experiences in shaping later mental health outcomes.", "label": 0}
