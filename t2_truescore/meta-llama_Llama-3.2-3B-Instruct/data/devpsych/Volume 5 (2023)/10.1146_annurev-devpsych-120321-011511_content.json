{"grounding": "Adolescence is a period of life that encompasses biological maturation and profound change in social roles. It is also a period associated with the onset of mental health problems. The field of developmental cognitive neuroscience has advanced our understanding of the development of the brain within its immediate social and cultural context. In a time of rising rates of mental health problems among adolescents across the globe, it is important to understand how the wider societal, structural, and cultural contexts of young people are impacting their biological and social-cognitive maturation. In this article, we review the landscape of youth mental health and brain development during adolescence and consider the potential role of brain research in understanding the effects of current social determinants of adolescent mental health, including socioeconomic inequality, city living, and eco-anxiety about the climate crisis.", "generated_text": "This study adopts a neuroecosocial perspective to explore the intersections of adolescent development, mental health, and social inequalities in the context of urbanicity and the climate crisis. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, combining youth-led research methods and quantitative data analysis, the study investigates how adolescents navigate the complexities of growing up amidst environmental degradation and social injustices. The findings highlight the disproportionate impact of climate-related stressors on the mental health of urban adolescents from marginalized communities, exacerbating existing social inequalities. The study's results underscore the need for context-specific, youth-led interventions that address the interplay between neuroecological factors, social determinants, and climate change, ultimately promoting more equitable and sustainable adolescent development pathways.", "label": 0}
