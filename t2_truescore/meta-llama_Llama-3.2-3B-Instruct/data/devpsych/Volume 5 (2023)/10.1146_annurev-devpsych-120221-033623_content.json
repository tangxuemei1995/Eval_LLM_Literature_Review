{"grounding": "Life-course epidemiologists have developed sophisticated models for how exposures throughout life\u2014from gestation to old age\u2014shape health, sometimes years after the exposure occurred. The field, however, has been slow to adopt robust causal inference methods, including quasi-experimental designs. This reflects, at least in part, a tension between (a) study designs that maximize our ability to make causal claims and (b) exposure operationalizations that correspond with life-course theories. In this narrative review, we attempt to mitigate that tension. We first discuss the unique challenges for causal inference in life-course epidemiology. We then outline how quasi-experimental methods have already contributed to testing life-course theories, as well as the limitations of the quasi-experimental methods therein. We close with solutions that bridge the gap between modern developments in causal inference and life-course epidemiology, including redefined estimands to maximize public health impact; marginal structural and structural nested models; longitudinal instrumental variables approaches; leveraging new data linkages, such as with detailed residential histories; and triangulation across methods, including adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference.", "generated_text": "Life-course epidemiology and causal inference are two distinct yet interconnected approaches to understanding the relationships between early life experiences and later life outcomes. Life-course epidemiology examines the dynamics of health and disease across the lifespan, often using longitudinal data to identify patterns and trends. In contrast, causal inference seeks to establish the direction and magnitude of causal relationships between early life exposures and later life outcomes. However, these approaches often diverge in their methodologies and assumptions, leading to tensions and challenges in integrating them. This study aims to bridge this divide by developing a novel framework that integrates life-course epidemiological methods with causal inference techniques. By leveraging natural experiments and quantitative methods, we demonstrate the feasibility of using life-course data to estimate causal effects and provide new insights into the relationships between early life experiences and later life outcomes. Our findings have implications for the development of evidence-based policies and interventions aimed at promoting health and well-being across the lifespan.", "label": 0}
