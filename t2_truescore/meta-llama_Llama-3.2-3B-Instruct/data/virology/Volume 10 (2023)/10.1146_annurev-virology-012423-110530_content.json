{"grounding": "The global rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and the waning efficacy of antibiotics urge consideration of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Phage therapy is a classic approach where bacteriophages (bacteria-specific viruses) are used against bacterial infections, with many recent successes in personalized medicine treatment of intractable infections. However, a perpetual challenge for developing generalized phage therapy is the expectation that viruses will exert selection for target bacteria to deploy defenses against virus attack, causing evolution of phage resistance during patient treatment. Here we review the two main complementary strategies for mitigating bacterial resistance in phage therapy: minimizing the ability for bacterial populations to evolve phage resistance and driving (steering) evolution of phage-resistant bacteria toward clinically favorable outcomes. We discuss future research directions that might further address the phage-resistance problem, to foster widespread development and deployment of therapeutic phage strategies that outsmart evolved bacterial resistance in clinical settings.", "generated_text": "The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to global public health, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Phage therapy, which harnesses the antimicrobial properties of bacteriophages, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria has compromised the efficacy of this approach. This study investigates the evolutionary trade-offs underlying the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria and explores strategies to overcome these limitations. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and phenotypic changes associated with phage resistance in various bacterial species. Our results reveal that phage-resistant bacteria often exhibit increased virulence and altered metabolic pathways, highlighting the need for phage therapy to be tailored to the specific bacterial species and strain. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of phage resistance and identifying effective countermeasures, we aim to develop phage therapy that can effectively combat the evolving threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.", "label": 1}
