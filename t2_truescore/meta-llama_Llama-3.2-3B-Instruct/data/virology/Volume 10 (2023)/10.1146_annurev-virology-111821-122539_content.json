{"grounding": "The large genetic and structural divergences between plants and fungi may hinder the transmission of viruses between these two kingdoms to some extent. However, recent accumulating evidence from virus phylogenetic analyses and the discovery of naturally occurring virus cross-infection suggest the occurrence of past and current transmissions of viruses between plants and plant-associated fungi. Moreover, artificial virus inoculation experiments showed that diverse plant viruses can multiply in fungi and vice versa. Thus, virus cross-infection between plants and fungi may play an important role in the spread, emergence, and evolution of both plant and fungal viruses and facilitate the interaction between them. In this review, we summarize current knowledge related to cross-kingdom virus infection in plants and fungi and further discuss the relevance of this new virological topic in the context of understanding virus spread and transmission in nature as well as developing control strategies for crop plant diseases.", "generated_text": "Cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to facilitate the transmission of viruses between disparate kingdoms. This phenomenon, known as cross-kingdom infection, can occur through various mechanisms, including extracellular transfer and virus-virus interaction. Plant viruses, such as tobacco rattle virus, have been shown to infect fungal hosts, while fungal viruses, like those belonging to the family Reoviridae, can infect plant hosts. The transmission of plant viruses to fungal hosts can be mediated by insect vectors, water droplets, or direct contact. Conversely, fungal viruses can also be transmitted to plants through similar routes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cross-kingdom interactions is crucial for the development of novel biocontrol strategies, which could potentially exploit these interactions to control the spread of plant viruses. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex relationships between plant and fungal viruses and to explore their potential applications in plant virus management.", "label": 1}
