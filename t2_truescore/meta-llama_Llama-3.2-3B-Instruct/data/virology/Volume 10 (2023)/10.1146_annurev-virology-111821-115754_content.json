{"grounding": "The mammalian gastrointestinal tract (GIT) hosts a diverse and highly active microbiota composed of bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses. Studies of the GIT microbiota date back more than a century, although modern techniques, including mouse models, sequencing technology, and novel therapeutics in humans, have been foundational to our understanding of the roles of commensal microbes in health and disease. Here, we review the impacts of the GIT microbiota on viral infection, both within the GIT and systemically. GIT-associated microbes and their metabolites alter the course of viral infection through a variety of mechanisms, including direct interactions with virions, alteration of the GIT landscape, and extensive regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Mechanistic understanding of the full breadth of interactions between the GIT microbiota and the host is still lacking in many ways but will be vital for the development of novel therapeutics for viral and nonviral diseases alike.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between the microbiota and viral infections has garnered significant attention in recent years. Recent studies have demonstrated that the microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating the host immune response to viral infections. The production of metabolites by the microbiota has been shown to influence the production of interferon, a key cytokine involved in antiviral defense. Furthermore, the microbiome has been found to regulate the composition and function of the virome, the collection of viruses that inhabit a host. The signaling pathways that govern the interaction between the microbiota and the host immune system are complex and multifaceted. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the impact of the microbiota on viral infections, with a focus on the role of metabolites, interferon signaling, and the microbiome-virome interface. The findings of this review have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of viral infections.", "label": 1}
