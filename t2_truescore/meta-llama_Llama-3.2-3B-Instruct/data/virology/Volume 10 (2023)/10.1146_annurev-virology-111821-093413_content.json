{"grounding": "There are at least 21 families of enveloped viruses that infect mammals, and many contain members of high concern for global human health. All enveloped viruses have a dedicated fusion protein or fusion complex that enacts the critical genome-releasing membrane fusion event that is essential before viral replication within the host cell interior can begin. Because all enveloped viruses enter cells by fusion, it behooves us to know how viral fusion proteins function. Viral fusion proteins are also major targets of neutralizing antibodies, and hence they serve as key vaccine immunogens. Here we review current concepts about viral membrane fusion proteins focusing on how they are triggered, structural intermediates between pre- and postfusion forms, and their interplay with the lipid bilayers they engage. We also discuss cellular and therapeutic interventions that thwart virus-cell membrane fusion.", "generated_text": "Viral membrane fusion is a complex process mediated by a diverse array of viral fusion proteins, which orchestrate the conformational changes necessary for the merging of host and viral membranes. Class I, II, and III viral fusion proteins exhibit distinct structural and functional properties, with class I proteins typically forming trimers-of-hairpins that facilitate membrane fusion, while class II proteins often employ fusion loops and peptides to regulate lipid dynamics. The energetics of fusion are influenced by the interplay between viral fusion proteins and host lipids, with conformational intermediates playing a crucial role in the fusion process. Furthermore, fusion restriction factors can modulate the efficiency of viral membrane fusion, highlighting the intricate mechanisms governing this critical step in viral entry. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying viral membrane fusion is essential for understanding viral pathogenesis and developing effective antiviral strategies.", "label": 1}
