{"grounding": "Plant viruses of the genus Tobamovirus cause significant economic losses in various crops. The emergence of new tobamoviruses such as the tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) poses a major threat to global agriculture. Upon infection, plants mount a complex immune response to restrict virus replication and spread, involving a multilayered defense system that includes defense hormones, RNA silencing, and immune receptors. To counter these defenses, tobamoviruses have evolved various strategies to evade or suppress the different immune pathways. Understanding the interactions between tobamoviruses and the plant immune pathways is crucial for the development of effective control measures and genetic resistance to these viruses. In this review, we discuss past and current knowledge of the intricate relationship between tobamoviruses and host immunity. We use this knowledge to understand the emergence of ToBRFV and discuss potential approaches for the development of new resistance strategies to cope with emerging tobamoviruses.", "generated_text": "Tobamoviruses, a family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, have evolved complex strategies to evade plant immunity, leading to devastating crop losses worldwide. This perpetual interplay between tobamoviruses and plant immunity is characterized by the activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) pathways, which involve the recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in PTI, promoting the expression of resistance genes and the production of defense-related proteins. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of RNA silencing (RNAi) in regulating tobamovirus infection, with ToBRFV and TMV serving as model viruses to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process. Understanding the intricate relationships between tobamoviruses and plant immunity is essential for the development of effective resistance strategies, and this review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on this topic, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying the PTI-RNAi-salicylic acid axis.", "label": 1}
