{"grounding": "Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) continue to experience chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which drives the persistence of latent HIV and prevalence of clinical comorbidities. Elucidating the mechanisms that lead to suboptimal immunity is necessary for developing therapeutics that improve the quality of life of PLWH. Although previous studies have found associations between gut dysbiosis and immune dysfunction, the cellular/molecular cascades implicated in the manifestation of aberrant immune responses downstream of microbial perturbations in PLWH are incompletely understood. Recent literature has highlighted that two abundant metabolite families, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), play a crucial role in shaping immunity. These metabolites can be produced and/or modified by bacterial species that make up the gut microbiota and may serve as the causal link between changes to the gut microbiome, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction in PLWH. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the role of the microbiome on HIV acquisition and latent HIV persistence despite ART. Further, we describe cellular/molecular cascades downstream of SCFAs and BAs that drive innate or adaptive immune responses responsible for promoting latent HIV persistence in PLWH. This knowledge can be used to advance HIV cure efforts.", "generated_text": "The human microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating immune homeostasis, modulating inflammation, and influencing HIV persistence. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids in shaping the immune response to HIV infection. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a key site of HIV replication, and the microbiome composition and SCFA production are significantly altered in HIV-infected individuals. SCFAs, produced by the microbiome, have anti-inflammatory properties and can modulate the immune response, potentially reducing HIV replication. Bile acids, produced by the liver and stored in the gut, also exhibit immunomodulatory effects and may influence HIV persistence. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the microbiome's role in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence, with a focus on the mechanisms by which SCFAs and bile acids contribute to these processes. Understanding these interactions is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to manage HIV infection and promote immune recovery.", "label": 1}
