{"grounding": "Negative-stranded RNA viruses are a large group of viruses that encode their genomes in RNA across multiple segments in an orientation antisense to messenger RNA. Their members infect broad ranges of hosts, and there are a number of notable human pathogens. Here, we examine the development of reverse genetic systems as applied to these virus families, emphasizing conserved approaches illustrated by some of the prominent members that cause significant human disease. We also describe the utility of their genetic systems in the development of reporter strains of the viruses and some biological insights made possible by their use. To conclude the review, we highlight some possible future uses of reporter viruses that not only will increase our basic understanding of how these viruses replicate and cause disease but also could inform the development of new approaches to therapeutically intervene.", "generated_text": "This review focuses on segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses of humans, including influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Rift Valley fever virus. These viruses exhibit complex genetic systems, comprising multiple segments of RNA that encode various proteins essential for viral replication and pathogenesis. Experimental uses of reporter strains have significantly advanced our understanding of viral biology and have enabled the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies. Fluorescent and bioluminescent strains have been engineered to facilitate the visualization of viral replication and transmission, providing valuable insights into viral dynamics and host-virus interactions. This review highlights the genetic systems and experimental applications of these viruses, with a focus on the potential for future research and therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
