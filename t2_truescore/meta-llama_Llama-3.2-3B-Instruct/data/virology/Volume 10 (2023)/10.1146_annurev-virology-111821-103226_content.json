{"grounding": "Phase separation of viral biopolymers is a key factor in the formation of cytoplasmic viral inclusions, known as sites of virus replication and assembly. This review describes the mechanisms and factors that affect phase separation in viral replication and identifies potential areas for future research. Drawing inspiration from studies on cellular RNA-rich condensates, we compare the hierarchical coassembly of ribosomal RNAs and proteins in the nucleolus to the coordinated coassembly of viral RNAs and proteins taking place within viral factories in viruses containing segmented RNA genomes. We highlight the common characteristics of biomolecular condensates in viral replication and how this new understanding is reshaping our views of virus assembly mechanisms. Such studies have the potential to uncover unexplored antiviral strategies targeting these phase-separated states.", "generated_text": "Biomolecular condensates, such as viroplasms, play a crucial role in the assembly and replication of segmented RNA viruses, including rotaviruses. These dynamic structures facilitate the organization of viral proteins and RNA into functional complexes, enabling efficient viral transcription and replication. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of phase transitions in the formation and stabilization of viroplasms, which can be triggered by viral proteins or environmental cues. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of viroplasm formation and function, with a focus on the role of phase transitions in viral assembly. The implications of this research for our understanding of viral replication and the development of antiviral strategies are also discussed.", "label": 0}
