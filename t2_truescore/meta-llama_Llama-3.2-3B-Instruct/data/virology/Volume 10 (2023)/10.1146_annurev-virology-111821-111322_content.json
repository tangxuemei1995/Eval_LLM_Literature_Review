{"grounding": "Bacteriophages are enigmatic entities that defy definition. Classically, they are specialist viruses that exclusively parasitize bacterial hosts. Yet this definition becomes limiting when we consider their ubiquity in the body coupled with their vast capacity to directly interact with the mammalian host. While phages certainly do not infect nor replicate within mammalian cells, they do interact with and gain unfettered access to the eukaryotic cell structure. With the growing appreciation for the human virome, coupled with our increased application of phages to patients within clinical settings, the potential impact of phage-mammalian interactions is progressively recognized. In this review, we provide a detailed mechanistic overview of how phages interact with the mammalian cell surface, the processes through which said phages are internalized by the cell, and the intracellular processing and fate of the phages. We then summarize the current state-of-the-field with respect to phage-mammalian interactions and their associations with health and disease states.", "generated_text": "The process of bacteriophage uptake and processing by mammalian cells is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. This process begins with the endocytosis of the phage, where the viral particle is engulfed by the cell membrane, often through the formation of a phagosome. Following internalization, the phage is trafficked through the endolysosomal system, where it is subjected to various forms of degradation and immune recognition. The host cell's immune response to the phage is characterized by the activation of inflammatory pathways, leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection. The phage's genome is also subject to regulation by the host's virome, with various viral and bacterial components interacting to modulate the immune response. Understanding the intricacies of phage processing and the host's response to infection is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against viral infections.", "label": 0}
