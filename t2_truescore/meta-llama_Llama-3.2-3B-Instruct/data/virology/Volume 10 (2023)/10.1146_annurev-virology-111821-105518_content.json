{"grounding": "Nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids across the intact nuclear envelope is an exceptional vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic translocation resulting in the delivery of herpesvirus capsids into the cytosol. Budding of the (nucleo)capsid at and scission from the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC) resulting in a transiently enveloped virus particle in the perinuclear space followed by fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The dimeric NEC oligomerizes into a honeycomb-shaped coat underlining the INM to induce membrane curvature and scission. Mutational analyses complemented structural data defining functionally important regions. Questions remain, including where and when the NEC is formed and how membrane curvature is mediated, vesicle formation is regulated, and directionality is secured. The composition of the primary enveloped virion and the machinery mediating fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM is still debated. While NEC-mediated budding apparently follows a highly conserved mechanism, species and/or cell type\u2013specific differences complicate understanding of later steps.", "generated_text": "Herpesvirus nuclear egress is a complex process involving the coordinated action of multiple proteins and cellular structures. The nuclear egress complex (NEC) plays a crucial role in the formation of primary enveloped virions (PEVs), which are the infectious particles released from infected cells. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying NEC-mediated nuclear membrane fusion, a key step in the egress process. The pseudorabies virus (PrV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been extensively studied, providing valuable insights into the NEC's function. However, the mechanisms of nuclear egress in other herpesviruses, such as HSV-1 and HSV-2, remain poorly understood. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on herpesvirus nuclear egress, highlighting the key players and regulatory mechanisms involved. The review will also discuss the implications of NEC-mediated nuclear membrane fusion for our understanding of herpesvirus replication and pathogenesis. Understanding the intricacies of nuclear egress is essential for the development of novel antiviral therapies targeting herpesvirus infections.", "label": 1}
