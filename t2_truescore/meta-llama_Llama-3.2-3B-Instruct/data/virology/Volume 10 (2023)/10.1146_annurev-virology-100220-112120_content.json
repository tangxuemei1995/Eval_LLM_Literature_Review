{"grounding": "Understanding the factors that shape viral evolution is critical for developing effective antiviral strategies, accurately predicting viral evolution, and preventing pandemics. One fundamental determinant of viral evolution is the interplay between viral protein biophysics and the host machineries that regulate protein folding and quality control. Most adaptive mutations in viruses are biophysically deleterious, resulting in a viral protein product with folding defects. In cells, protein folding is assisted by a dynamic system of chaperones and quality control processes known as the proteostasis network. Host proteostasis networks can determine the fates of viral proteins with biophysical defects, either by assisting with folding or by targeting them for degradation. In this review, we discuss and analyze new discoveries revealing that host proteostasis factors can profoundly shape the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins. We also discuss the many opportunities for research progress proffered by the proteostasis perspective on viral evolution and adaptation.", "generated_text": "Viral evolution has been significantly influenced by host proteostasis networks, which are complex systems that maintain protein homeostasis and respond to stress. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of chaperones and quality control mechanisms in modulating viral replication and survival. Viruses have evolved strategies to evade host proteostasis networks, including the hijacking of chaperones and the manipulation of stress response pathways. This abstract reviews the current understanding of the interplay between viral evolution and host proteostasis networks, with a focus on protein folding biophysics and the role of chaperones in viral adaptation. The impact of viral adaptation on drug and immune system resistance is also discussed, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between viruses and host proteostasis networks. This knowledge has important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and the design of effective vaccines.", "label": 1}
