{"grounding": "Enteric viruses display intricate adaptations to the host mucosal immune system to successfully reproduce in the gastrointestinal tract and cause maladies ranging from gastroenteritis to life-threatening disease upon extraintestinal dissemination. However, many viral infections are asymptomatic, and their presence in the gut is associated with an altered immune landscape that can be beneficial or adverse in certain contexts. Genetic variation in the host and environmental factors including the bacterial microbiota influence how the immune system responds to infections in a remarkably viral strain\u2013specific manner. This immune response, in turn, determines whether a given virus establishes acute versus chronic infection, which may have long-lasting consequences such as susceptibility to inflammatory disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interaction between enteric viruses and the immune system that underlie the impact of these ubiquitous infectious agents on our health.", "generated_text": "Enteric viruses, comprising a diverse range of noroviruses, play a significant role in modulating the immune response within the intestine. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between enteric viruses and the host immune system, leading to the development of novel immunomodulatory strategies. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of immunomodulation by enteric viruses, with a focus on norovirus. The norovirus-induced immune response is characterized by the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of mucosal barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, the norovirus virome influences the host's immune response, modulating the expression of immune-related genes and proteins. Understanding the mechanisms of immunomodulation by enteric viruses is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and the prevention of norovirus-induced gastrointestinal disease.", "label": 1}
