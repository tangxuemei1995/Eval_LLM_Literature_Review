{"grounding": "The nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs), also known as the order Mononegavirales, have a genome consisting of a single strand of negative-sense RNA. Integral to the nsNSV replication cycle is the viral polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing the viral genome, to produce an array of capped and polyadenylated messenger RNAs, and replicating it to produce new genomes. To perform the different steps that are necessary for these processes, the nsNSV polymerases undergo a series of coordinated conformational transitions. While much is still to be learned regarding the intersection of nsNSV polymerase dynamics, structure, and function, recently published polymerase structures, combined with a history of biochemical and molecular biology studies, have provided new insights into how nsNSV polymerases function as dynamic machines. In this review, we consider each of the steps involved in nsNSV transcription and replication and suggest how these relate to solved polymerase structures.", "generated_text": "Nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses, including members of the Mononegavirales order, utilize RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) to transcribe their genomes. These polymerases are essential for viral replication and have evolved unique structures and mechanisms to facilitate efficient transcription. Paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, pneumoviruses, and rhabdoviruses, all classified within the Mononegavirales, employ distinct RdRp architectures. Paramyxoviruses feature a large, multifunctional RdRp, while filoviruses possess a smaller, more compact RdRp. Pneumoviruses and rhabdoviruses exhibit intermediate RdRp structures. The mechanisms underlying RdRp activity, including processivity, error correction, and interaction with viral RNA, have been elucidated through structural and biochemical studies. Understanding the structures and mechanisms of nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus polymerases is crucial for the development of antiviral therapies and the design of novel vaccine strategies. This knowledge has significant implications for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases caused by Mononegavirales viruses.", "label": 0}
