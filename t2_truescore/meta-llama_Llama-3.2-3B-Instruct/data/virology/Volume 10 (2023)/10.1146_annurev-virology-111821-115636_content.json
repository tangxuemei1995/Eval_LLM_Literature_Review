{"grounding": "Host defense against viral pathogens is an essential function for all living organisms. In cell-intrinsic innate immunity, dedicated sensor proteins recognize molecular signatures of infection and communicate to downstream adaptor or effector proteins to activate immune defense. Remarkably, recent evidence demonstrates that much of the core machinery of innate immunity is shared across eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains of life. Here, we review a pioneering example of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity: the animal cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase\u2013stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway and its ancestor in bacteria, CBASS (cyclic nucleotide-based antiphage signaling system) antiphage defense. We discuss the unique mechanism by which animal cGLRs (cGAS-like receptors) and bacterial CD-NTases (cGAS/dinucleotide-cyclase in Vibrio (DncV)-like nucleotidyltransferases) in these pathways link pathogen detection with immune activation using nucleotide second messenger signals. Comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we highlight emerging questions in the field and examine evolutionary pressures that may have shaped the origins of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense.", "generated_text": "The discovery of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) as nucleotide second messengers has revolutionized our understanding of innate immune signaling. The cytosolic sensor cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) and its downstream effector STING (stimulator of interferon genes) are pivotal in recognizing and responding to viral infections. Recent studies have shed light on the evolutionary origins of this pathway, revealing a common ancestor with the bacterial sensor cGLR (cyclic GMP-AMP receptor). The CBASS (cGAS-STING pathway activation) pathway has been extensively characterized, demonstrating its critical role in antiviral defense and innate immunity. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms of nucleotide second messenger immune signaling, from the recognition of viral nucleic acids to the activation of downstream transcription factors. The intricate relationships between cGAS, STING, and cGLR are discussed, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this pathway across species. The implications of this pathway in understanding viral infections and innate immunity are also explored.", "label": 1}
