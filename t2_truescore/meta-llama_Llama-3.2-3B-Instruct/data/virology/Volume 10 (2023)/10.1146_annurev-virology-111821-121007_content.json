{"grounding": "N- and O-glycans are both important constituents of viral envelope glycoproteins. O-linked glycosylation can be initiated by any of 20 different human polypeptide O-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases, resulting in an important functional O-glycan heterogeneity. O-glycans are organized as solitary glycans or in clusters of multiple glycans forming mucin-like domains. They are functional both in the viral life cycle and in viral colonization of their host. Negatively charged O-glycans are crucial for the interactions between glycosaminoglycan-binding viruses and their host. A novel mechanism, based on controlled electrostatic repulsion, explains how such viruses solve the conflict between optimized viral attachment to target cells and efficient egress of progeny virus. Conserved solitary O-glycans appear important for viral uptake in target cells by contributing to viral envelope fusion. Dual roles of viral O-glycans in the host B cell immune response, either epitope blocking or epitope promoting, may be exploitable for vaccine development. Finally, specific virus-induced O-glycans may be involved in viremic spread.", "generated_text": "O-Linked glycans play a crucial role in the structure and function of viral envelope proteins, influencing viral attachment, entry, and egress. These carbohydrate moieties, particularly mucin-like domains, are often composed of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, which interact with host cell receptors and modulate the viral attachment process. The precise arrangement and glycosylation pattern of O-linked glycans can significantly impact the efficiency of viral entry and the immune response elicited by viral infections. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of O-linked glycans as targets for vaccine development, with strategies aimed at inducing neutralizing antibodies against these carbohydrate structures. Understanding the structure and role of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins is essential for the design of effective vaccines and the development of novel therapeutic interventions against viral infections. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between O-linked glycans and host cell receptors, and to explore their potential as targets for antiviral therapies.", "label": 1}
