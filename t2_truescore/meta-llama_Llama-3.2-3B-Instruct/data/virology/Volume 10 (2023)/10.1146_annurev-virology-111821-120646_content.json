{"grounding": "Protein synthesis by the ribosome is the final stage of biological information transfer and represents an irreversible commitment to gene expression. Accurate translation of messenger RNA is therefore essential to all life, and spontaneous errors by the translational machinery are highly infrequent (\u223c1/100,000 codons). Programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121PRF) is a mechanism in which the elongating ribosome is induced at high frequency to slip backward by one nucleotide at a defined position and to continue translation in the new reading frame. This is exploited as a translational regulation strategy by hundreds of RNA viruses, which rely on \u22121PRF during genome translation to control the stoichiometry of viral proteins. While early investigations of \u22121PRF focused on virological and biochemical aspects, the application of X-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and the advent of deep sequencing and single-molecule approaches have revealed unexpected structural diversity and mechanistic complexity. Molecular players from several model systems have now been characterized in detail, both in isolation and, more recently, in the context of the elongating ribosome. Here we provide a summary of recent advances and discuss to what extent a general model for \u22121PRF remains a useful way of thinking.", "generated_text": "Viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a crucial mechanism employed by various viruses to manipulate host cell translation and promote their replication. This process involves the formation of pseudoknot structures within the viral mRNA, which in turn induce ribosomal frameshifting, leading to the production of aberrant proteins. Recent studies have shed light on the structural and functional insights underlying this phenomenon, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. In SARS-CoV-2, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) generates pseudoknot structures within the viral mRNA, which in turn induce frameshifting and the production of non-structural proteins. Similarly, in HIV, the viral reverse transcriptase generates pseudoknot structures within the viral mRNA, leading to frameshifting and the production of aberrant proteins. The structural and functional insights gained from these studies have significant implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is essential for the design of effective therapeutic strategies to combat viral infections. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.", "label": 1}
