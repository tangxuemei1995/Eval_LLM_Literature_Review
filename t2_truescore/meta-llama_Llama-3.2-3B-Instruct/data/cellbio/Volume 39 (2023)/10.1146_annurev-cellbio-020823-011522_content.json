{"grounding": "Intercellular signaling molecules, known as morphogens, act at a long range in developing tissues to provide spatial information and control properties such as cell fate and tissue growth. The production, transport, and removal of morphogens shape their concentration profiles in time and space. Downstream signaling cascades and gene regulatory networks within cells then convert the spatiotemporal morphogen profiles into distinct cellular responses. Current challenges are to understand the diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying morphogen gradient formation, as well as the logic of downstream regulatory circuits involved in morphogen interpretation. This knowledge, combining experimental and theoretical results, is essential to understand emerging properties of morphogen-controlled systems, such as robustness and scaling.", "generated_text": "Morphogens play a crucial role in controlling tissue development by regulating gene expression in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. Through diffusion-driven signaling, morphogens interact with specific receptors to activate or repress target gene expression, thereby influencing cell fate decisions and tissue patterning. In the context of embryonic development, morphogens such as Wnt, BMP, and FGF have been shown to regulate key developmental processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The complex interplay between morphogens and their receptors in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlies the intricate patterns of tissue development, highlighting the importance of morphogen signaling in shaping the embryonic body plan.", "label": 1}
