{"grounding": "Every eukaryotic cell contains two distinct multisubunit protein kinase complexes that each contain a TOR (target of rapamycin) protein as the catalytic subunit. These ensembles, designated TORC1 and TORC2, serve as nutrient and stress sensors, signal integrators, and regulators of cell growth and homeostasis, but they differ in their composition, localization, and function. TORC1, activated on the cytosolic surface of the vacuole (or, in mammalian cells, on the cytosolic surface of the lysosome), promotes biosynthesis and suppresses autophagy. TORC2, located primarily at the plasma membrane (PM), maintains the proper levels and bilayer distribution of all PM components (sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterols, and integral membrane proteins), which are needed for the membrane expansion that accompanies cell growth and division and for combating insults to PM integrity. This review summarizes our current understanding of the assembly, structural features, subcellular distribution, and function and regulation of TORC2, obtained largely through studies conducted with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "generated_text": "The target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, and metabolism, in yeast. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of TORC2 function and localization in maintaining cellular homeostasis. This complex is composed of two subunits, Tsc2 and Lst7, which are essential for its activity. The plasma membrane (PM) serves as the primary site of TORC2 activity, where it regulates the phosphorylation of downstream targets. Phosphoinositides, specifically phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), are key phospholipids involved in TORC2 localization and function. Endosomes also play a critical role in regulating TORC2 activity, with the complex being transported to and from the PM through endocytic pathways. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of TORC2 function and localization in yeast, with a focus on the regulatory mechanisms that govern its activity and the importance of phosphoinositides and endosomes in maintaining its proper localization and function.", "label": 1}
