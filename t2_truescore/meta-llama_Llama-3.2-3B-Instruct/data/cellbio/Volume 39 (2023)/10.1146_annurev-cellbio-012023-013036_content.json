{"grounding": "The neural retina, at the back of the eye, is a fascinating system to use to discover how cells form tissues in the context of the developing nervous system. The retina is the tissue responsible for perception and transmission of visual information from the environment. It consists of five types of neurons and one type of glia cells that are arranged in a highly organized, layered structure to assure visual information flow. To reach this highly ordered arrangement, intricate morphogenic movements are occurring at the cell and tissue levels. I here discuss recent advances made to understand retinal development, from optic cup formation to neuronal layering. It becomes clear that these complex morphogenetic processes must be studied by taking the cellular as well as the tissue-wide aspects into account. The loop has to be closed between exploring how cell behavior influences tissue development and how the surrounding tissue itself influences single cells. Furthermore, it was recently revealed that the retina is a great system to study neuronal migration phenomena, and more is yet to be discovered in this aspect. Constantly developing imaging and image analysis toolboxes as well as the use of machine learning and synthetic biology make the retina the perfect system to explore more of its exciting neurodevelopmental biology.", "generated_text": "The development of the retina is a complex process involving intricate morphogenetic transformations, ultimately giving rise to a highly organized and specialized neural tissue. This review provides an in-depth examination of retinal morphogenesis, from the initial formation of the optic cup to the final lamination of neurons. The optic cup, a precursor structure to the retina, undergoes a series of shape changes and growth patterns, guided by a delicate interplay of cellular and molecular mechanisms. As the optic cup expands and differentiates, neurons begin to migrate and establish their precise positions within the retinal layer. This process is influenced by a range of factors, including cell-cell interactions, growth factors, and transcriptional regulators. The precise lamination of neurons is critical for the proper functioning of the retina, with aberrant patterns of neuronal positioning leading to visual impairments. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying retinal morphogenesis is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for retinal disorders, including retinal degeneration and visual impairment. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on retinal morphogenesis, highlighting key regulatory pathways and molecular mechanisms that govern this complex process.", "label": 1}
