{"grounding": "Animal tissues are made up of multiple cell types that are increasingly well-characterized, yet our understanding of the core principles that govern tissue organization is still incomplete. This is in part because many observable tissue characteristics, such as cellular composition and spatial patterns, are emergent properties, and as such, they cannot be explained through the knowledge of individual cells alone. Here we propose a complex systems theory perspective to address this fundamental gap in our understanding of tissue biology. We introduce the concept of cell categories, which is based on cell relations rather than cell identity. Based on these notions we then discuss common principles of tissue modularity, introducing compositional, structural, and functional tissue modules. Cell diversity and cell relations provide a basis for a new perspective on the underlying principles of tissue organization in health and disease.", "generated_text": "The intricate organization of tissues in multicellular organisms has long been a subject of fascination and inquiry in the field of tissue biology. Recent advances in our understanding of tissue structure and function have highlighted the need for a new paradigm that integrates the complex interplay between cell type, tissue organization, and self-organization. This review aims to explore the current state of knowledge on tissue biology, with a focus on the concept of tissue modules and the relationships between cell types within these modules. We discuss the evolution of tissue organization and the emergence of distinct cell categories, and examine the role of cell relations in shaping tissue function. By synthesizing existing research and identifying key areas of future investigation, this review seeks to contribute to the development of a new paradigm for understanding tissue biology and its implications for our understanding of complex biological systems.", "label": 1}
