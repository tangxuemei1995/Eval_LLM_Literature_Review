{"grounding": "Cell-cell communication is critical for the development and function of multicellular organisms. A crucial means by which cells communicate with one another is physical interactions between receptors on one cell and their ligands on a neighboring cell. Trans ligand:receptor interactions activate the receptor, ultimately leading to changes in the fate of the receptor-expressing cells. Such trans signaling is known to be critical for the functions of cells in the nervous and immune systems, among others. Historically, trans interactions are the primary conceptual framework for understanding cell-cell communication. However, cells often coexpress many receptors and ligands, and a subset of these has been reported to interact in cis and profoundly impact cell functions. Cis interactions likely constitute a fundamental, understudied regulatory mechanism in cell biology. Here, I discuss how cis interactions between membrane receptors and ligands regulate immune cell functions, and I also highlight outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "Cis interactions between membrane receptors and their ligands play a crucial role in regulating cellular signaling pathways. These interactions occur within the same cell membrane compartment and can modulate the receptor's conformation, affinity, and signaling capacity. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cis interactions in modulating the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and receptor tyrosine kinases. The mechanisms underlying cis interactions involve changes in receptor-ligand binding affinity, receptor dimerization, and conformational rearrangements. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of cis interactions is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting membrane receptors and ligands. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on cis interactions, highlighting the key players, mechanisms, and implications for cellular signaling. By exploring the complexities of cis interactions, we can gain insights into the regulation of membrane receptor function and the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.", "label": 1}
