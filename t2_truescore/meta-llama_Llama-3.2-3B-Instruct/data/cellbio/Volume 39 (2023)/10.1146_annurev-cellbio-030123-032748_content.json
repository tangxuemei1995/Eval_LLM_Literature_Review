{"grounding": "Microtubules are essential dynamic polymers composed of \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin heterodimers. They support intracellular trafficking, cell division, cellular motility, and other essential cellular processes. In many species, both \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin are encoded by multiple genes with distinct expression profiles and functionality. Microtubules are further diversified through abundant posttranslational modifications, which are added and removed by a suite of enzymes to form complex, stereotyped cellular arrays. The genetic and chemical diversity of tubulin constitute a tubulin code that regulates intrinsic microtubule properties and is read by cellular effectors, such as molecular motors and microtubule-associated proteins, to provide spatial and temporal specificity to microtubules in cells. In this review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding tubulin code literature and highlight limitations and opportunities for the field. As complex microtubule arrays underlie essential physiological processes, a better understanding of how cells employ the tubulin code has important implications for human disease ranging from cancer to neurological disorders.", "generated_text": "The tubulin code refers to the complex interplay of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on microtubule-associated proteins, specifically tubulin, which plays a crucial role in determining microtubule dynamics, stability, and function. The tubulin code is composed of various PTMs, including detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation, which can either stabilize or destabilize microtubules. These modifications can be influenced by a range of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and response to environmental stress. Aberrant tubulin PTMs have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. Understanding the tubulin code and its dysregulation is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting microtubule function. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of tubulin PTMs in regulating microtubule dynamics and have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their dysregulation. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional significance of the tubulin code and its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting disease susceptibility.", "label": 1}
