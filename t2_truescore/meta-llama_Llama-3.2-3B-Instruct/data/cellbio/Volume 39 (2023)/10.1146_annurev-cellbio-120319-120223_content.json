{"grounding": "Toll signaling plays a crucial role in pathogen defense throughout the animal kingdom. It was discovered, however, for its function in dorsoventral (DV) axis formation in Drosophila. In all other insects studied so far, but not outside the insects, Toll is also required for DV patterning. However, in insects more distantly related to Drosophila, Toll's patterning role is frequently reduced and substituted by an expanded influence of BMP signaling, the pathway implicated in DV axis formation in all major metazoan lineages. This suggests that Toll was integrated into an ancestral BMP-based patterning system at the base of the insects or during insect evolution. The observation that Toll signaling has an immune function in the extraembryonic serosa, an early differentiating tissue of most insect embryos, suggests a scenario of how Toll was co-opted from an ancestral immune function for its new role in axis formation.", "generated_text": "The neofunctionalization of Toll signaling in insects has been a subject of intense research, with significant implications for our understanding of immunity and embryonic patterning. In this context, the model organisms Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus have provided valuable insights into the evolution of Toll signaling. Comparative analyses of these species have revealed distinct Toll signaling pathways, which have been linked to the development of the mesoderm and serosa, critical components of the embryonic cuticle. Furthermore, studies in non-insect hexapods have shed light on the conserved nature of Toll signaling in these organisms, highlighting its role in germ layer evolution. The serosal cuticle, a unique feature of insects, has also been shown to be influenced by Toll signaling, suggesting a complex interplay between immunity and patterning. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the neofunctionalization of Toll signaling in insects, with a focus on its role in embryonic patterning and germ layer evolution.", "label": 0}
