{"grounding": "In 1952, Alan Turing published the reaction-diffusion (RD) mathematical framework, laying the foundations of morphogenesis as a self-organized process emerging from physicochemical first principles. Regrettably, this approach has been widely doubted in the field of developmental biology. First, we summarize Turing's line of thoughts to alleviate the misconception that RD is an artificial mathematical construct. Second, we discuss why phenomenological RD models are particularly effective for understanding skin color patterning at the meso/macroscopic scales, without the need to parameterize the profusion of variables at lower scales. More specifically, we discuss how RD models (a) recapitulate the diversity of actual skin patterns, (b) capture the underlying dynamics of cellular interactions, (c) interact with tissue size and shape, (d) can lead to ordered sequential patterning, (e) generate cellular automaton dynamics in lizards and snakes, (f) predict actual patterns beyond their statistical features, and (g) are robust to model variations. Third, we discuss the utility of linear stability analysis and perform numerical simulations to demonstrate how deterministic RD emerges from the underlying chaotic microscopic agents.", "generated_text": "Reaction diffusion models have been widely employed to explain the emergence of complex patterns in various biological systems, including vertebrate skin color patterning. Despite their simplicity, these models have been found to exhibit surprisingly effective and realistic outcomes, often referred to as the 'unreasonable effectiveness' of reaction diffusion. This phenomenon is exemplified in the sequential patterning of melanocytes and keratinocytes in the skin, where reaction diffusion processes drive the formation of intricate patterns of skin color. By analyzing the interplay between reaction diffusion and cellular automata, we demonstrate that the sequential patterning of skin color can be accurately modeled using phenomenological models. Our results show that the interplay between reaction diffusion and cellular automata gives rise to Turing patterns, which are essential for the emergence of complex patterns in vertebrate skin color patterning. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying skin color patterning and highlight the potential of reaction diffusion models in understanding complex biological systems.", "label": 1}
