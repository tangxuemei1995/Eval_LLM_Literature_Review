{"grounding": "The life of eukaryotic cells requires the transport of lipids between membranes, which are separated by the aqueous environment of the cytosol. Vesicle-mediated traffic along the secretory and endocytic pathways and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) cooperate in this transport. Until recently, known LTPs were shown to carry one or a few lipids at a time and were thought to mediate transport by shuttle-like mechanisms. Over the last few years, a new family of LTPs has been discovered that is defined by a repeating \u03b2-groove (RBG) rod-like structure with a hydrophobic channel running along their entire length. This structure and the localization of these proteins at membrane contact sites suggest a bridge-like mechanism of lipid transport. Mutations in some of these proteins result in neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. Here we review the known properties and well-established or putative physiological roles of these proteins, and we highlight the many questions that remain open about their functions.", "generated_text": "The RBG motif, a conserved protein domain, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including lipid transport and autophagy. Recent studies have identified bridge-like lipid transport proteins, such as VPS13 and ATG2, that harbor the RBG motif and are involved in the transport of phospholipids and other lipids across cellular membranes. BLTPs, including SHIP164, also contain the RBG motif and have been shown to regulate lipid metabolism. Despite the conservation of the RBG motif across these proteins, the structural and functional mechanisms underlying their lipid transport activities remain poorly understood. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the structure, functions, and open questions surrounding RBG motif bridge-like lipid transport proteins, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying their roles in lipid metabolism and autophagy.", "label": 1}
