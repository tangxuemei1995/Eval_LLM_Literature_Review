{"grounding": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) decode messenger RNA codons to peptides at the ribosome. The nuclear genome contains many tRNA genes for each amino acid and even each anticodon. Recent evidence indicates that expression of these tRNAs in neurons is regulated, and they are not functionally redundant. When specific tRNA genes are nonfunctional, this results in an imbalance between codon demand and tRNA availability. Furthermore, tRNAs are spliced, processed, and posttranscriptionally modified. Defects in these processes lead to neurological disorders. Finally, mutations in the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) also lead to disease. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs cause syndromic disorders, while dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs lead to peripheral neuropathy, again due to an imbalance between tRNA supply and codon demand. While it is clear that disrupting tRNA biology often leads to neurological disease, additional research is needed to understand the sensitivity of neurons to these changes.", "generated_text": "tRNA dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Aberrant tRNA processing, modification, and splicing can disrupt the translation of essential mRNAs, leading to protein misfolding and aggregation. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, responsible for charging tRNA with amino acids, can also contribute to disease through the production of aberrant tRNA species. Furthermore, tRNA modifications, such as the incorporation of angiogenin, can modulate the integrated stress response, exacerbating cellular stress and promoting disease progression. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of tRNA dysregulation in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the complex interplay between tRNA processing, modification, and splicing, and the role of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and the integrated stress response in disease pathogenesis. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting tRNA dysregulation in these devastating diseases.", "label": 1}
