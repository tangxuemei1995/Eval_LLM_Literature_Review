{"grounding": "Multicellular organisms generate tissues of diverse shapes and functions from cells and extracellular matrices. Their adhesion molecules mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which not only play crucial roles in maintaining tissue integrity but also serve as key regulators of tissue morphogenesis. Cells constantly probe their environment to make decisions: They integrate chemical and mechanical information from the environment via diffusible ligand- or adhesion-based signaling to decide whether to release specific signaling molecules or enzymes, to divide or differentiate, to move away or stay, or even whether to live or die. These decisions in turn modify their environment, including the chemical nature and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. Tissue morphology is the physical manifestation of the remodeling of cells and matrices by their historical biochemical and biophysical landscapes. We review our understanding of matrix and adhesion molecules in tissue morphogenesis, with an emphasis on key physical interactions that drive morphogenesis.", "generated_text": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process involving the coordinated interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), including the basement membrane. This dynamic interplay of cell adhesion, migration, and ECM remodeling is crucial for the formation and maintenance of tissue structure and function. Recent studies have highlighted the critical roles of integrins and cadherins in mediating cell-ECM interactions, influencing cell shape, motility, and signaling pathways. Interfacial tension, generated by the balance between cell adhesion and ECM stiffness, also plays a key role in regulating tissue morphogenesis. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue morphogenesis, with a focus on the dynamic interactions between cells and the ECM. We discuss the key players involved, including integrins, cadherins, and the ECM components, and explore the implications of these interactions for tissue development and disease.", "label": 1}
