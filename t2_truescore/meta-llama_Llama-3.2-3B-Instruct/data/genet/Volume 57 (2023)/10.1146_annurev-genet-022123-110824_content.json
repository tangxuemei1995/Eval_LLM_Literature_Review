{"grounding": "The ease and throughput of single-cell genomics have steadily improved, and its current trajectory suggests that surveying single-cell populations will become routine. We discuss the merger of quantitative genetics with single-cell genomics and emphasize how this synergizes with advantages intrinsic to plants. Single-cell population genomics provides increased detection resolution when mapping variants that control molecular traits, including gene expression or chromatin accessibility. Additionally, single-cell population genomics reveals the cell types in which variants act and, when combined with organism-level phenotype measurements, unveils which cellular contexts impact higher-order traits. Emerging technologies, notably multiomics, can facilitate the measurement of both genetic changes and genomic traits in single cells, enabling single-cell genetic experiments. The implementation of single-cell genetics will advance the investigation of the genetic architecture of complex molecular traits and provide new experimental paradigms to study eukaryotic genetics.", "generated_text": "Single-cell genomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, enabling the characterization of rare cell populations and their contributions to complex traits. By leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data, researchers can dissect the genetic basis of complex traits, such as height, blood pressure, and disease susceptibility. This approach allows for the identification of rare genetic variants associated with specific cell types, providing new insights into the quantitative genetic architecture of complex traits. Furthermore, the analysis of mutant cells and population genetics data can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits, ultimately informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies and precision medicine approaches.", "label": 0}
