{"grounding": "Enzymes that phosphorylate, dephosphorylate, and ligate RNA 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were discovered more than half a century ago and were eventually shown to repair purposeful site-specific endonucleolytic breaks in the RNA phosphodiester backbone. The pace of discovery and characterization of new candidate RNA repair activities in taxa from all phylogenetic domains greatly exceeds our understanding of the biological pathways in which they act. The key questions anent RNA break repair in vivo are (a) identifying the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage and (b) determining whether RNA repair results in restoration of the original RNA, modification of the RNA (by loss or gain at the ends), or rearrangements of the broken RNA segments (i.e., RNA recombination). This review provides a perspective on the discovery, mechanisms, and physiology of purposeful RNA break repair, highlighting exemplary repair pathways (e.g., tRNA restriction-repair and tRNA splicing) for which genetics has figured prominently in their elucidation.", "generated_text": "RNA repair mechanisms are crucial for maintaining genome stability and cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of tRNA restriction and splicing in end healing and sealing, processes that involve the coordinated action of multiple enzymes. Polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (PNK/PAP) complexes play a pivotal role in these reactions, facilitating the repair of damaged RNA molecules. RNA ligase, another essential enzyme, is also involved in end sealing, forming phosphodiester bonds to reconnect broken RNA strands. The discovery of novel tRNA restriction enzymes has expanded our understanding of the complex interplay between these enzymes in RNA repair. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on tRNA restriction, splicing, and end healing, highlighting the latest advances in enzyme discovery and the implications for our understanding of RNA repair mechanisms.", "label": 1}
