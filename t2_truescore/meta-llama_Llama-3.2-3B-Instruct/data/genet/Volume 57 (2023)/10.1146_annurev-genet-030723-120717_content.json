{"grounding": "Despite accumulating evidence implicating noncoding variants in human diseases, unraveling their functionality remains a significant challenge. Systematic annotations of the regulatory landscape and the growth of sequence variant data sets have fueled the development of tools and methods to identify causal noncoding variants and evaluate their regulatory effects. Here, we review the latest advances in the field and discuss potential future research avenues to gain a more in-depth understanding of noncoding regulatory variants.", "generated_text": "Noncoding regulatory variants, including enhancers, play a crucial role in gene expression and disease susceptibility. Despite their importance, identifying these variants remains a significant challenge. This study employs a multi-faceted approach, integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare-variant association tests, and machine learning algorithms to uncover noncoding regulatory variants associated with complex diseases. Functional assays validate the identified variants, providing insights into their regulatory mechanisms.", "label": 0}
