{"grounding": "Programmed cell death (self-induced) is intrinsic to all cellular life forms, including unicellular organisms. However, cell death research has focused on animal models to understand cancer, degenerative disorders, and developmental processes. Recently delineated suicidal death mechanisms in bacteria and fungi have revealed ancient origins of animal cell death that are intertwined with immune mechanisms, allaying earlier doubts that self-inflicted cell death pathways exist in microorganisms. Approximately 20 mammalian death pathways have been partially characterized over the last 35 years. By contrast, more than 100 death mechanisms have been identified in bacteria and a few fungi in recent years. However, cell death is nearly unstudied in most human pathogenic microbes that cause major public health burdens. Here, we consider how the current understanding of programmed cell death arose through animal studies and how recently uncovered microbial cell death mechanisms in fungi and bacteria resemble and differ from mechanisms of mammalian cell death.", "generated_text": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a vital process in multicellular organisms, allowing for tissue homeostasis and adaptation to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying PCD in unicellular organisms, such as microbes, remain poorly understood. This review aims to bridge the gap between unicellular and multicellular PCD, highlighting the conserved and divergent features of the two processes. We discuss the regulation of PCD in microorganisms, including the role of stress response pathways, DNA damage response, and cell cycle checkpoints. In contrast to multicellular organisms, unicellular microbes often lack the complex cellular architecture and tissue organization, yet they have evolved unique strategies to control PCD. Our analysis reveals that PCD in unicellular organisms is tightly regulated by a network of molecular mechanisms, including the activation of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes. Understanding the mechanisms of PCD in unicellular organisms has important implications for our understanding of microbial biology and disease, and may also provide insights into the evolution of PCD in multicellular organisms.", "label": 1}
