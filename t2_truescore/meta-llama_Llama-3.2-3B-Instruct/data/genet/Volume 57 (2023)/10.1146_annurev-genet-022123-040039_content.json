{"grounding": "Germ cells are the only cell type that is capable of transmitting genetic information to the next generation, which has enabled the continuation of multicellular life for the last 1.5 billion years. Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms supporting the germline's remarkable ability to continue in this eternal cycle, termed germline immortality. Even unicellular organisms age at a cellular level, demonstrating that cellular aging is inevitable. Extensive studies in yeast have established the framework of how asymmetric cell division and gametogenesis may contribute to the resetting of cellular age. This review examines the mechanisms of germline immortality\u2014how germline cells reset the aging of cells\u2014drawing a parallel between yeast and multicellular organisms.", "generated_text": "Asymmetric stem cell division is a critical mechanism underlying germline immortality, allowing for the maintenance of a self-renewing population of cells that can perpetuate life indefinitely. Recent studies have highlighted the role of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in regulating asymmetric cell division, with evidence suggesting that rDNA content influences the asymmetric division of stem cells. This process is thought to be mediated by the interaction of rDNA with specific proteins, leading to the preferential division of cells with high rDNA content. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying germline immortality is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to promote healthy aging and extend human lifespan.", "label": 0}
