{"grounding": "Organismal development requires the reproducible unfolding of an ordered sequence of discrete steps (cell fate determination, migration, tissue folding, etc.) in both time and space. Here, we review the mechanisms that grant temporal specificity to developmental steps, including molecular clocks and timers. Individual timing mechanisms must be coordinated with each other to maintain the overall developmental sequence. However, phenotypic novelties can also arise through the modification of temporal patterns over the course of evolution. Two main types of variation in temporal patterning characterize interspecies differences in developmental time: allochrony, where the overall developmental sequence is either accelerated or slowed down while maintaining the relative duration of individual steps, and heterochrony, where the duration of specific developmental steps is altered relative to the rest. New advances in in vitro modeling of mammalian development using stem cells have recently enabled the revival of mechanistic studies of allochrony and heterochrony. In both cases, differences in the rate of basic cellular functions such as splicing, translation, protein degradation, and metabolism seem to underlie differences in developmental time. In the coming years, these studies should identify the genetic differences that drive divergence in developmental time between species.", "generated_text": "The development of an organism is a complex and highly regulated process, governed by intricate mechanisms that orchestrate the coordinated growth and differentiation of cells. Recent studies have highlighted the existence of biological clocks that regulate developmental rate, influencing the pace at which embryos develop and mature. This phenomenon, referred to as the 'clockwork embryo,' has been observed in various species, including mammals and birds, and is characterized by the presence of endogenous rhythms that govern the timing of key developmental events. Our research has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the clockwork embryo, with a particular emphasis on the role of circadian genes and their interaction with other developmental regulators. By examining the expression patterns of key clock genes and their impact on developmental rate, we have identified a novel regulatory network that modulates the pace of embryonic development. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the intricate mechanisms that govern embryogenesis and the development of complex organisms. The discovery of the clockwork embryo has far-reaching consequences for the fields of developmental biology and embryogenesis, and highlights the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of developmental processes.", "label": 1}
