{"grounding": "Many human phenotypes are impossible to recapitulate in model organisms or immortalized human cell lines. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a way to study disease mechanisms in a variety of differentiated cell types while circumventing ethical and practical issues associated with finite tissue sources and postmortem states. Here, we discuss the broad utility of iPSCs in genetic medicine and describe how they are being used to study musculoskeletal, pulmonary, neurologic, and cardiac phenotypes. We summarize the particular challenges presented by each organ system and describe how iPSC models are being used to address them. Finally, we discuss emerging iPSC-derived organoid models and the potential value that they can bring to studies of human disease.", "generated_text": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have revolutionized the field of disease biology by providing a powerful tool for studying human genetics and disease mechanisms in vitro. By reprogramming somatic cells into a pluripotent state, iPSCs can recapitulate the complex gene regulatory networks that govern human development and disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of iPSCs in modeling human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Organoid cultures derived from iPSCs have also shown great promise in mimicking the in vivo architecture of human tissues, enabling the study of disease-specific cellular and molecular mechanisms. This abstract reviews the current evidence for the in vitro utility of iPSCs in disease biology and highlights their potential for translational research and therapeutic applications.", "label": 1}
