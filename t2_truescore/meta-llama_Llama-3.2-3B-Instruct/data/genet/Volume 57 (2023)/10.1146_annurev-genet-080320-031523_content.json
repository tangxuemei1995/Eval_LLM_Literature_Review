{"grounding": "Transcription and replication both require large macromolecular complexes to act on a DNA template, yet these machineries cannot simultaneously act on the same DNA sequence. Conflicts between the replication and transcription machineries (transcription\u2013replication conflicts, or TRCs) are widespread in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and have the capacity to both cause DNA damage and compromise complete, faithful replication of the genome. This review will highlight recent studies investigating the genomic locations of TRCs and the mechanisms by which they may be prevented, mitigated, or resolved. We address work from both model organisms and mammalian systems but predominantly focus on multicellular eukaryotes owing to the additional complexities inherent in the coordination of replication and transcription in the context of cell type\u2013specific gene expression and higher-order chromatin organization.", "generated_text": "Transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) are a ubiquitous source of genome instability, arising from the concurrent processes of transcription and replication. The replisome, a complex of enzymes responsible for DNA replication, and RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for transcription, often occupy the same DNA region, leading to conflicts that can result in genomic instability. Origin firing, a process where multiple origins of replication are activated simultaneously, exacerbates TRCs, causing replication stress and DNA damage. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of DNA repair mechanisms in mitigating the effects of TRCs. However, the intricate relationships between TRCs, replisome dynamics, and DNA repair pathways remain poorly understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TRCs and their impact on genome stability, with implications for our understanding of human diseases and cancer.", "label": 1}
