{"grounding": "Assigning functions to genes and learning how to control their expression are part of the foundation of cell biology and therapeutic development. An efficient and unbiased method to accomplish this is genetic screening, which historically required laborious clone generation and phenotyping and is still limited by scale today. The rapid technological progress on modulating gene function with CRISPR-Cas and measuring it in individual cells has now relaxed the major experimental constraints and enabled pooled screening with complex readouts from single cells. Here, we review the principles and practical considerations for pooled single-cell CRISPR screening. We discuss perturbation strategies, experimental model systems, matching the perturbation to the individual cells, reading out cell phenotypes, and data analysis. Our focus is on single-cell RNA sequencing and cell sorting\u2013based readouts, including image-enabled cell sorting. We expect this transformative approach to fuel biomedical research for the next several decades.", "generated_text": "Pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens in single cells enable the simultaneous assessment of gene function across the entire genome in individual cells. By leveraging cell sorting and pooled CRISPR libraries, researchers can efficiently screen for functional genomics in single cells, providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. This approach allows for the identification of cell-specific gene dependencies, revealing novel mechanisms of cellular differentiation and response to environmental cues. The use of pooled CRISPR screens in single cells also facilitates the analysis of rare cell populations and the study of gene function in cells with limited availability. By integrating single-cell CRISPR screening with advanced cell sorting and computational analysis, researchers can uncover the complex interplay between gene function and cellular behavior, ultimately advancing our understanding of cellular biology and disease mechanisms.", "label": 1}
