{"grounding": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by excess activation of the innate immune system in an antigen-independent manner. Starting with the discovery of the causal gene for familial Mediterranean fever, more than 50\u00a0monogenic SAIDs have been described. These discoveries, paired with advances in immunology and genomics, have allowed our understanding of these diseases to improve drastically in the last decade. The genetic causes of SAIDs are complex and include both germline and somatic pathogenic variants that affect various inflammatory signaling pathways. We provide an overview of the acquired SAIDs from a genetic perspective and summarize the clinical phenotypes and mechanism(s) of inflammation, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by chronic inflammation, often resulting in debilitating symptoms. Recent advances in genetic research have elucidated the complex interplay between monogenic, digenic, and polygenic factors contributing to SAID pathogenesis. Epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations also play a crucial role in modulating disease susceptibility. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of SAID genetics, highlighting the key findings from genome-wide association studies, candidate gene analyses, and epigenetic investigations. By integrating these findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic basis of SAIDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for future treatment strategies.", "label": 1}
