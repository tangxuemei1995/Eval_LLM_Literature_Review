{"grounding": "Antibiotic resistance genes predate the therapeutic uses of antibiotics. However, the current antimicrobial resistance crisis stems from our extensive use of antibiotics and the generation of environmental stressors that impose new selective pressure on microbes and drive the evolution of resistant pathogens that now threaten human health. Similar to climate change, this global threat results from human activities that change habitats and natural microbiomes, which in turn interact with human-associated ecosystems and lead to adverse impacts on human health. Human activities that alter our planet at global scales exacerbate the current resistance crisis and exemplify our central role in large-scale changes in which we are both protagonists and architects of our success but also casualties of unanticipated collateral outcomes. As cognizant participants in this ongoing planetary experiment, we are driven to understand and find strategies to curb the ongoing crises of resistance and climate change.", "generated_text": "The interplay between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change is a pressing concern, as the increasing anthropogenic impact on the environment exacerbates the emergence and spread of AMR. Climate change, driven by human activities, alters ecosystems, leading to the disruption of natural antimicrobial processes and the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The contamination of water sources, soil, and air with antibiotics and antimicrobial residues further contributes to the development of AMR. Conversely, the degradation of environmental habitats and the loss of biodiversity can also facilitate the transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between bacteria. This review synthesizes the current literature on the relationship between AMR and global environmental change, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to address the root causes of AMR and mitigate its consequences. Understanding the complex interactions between AMR and environmental change is crucial for the development of effective strategies to combat this growing public health threat.", "label": 1}
