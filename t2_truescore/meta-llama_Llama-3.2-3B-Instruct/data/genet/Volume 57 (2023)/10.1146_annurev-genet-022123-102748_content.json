{"grounding": "Coral reefs are both exceptionally biodiverse and threatened by climate change and other human activities. Here, we review population genomic processes in coral reef taxa and their importance for understanding responses to global change. Many taxa on coral reefs are characterized by weak genetic drift, extensive gene flow, and strong selection from complex biotic and abiotic environments, which together present a fascinating test of microevolutionary theory. Selection, gene flow, and hybridization have played and will continue to play an important role in the adaptation or extinction of coral reef taxa in the face of rapid environmental change, but research remains exceptionally limited compared to the urgent needs. Critical areas for future investigation include understanding evolutionary potential and the mechanisms of local adaptation, developing historical baselines, and building greater research capacity in the countries where most reef diversity is concentrated.", "generated_text": "Coral reefs, crucial ecosystems providing habitat for a quarter of marine species, are facing unprecedented threats from global change. Climate-driven mass bleaching events and ocean acidification are driving population declines, necessitating an understanding of local adaptation and evolutionary rescue mechanisms. This study employs population genomics to investigate the genetic responses of a coral reef fish species to changing environmental conditions. By analyzing genomic data from populations across a range of environmental gradients, we identify signatures of local adaptation and dispersal patterns. Our results suggest that evolutionary rescue is underway, with populations exhibiting increased genetic diversity and adaptation to changing conditions. These findings have implications for conservation efforts, highlighting the importance of preserving genetic diversity and facilitating dispersal to enhance the resilience of coral reef populations in an age of global change.", "label": 1}
