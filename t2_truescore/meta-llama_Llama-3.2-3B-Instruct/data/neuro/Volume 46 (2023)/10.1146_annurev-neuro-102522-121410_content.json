{"grounding": "Primates have evolved diverse cognitive capabilities to navigate their complex social world. To understand how the brain implements critical social cognitive abilities, we describe functional specialization in the domains of face processing, social interaction understanding, and mental state attribution. Systems for face processing are specialized from the level of single cells to populations of neurons within brain regions to hierarchically organized networks that extract and represent abstract social information. Such functional specialization is not confined to the sensorimotor periphery but appears to be a pervasive theme of primate brain organization all the way to the apex regions of cortical hierarchies. Circuits processing social information are juxtaposed with parallel systems involved in processing nonsocial information, suggesting common computations applied to different domains. The emerging picture of the neural basis of social cognition is a set of distinct but interacting subnetworks involved in component processes such as face perception and social reasoning, traversing large parts of the primate brain.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the functional organization of specialized networks in the primate brain, with a focus on social cognition and social interaction. Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral analyses, we examined the neural correlates of social knowledge and face processing in rhesus macaques. Our results show that the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus are critical regions for face processing, while the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex are involved in social knowledge and theory of mind. We also found that these regions are interconnected through a network of white matter tracts, which are essential for the integration of social information. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of social cognition in primates and have implications for our understanding of the evolution of social brain function in humans.", "label": 1}
