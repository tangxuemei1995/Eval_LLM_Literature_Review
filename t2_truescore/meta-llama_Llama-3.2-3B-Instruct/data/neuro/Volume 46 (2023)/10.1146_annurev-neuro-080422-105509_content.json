{"grounding": "Migraine is a complex neurovascular pain disorder linked to the meninges, a border tissue innervated by neuropeptide-containing primary afferent fibers chiefly from the trigeminal nerve. Electrical or mechanical stimulation of this nerve surrounding large blood vessels evokes headache patterns as in migraine, and the brain, blood, and meninges are likely sources of headache triggers. Cerebrospinal fluid may play a significant role in migraine by transferring signals released from the brain to overlying pain-sensitive meningeal tissues, including dura mater. Interactions between trigeminal afferents, neuropeptides, and adjacent meningeal cells and tissues cause neurogenic inflammation, a critical target for current prophylactic and abortive migraine therapies. Here we review the importance of the cranial meninges to migraine headaches, explore the properties of trigeminal meningeal afferents, and briefly review emerging concepts, such as meningeal neuroimmune interactions, that may one day prove therapeutically relevant.", "generated_text": "Meningeal mechanisms play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of migraine, a complex and debilitating headache disorder. The meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, are involved in the initiation and propagation of migraine attacks. Research has identified the trigeminal nerve, which innervates the meninges, as a key player in the development of migraine. Meningeal afferents, specialized nerve fibers that detect changes in the meninges, contribute to neurogenic inflammation, a hallmark of migraine. Sensitization of these afferents leads to an exaggerated response to normal stimuli, resulting in the characteristic pain and other symptoms of migraine. Cortical spreading depression, a wave of abnormal electrical activity, also plays a role in migraine pathophysiology, contributing to the spread of pain and other symptoms. Understanding the meningeal mechanisms underlying migraine is crucial for the development of effective treatments and prevention strategies.", "label": 1}
