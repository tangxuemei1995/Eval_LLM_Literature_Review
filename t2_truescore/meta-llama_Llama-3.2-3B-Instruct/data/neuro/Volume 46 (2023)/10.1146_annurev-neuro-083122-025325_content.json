{"grounding": "The spinal cord is home to the intrinsic networks for locomotion. An animal in which the spinal cord has been fully severed from the brain can still produce rhythmic, patterned locomotor movements as long as some excitatory drive is provided, such as physical, pharmacological, or electrical stimuli. Yet it remains a challenge to define the underlying circuitry that produces these movements because the spinal cord contains a wide variety of neuron classes whose patterns of interconnectivity are still poorly understood. Computational models of locomotion accordingly rely on untested assumptions about spinal neuron network element identity and connectivity. In this review, we consider the classes of spinal neurons, their interconnectivity, and the significance of their circuit connections along the long axis of the spinal cord. We suggest several lines of analysis to move toward a definitive understanding of the spinal network.", "generated_text": "Spinal interneurons play a crucial role in regulating motor control and locomotion, with a diverse array of neuronal populations contributing to the complex circuitry of the ventral horn. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of interneuronal connectivity in modulating motor output, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting unique expression profiles and synaptic connections. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of spinal interneuron diversity and connectivity, with a focus on their role in motor control and locomotion. We discuss the functional specialization of interneuronal subtypes, including their involvement in rhythmic activity generation, sensory processing, and motor pattern formation. Furthermore, we examine the molecular mechanisms underlying interneuronal connectivity, including synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between spinal interneurons, motor control, and locomotion.", "label": 1}
