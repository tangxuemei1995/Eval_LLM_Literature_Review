{"grounding": "This review explores the interface between circadian timekeeping and the regulation of brain function by astrocytes. Although astrocytes regulate neuronal activity across many time domains, their cell-autonomous circadian clocks exert a particular role in controlling longer-term oscillations of brain function: the maintenance of sleep states and the circadian ordering of sleep and wakefulness. This is most evident in the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where the molecular clock of astrocytes suffices to drive daily cycles of neuronal activity and behavior. In Alzheimer's disease, sleep impairments accompany cognitive decline. In mouse models of the disease, circadian disturbances accelerate astroglial activation and other brain pathologies, suggesting that daily functions in astrocytes protect neuronal homeostasis. In brain cancer, treatment in the morning has been associated with prolonged survival, and gliomas have daily rhythms in gene expression and drug sensitivity. Thus, circadian time is fast becoming critical to elucidating reciprocal astrocytic-neuronal interactions in health and disease.", "generated_text": "Circadian rhythms, regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and overall health. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the brain, have been implicated in the modulation of circadian rhythms through calcium signaling pathways. Recent studies have revealed that astrocytes can act as gliotransmitters, releasing neurotransmitters and signaling molecules that synchronize neural activity with the circadian clock. However, dysregulation of circadian rhythms has been linked to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and glioma. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the complex relationships between circadian rhythms, astrocytes, and gliotransmitters, highlighting both the beneficial and detrimental effects of these interactions. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these relationships, this review seeks to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of circadian-related disorders and potential therapeutic strategies for their treatment.", "label": 1}
