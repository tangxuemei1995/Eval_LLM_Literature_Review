{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires the creation, updating, and expression of memories to depend on context. While the neural underpinnings of each of these processes have been intensively studied, recent advances in computational modeling revealed a key challenge in context-dependent learning that had been largely ignored previously: Under naturalistic conditions, context is typically uncertain, necessitating contextual inference. We review a theoretical approach to formalizing context-dependent learning in the face of contextual uncertainty and the core computations it requires. We show how this approach begins to organize a large body of disparate experimental observations, from multiple levels of brain organization (including circuits, systems, and behavior) and multiple brain regions (most prominently the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and motor cortices), into a coherent framework. We argue that contextual inference may also be key to understanding continual learning in the brain. This theory-driven perspective places contextual inference as a core component of learning.", "generated_text": "Context-dependent learning refers to the ability of individuals to adapt to changing environments and learn from experiences that are specific to particular contexts. Recent advances in computational modeling and neural imaging have shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying this complex cognitive process. This review integrates findings from neuroscience and machine learning to elucidate the computational and neural bases of context-dependent learning. We discuss the role of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus in processing contextual information and updating memory representations. Bayesian inference and neural computation are also examined as key drivers of context-dependent learning. Furthermore, we explore the implications of context-dependent learning for understanding human memory and learning, as well as its applications in artificial intelligence and robotics. By synthesizing insights from multiple disciplines, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying context-dependent learning.", "label": 1}
