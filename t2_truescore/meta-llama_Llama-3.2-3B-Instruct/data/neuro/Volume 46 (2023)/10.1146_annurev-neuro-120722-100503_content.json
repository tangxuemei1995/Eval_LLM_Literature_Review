{"grounding": "Despite increasing evidence of its involvement in several key functions of the cerebral cortex, the vestibular sense rarely enters our consciousness. Indeed, the extent to which these internal signals are incorporated within cortical sensory representation and how they might be relied upon for sensory-driven decision-making, during, for example, spatial navigation, is yet to be understood. Recent novel experimental approaches in rodents have probed both the physiological and behavioral significance of vestibular signals and indicate that their widespread integration with vision improves both the cortical representation and perceptual accuracy of self-motion and orientation. Here, we summarize these recent findings with a focus on cortical circuits involved in visual perception and spatial navigation and highlight the major remaining knowledge gaps. We suggest that vestibulo-visual integration reflects a process of constant updating regarding the status of self-motion, and access to such information by the cortex is used for sensory perception and predictions that may be implemented for rapid, navigation-related decision-making.", "generated_text": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues plays a crucial role in navigation, visual processing, and perception. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of multisensory integration in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the vestibular and visual cortices. This integration enables the brain to accurately estimate self-motion, spatial location, and visual context. In this context, the vestibular system, which detects changes in head position and movement, provides essential information for navigation and balance. Visual cues, on the other hand, offer information about the environment and object recognition. The integration of these cues in the cerebral cortex allows for the creation of a unified perceptual representation, enabling individuals to navigate complex environments and perceive their surroundings accurately. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this integration is essential for developing novel treatments for vestibular disorders and improving navigation and visual processing in individuals with neurological or psychiatric conditions.", "label": 0}
