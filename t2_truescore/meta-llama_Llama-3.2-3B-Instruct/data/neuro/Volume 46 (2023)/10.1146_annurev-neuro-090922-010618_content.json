{"grounding": "In mammals, the activity of neurons in the entorhinal-hippocampal network is modulated by the animal's position and its movement through space. At multiple stages of this distributed circuit, distinct populations of neurons can represent a rich repertoire of navigation-related variables like the animal's location, the speed and direction of its movements, or the presence of borders and objects. Working together, spatially tuned neurons give rise to an internal representation of space, a cognitive map that supports an animal's ability to navigate the world and to encode and consolidate memories from experience. The mechanisms by which, during development, the brain acquires the ability to create an internal representation of space are just beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we examine recent work that has begun to investigate the ontogeny of circuitry, firing patterns, and computations underpinning the representation of space in the mammalian brain.", "generated_text": "The construction of a cognitive map, a mental representation of spatial relationships and navigation, is a complex process involving the coordinated development of neural circuits and computations within the brain. Research has identified the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus as key structures involved in the formation of cognitive maps, with the hippocampus playing a critical role in the initial stages of spatial learning and memory. As the brain matures, the entorhinal cortex integrates information from multiple sources, including sensory inputs and prior experiences, to construct a comprehensive cognitive map. This abstract reviews the current understanding of the development of cognitive maps, highlighting the interplay between the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and discussing the implications for our understanding of spatial navigation and memory. The findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for spatial disorders and cognitive impairments.", "label": 0}
