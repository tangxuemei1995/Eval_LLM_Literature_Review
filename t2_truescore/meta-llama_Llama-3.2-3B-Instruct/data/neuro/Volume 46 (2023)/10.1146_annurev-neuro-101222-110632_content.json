{"grounding": "Examination of cognition has historically been approached from language and introspection. However, human language\u2013dependent definitions ignore the evolutionary roots of brain mechanisms and constrain their study in experimental animals. We promote an alternative view, namely that cognition, including memory, can be explained by exaptation and expansion of the circuits and algorithms serving bodily functions. Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states. Exaptation of such circuits was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche. We illustrate that exploration gives rise to a cognitive map, and in turn, environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning). Such brain-body interactions not only occur during waking but also persist during sleep. These exaptation steps are illustrated by the dual, endocrine-homeostatic and memory, contributions of the hippocampal system, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between the body and brain in the formation and retrieval of memories, focusing on the concept of exaptation. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the role of the hippocampus in memory consolidation and the interplay between sharp-wave ripples, homeostasis, and allostasis in modulating cognitive processes. Our analysis reveals that the body's glucose regulation and autonomic nervous system play a crucial role in shaping memory formation, with implications for the body-brain partnership. Furthermore, we discuss the potential for exaptation of memory, where previously stored information is reactivated and reinterpreted in response to changing physiological states. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex dynamics between the body and brain in memory formation, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between physiological and cognitive processes.", "label": 1}
