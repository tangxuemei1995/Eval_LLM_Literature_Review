{"grounding": "All mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol to maintain membrane integrity. The transport of this hydrophobic lipid is mediated by lipoproteins. Cholesterol is especially enriched in the brain, particularly in synaptic and myelin membranes. Aging involves changes in sterol metabolism in peripheral organs and also in the brain. Some of those alterations have the potential to promote or to counteract the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of general principles of sterol metabolism in humans and mice, the most widely used model organism in biomedical research. We discuss changes in sterol metabolism that occur in the aged brain and highlight recent developments in cell type\u2013specific cholesterol metabolism in the fast-growing research field of aging and age-related diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. We propose that cell type\u2013specific cholesterol handling and the interplay between cell types critically influence age-related disease processes.", "generated_text": "Aging is a complex process that affects various physiological systems, including cholesterol metabolism, leading to an increased risk of age-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in cholesterol homeostasis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism contributing to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a critical role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and maintaining neuronal health. As aging progresses, microglial function declines, leading to impaired cholesterol metabolism and increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of cholesterol metabolism in aging and age-related neurological disorders, with a focus on the role of microglia in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and maintaining neuronal health. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cholesterol metabolism in aging may provide new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of age-related neurological diseases.", "label": 1}
