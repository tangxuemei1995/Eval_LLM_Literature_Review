{"grounding": "The field of stereotactic neurosurgery developed more than 70 years ago to address a therapy gap for patients with severe psychiatric disorders. In the decades since, it has matured tremendously, benefiting from advances in clinical and basic sciences. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe, treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders is currently poised to transition from a stage of empiricism to one increasingly rooted in scientific discovery. Current drivers of this transition are advances in neuroimaging, but rapidly emerging ones are neurophysiological\u2014as we understand more about the neural basis of these disorders, we will more successfully be able to use interventions such as invasive stimulation to restore dysfunctional circuits to health. Paralleling this transition is a steady increase in the consistency and quality of outcome data. Here, we focus on obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, two topics that have received the most attention in terms of trial volume and scientific effort.", "generated_text": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. By modulating neural activity in specific brain regions, DBS aims to alleviate symptoms of these debilitating psychiatric conditions. Studies have shown that DBS can effectively reduce OCD symptoms, including compulsive behaviors and anxiety, in patients who have failed to respond to traditional treatments. Furthermore, DBS has also demonstrated efficacy in treating depression, particularly in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. The precise mechanisms underlying DBS's therapeutic effects are not fully understood, but evidence suggests that it modulates neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin and dopamine, to promote neural plasticity and reduce symptoms. As a minimally invasive procedure, DBS offers a promising alternative to traditional psychiatric treatments, with potential applications in improving the quality of life for individuals with OCD and depression.", "label": 1}
