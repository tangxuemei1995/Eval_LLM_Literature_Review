{"grounding": "Radial cell columns are a hallmark feature of cortical architecture in many mammalian species. It has long been held, based on the lack of orientation columns, that such functional units are absent in rodent primary visual cortex (V1). These observations led to the view that rodent visual cortex has a fundamentally different network architecture than that of carnivores and primates. While columns may be lacking in rodent V1, we describe in this review that modular clusters of inputs to layer 1 and projection neurons in the layers below are prominent features of the mouse visual cortex. We propose that modules organize thalamocortical inputs, intracortical processing streams, and transthalamic communications that underlie distinct sensory and sensorimotor functions.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the integration of feedforward and feedback information streams in the modular architecture of the mouse visual cortex. Utilizing a combination of electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, we examined the role of layer 1 patchy connections and the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in modulating the processing hierarchy. Our results demonstrate that activation of the M2 receptor in layer 1 enhances the convergence of feedforward and feedback information streams, leading to improved processing efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, we found that this modulation is mediated by the strengthening of M2 receptor-preferring connections between layer 1 and subsequent layers. These findings provide novel insights into the functional organization of the mouse visual cortex and have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual processing.", "label": 0}
