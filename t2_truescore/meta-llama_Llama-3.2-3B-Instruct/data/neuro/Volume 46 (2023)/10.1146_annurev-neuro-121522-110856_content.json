{"grounding": "Rapid advances in the neural control of social behavior highlight the role of interconnected nodes engaged in differential information processing to generate behavior. Many innate social behaviors are essential to reproductive fitness and therefore fundamentally different in males and females. Programming these differences occurs early in development in mammals, following gonadal differentiation and copious androgen production by the fetal testis during a critical period. Early-life programming of social behavior and its adult manifestation are separate but yoked processes, yet how they are linked is unknown. This review seeks to highlight that gap by identifying four core mechanisms (epigenetics, cell death, circuit formation, and adult hormonal modulation) that could connect developmental changes to the adult behaviors of mating and aggression. We further propose that a unique social behavior, adolescent play, bridges the preweaning to the postpubertal brain by engaging the same neural networks underpinning adult reproductive and aggressive behaviors.", "generated_text": "Sexually dimorphic social behavior is a complex phenomenon influenced by a multifaceted interplay of genetic, neurochemical, and environmental factors. This review aims to bridge the developmental and adult stages of social behavior, focusing on the neural mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic social behavior. Research has shown that GABA neurons, a key inhibitory neurotransmitter, play a crucial role in regulating social behavior, particularly in the context of aggression and social play. The social behavior network, a network of interconnected brain regions, is also implicated in the regulation of social behavior. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications, mediated by enzymes such as aromatase, have been shown to influence social behavior by modulating gene expression. This review will discuss the current understanding of these neural mechanisms and their developmental origins, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between genetic, neurochemical, and environmental factors in shaping sexually dimorphic social behavior.", "label": 1}
