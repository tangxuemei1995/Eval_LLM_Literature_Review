{"grounding": "Many animals can navigate toward a goal they cannot see based on an internal representation of that goal in the brain's spatial maps. These maps are organized around networks with stable fixed-point dynamics (attractors), anchored to landmarks, and reciprocally connected to motor control. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding these networks, focusing on studies in arthropods. One factor driving recent progress is the availability of the Drosophila connectome; however, it is increasingly clear that navigation depends on ongoing synaptic plasticity in these networks. Functional synapses appear to be continually reselected from the set of anatomical potential synapses based on the interaction of Hebbian learning rules, sensory feedback, attractor dynamics, and neuromodulation. This can explain how the brain's maps of space are rapidly updated; it may also explain how the brain can initialize goals as stable fixed points for navigation.", "generated_text": "This review article explores the neural mechanisms underlying navigation, a complex cognitive process that relies on the integration of multiple sensory inputs and spatial memory. Recent advances in neural network research have shed light on the neural circuits and computations involved in navigation, including the role of head direction cells, dopamine signaling, and path integration. By examining the connections between these components, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how neural networks process spatial information and generate navigational behaviors. Our review highlights the key findings from studies on menotaxis, the ability to navigate through familiar environments, and the neural transformations involved in coordinate transformation, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the neural basis of navigation and its potential applications in robotics and cognitive neuroscience.", "label": 1}
