{"grounding": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified racism as a serious threat to public health. Structural racism is a fundamental cause of inequity within interconnected institutions and the social environments in which we live and develop. This review illustrates how these ethnoracial inequities impact risk for the extended psychosis phenotype. Black and Latinx populations are more likely than White populations to report psychotic experiences in the United States due to social determining factors such as racial discrimination, food insecurity, and police violence. Unless we dismantle these discriminatory structures, the chronic stress and biological consequences of this race-based stress and trauma will impact the next generation's risk for psychosis directly, and indirectly through Black and Latina pregnant mothers. Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions show promise in improving prognosis, but coordinated care and other treatments still need to be more accessible and address the racism-specific adversities many Black and Latinx people face in their neighborhoods and social environments.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of racism and social determinants in the development of psychosis, with a focus on the experiences of marginalized communities. Research suggests that structural racism and neighborhood factors contribute to increased rates of psychotic experiences among individuals of color. This study investigates the relationship between racial discrimination, socioeconomic status, and neighborhood characteristics on the risk of early psychosis. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from a sample of 500 individuals with psychotic experiences and in-depth interviews with 30 community members. Results indicate that exposure to racial discrimination and living in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and crime are associated with an increased risk of early psychosis. The findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive interventions and policy reforms to address the social determinants of psychosis in marginalized communities. The study's results contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between racism and psychosis, and inform the development of targeted prevention and intervention strategies.", "label": 0}
