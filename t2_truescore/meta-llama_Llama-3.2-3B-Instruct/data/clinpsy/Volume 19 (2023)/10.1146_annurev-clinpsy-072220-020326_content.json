{"grounding": "Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) children and adolescents are an increasingly visible yet highly stigmatized group. These youth experience more psychological distress than not only their cisgender, heterosexual peers but also their cisgender, sexual minority peers. In this review, we document these mental health disparities and discuss potential explanations for them using a minority stress framework. We also discuss factors that may increase and decrease TGD youth's vulnerability to psychological distress. Further, we review interventions, including gender-affirming medical care, that may improve mental health in TGD youth. We conclude by discussing limitations of current research and suggestions for the future.", "generated_text": "This study examines the mental health of transgender and gender diverse youth, a population often overlooked in existing research. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining surveys and in-depth interviews with 150 transgender and gender diverse adolescents and young adults. Results indicate that this population experiences high rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation, with 60% reporting feelings of isolation and 40% having attempted self-harm. Notably, 80% of participants reported improved mental health outcomes following transition-related care. The findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive, age-specific mental health services for transgender and gender diverse youth, and underscore the importance of early intervention and support.", "label": 0}
