{"grounding": "Partialing is a statistical approach researchers use with the goal of removing extraneous variance from a variable before examining its association with other variables. Controlling for confounds through analysis of covariance or multiple regression analysis and residualizing variables for use in subsequent analyses are common approaches to partialing in clinical research. Despite its intuitive appeal, partialing is fraught with undesirable consequences when predictors are correlated. After describing effects of partialing on variables, we review analytic approaches commonly used in clinical research to make inferences about the nature and effects of partialed variables. We then use two simulations to show how partialing can distort variables and their relations with other variables. Having concluded that, with rare exception, partialing is ill-advised, we offer recommendations for reducing or eliminating problematic uses of partialing. We conclude that the best alternative to partialing is to define and measure constructs so that it is not needed.", "generated_text": "This study examines the questionable practice of partialing to refine scores on and inferences about measures of psychological constructs. By statistically controlling for residualized variables, researchers often aim to isolate the effects of specific constructs while minimizing the impact of extraneous variables. However, this approach can lead to the suppression of semipartial effects, which are essential for understanding the complex relationships between constructs. The authors argue that partialing can result in biased inferences about construct validity, as it may obscure the presence of residualized variables that can influence the relationships between constructs. The study highlights the need for researchers to critically evaluate the use of partialing and to consider alternative methods that can provide a more nuanced understanding of construct relationships. By doing so, researchers can avoid questionable measurement practice and ensure the accuracy of their inferences about psychological constructs.", "label": 1}
