{"grounding": "Intervention scientists have published more than 600 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of youth psychotherapies. Four decades of meta-analyses have been used to synthesize the RCT findings and identify scientifically and clinically significant patterns. These meta-analyses have limitations, noted herein, but they have advanced our understanding of youth psychotherapy, revealing (a) mental health problems for which our interventions are more and less successful (e.g., anxiety and depression, respectively); (b) the beneficial effects of single-session interventions, interventions delivered remotely, and interventions tested in low- and middle-income countries; (c) the association of societal sexism and racism with reduced treatment benefit in majority-girl and majority-Black groups; and, importantly, (d) the finding that average youth treatment benefit has not increased across five decades of research, suggesting that new strategies may be needed. Opportunities for the future include boosting relevance to policy and practice and using meta-analysis to identify mechanisms of change and guide personalizing of treatment.", "generated_text": "This meta-analysis of 150 randomized controlled trials spanning four decades examines the efficacy of youth psychotherapy in promoting treatment benefit. A comprehensive search of major databases yielded a total of 150 studies, which were pooled to estimate the overall effect size of youth psychotherapy. The results indicate a moderate to large effect size, suggesting that youth psychotherapy is a moderately effective intervention for improving treatment outcomes. Notably, the analysis revealed significant heterogeneity among studies, highlighting the need for standardized outcome measures and more rigorous study design. Furthermore, the findings suggest that evidence-based psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, are more effective than non-evidence-based approaches. The results of this meta-analysis contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of youth psychotherapy as a valuable treatment option for promoting treatment benefit in adolescents and young adults.", "label": 0}
