{"grounding": "Acculturation and psychopathology are linked in integrated, interactional, intersectional, and dynamic ways that span different types of intercultural contact, levels of analysis, timescales, and contexts. A developmental psychopathology approach can be useful to explain why, how, and what about psychological acculturation results in later adaptation or maladaptation for acculturating youth and adults. This review applies a conceptual model of acculturation and developmental psychopathology to a widely used framework of acculturation variables producing an Integrated Process Framework of Acculturation Variables (IP-FAV). This new comprehensive framework depicts major predisposing acculturation conditions (why) as well as acculturation orientations and processes (how) that result in adaptation and maladaptation across the life span (what). The IP-FAV is unique in that it integrates both proximal and remote acculturation variables and explicates key acculturation processes to inform research, practice, and policy.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationship between acculturation and psychopathology in immigrant and refugee populations. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 500 individuals. Proximal acculturation, defined as the adoption of cultural practices and values of the host country, was found to be positively correlated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. In contrast, remote acculturation, characterized by the maintenance of cultural identity and practices from one's country of origin, was associated with enhanced resilience and reduced psychopathology. The findings suggest that the pace and extent of acculturation can have significant implications for mental health outcomes in immigrant and refugee populations. The results have implications for the development of culturally sensitive interventions and policies aimed at promoting mental health and well-being in these vulnerable groups.", "label": 0}
