{"grounding": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often referred to as the \u201cgold standard\u201d treatment for mental health problems, given the large body of evidence supporting its efficacy. However, there are persistent questions about the generalizability of CBTs to culturally diverse populations and whether culturally sensitive approaches are warranted. In this review, we synthesize the literature on CBT for ethnic minorities, with an emphasis on randomized trials that address cultural sensitivity within the context of CBT. In general, we find that CBT is effective for ethnic minorities with diverse mental health problems, although nonsignificant trends suggest that CBT effects may be somewhat weaker for ethnic minorities compared to Whites. We find mixed support for the cultural adaptation of CBTs, but evidence for cultural sensitivity training of CBT clinicians is lacking, given a dearth of relevant trials. Based on the limited evidence thus far, we summarize three broad models for addressing cultural issues when providing CBT to diverse populations.", "generated_text": "Culturally Responsive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CRCBT) is a specialized approach to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) designed to address the unique needs of ethnically diverse populations. This approach emphasizes the importance of clinician training in cultural adaptation and competence to effectively treat individuals from diverse backgrounds. Research has consistently shown that traditional CBT can be ineffective for minority populations due to cultural misalignments and lack of cultural relevance. CRCBT seeks to bridge this gap by incorporating culturally sensitive techniques, assessment tools, and therapeutic strategies tailored to the specific needs of diverse populations. By enhancing clinician training in cultural competence and adaptation, CRCBT aims to reduce mental health disparities and improve treatment outcomes for minority populations. This abstract provides an overview of the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of CRCBT, highlighting its potential to promote culturally responsive care and address the mental health needs of ethnically diverse populations.", "label": 0}
