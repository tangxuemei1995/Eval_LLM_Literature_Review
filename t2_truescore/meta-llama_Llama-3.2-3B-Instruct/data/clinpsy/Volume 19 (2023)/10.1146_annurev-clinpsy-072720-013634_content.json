{"grounding": "Numerous studies associate childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) with adverse adjustment in the domains of mental health, social, and academic functioning. This review synthesizes this literature and highlights the critical role of child self-regulation in mediating children's adjustment outcomes. We discuss major methodological problems of the field, including failure to consider the effects of prenatal IPV exposure and the limitations of variable-oriented and cross-sectional approaches. Finally, we present a comprehensive theoretical model of the effects of IPV on children's development. This model includes three mechanistic pathways\u2014one that is unique to IPV (maternal representations) and two that are consistent with the effects of other stressors (maternal mental health and physiological functioning). In our model, the effects of these three pathways on child adjustment outcomes are mediated through parenting and child self-regulation. Future research directions and clinical implications are discussed in the context of the model.", "generated_text": "This study examines the developmental consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) on children, with a focus on prenatal stress and attachment. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from mothers who experienced IPV during pregnancy with in-depth interviews and observational assessments of child development. Results indicate that children of mothers who experienced prenatal IPV exhibit compromised attachment styles, increased anxiety, and decreased cognitive development. Furthermore, mothers who experienced prenatal IPV reported higher levels of stress and anxiety, which were transmitted to their children through the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The findings suggest that prenatal IPV has a profound impact on child development, highlighting the need for early intervention and support services to mitigate the long-term effects of IPV on children's attachment, emotional, and cognitive development. The study's results have implications for the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent and address the intergenerational transmission of trauma in families affected by IPV.", "label": 1}
