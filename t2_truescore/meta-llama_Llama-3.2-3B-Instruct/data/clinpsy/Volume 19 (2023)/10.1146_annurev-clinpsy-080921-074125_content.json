{"grounding": "While boys and men have historically been underrepresented in eating disorder research, increasing interest and research during the twenty-first century have contributed important knowledge to the field. In this article, we review the epidemiology of eating disorders and muscle dysmorphia (the pathological pursuit of muscularity) in boys and men; specific groups of men at increased risk for eating disorders; sociocultural, psychological, and biological vulnerability factors; and male-specific assessment measures. We also provide an overview of current research on eating disorder and muscle dysmorphia prevention efforts, treatment outcomes, and mortality risk in samples of boys and men. Priorities for future research are including boys and men in epidemiological studies to track changes in incidence, identifying (neuro)biological factors contributing to risk, eliminating barriers to treatment access and utilization, and refining male-specific prevention and treatment efforts.", "generated_text": "Eating disorders among boys and men are a growing concern, with increasing prevalence rates reported in recent years. This disparity in eating disorder diagnosis and treatment has significant implications for the mental and physical health of affected individuals. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that boys and men are less likely to seek help for eating disorders, and when they do, they often receive inadequate treatment. The current epidemiological data suggest that eating disorders among boys and men are associated with a range of negative outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular disease. Effective interventions, such as family-based therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, have shown promise in reducing symptoms and improving outcomes. However, more research is needed to develop culturally sensitive and effective treatment approaches for this underserved population.", "label": 1}
