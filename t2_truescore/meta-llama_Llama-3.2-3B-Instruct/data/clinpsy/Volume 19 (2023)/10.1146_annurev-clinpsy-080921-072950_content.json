{"grounding": "This review updates and extends Gone & Trimble's (2012) prior review of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) mental health. First, it defines AI/AN populations in the USA, with an explanation of the importance of political citizenship in semisovereign Tribal Nations as primary for categorizing this population. Second, it presents an updated summary of what is known about AI/AN mental health, with careful notation of recurrent findings concerning community inequities in addiction, trauma, and suicide. Third, this article reviews key literature about AI/AN community mental health services appearing since 2010, including six randomized controlled trials of recognizable mental health treatments. Finally, it reimagines the AI/AN mental health enterprise in response to an \u201calter-Native psy-ence,\u201d which recasts prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and harnesses postcolonial meaning-making through Indigenized therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, AI/AN Tribal Nations must determine for themselves how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services for wider community benefit.", "generated_text": "The provision of community mental health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) has long been hampered by the imposition of Western, evidence-based practices that fail to account for the unique cultural, historical, and social contexts of these communities. This disparity is exacerbated by the legacy of colonialism, which has led to intergenerational trauma, cultural erasure, and postcolonial anomie. In response, there is a growing need for Indigenized therapies and community mental health services that prioritize AI/AN epistemologies, worldviews, and healing practices. This special issue seeks to reconcile evidence-based practice with alter-Native psy-ence by showcasing innovative approaches to community mental health services that center AI/AN voices, perspectives, and experiences. Through a critical examination of existing literature and innovative research, this collection aims to advance our understanding of the complex interplay between cultural humility, community engagement, and effective mental health care for AI/AN populations.", "label": 1}
