{"grounding": "Research conducted over the past several decades has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the immune system in neural and psychological development and function across the life span. Our goal in this review is to introduce this dynamic area of research to a psychological audience and highlight its relevance for clinical psychology. We begin by introducing the basic physiology of immune-to-brain signaling and the neuroimmune network, focusing on inflammation. Drawing from preclinical and clinical research, we then examine effects of immune activation on key psychological domains, including positive and negative valence systems, social processes, cognition, and arousal (fatigue, sleep), as well as links with psychological disorders (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia). We also consider psychosocial stress as a critical modulator of neuroimmune activity and focus on early life adversity. Finally, we highlight psychosocial and mind\u2013body interventions that influence the immune system and may promote neuroimmune resilience.", "generated_text": "Psychoneuroimmunology is an interdisciplinary field that explores the intricate communication network between the immune system, brain, and behavior. This field of study reveals that immune responses are not isolated to the body, but rather, they have a profound impact on mental health and well-being. The psychoneuroimmunological framework highlights the complex interplay between psychosocial stress, inflammation, and sickness behavior, which are all linked to the development and maintenance of depression. Recent advances in translational science have enabled researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying immune-to-brain communication, providing new insights into the etiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders. This review aims to provide an introduction to the field of psychoneuroimmunology, highlighting its key concepts, methods, and implications for clinical psychology, with a focus on the translational potential of this emerging field.", "label": 1}
