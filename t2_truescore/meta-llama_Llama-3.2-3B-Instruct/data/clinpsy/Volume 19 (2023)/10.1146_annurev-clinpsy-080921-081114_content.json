{"grounding": "For many people worldwide, supernatural beliefs and attributions\u2014those focused on God, the devil, demons, spirits, an afterlife, karma, or fate\u2014are part of everyday life. Although not widely studied in clinical psychology, these beliefs and attributions are a key part of human diversity. This article provides a broad overview of research on supernatural beliefs and attributions with special attention to their psychological relevance: They can serve as coping resources, sources of distress, psychopathology signals, moral guides, and decision-making tools. Although supernatural attributions sometimes involve dramatic experiences seen to violate natural laws, people more commonly think of supernatural entities working indirectly through natural events. A whole host of factors can lead people to make supernatural attributions, including contextual factors, specific beliefs, psychopathology, cognitive styles and personality, and social and cultural influences. Our aim is to provide clinical psychologists with an entry point into this rich, fascinating, and often overlooked literature.", "generated_text": "This study examines the phenomenon of supernatural attributions, where individuals attribute events to divine or malevolent forces, such as God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research explores the complex relationships between supernatural beliefs, paranormal experiences, and spiritual struggles. The findings suggest that supernatural attributions serve as a coping mechanism for individuals navigating life's challenges, providing a sense of meaning and control in the face of uncertainty. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of religion and spiritual experiences in shaping supernatural beliefs and attributions. The results have implications for our understanding of the psychological and social factors underlying supernatural beliefs and the ways in which they influence human behavior and well-being. The study contributes to the ongoing debate about the nature of supernatural experiences and their significance in modern society.", "label": 1}
