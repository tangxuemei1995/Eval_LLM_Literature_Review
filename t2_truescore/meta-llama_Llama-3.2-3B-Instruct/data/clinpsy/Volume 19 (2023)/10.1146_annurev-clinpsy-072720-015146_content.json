{"grounding": "Racism constitutes a significant risk to the mental health of African American children, adolescents, and emerging adults. This review evaluates recent literature examining ethnic and racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity and spirituality, and family and parenting as racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors that shape the impact of racism on youth mental health. Representative studies, purported mechanisms, and critiques of prior research are presented for each factor. Recent studies of racism and resilience revisit foundational resilience factors from prior research while reflecting new and important advances (e.g., consideration of gender, cultural context, structural racism), providing important insights for the development of prevention and intervention efforts and policy that can alleviate mental health suffering and promote health and mental health equity for African American youth.", "generated_text": "This study examines the role of racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors in maintaining African American youth mental health. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from 500 African American youth and in-depth interviews with 30 parents and 20 youth. Results indicate that religiosity, spirituality, and ethnic-racial socialization play significant roles in promoting resilience among African American youth. Parenting practices, such as emotional support and cultural connection, also contribute to youth mental well-being. Conversely, experiences of racism and racial identity confusion were found to negatively impact mental health. The findings suggest that targeted interventions should prioritize cultural and spiritual support, as well as address systemic racism, to promote resilience and improve mental health outcomes among African American youth.", "label": 0}
