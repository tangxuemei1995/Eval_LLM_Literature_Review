{"grounding": "The use of repeated, momentary, real-world assessment methods known as the Experience Sampling Method and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has been broadly embraced over the last few decades. These methods have extended our assessment reach beyond lengthy retrospective self-reports as they can capture everyday experiences in their immediate context, including affect, behavior, symptoms, and cognitions. In this review we evaluate nine conceptual, methodological, and psychometric issues about EMA with the goal of stimulating conversation and guiding future research on these matters: the extent to which participants are actually reporting momentary experiences, respondents\u2019 interpretation of momentary questions, the use of comparison standards in responding, efforts to increase the EMA reporting period beyond the moment to longer periods within a day, training of EMA study participants, concerns about selection bias of respondents, the impact of missing EMA assessments, the reliability of momentary data, and for which purposes EMA might be considered a gold standard for assessment. Resolution of these issues should have far-reaching implications for advancing the field.", "generated_text": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a widely used method for assessing psychological experiences in naturalistic settings. However, concerns regarding the reliability, content validity, and selection bias of EMA have been raised. This study aimed to evaluate the pressing issues in EMA, focusing on the impact of training, missingness, and comparison standards on the validity and reliability of EMA data. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The results showed that inadequate training of EMA participants and researchers led to significant selection bias and missingness, compromising the validity and reliability of the data. Furthermore, the use of comparison standards without a gold standard reference point resulted in biased comparisons. The findings highlight the need for rigorous training, careful data management, and the establishment of a gold standard reference point to ensure the validity and reliability of EMA data. These results have important implications for the development of EMA as a research method and highlight the need for further methodological refinement.", "label": 1}
