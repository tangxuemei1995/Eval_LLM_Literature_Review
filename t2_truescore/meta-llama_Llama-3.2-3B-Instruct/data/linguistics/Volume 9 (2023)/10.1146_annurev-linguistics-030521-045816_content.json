{"grounding": "Socioeconomic status (SES) differences in language development are ubiquitous, but existing research has yet to wrestle with how language gaps reflect (a) differences in relevant concepts for communication, (b) comprehension strategies to access meanings, and (c) production practices that express social identity. In child-directed input, parents use verbs to describe similar concepts across SES, and the largest gaps emerge when frequent meanings are being conveyed. During comprehension, children acquire infrequent aspects of grammar across SES but differ in context-specific strategies for interpreting likely meanings. In production, children are sensitive to sociolinguistic implications and adopt context-specific strategies to signal social identity. This suggests that language is a flexible medium for communicating thoughts and that SES effects signal latent differences in meanings and identities across social classes. Whether language gaps contribute to achievement gaps may depend on the extent to which learning and communication draw on these meanings and value these identities.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and language processing in children, with a focus on syntactic parsing and parental input. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 120 children from diverse SES backgrounds. Results show that children from lower SES backgrounds exhibit delayed syntactic parsing skills compared to their higher SES counterparts. Furthermore, parental input was found to be a significant predictor of syntactic parsing ability, with higher SES parents providing more targeted and explicit language instruction. The findings of this study contribute to the sociolinguistic literature on the impact of SES on language development, highlighting the importance of parental input in bridging the language gap between SES groups. The implications of these results have significant implications for language education policy and practice, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to support language development in disadvantaged populations.", "label": 0}
