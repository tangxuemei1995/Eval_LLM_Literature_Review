{"grounding": "The term homesign has been used to describe the signing of deaf individuals who have not had sustained access to the linguistic resources of a named language. Early studies of child homesigners focused on documenting their manual communication systems through the lens of developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics, but a recent wave of linguistic ethnographic investigations is challenging many of the established theoretical presuppositions that underlie the foundational homesign research. Sparked by a larger critical movement within Deaf Studies led by deaf scholars, this new generation of scholarship interrogates how researchers portray deaf individuals and their communication practices and questions the conceptualization of language in the foundational body of homesign research. In this review, we discuss these contested issues and the current moment of transition within research on homesign.", "generated_text": "This study examines the contested issues surrounding homesign, a unique system of communication used by deaf individuals to convey meaning. Through a mixed-methods approach combining linguistic ethnography and sociolinguistics, we investigate the emergence and use of homesign in Deaf communities. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between homesign and sign language, revealing both similarities and differences in their grammatical structures and communicative functions. We also explore the social and cultural contexts in which homesign is used, including its role in identity formation and community building. The study contributes to our understanding of language emergence and the diverse ways in which humans communicate, challenging traditional notions of language and highlighting the importance of linguistic diversity.", "label": 0}
