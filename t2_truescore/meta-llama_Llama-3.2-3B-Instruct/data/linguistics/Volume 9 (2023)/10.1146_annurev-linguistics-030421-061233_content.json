{"grounding": "Detailed comparative studies have revealed many surface similarities between linguistic communication and the communication of nonhumans. How should we interpret these discoveries in linguistic and cognitive perspective? We review the literature with a specific focus on analogy (similar features and function but not shared ancestry) and homology (shared ancestry). We conclude that combinatorial features of animal communication are analogous but not homologous to natural language. Homologies are found instead in cognitive capacities of attention manipulation, which are enriched in humans, making possible many distinctive forms of communication, including language use. We therefore present a new, graded taxonomy of means of attention manipulation, including a new class we call Ladyginian, which is related to but slightly broader than the more familiar class of Gricean interaction. Only in the latter do actors have the goal of revealing specifically informative intentions. Great ape interaction may be best characterized as Ladyginian but not Gricean.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex phenomenon of animal communication from a linguistic and cognitive perspective, drawing on insights from comparative cognition and the works of prominent researchers such as David Washburn and Ladygina-Kohts. By examining the duality of patterning in animal communication systems, we investigate the generative and non-generative aspects of signaling, highlighting the role of cognitive processes in shaping the structure and function of animal communication. Building on Grice's cooperative principle, we analyze how animals use cues, implicature, and inference to convey meaning and negotiate social relationships. Our analysis reveals that animal communication systems exhibit a range of generative properties, including the ability to create novel expressions and adapt to changing contexts. This research contributes to our understanding of the cognitive and linguistic underpinnings of animal communication, shedding light on the intricate relationships between cognition, language, and social behavior in non-human species.", "label": 0}
