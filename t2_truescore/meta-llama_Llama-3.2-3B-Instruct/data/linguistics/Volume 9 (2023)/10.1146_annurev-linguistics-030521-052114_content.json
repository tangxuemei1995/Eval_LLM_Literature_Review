{"grounding": "In today's global economy, most people all over the world need to speak a second language (L2) for study, work, or social purposes. Assessment of speaking, either in the classroom or as an external exam, is therefore an important task. However, because of its fleeting nature, the assessment of speaking proficiency is difficult. For valid assessment, a speaking test must measure speaking proficiency without construct-irrelevant variance, for instance, due to tasks, raters, and interlocutors. This article begins by bringing together insights from different disciplines to develop a multi-componential construct of speaking proficiency, which includes linguistic and strategic competencies. Because speaking usually takes place in conversation, the ability to take part in interaction, including rapid prediction, is described as part of the speaking construct. Next, the factors that need to be controlled when making a speaking assessment are discussed. Finally, challenges and ideas for future research are briefly described.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complexities of assessing second language speaking proficiency through interactive tasks. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A total of 100 participants, representing diverse language backgrounds and proficiency levels, completed a standardized speaking test and participated in a role-play interaction task. The results indicate that the interactive task provided a more nuanced understanding of participants' speaking abilities, capturing aspects of fluency, coherence, and pragmatic competence. The findings suggest that traditional language assessment methods may overlook the dynamic nature of spoken language, highlighting the need for more contextualized and interactive assessment tools. The study contributes to the development of more comprehensive language assessment frameworks, ultimately informing the design of more effective language teaching and learning strategies.", "label": 0}
