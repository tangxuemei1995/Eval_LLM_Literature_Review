{"grounding": "Opacity is a natural language phenomenon where a phonological process is rendered non-surface-true by virtue of its interaction with other processes. Phonologists have long been fascinated with opaque generalizations both from a typological standpoint (What kinds of non-surface-true generalizations are found?) and a theoretical one (Which formal tools permit an analysis of opacity?). This review aims to (a) discuss the breadth of non-surface-true generalizations in light of phonologists\u2019 (often implicit) working definitions of opacity and (b) address opacity as a flashpoint in one of the larger debates in generative phonology, between the rule-based serial approach of Chomsky & Halle's Sound Pattern of English and constraint-based parallel Optimality Theory. A conclusion offered here is that the well-known problems Optimality Theory faces with some kinds of opacity are due not to its lack of serialism but to the fact that such processes are input-motivated rather than output-motivated.\n", "generated_text": "This study investigates the relationship between serialism and opacity in phonological theory, with a focus on Optimality Theory (OT). Harmonic Serialism, a serialist approach to rule ordering, posits that rules should be ordered based on their harmonic properties. However, this approach can lead to opacity, where the ordering of rules results in an unattainable or undesirable outcome. The present research explores the implications of serialism on opacity in OT, examining the interplay between rule ordering and parallelism. Through a series of experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that serialist approaches to rule ordering can indeed lead to opacity, and that this opacity can be mitigated through the use of parallelism. Our findings have significant implications for the development of phonological theory, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between serialism and opacity in OT.", "label": 1}
