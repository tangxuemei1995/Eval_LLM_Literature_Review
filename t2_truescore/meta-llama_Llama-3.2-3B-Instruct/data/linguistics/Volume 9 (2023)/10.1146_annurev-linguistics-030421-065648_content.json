{"grounding": "Chinese developmental dyslexia (DD) research provides important insights into the language-universal and language-specific mechanisms underlying dyslexia. In this article, we review recent advances in Chinese DD. Converging behavioral evidence suggests that, while phonological and rapid automatized naming deficits are language universal, orthographic and morphological deficits are specific to the linguistic properties of Chinese. At the neural level, hypoactivation in the left superior temporal/inferior frontal regions in dyslexic children across Chinese and alphabetic languages may indicate a shared phonological processing deficit, whereas hyperactivation in the right inferior occipital/middle temporal regions and atypical activation in the left frontal areas in Chinese dyslexic children may indicate a language-specific compensatory strategy for impaired visual-spatial analysis and a morphological deficit in Chinese DD, respectively. The findings call for further theoretical endeavors to understand the language-universal and Chinese-specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying dyslexia and to design more effective and efficient intervention programs.", "generated_text": "Chinese developmental dyslexia has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a growing body of research highlighting the complexities of this condition. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on Chinese developmental dyslexia, focusing on linguistic profiles, brain abnormalities, and susceptibility genes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, incorporating studies published in top-tier journals and databases. The results reveal that Chinese developmental dyslexia exhibits unique linguistic characteristics, including phonological and orthographic processing deficits. Neuroimaging studies have also identified brain abnormalities in individuals with Chinese developmental dyslexia, particularly in regions responsible for language processing. Furthermore, genetic studies have implicated susceptibility genes that may contribute to the development of Chinese developmental dyslexia. The findings of this review suggest that Chinese developmental dyslexia is a complex condition that cannot be fully explained by language-specific factors, but rather is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The review also highlights the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Chinese developmental dyslexia.", "label": 1}
