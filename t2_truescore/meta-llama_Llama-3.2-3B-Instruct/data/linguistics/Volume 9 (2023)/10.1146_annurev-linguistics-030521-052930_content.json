{"grounding": "In this review, we discuss the limits of the concept of the modern nation-state to explore language issues in postcolonial contexts, as in Africa. We argue in favor of a revision of the history of the field of language policy and planning (LPP) and sociolinguistics, paying attention to how the colonial issue has been erased and downplayed. We first explore the colonial history of LPP and how this field contributed to frame African multilingualisms as problems to be solved. Second, we briefly discuss how the contemporary understanding of citizenship in Africa is entangled with the colonial history of a particular version of the state in Africa; we focus on Sudan as an example. We problematize the construct of \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d inscribed in the methodological nationalism that characterizes the early LPP framework, which reverberates in contemporary public policies. By doing so, we advocate for a perspective of language that is historically and locally embedded, following a politics that recognizes the importance of Southern epistemologies to language studies.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of postcolonial language policy and planning (LPP) with the notion of the modern state, drawing on a Southern perspective from Sudan. The modern state is often seen as a universal model, but this study argues that its applicability is limited, particularly in postcolonial contexts. Through a critical discourse analysis of Sudanese language policies, this research highlights the tensions between the dominant Western notion of the modern state and the postcolonial realities of language use and power dynamics. The study reveals how language policies in Sudan reflect the country's complex history of colonialism, neocolonialism, and nation-building. The findings suggest that a postcolonial approach to LPP can provide a more nuanced understanding of language policy and planning in the Global South, one that acknowledges the diversity of language use and the multiple forms of power and resistance. The study contributes to the development of a more inclusive and contextualized understanding of LPP, one that recognizes the limits of the modern state and the importance of Southern perspectives.", "label": 1}
