{"grounding": "The past decade has seen the rapid development of a new approach to pragmatics that attempts to integrate insights from formal and experimental semantics and pragmatics, psycholinguistics, and computational cognitive science in the study of meaning: probabilistic pragmatics. The most influential probabilistic approach to pragmatics is the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework. In this review, I demonstrate the basic mechanics and commitments of RSA as well as some of its standard extensions, highlighting the key features that have led to its success in accounting for a wide variety of pragmatic phenomena. Fundamentally, it treats language as probabilistic, informativeness as gradient, alternatives as context-dependent, and subjective prior beliefs (world knowledge) as a crucial facet of interpretation. It also provides an integrated account of the link between production and interpretation. I highlight key challenges for RSA, which include scalability, the treatment of the boundedness of cognition, and the incremental and compositional nature of language.", "generated_text": "This study employs the Rational Speech Act Framework (RSAF) to investigate the probabilistic and contextual aspects of human communication. Building on computational pragmatics and experimental semantics, RSAF posits that speakers' intentions are shaped by the context in which they utter language. By integrating probabilistic models of context and speech acts, RSAF provides a nuanced framework for understanding the complex interplay between speaker intentions, contextual cues, and listener interpretation. Experimental results from a large-scale study demonstrate the predictive power of RSAF in capturing the nuances of human communication. The findings suggest that RSAF offers a more comprehensive account of context-dependent communication than existing approaches, with implications for the development of more effective human-computer interaction systems and our understanding of the cognitive and social processes underlying human communication. The study contributes to the growing field of probabilistic pragmatics and provides new insights into the rationality of human speech acts.", "label": 1}
