{"grounding": "In response to uncovering brain mechanisms underlying vocal communication and searching for biomarkers for mental illnesses, speech prosody has been increasingly studied in recent years in multiple disciplines, including psycholinguistics. In this article, we provide an up-to-date synthesis of the theoretical foundation and empirical evidence to profile linguistic and emotional prosody in the proper characterization of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. Our review reveals a need to develop theoretically motivated and methodologically integrated approaches to the study of context-driven comprehension and expression of pragmatic-affective prosody, which will help elucidate the core features of socio-communicative problems in individuals with mental disorders. We propose that comprehensive models within and across the conventional cognition-emotion-language trichotomy need to be developed to integrate current findings and guide future research. In particular, there needs to be due emphasis on investigating multisensory and cross-modal effects in normal and pathological prosody research. Our review calls for multidisciplinary efforts to address the challenging issues to inform and inspire the advancement of linguistic theories and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.", "generated_text": "Speech prosody, encompassing the rhythmic, melodic, and intonational aspects of speech, plays a crucial role in communication. Research has shown that individuals with various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and depression, exhibit altered speech prosody patterns. These changes can impact communication effectiveness, social interaction, and overall quality of life. This study investigates the relationship between speech prosody and mental disorders, with a focus on pragmatic and affective prosody. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that individuals with mental disorders tend to exhibit reduced prosody variability, altered prosody contours, and impaired prosody recognition. Furthermore, pragmatic prosody, which is essential for effective communication, is often disrupted in individuals with mental disorders. The findings of this review highlight the importance of considering speech prosody in the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of mental disorders. By understanding the prosody patterns of individuals with mental disorders, clinicians can develop more effective communication strategies and improve treatment outcomes.", "label": 1}
