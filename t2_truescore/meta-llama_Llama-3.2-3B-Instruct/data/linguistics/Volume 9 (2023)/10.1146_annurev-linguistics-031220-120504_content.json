{"grounding": "Language documentation as a subfield of linguistics has arisen over the past roughly two and a half decades more or less simultaneously with the widespread availability of inexpensive hardware and software for creating, storing, and sharing digital objects. Thus, in some ways the history of advancements within the discipline is also a history of how technological tools have been developed, tested, adopted, and eventually abandoned as newer technologies appear. In this article we examine some recent technologies used both for creating documentary resources, usually considered to include recorded language events in a variety of genres and settings and enough annotation to make them decipherable, and for then mobilizing those resources so that they can be used and shared in language learning, reclamation, revitalization, and analysis.", "generated_text": "This study examines recent technological advancements in language documentation, focusing on innovative methods for resource creation and mobilization. The integration of digital tools, such as audio and video recording software, 3D scanning, and virtual reality platforms, has significantly enhanced the documentation process. Additionally, the development of open-source software and online platforms has facilitated collaboration and data sharing among linguists and communities. The abstract highlights the potential of these technologies to democratize language documentation, increase accessibility, and promote linguistic diversity. By exploring the intersection of technology and language documentation, this study aims to contribute to the development of more effective and sustainable language preservation strategies.", "label": 0}
