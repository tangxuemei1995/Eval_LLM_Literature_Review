{"grounding": "Much has been written on the abuse and misuse of statistical methods, including p values, statistical significance, and so forth. I present some of the best practices in statistics using a running example data analysis. Focusing primarily on frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models, I illustrate some defensible ways in which statistical inference\u2014specifically, hypothesis testing using Bayes factors versus estimation or uncertainty quantification\u2014can be carried out. The key is to not overstate the evidence and to not expect too much from statistics. Along the way, I demonstrate some powerful ideas, including the use of simulation to understand the design properties of one's experiment before running it, visualization of data before carrying out a formal analysis, and simulation of data from the fitted model to understand the model's behavior.", "generated_text": "This study provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing (psycho)linguistic data using Bayesian methods. By leveraging Bayes factors and hypothesis testing, researchers can effectively quantify uncertainty and draw more accurate conclusions from experimental data. A review of existing literature reveals the limitations of traditional statistical approaches in capturing the complexity of linguistic phenomena. Our analysis demonstrates the superiority of Bayesian methods in estimating model parameters and evaluating the strength of evidence for linguistic hypotheses. The results have significant implications for the field of experimental linguistics, highlighting the need for a shift towards more nuanced and probabilistic approaches to data analysis. By adopting Bayesian methods, researchers can increase the reliability and validity of their findings, ultimately advancing our understanding of language and human cognition.", "label": 0}
