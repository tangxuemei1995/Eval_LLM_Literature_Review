{"grounding": "Interpreting anaphoric references is a fundamental aspect of our language competence that has long attracted the attention of computational linguists. The appearance of ever-larger anaphorically annotated data sets covering more and more anaphoric phenomena in ever-greater detail has spurred the development of increasingly more sophisticated computational models; as a result, the most recent state-of-the-art neural models are able to achieve impressive performance by leveraging linguistic, lexical, discourse, and encyclopedic information. This article provides a thorough survey of anaphora resolution (coreference) throughout this development, reviewing the available data sets and covering both the preneural history of the field and\u2014in more detail\u2014current neural models, including research on less-studied aspects of anaphoric interpretation such as bridging reference resolution and discourse deixis interpretation.", "generated_text": "This study examines the application of computational models in resolving anaphora, a fundamental aspect of coreference resolution in natural language processing. By leveraging corpora specifically designed for anaphora analysis, we investigate the efficacy of neural models in accurately identifying bridging references and discourse deixis. Our approach employs a multi-task learning framework, where models are trained on a combination of anaphora resolution and Winograd Schema Challenge datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in coreference accuracy, with a notable increase in precision and recall for bridging references. These findings contribute to the development of more sophisticated computational models for anaphora resolution, ultimately enhancing the ability to capture complex discourse structures in human language.", "label": 0}
