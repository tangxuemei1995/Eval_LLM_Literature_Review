{"grounding": "Environmental linguistics is an emerging field at the intersection of linguistics and natural sciences. It recognizes the mutual relationship between cultural and ecological diversity, documenting linguistic structures and verbal practices by which speakers conceptualize, encode, and transmit knowledge about the natural world. It surpasses the largely metaphorical and narrative program of ecolinguistics to position language as the preeminent conceptual framework and channel for environmental knowledge. Natural phenomena\u2014as Indigenous experts explain\u2014cannot be understood apart from the languages that encode them, and vice versa. Language diversity is thus the key to safeguarding biodiversity and a balanced human relationship with nature. Environmental linguistics helps decolonize linguistics as our field evolves to prioritize knowledge coproduction over data extraction. Examples from my fieldwork in Tuva cover six domains of knowledge: landscapes, lifeforms, time, sound, memory, and survival. This article reviews recent literature from many cultures, emphasizing works by Indigenous authors.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of environmental linguistics and native science in the context of Tuva, a region in southern Siberia known for its rich biodiversity and unique cultural heritage. Drawing on decolonization theory, the research examines how traditional knowledge systems in Tuva can inform our understanding of environmental intelligence and the interconnectedness of human and natural systems. Through a critical discourse analysis of indigenous texts and oral traditions, this study reveals the ways in which Tuvan native science has been marginalized and suppressed by dominant Western epistemologies. By centering the voices and perspectives of Tuvan communities, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between language, culture, and the environment, and highlights the importance of decolonizing environmental discourse to promote more inclusive and sustainable approaches to conservation and environmental management.", "label": 0}
