{"grounding": "In linguistics, ethics has long encompassed matters typically covered under regulatory oversight, but it is increasingly understood as relational and reciprocal, conferring responsibilities and obligations that extend beyond the work produced for other researchers. Those who study language are also coming to interrogate their professional responsibilities not only in how research is done but also in how research is conceived, framed, reported, discussed, and taught, as part of larger discussions around decolonization, intersectionality, and social justice. In this article, we review existing literature on ethics in linguistics, both as it relates to research and as it relates to broader practices, which we then situate within ongoing conversations across subfields. The overarching frame for our discussion is that ethical practice and scientific validity are aligned, and that dismantling dominant discourses and normative practices will serve to advance the work linguists do in meaningful ways.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of ethics and linguistics, with a focus on the development of an ethical praxis in the field. Drawing on regulatory ethics and relational ethics, the research highlights the need for linguists to prioritize scientific validity while navigating complex power dynamics and cultural sensitivities. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this investigation reveals the ways in which linguistic research can perpetuate or challenge dominant narratives and social inequalities. The findings emphasize the importance of relational ethics in fostering a more inclusive and equitable research environment, where linguists engage in collaborative and reciprocal relationships with communities and stakeholders. Ultimately, this research contributes to the development of a more nuanced and reflexive understanding of ethics in linguistics, one that prioritizes the well-being and agency of all individuals involved in the research process.", "label": 1}
