{"grounding": "Recent developments in language modeling have enabled large text encoders to derive a wealth of linguistic information from raw text corpora without supervision. Their success across natural language processing (NLP) tasks has called into question the role of man-made computational resources, such as verb lexicons, in supporting modern NLP. Still, probing analyses have concurrently exposed the limitations of the knowledge possessed by the large neural architectures, revealing them to be clever task solvers rather than self-taught linguists. Can human-designed lexical resources still help fill their knowledge gaps? Focusing on verb classification, we discuss approaches to generating verb classes multilingually and weigh the relative benefits of undertaking expensive lexicographic work and outsourcing the task to untrained native speakers. Then, we consider the evidence for the utility of augmenting pretrained language models with external verb knowledge and ponder the ways in which human expertise can continue to benefit multilingual NLP.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the challenges and opportunities of verb classification across languages, with a focus on multilingual Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. By leveraging crowdsourced knowledge augmentation, we develop a novel approach to improve the accuracy of verb classification in low-resource languages. Our method involves collecting labeled data from crowdsourcing platforms and incorporating it into pre-trained NMT models. The results show significant improvements in verb classification accuracy, particularly for low-resource languages. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the overall performance of multilingual NMT systems. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of multilingual NLP models and highlight the potential of crowdsourced knowledge augmentation in bridging the gap between high- and low-resource languages. The proposed approach can be applied to various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.", "label": 1}
