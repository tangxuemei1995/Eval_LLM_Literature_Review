{"grounding": "The physician\u2013patient relationship has evolved significantly in the past century. Physician authority has been reduced while patients have been empowered. This review focuses on face-to-face clinical care and argues that current physician\u2013patient relations range from partnerships between social actors who each play critical roles in negotiating care to a more adversarial duel in which both participants advocate for goals that are not necessarily shared. While the former is the hope of increased patient involvement, the latter is increasingly common. Through our discussion of existing studies, we document that while high levels of patient participation are beneficial to treatment outcomes, this engagement also has a dark side that threatens treatment outcomes. We discuss some communication resources patients use that affect treatment outcomes, exemplify how patient engagement affects physician communication, and discuss some strategies that current research finds effective for communicating about treatment with today's engaged patients.", "generated_text": "Effective health care communication is a crucial factor in determining treatment outcomes, as it enables patients to understand their conditions, make informed decisions, and engage in collaborative care. This study employed conversation analysis to examine the physician-patient interactions in a clinical setting. The results revealed that successful communication was characterized by active listening, clear explanations, and negotiation of treatment plans. Patients who felt heard and understood were more likely to adhere to treatment recommendations and experience improved health outcomes. Conversely, ineffective communication was associated with increased anxiety, mistrust, and non-adherence. The findings highlight the importance of social interaction in shaping treatment outcomes and underscore the need for healthcare providers to adopt a patient-centered approach to communication. By fostering a collaborative and empathetic dialogue, healthcare providers can improve treatment outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction.", "label": 0}
