{"grounding": "A significant advantage of organic semiconductors over many of their inorganic counterparts is solution processability. However, solution processing commonly yields heterogeneous films with properties that are highly sensitive to the conditions and parameters of casting and processing. Measuring the key properties of these materials in situ, during film production, can provide new insight into the mechanism of these processing steps and how they lead to the emergence of the final organic film properties. The excited-state dynamics is often of import in photovoltaic, electronic, and light-emitting devices. This review focuses on single-shot transient absorption, which measures a transient spectrum in a single shot, enabling the rapid measurement of unstable chemical systems such as organic films during their casting and processing. We review the principles of instrument design and provide examples of the utility of this spectroscopy for measuring organic films during their production.", "generated_text": "In situ measurement of evolving excited-state dynamics during the deposition and processing of organic films is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms governing their optical properties. This study presents a novel single-shot transient absorption spectroscopy setup designed for in situ monitoring of organic thin film formation and thermal annealing. Utilizing a femtosecond laser source and a high-speed camera, the setup enables real-time observation of molecular aggregation and excited-state relaxation processes. The results demonstrate the ability to track the evolution of excited-state dynamics during film deposition and thermal annealing, revealing distinct changes in molecular structure and optical properties. These findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of organic thin films for various applications, including optoelectronic devices and solar cells.", "label": 1}
