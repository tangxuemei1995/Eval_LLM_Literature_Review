{"grounding": "Predicting the whole process of a chemical reaction while solving kinetic equations presents an opportunity to realize an on-the-fly kinetic simulation that directly discovers chemical reactions with their product yields. Such a simulation avoids the combinatorial explosion of reaction patterns to be examined by narrowing the search space based on the kinetic analysis of the reaction path network, and would open a new paradigm beyond the conventional two-step approach, which requires a reaction path network prior to performing a kinetic simulation. The authors addressed this issue and developed a practical method by combining the artificial force induced reaction method with the rate constant matrix contraction method. Two algorithms are available for this purpose: a forward mode with reactants as the input and a backward mode with products as the input. This article first numerically verifies these modes for known reactions and then demonstrates their application to the actual reaction discovery. Finally, the challenges of this method and the prospects for ab initio reaction discovery are discussed.", "generated_text": "The Artificial Force Induced Reaction Method (AFIRM) is a novel approach for discovering new reactions through the manipulation of potential energy surfaces. By leveraging quantum chemical calculations and kinetic simulations, AFIRM enables the prediction of reaction pathways and the identification of potential reaction mechanisms. This method involves the use of a reaction path network to model the energy landscape of a reaction system, and the application of artificial forces to perturb the potential energy surface and induce new reaction pathways. The resulting reaction pathways are then simulated to predict the kinetic outcomes of the reactions. In this study, we demonstrate the application of AFIRM to the discovery of new organic synthesis reactions. Our results show that AFIRM can successfully predict novel reaction pathways and identify potential reaction mechanisms, with a high degree of accuracy. The findings of this study have significant implications for the discovery of new reactions and the development of novel synthetic methods in organic chemistry.", "label": 0}
