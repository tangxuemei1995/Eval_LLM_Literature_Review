{"grounding": "Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metallic nanostructures result in subwavelength optical confinement that enhances light\u2013matter interactions, for example, aiding the sensitivity of surface spectroscopies. The dissipation of surface plasmons as electronic and vibrational excitations sets the limit for field confinement but also provides opportunities for photochemistry, photocatalysis, and photothermal heating. Optimization for either goal requires a deeper understanding of this photothermalization process. In this review, we focus on recent insights into the physics and dynamics governing photothermalization of LSPRs in metallic nanostructures, emphasizing comparisons between the steady-state behavior and ultrafast time-resolved studies. The differences between these regimes inform how to best optimize plasmonic systems for applications under relatively low-intensity, continuous illumination (e.g., sunlight).", "generated_text": "Photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures is a complex process involving the generation of nonthermal carriers, such as hot electrons, which can lead to photocatalytic activities. In the steady state, these carriers interact with the surrounding environment, influencing the material's optical and electrical properties. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying photothermalization, focusing on the role of metallic nanoparticles and the impact of Raman thermometry on understanding the thermal dynamics. The interplay between hot electrons, phonons, and the material's lattice is also discussed, highlighting the potential applications of plasmonic nanostructures in photocatalytic processes and thermal management.", "label": 0}
