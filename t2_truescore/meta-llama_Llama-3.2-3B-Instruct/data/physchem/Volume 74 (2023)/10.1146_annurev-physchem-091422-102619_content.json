{"grounding": "The photoacid dynamics of fluorescent proteins include both electronic excited- and ground-state mechanisms of proton transfer. The associated characteristic timescales of these reactions range over many orders of magnitude, and the tunneling, barrier crossing, and relevant thermodynamics have in certain cases been linked to coherent nuclear motion. We review the literature and summarize the experiments and theory that demonstrate proton tunneling in the electronic ground state of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). We also discuss the excited-state proton-transfer reaction of GFP that takes place on the picosecond timescale. Although this reaction has been investigated using several vibrational spectroscopic methods, the interpretation remains unsettled. We discuss recent advances as well as remaining questions, in particular those related to the vibrational mode couplings that involve low-frequency modulations of chromophore vibrations on the timescale of proton transfer.", "generated_text": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a widely used biomarker in biological research, emitting light at a wavelength of 508 nm upon excitation. However, the underlying photoacid dynamics that govern its fluorescence behavior remain poorly understood. Utilizing ultrafast spectroscopic techniques, including stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we investigated the coherence and proton tunneling processes in GFP. Our results reveal a complex interplay between electronic and nuclear dynamics, leading to a non-radiative decay pathway that competes with fluorescence emission. The observed proton tunneling events facilitate the formation of a photoacid state, which in turn influences the fluorescence yield. These findings provide new insights into the ultrafast photochemistry of GFP, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms governing its fluorescence behavior and have significant implications for the design of novel fluorescent probes and biosensors.", "label": 0}
