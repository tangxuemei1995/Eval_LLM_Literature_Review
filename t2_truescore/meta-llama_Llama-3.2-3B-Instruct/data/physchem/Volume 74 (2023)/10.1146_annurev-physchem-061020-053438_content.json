{"grounding": "Modern quantum chemistry algorithms are increasingly able to accurately predict molecular properties that are useful for chemists in research and education. Despite this progress, performing such calculations is currently unattainable to the wider chemistry community, as they often require domain expertise, computer programming skills, and powerful computer hardware. In this review, we outline methods to eliminate these barriers using cutting-edge technologies. We discuss the ingredients needed to create accessible platforms that can compute quantum chemistry properties in real time, including graphical processing units\u2013accelerated quantum chemistry in the cloud, artificial intelligence\u2013driven natural molecule input methods, and extended reality visualization. We end by highlighting a series of exciting applications that assemble these components to create uniquely interactive platforms for computing and visualizing spectra, 3D structures, molecular orbitals, and many other chemical properties.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of machine learning, graphical processing units, and cloud computing to enable interactive quantum chemistry. By leveraging natural user interfaces and chemical structure recognition, users can interactively visualize and manipulate molecular structures, facilitating a deeper understanding of quantum chemical phenomena. The proposed system utilizes cloud computing to process complex quantum chemical calculations, while graphical processing units accelerate the rendering of 3D molecular models.
