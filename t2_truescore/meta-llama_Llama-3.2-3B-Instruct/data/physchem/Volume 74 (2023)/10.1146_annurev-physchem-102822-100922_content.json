{"grounding": "We review our recent quantum stochastic model for spectroscopic lineshapes in the presence of a coevolving and nonstationary background population of excitations. Starting from a field theory description for interacting bosonic excitons, we derive a reduced model whereby optical excitons are coupled to an incoherent background via scattering as mediated by their screened Coulomb coupling. The Heisenberg equations of motion for the optical excitons are then driven by an auxiliary stochastic population variable, which we take to be the solution of an Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process. Here, we present an overview of the theoretical techniques we have developed as applied to predicting coherent nonlinear spectroscopic signals. We show how direct (Coulomb) and exchange coupling to the bath give rise to distinct spectral signatures and discuss mathematical limits on inverting spectral signatures to extract the background density of states.", "generated_text": "Many-body exciton scattering is a fundamental process in quantum optics, where the interaction between excitons and their environment leads to decoherence and dephasing. In this context, the optical signatures of stochastic processes play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of quantum systems. This study employs quantum stochastic calculus to investigate the effects of many-body interactions on the coherent nonlinear spectroscopy of excitons. By analyzing the excitation-induced dephasing, we reveal the intricate interplay between quantum fluctuations and classical noise in the exciton dynamics. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering stochastic processes in the theoretical description of many-body exciton scattering, and provide a framework for the development of more accurate models of quantum optics in complex systems.", "label": 0}
