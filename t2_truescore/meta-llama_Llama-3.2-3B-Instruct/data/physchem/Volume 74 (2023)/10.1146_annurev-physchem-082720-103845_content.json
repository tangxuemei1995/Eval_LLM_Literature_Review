{"grounding": "Gas-phase molecular spectroscopy is a natural playground for accurate quantum-chemical computations. However, the molecular bricks of life (e.g., DNA bases or amino acids) are challenging systems because of the unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with the molecular size (active electrons) and/or the presence of large-amplitude internal motions. From the theoretical point of view, both aspects prevent the brute-force use of very accurate but very expensive state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methodologies. From the experimental point of view, both features lead to congested gas-phase spectra, whose assignment and interpretation are not at all straightforward. Based on these premises, this review focuses on the current status and perspectives of the fully a priori prediction of the spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules (containing up to two dozen atoms) in the gas phase with special reference to rotational and vibrational spectroscopies of some representative molecular bricks of life.", "generated_text": "Gas-phase computational spectroscopy has emerged as a crucial tool for elucidating the molecular structures and properties of biological molecules, often referred to as the'molecular bricks of life'. This field combines advanced computational methods with experimental spectroscopic techniques to investigate the rotational and vibrational spectra of molecules in the gas phase. However, the complexity of biological molecules, characterized by their flexibility and anharmonicity, poses significant challenges for computational spectroscopy. Anharmonicity, in particular, introduces non-linear effects that significantly impact the rotational and vibrational spectra. Recent advances in computational methods, such as coupled-cluster theory and machine learning algorithms, have improved the accuracy of spectroscopic predictions. Nevertheless, further research is needed to fully exploit the potential of gas-phase computational spectroscopy for understanding the molecular structures and properties of biological molecules.", "label": 0}
