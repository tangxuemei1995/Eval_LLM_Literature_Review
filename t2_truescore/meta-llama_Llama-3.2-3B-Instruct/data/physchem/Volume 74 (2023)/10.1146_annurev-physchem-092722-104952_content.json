{"grounding": "Photochemical upconversion is a process whereby two lower-energy photons are converted into a higher-energy photon by sensitized triplet\u2013triplet annihilation. While recent interest in this process has been motivated by improving the efficiencies of solar cells, many applications are being explored. In this review, we address the underlying physicochemical phenomena that are responsible for photochemical upconversion. We review their kinetics, and the requirements for annihilators and sensitizers to design efficient upconversion systems. We discuss the spin physics of the bi-excitonic interactions and how the spin character of the triplet pairs can fundamentally limit the upconversion efficiency and give rise to the magnetic field effect on delayed photoluminescence. Finally, we address light-matter coupling phenomena that could be employed to enhance photochemical upconversion.", "generated_text": "Photochemical upconversion (UC) is a process where a lower-energy photon is converted into a higher-energy photon through a series of photochemical reactions. This phenomenon is achieved through the triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) mechanism, where a triplet state of a sensitizer molecule interacts with a chromophore, resulting in the emission of a higher-energy photon. The spin statistical limit and magnetic field effects play crucial roles in modulating the kinetics and efficiency of UC. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of UC in various applications, including optoelectronics and biomedical imaging. Understanding the kinetics and mechanisms underlying UC is essential for optimizing the performance of UC-based systems and exploring new applications in fields such as energy harvesting and sensing.", "label": 1}
