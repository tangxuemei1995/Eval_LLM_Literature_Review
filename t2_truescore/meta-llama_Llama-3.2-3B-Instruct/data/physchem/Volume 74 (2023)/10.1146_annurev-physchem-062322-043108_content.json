{"grounding": "The magneto-optical signatures of colloidal noble metal nanostructures, spanning both discrete nanoclusters (<2 nm) and plasmonic nanoparticles (>2 nm), exhibit rich structure-property correlations, impacting applications including photonic integrated circuits, light modulation, applied spectroscopy, and more. For nanoclusters, electron doping and single-atom substitution modify both the intensity of the magneto-optical response and the degree of transient spin polarization. Nanoparticle size and morphology also modulate the magnitude and polarity of plasmon-mediated magneto-optical signals. This intimate interplay between nanostructure and magneto-optical properties becomes especially apparent in magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magnetic circular photoluminescence (MCPL) spectroscopic data. Whereas MCD spectroscopy informs on a metal nanostructure's steady-state extinction properties, its MCPL counterpart is sensitive to electronic spin and orbital angular momenta of transiently excited states. This review describes the size- and structure-dependent magneto-optical properties of nanoscale metals, emphasizing the increasingly important role of MCPL in understanding transient spin properties and dynamics.", "generated_text": "The magneto-optical properties of noble metal nanostructures have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in spin-based technologies. This review focuses on the plasmon-mediated magneto-optics of superatoms, which exhibit unique spin-polarized emission and magnetic circular photoluminescence characteristics. Theoretical models and experimental studies demonstrate that the nanostructured geometry of noble metals can give rise to enhanced spin polarization, leading to the observation of magnetic circular dichroism. The review discusses the role of superatoms in modulating the magneto-optical response, including the influence of surface plasmon resonance and spin-orbit coupling. The findings of this review highlight the potential of noble metal nanostructures for the development of spin-based devices, such as spin-based sensors and magnetic data storage devices. The review also discusses the challenges and limitations of current research in this field and future directions for investigation.", "label": 0}
