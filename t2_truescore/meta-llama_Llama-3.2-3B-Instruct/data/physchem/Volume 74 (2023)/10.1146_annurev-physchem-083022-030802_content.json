{"grounding": "Reactions at solid\u2013water interfaces play a foundational role in water treatment systems, catalysis, and chemical separations, and in predicting chemical fate and transport in the environment. Over the last century, experimental measurements and computational models have made tremendous progress in capturing reactions at solid surfaces. The interfacial reactivity of a solid surface, however, can change dramatically and unexpectedly when it is confined to the nanoscale. Nanoconfinement can arise in different geometries such as pores/cages (3D confinement), channels (2D confinement), and slits (1D confinement). Therefore, measurements on unconfined surfaces, and molecular models parameterized based on these measurements, fail to capture chemical behaviors under nanoconfinement. This review evaluates recent experimental and theoretical advances, with a focus on adsorption at solid\u2013water interfaces. We review how nanoconfinement alters the physico-chemical properties of water, and how the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water dictate energetics, pathways, and products of adsorption in nanopores. Finally, the implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.", "generated_text": "The adsorption of ions and molecules at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces is a complex phenomenon influenced by the unique properties of these interfaces. In this context, surface complexation and speciation play crucial roles in determining the adsorption behavior. This review focuses on the recent advances in understanding the adsorption of ions and molecules at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces, with a particular emphasis on the effects of nanoconfinement on surface complexation and speciation. Theoretical models and experimental studies are discussed, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between surface chemistry, electrostatic interactions, and confinement effects. The review also explores the implications of these findings for various applications, including water purification, catalysis, and biotechnology. Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on adsorption at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces and its potential for advancing our understanding of these complex systems.", "label": 1}
