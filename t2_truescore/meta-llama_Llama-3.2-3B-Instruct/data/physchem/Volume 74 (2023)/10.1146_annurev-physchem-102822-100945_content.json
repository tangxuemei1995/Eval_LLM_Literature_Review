{"grounding": "Light-driven phenomena in organic molecular aggregates underpin several mechanisms relevant to optoelectronic applications. Modeling these processes is essential for aiding the design of new materials and optimizing optoelectronic devices. In this review, we cover the use of different atomistic models, excited-state dynamics, and transport approaches for understanding light-activated phenomena in molecular aggregates, including radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. We consider both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms and focus on the role of conical intersections as facilitators of internal conversion. We explore the use of the exciton models for Frenkel and charge transfer states and the electronic structure methods and algorithms commonly applied for excited-state dynamics. Throughout the review, we analyze the approximations employed for the simulation of internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and reverse intersystem crossing rates and analyze the molecular processes behind single fission, triplet-triplet annihilation, Dexter energy transfer, and F\u00f6rster energy transfer.", "generated_text": "Molecular organic aggregates, such as J-aggregates and H-aggregates, have garnered significant attention in the field of optoelectronics due to their potential applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), solar cells, and photovoltaic devices. The excited states of these aggregates play a crucial role in determining their optoelectronic properties. This review article focuses on the theoretical modeling of excited states in molecular organic aggregates, with a particular emphasis on radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. The role of conical intersections and exciton models in understanding the dynamics of excited states is also discussed. Furthermore, the impact of singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation on the optoelectronic properties of these aggregates is examined. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of excited-state dynamics, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential applications of molecular organic aggregates in optoelectronic devices.", "label": 1}
