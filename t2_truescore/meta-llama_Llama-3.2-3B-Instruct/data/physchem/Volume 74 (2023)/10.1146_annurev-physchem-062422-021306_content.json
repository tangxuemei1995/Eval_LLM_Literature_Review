{"grounding": "High-resolution vibrational spectra of C\u2013H, O\u2013H, and N\u2013H stretches depend on both molecular conformation and environment as well as provide a window into the frequencies of many other vibrational degrees of freedom as a result of mode mixing. We review current theoretical strategies that are being deployed to both aid and guide the analysis of the data that are encoded in these spectra. The goal is to enhance the power of vibrational spectroscopy as a tool for probing conformational preferences, hydrogen bonding effects away from equilibrium, and energy flow pathways. Recent years have seen an explosion of new methods and strategies for solving the nuclear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Rather than attempt a comprehensive review, this work highlights specific molecular systems that we have chosen as representing bonding motifs that are important to chemistry and biology. We focus on the choices theoretical chemists make regarding the level of electronic structure theory, the representation of the potential energy surface, the selection of coordinates, preferences in basis sets, and methods of solution.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of anharmonic effects on the vibrational spectra of high-frequency modes in molecular systems. By employing a combination of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the role of mode mixing and anharmonicities in shaping the vibrational spectra of these modes. Our results show that anharmonic effects can lead to significant deviations from harmonic predictions, resulting in the appearance of resonances and broadening of spectral lines. We demonstrate that these effects are particularly pronounced in systems with high-frequency modes, where the vibrational energy levels are closely spaced. The findings of this study have important implications for the interpretation of vibrational spectroscopic data, particularly in the context of high-frequency modes. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between anharmonicities, mode mixing, and vibrational resonances, and highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to modeling high-frequency vibrational spectra.", "label": 0}
