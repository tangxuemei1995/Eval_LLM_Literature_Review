{"grounding": "Surfaces mediate the formation of stable glasses (SGs) upon physical vapor deposition (PVD) for a wide range of glass formers. The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of SGs and their anisotropic packing structures are controlled through the deposition parameters (deposition temperature and rate) as well as the chemical structure and composition of the glass former. The resulting PVD glass properties can therefore be related to the structure and dynamics of the glass surface, which can have oriented packing, enhanced surface diffusion, and a lower glass transition temperature, and can facilitate an enhanced aging rate of the interfacial region. We review our current understanding of the details of this surface-mediated SG formation process and discuss key gaps in our knowledge of glass surface dynamics and their effect on this process.", "generated_text": "The formation of stable glasses is a complex process influenced by surface-mediated equilibration, where the surface properties of the substrate play a crucial role in determining the glass transition temperature and structural anisotropy. This study investigates the surface-mediated formation of stable glasses through physical vapor deposition, focusing on the effects of enhanced surface mobility on glass transition and structural properties. The results show that the introduction of surface-mediated equilibration leads to the formation of stable glasses with enhanced surface mobility, resulting in reduced glass transition temperatures and increased structural anisotropy. These findings have significant implications for the design of stable glasses with tailored properties for various applications, including energy storage and optoelectronics.", "label": 1}
