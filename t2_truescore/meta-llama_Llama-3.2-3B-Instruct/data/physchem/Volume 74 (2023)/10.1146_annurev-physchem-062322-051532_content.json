{"grounding": "Elementary events that determine photochemical outcomes and molecular functionalities happen on the femtosecond and subfemtosecond timescales. Among the most ubiquitous events are the nonadiabatic dynamics taking place at conical intersections. These facilitate ultrafast, nonradiative transitions between electronic states in molecules that can outcompete slower relaxation mechanisms such as fluorescence. The rise of ultrafast X-ray sources, which provide intense light pulses with ever-shorter durations and larger observation bandwidths, has fundamentally revolutionized our spectroscopic capabilities to detect conical intersections. Recent theoretical studies have demonstrated an entirely new signature emerging once a molecule traverses a conical intersection, giving detailed insights into the coupled nuclear and electronic motions that underlie, facilitate, and ultimately determine the ultrafast molecular dynamics. Following a summary of current sources and experiments, we survey these techniques and provide a unified overview of their capabilities. We discuss their potential to dramatically increase our understanding of ultrafast photochemistry.", "generated_text": "The study of elementary molecular events is crucial for understanding the fundamental processes underlying chemical reactions and photochemical transformations. Ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for probing these events, leveraging the high-intensity, coherent radiation from free-electron lasers. By exploiting the unique properties of conical intersections, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy can provide direct insights into the electronic structure and dynamics of molecules. This review article highlights the recent advances in ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy, with a focus on its applications in studying conical intersections and photochemical reactions. Theoretical and experimental approaches are discussed, and the potential of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy is explored for elucidating the mechanisms of elementary molecular events, with implications for our understanding of chemical reactivity and photochemical transformations.", "label": 0}
