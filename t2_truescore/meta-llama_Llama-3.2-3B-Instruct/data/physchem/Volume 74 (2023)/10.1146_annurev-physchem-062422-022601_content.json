{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques are powerful tools to investigate polymer systems. In this review, we address how these techniques have been applied to hydrogel nano- and microparticles, so-called nano- or microgels. We outline which research questions on microgels could be addressed and what new insights could be achieved. Studies of the morphology, shape, and deformation of microgels; their internal compartmentalization; the cross-linker distribution and polarity inside them; and their dynamics and diffusion are summarized. In particular, the abilities to super-resolve structures in three dimensions have boosted the research field and have also allowed researchers to obtain impressive 3D images of deformed microgels. Accessing information beyond 3D localization, such as spectral and lifetime properties and correlative imaging or the combination of data with other methods, shines new light onto polymer systems and helps us understand their complexity in detail. Such future trends and developments are also addressed.", "generated_text": "We present a novel approach for 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging of microgels, utilizing a combination of adaptive optics and structured illumination nanoscopy. By leveraging the unique properties of microgels as adaptive materials, we develop a novel fluorescence labeling strategy that enables high-resolution imaging of microgel networks in three dimensions. Our approach involves the use of a custom-designed adaptive optics system to correct for aberrations and enhance signal-to-noise ratio, followed by structured illumination nanoscopy to achieve super-resolution imaging. Correlative microscopy techniques are employed to track microgel dynamics and morphology in real-time. The resulting 3D images reveal unprecedented details of microgel structure and behavior, providing new insights into the properties of polymer networks and adaptive materials. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging for studying complex microgel systems and opens up new avenues for research in materials science and biomedicine.", "label": 0}
