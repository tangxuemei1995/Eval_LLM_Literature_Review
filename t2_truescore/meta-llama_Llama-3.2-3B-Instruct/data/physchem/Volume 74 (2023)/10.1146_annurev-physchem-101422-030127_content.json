{"grounding": "Phillip L. Geissler made important contributions to the statistical mechanics of biological polymers, heterogeneous materials, and chemical dynamics in aqueous environments. He devised analytical and computational methods that revealed the underlying organization of complex systems at the frontiers of biology, chemistry, and materials science. In this retrospective we celebrate his work at these frontiers.", "generated_text": "This coda honors the scientific legacy of Phillip L. Geissler, a pioneer in the intersection of statistical mechanics, chemical dynamics, and biological systems. Geissler's work in aqueous environments and algorithm development significantly advanced our understanding of complex biological systems, leaving a lasting impact on the field of model development.", "label": 0}
