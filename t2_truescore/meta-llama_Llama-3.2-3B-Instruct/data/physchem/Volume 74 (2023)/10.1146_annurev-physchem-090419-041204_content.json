{"grounding": "The processes of genome expression, regulation, and repair require direct interactions between proteins and DNA at specific sites located at and near single-stranded\u2013double-stranded DNA (ssDNA\u2013dsDNA) junctions. Here, we review the application of recently developed spectroscopic methods and analyses that combine linear absorbance and circular dichroism spectroscopy with nonlinear 2D fluorescence spectroscopy to study the local conformations and conformational disorder of the sugar-phosphate backbones of ssDNA\u2013dsDNA fork constructs that have been internally labeled with exciton-coupled cyanine (iCy3)2 dimer probes. With the application of these methods, the (iCy3)2 dimer can serve as a reliable probe of the mean local conformations and conformational distributions of the sugar-phosphate backbones of dsDNA at various critical positions. The results of our studies suggest a possible structural framework for understanding the roles of DNA breathing in driving the processes of protein\u2013DNA complex assembly and function.", "generated_text": "Site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder in various biological contexts. By incorporating site-specific fluorescence labels, this technique enables the probing of specific DNA sequences and their interactions with proteins, thereby providing insights into DNA replication and protein-DNA interactions. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of this approach in elucidating the conformational dynamics of DNA, including DNA breathing and breathing-like motions. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of DNA structure and function, and have the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with DNA conformational disorders. Further research is needed to fully explore the capabilities and limitations of this technique, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing DNA conformational dynamics.", "label": 1}
