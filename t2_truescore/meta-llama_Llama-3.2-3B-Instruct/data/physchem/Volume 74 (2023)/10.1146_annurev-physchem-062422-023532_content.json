{"grounding": "Interaction analysis techniques, including the many-body expansion (MBE), symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, and energy decomposition analysis, allow for an intuitive understanding of complex molecular interactions. We review these methods by first providing a historical context for the study of many-body interactions and discussing how nonadditivities emerge from Hamiltonians containing strictly pairwise-additive interactions. We then elaborate on the synergy between these interaction analysis techniques and the development of advanced force fields aimed at accurately reproducing the Born\u2013Oppenheimer potential energy surface. In particular, we focus on ab initio\u2013based force fields that aim to explicitly reproduce many-body terms and are fitted to high-level electronic structure results. These force fields generally incorporate many-body effects through (a) parameterization of distributed multipoles, (b) explicit fitting of the MBE, (c) inclusion of many-atom features in a neural network, and (d) coarse-graining of many-body terms into an effective two-body term. We also discuss the emerging use of the MBE to improve the accuracy and speed of ab initio molecular dynamics.", "generated_text": "The accurate representation of intermolecular interactions in aqueous systems is crucial for understanding various biological and chemical phenomena. This study explores the synergies between interaction analysis techniques and force field development, focusing on the many-body effects in aqueous systems. By employing a combination of experimental and computational methods, we investigate the limitations of current polarizable force fields and develop a novel many-body expansion approach. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of intermolecular interactions, particularly for systems involving hydrogen bonding and water dimerization. The proposed many-body expansion is validated through molecular dynamics simulations, showcasing enhanced stability and structural accuracy. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the development of more realistic force fields for aqueous systems, paving the way for further research in fields such as protein-ligand interactions and aqueous-phase chemistry. The proposed approach offers a promising avenue for improving the accuracy of simulations in aqueous environments.", "label": 0}
