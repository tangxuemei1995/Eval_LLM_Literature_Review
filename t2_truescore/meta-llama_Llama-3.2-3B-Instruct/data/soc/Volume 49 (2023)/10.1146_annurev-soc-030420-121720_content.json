{"grounding": "The global dimensions of diasporic politics and state response have generated a large, interdisciplinary literature. Yet, scholars struggle to find the most productive conceptual tools, as one literature, at point of origin, studies emigration and the other, at point of destination, studies immigration. The transnational turn in the social sciences four decades ago propelled scholars to study cross-border political mobilization by viewing immigration and emigration as two sides of the same coin. This article provides a guide to this scholarship. We show how the political nature of cross-border movements creates and circumscribes conditions for diasporic political mobilization. We then identify the different types of cross-border political activities and the modalities of corresponding home state policies. We conclude by reflecting how the world today has changed since the geopolitical moment in which the transnational turn was born and what these changes mean for studying immigrant and emigrant cross-border politics.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex dynamics of cross-border politics, focusing on the mobilization of diasporic communities and the state's response to their activism. Through a critical analysis of transnationalism and geopolitics, this research explores how diasporic groups navigate their homeland and host country relationships, influencing the trajectory of emigrant politics. The intersection of nationalism and transnationalism is also investigated, highlighting the tensions between state sovereignty and diasporic identity. Drawing on case studies of various diasporic communities, this research reveals the multifaceted nature of diasporic mobilization, from advocacy for homeland rights to transnational solidarity. The state response to diasporic activism is also scrutinized, highlighting the ways in which governments navigate the complexities of cross-border politics and the implications for homeland and host country relations. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of diasporas in shaping geopolitics and the evolving nature of nationalism in the 21st century.", "label": 1}
