{"grounding": "The ongoing pandemic and quickening climate crisis make it difficult to overstate the significance of science and science policy to our world. These global catastrophes have laid bare the fragility of science's legitimacy and its dependence on broader cultural understandings and institutional norms. Challenges to science's legitimacy are numerous and daunting in the early twenty-first century but also nothing new. This review interrogates science as culture in our highly fragmented and polarized social environment, and the idea that scientific knowledge and expertise are experiencing a profound and accelerating legitimacy crisis. The challenges are internal and external to the production of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the publicly financed sector in colleges and universities worldwide. Internal threats include fraud, replicability, knowledge diffusion and equability, disciplinary fragmentation, and overproduction. Equally important are the external threats, such as polarization, authoritarianism, religious beliefs, information technology, and economic capital\u2014commanding financial flows to organized science. While sociology is uniquely situated to study these composite issues, it faces sobering challenges and its own scientific legitimacy crisis.", "generated_text": "The legitimacy of science is a multifaceted concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of public policy and cultural discourse. This study examines the relationship between science, knowledge, and legitimacy, with a focus on the polarization of scientific opinions in the public sphere. Through a critical discourse analysis of media reports and public statements, this research reveals how the legitimacy of science is shaped by cultural and social factors, including the representation of science in the media and the role of science in public policy. The findings suggest that the polarization of scientific opinions is often driven by a perceived mismatch between scientific knowledge and public values, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between science, knowledge, and legitimacy. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the social and cultural contexts that shape the legitimacy of science and informs strategies for promoting public trust in science.", "label": 1}
