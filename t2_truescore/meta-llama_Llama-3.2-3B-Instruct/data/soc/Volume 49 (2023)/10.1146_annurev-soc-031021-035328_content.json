{"grounding": "Policing and punishment are unevenly distributed across geographic space. Research analyzing place-based variation in the criminal legal system is increasing, asking how community conditions contribute to variation in criminal justice outcomes and how multiple criminal justice exposures (e.g., policing and punishment) vary together in places. In this article, we identify spatial-contextual analyses of the criminal legal system and summarize their contributions by organizing them by their three major approaches: those emphasizing crime, urban ecology, or social control. We describe challenges the subfield faces, including an overemphasis on large cities and an overcommitment to analyzing criminal justice institutions like police or prisons discretely, when they are often experienced cumulatively and simultaneously. We call for research that transcends received institutional divisions, generates recommendations for stakeholders at multiple scales, makes greater use of formal spatial modeling, and analyzes places across the urban-rural continuum.", "generated_text": "This study undertakes a spatial-contextual analysis of the criminal legal system, examining the interplay between policing, punishment, and place. Through a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative data, we investigate how spatial contexts influence the exercise of policing and punishment. Our research reveals that the spatial distribution of crime, policing strategies, and punishment outcomes are shaped by factors such as urban planning, socioeconomic status, and institutional policies. We demonstrate how the built environment and social contexts interact to produce disparate outcomes for different populations, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the spatial dimensions of the criminal legal system. Our findings have implications for the development of more effective and equitable policing and punishment strategies, and underscore the importance of considering the spatial context in which these practices occur.", "label": 0}
