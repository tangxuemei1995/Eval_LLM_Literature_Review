{"grounding": "This article considers the large range of empirical research that has emerged under the broad aegis of ethnomethodology, in the period between the publication of Studies in Ethnomethodology (1967) and the present day. Starting with a brief overview of Garfinkel's intellectual career, we discuss the relation of ethnomethodology to Sch\u00fctz's phenomenology, Parsons's systems theory, and Weber's concern with meaning construction. A central concern was with the problem of contextuality, which Garfinkel initially addressed by drawing on, while fashioning in his own way, Mannheim's concern with the documentary method of interpretation. Ethnomethodologically-related studies have proliferated in a variety of domains, including conversation analysis, membership categorization analysis, and (related to Garfinkel's own early work) empirical initiatives in the study of everyday life involving racial, gender and other minoritized groups. Further ethnomethodological studies emerged from legal environments, from social problems and deviance, and in relation to ability differences. Still other investigations concerned instructed action and its ramifications for the sciences, technology and organizations, including the workplace. A longstanding concern for ethnomethodology has been with the conduct of social sciences\u2014how coding is done, how surveys are conducted, and how standardization is achieved. Many of these areas have given rise to thriving subfields, have dedicated journals, and resulted in applications. Few initiatives in sociological theory have resulted in a wider range of innovative research than Garfinkel's and successor studies showing, explicating, and demonstrating the organization of details in social life and their consequences for social order.", "generated_text": "This abstract provides an overview of the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology, a sociological approach that examines the methods and practices of everyday social interaction. Ethnomethodology, pioneered by Harold Garfinkel, has had a profound impact on the field of conversation analysis, which has in turn influenced various studies of science, organizations, and the workplace. By examining the instructed actions and rules that govern social behavior, ethnomethodologists have shed light on the ways in which individuals and groups construct and negotiate meaning in everyday interactions. The legacy of ethnomethodology can be seen in the work of scholars such as Anselm Strauss and Erving Goffman, who have applied the approach to the study of organizations and institutions. However, ethnomethodology's focus on the micro-level details of social interaction has also led to criticisms of its relevance to broader social and political issues. As the field continues to evolve, ethnomethodologists are exploring new avenues for research, including the application of conversation analysis to the study of technology and the internet. Ultimately, the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology offer a nuanced understanding of the complex ways in which social interaction shapes our understanding of the world around us. By examining the rules and instructed actions that govern everyday life, ethnomethodologists can provide insights into the ways in which social structures and institutions are constructed and negotiated.", "label": 1}
