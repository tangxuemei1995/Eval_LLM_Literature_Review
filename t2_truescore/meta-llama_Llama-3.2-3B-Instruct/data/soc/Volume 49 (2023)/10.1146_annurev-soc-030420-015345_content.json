{"grounding": "This article reviews recent advances in causal inference relevant to sociology. We focus on a selective subset of contributions aligning with four broad topics: causal effect identification and estimation in general, causal effect heterogeneity, causal effect mediation, and temporal and spatial interference. We describe how machine learning, as an estimation strategy, can be effectively combined with causal inference, which has been traditionally concerned with identification. The incorporation of machine learning in causal inference enables researchers to better address potential biases in estimating causal effects and uncover heterogeneous causal effects. Uncovering sources of effect heterogeneity is key for generalizing to populations beyond those under study. While sociology has long emphasized the importance of causal mechanisms, historical and life-cycle variation, and social contexts involving network interactions, recent conceptual and computational advances facilitate more principled estimation of causal effects under these settings. We encourage sociologists to incorporate these insights into their empirical research.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in causal inference and machine learning, highlighting their interplay in estimating treatment effects and addressing treatment effect heterogeneity. By leveraging counterfactuals and mediation analysis, researchers can better understand the complex relationships between treatment variables and outcome variables. Machine learning techniques, such as propensity score matching and gradient boosting, have been employed to improve the accuracy of causal inference. However, extrapolation of results to new populations and contexts remains a significant challenge. External validity is increasingly recognized as a critical concern in causal inference, particularly when using machine learning methods. This review discusses the current state of the field, highlighting key challenges and opportunities for future research, and provides a roadmap for integrating causal inference and machine learning to improve the validity and generalizability of treatment effect estimates.", "label": 1}
