{"grounding": "I got hooked on sociology as a 20-year-old. Engaging with the world as a sociologist, together with colleagues, comrades, and students, has been immensely rewarding for six decades. My work has centered primarily on what were once called developing countries and now comprise the Global South. This article recounts my sociological adventures, from efforts to understand the world as I found it in the early 1960s to my responses to current reactionary trends. I start with my earlier work\u2014Dependent Development (1979) and Embedded Autonomy (1995)\u2014and then move to more recent efforts to construct paradigms of progressive twenty-first-century possibilities. I discuss, first, how a 21st century developmental state might incorporate deliberation and state-society synergies to expand human capabilities, and second, how an amalgam of global and national labor movements together with transnational advocacy networks might pursue a counter-hegemonic globalization capable of confronting global neoliberal capitalism.", "generated_text": "This 60-year journey in comparative political economy has traversed the complexities of embedded autonomy and its evolution into counter-hegemonic globalization. Through a critical examination of dependent development and the state-society synergy of developmental states, this research has identified the transformative power of transnational advocacy networks in shaping global economic policies. Drawing on autobiographical accounts of key figures, this study reveals the intricate dynamics of power and resistance that have characterized the trajectory of globalization. By juxtaposing the embedded autonomy of the 1950s and 1960s with the counter-hegemonic forces of the present day, this research offers a nuanced understanding of the ongoing struggle for economic justice and democracy. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intersections between globalization, development, and social change, highlighting the need for more inclusive and equitable global economic systems.", "label": 0}
