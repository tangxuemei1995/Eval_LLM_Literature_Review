{"grounding": "Robust literatures separately estimate school effects and neighborhood effects on children's educational, economic, health, and other outcomes that measure well-being. A growing body of research acknowledges that both contexts matter and considers neighborhoods and schools jointly. In this review, we synthesize the array of results that emerge from these studies and critique the tendency for researchers to evaluate which matters more, neighborhoods versus schools. We propose a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes. We argue that contextual effects research would be enriched by considering local neighborhood\u2013school structures: the ways that families choose neighborhoods and schools and that neighborhoods and schools mutually and cyclically constitute one another. We conclude with recommendations for bringing neighborhood\u2013school structures to bear on both outcomes-oriented studies of neighborhood and school effects as well as studies of contextual selection and segregation.", "generated_text": "This study introduces a novel framework for investigating the interplay between neighborhood and school structures, shedding light on the complex relationships between social contexts and educational outcomes. By examining the intersection of neighborhood effects and school effects, our research aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how social segregation influences student achievement and school performance. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data, we analyze the relationships between neighborhood characteristics, school demographics, and student academic results. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the social contexts in which schools operate, and underscore the importance of considering the broader neighborhood environment in educational policy and practice. By exploring the dynamics between neighborhood-school structures, this research contributes to a more informed discussion of the social determinants of educational success.", "label": 0}
