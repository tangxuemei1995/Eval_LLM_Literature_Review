{"grounding": "Age as an individual characteristic is ubiquitous in social science research because it has important associations with numerous outcomes of interest. Yet age is rarely treated as a phenomenon that requires explanation or theoretical attention. To advance research in sociology and beyond, we bring together previously siloed literatures on the conceptualization and measurement of age. Our framework presents age as a system of inequality that can be understood through concepts and processes that operate at multiple levels of analysis. At the individual level, we argue age is best conceptualized and operationalized as multidimensional. We review a range of measures, from birth cohort to physical appearance, that can be fruitfully combined in empirical research to account for this complexity. The multidimensionality of age also highlights how it is \u201cdone\u201d in interactions, connecting the social construction of age to the intersectional production of inequality.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex and multifaceted concept of age, exploring its social construction and implications for understanding aging and life course dynamics. Drawing on intersectional and demographic perspectives, the research highlights how age is shaped by stratification, power relations, and social context. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and empirical data, this study reveals how age is constructed and measured, and how these constructions impact individual and collective experiences of aging. The findings emphasize the need for a nuanced understanding of age that takes into account the intersections of age with other social factors, such as gender, class, and ethnicity. By examining the social construction of age, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the life course and its relationship to demographic and social change, ultimately informing more effective policies and interventions aimed at promoting healthy aging and social inclusion.", "label": 1}
