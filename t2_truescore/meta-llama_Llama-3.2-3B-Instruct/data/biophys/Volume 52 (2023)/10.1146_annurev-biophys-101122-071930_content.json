{"grounding": "Many proteins contain large structurally disordered regions or are entirely disordered under physiological conditions. The functions of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often involve interactions with other biomolecules. An important emerging effort has thus been to identify the molecular mechanisms of IDP interactions and how they differ from the textbook notions of biomolecular binding for folded proteins. In this review, we summarize how the versatile tool kit of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy can aid the investigation of these conformationally heterogeneous and highly dynamic molecular systems. We discuss the experimental observables that can be employed and how they enable IDP complexes to be probed on timescales from nanoseconds to hours. Key insights include the diverse structural and dynamic properties of bound IDPs and the kinetic mechanisms facilitated by disorder, such as fly-casting; disorder-mediated encounter complexes; and competitive substitution via ternary complexes, which enables rapid dissociation even for high-affinity complexes. We also discuss emerging links to aggregation, liquid\u2013liquid phase separation, and cellular processes, as well as current technical advances to further expand the scope of single-molecule spectroscopy.", "generated_text": "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) are proteins that lack a fixed three-dimensional structure, exhibiting dynamic behavior and interacting with other molecules through transient and reversible binding events. Single-molecule F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) spectroscopy provides a unique platform to investigate the interaction dynamics of IDPs with their binding partners. This study employed single-molecule FRET to investigate the binding kinetics and dynamics of IDPs with their target proteins. Our results reveal that IDPs form disordered complexes with their target proteins, characterized by transient and reversible binding events. Molecular simulations were used to model the binding kinetics and provide insights into the structural rearrangements of IDPs during binding. The findings of this study provide new insights into the interaction dynamics of IDPs and have implications for our understanding of protein-protein interactions in various biological contexts. The results also highlight the potential of single-molecule FRET spectroscopy as a powerful tool for investigating the binding kinetics and dynamics of IDPs.", "label": 1}
