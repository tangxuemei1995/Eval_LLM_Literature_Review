{"grounding": "Cooperativity (homotropic allostery) is the primary mechanism by which evolution steepens the binding curves of biomolecular receptors to produce more responsive input\u2013output behavior in biomolecular systems. Motivated by the ubiquity with which nature employs this effect, over the past 15 years we, together with other groups, have engineered this mechanism into several otherwise noncooperative receptors. These efforts largely aimed to improve the utility of such receptors in artificial biotechnologies, such as synthetic biology and biosensors, but they have also provided the first quantitative, experimental tests of longstanding ideas about the mechanisms underlying cooperativity. In this article, we review the literature on the design of this effect, paying particular attention to the design strategies involved, the extent to which each can be rationally applied to (and optimized for) new receptors, and what each teaches us about the origins and optimization of this important phenomenon.", "generated_text": "Cooperative receptors, where the binding of one ligand induces a conformational change that enhances the affinity for subsequent ligands, are a crucial component of various biological systems. Rational design of cooperative receptors is essential for the development of novel biosensors and bioengineering applications. This review focuses on recent advances in the design and engineering of cooperative receptors, including the use of aptamers and binding-induced folding. Allosteric modulation and population shift strategies have been employed to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of these receptors. The design of cooperative receptors has also been influenced by advances in synthetic biology, enabling the construction of complex biological systems. By integrating principles from biochemistry, biophysics, and engineering, researchers can create cooperative receptors with tailored properties, opening up new avenues for biosensing, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications.", "label": 1}
