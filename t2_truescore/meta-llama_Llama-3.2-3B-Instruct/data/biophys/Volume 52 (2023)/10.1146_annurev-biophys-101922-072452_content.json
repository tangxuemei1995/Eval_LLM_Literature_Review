{"grounding": "Faithful translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein is essential to maintain protein homeostasis in the cell. Spontaneous translation errors are very rare due to stringent selection of cognate aminoacyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the tight control of the mRNA reading frame by the ribosome. Recoding events, such as stop codon readthrough, frameshifting, and translational bypassing, reprogram the ribosome to make intentional mistakes and produce alternative proteins from the same mRNA. The hallmark of recoding is the change of ribosome dynamics. The signals for recoding are built into the mRNA, but their reading depends on the genetic makeup of the cell, resulting in cell-specific changes in expression programs. In this review, I discuss the mechanisms of canonical decoding and tRNA\u2013mRNA translocation; describe alternative pathways leading to recoding; and identify the links among mRNA signals, ribosome dynamics, and recoding.", "generated_text": "The ribosome plays a central role in decoding and recoding mRNA sequences during protein synthesis. Through its interaction with transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, the ribosome recognizes and interprets the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA, translating them into the corresponding amino acids. The ribosome's decoding process is mediated by the EF-Tu and EF-G proteins, which facilitate the binding and release of tRNA molecules. Recent studies have revealed that the ribosome can also engage in frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, allowing for the translation of alternative open reading frames and the rescue of stalled translation. Understanding the kinetics of these processes is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying ribosome-mediated recoding and its implications for protein synthesis and cellular function. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on ribosome-mediated decoding and recoding of mRNA sequences, with a focus on the roles of EF-Tu, EF-G, and the kinetics of these processes.", "label": 1}
