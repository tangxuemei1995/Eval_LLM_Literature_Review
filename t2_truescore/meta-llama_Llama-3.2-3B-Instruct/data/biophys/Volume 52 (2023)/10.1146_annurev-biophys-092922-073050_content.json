{"grounding": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are critical intracellular immune receptors in both animals and plants. Perception of pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals induces NLR oligomerization to form multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes in animals or resistosomes in plants to mediate host immune response. Significant progress has been made during the past few years in our understanding of NLR biology, particularly the structural perspective of these two types of NLR-containing complexes. In this article, we review the latest advances in our structural knowledge of how NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are activated and assembled and how the structural information provides insight into their distinct mechanisms of action. Commonalities and differences between NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are also discussed.", "generated_text": "NLR (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domains-containing) resistosomes and inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play crucial roles in the innate immune response to microbial infections. Recent studies have elucidated the assembly and architecture of these complexes, revealing a dynamic interplay between autoinhibitory and activatory mechanisms. The resistosome channel, formed by the NLR protein, regulates the flow of NADase holoenzymes into the inflammasome, modulating its activation status. Ligand recognition by NLR proteins triggers a conformational change, releasing autoinhibitory peptides and allowing the inflammasome to assemble and activate. Understanding the assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes is essential for elucidating the mechanisms of innate immunity and developing therapeutic strategies against inflammatory diseases.", "label": 1}
