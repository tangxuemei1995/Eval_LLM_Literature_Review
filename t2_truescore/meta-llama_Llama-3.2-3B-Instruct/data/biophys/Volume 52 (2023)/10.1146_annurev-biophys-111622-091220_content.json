{"grounding": "Diffusion is a pervasive process present in a broad spectrum of cellular reactions. Its mathematical description has existed for nearly two centuries and permits the construction of simple rules for evaluating the characteristic timescales of diffusive processes and some of their determinants. Although the term diffusion originally referred to random motions in three-dimensional (3D) media, several biological diffusion processes in lower dimensions have been reported. One-dimensional (1D) diffusions have been reported, for example, for translocations of various proteins along DNA or protein (e.g., microtubule) lattices and translation of helical peptides along the coiled-coil interface. Two-dimensional (2D) diffusion has been shown for dynamics of proteins along membranes. The microscopic mechanisms of these 1\u20133D diffusions may vary significantly depending on the nature of the diffusing molecules, the substrate, and the interactions between them. In this review, we highlight some key examples of 1\u20133D biomolecular diffusion processes and illustrate the roles that electrostatic interactions and intrinsic disorder may play in modulating these processes.", "generated_text": "Protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices is a crucial process that governs various cellular functions, including DNA search and transcription. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of electrostatics and disordered regions in modulating protein diffusion. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices, with a focus on the role of electrostatics and disordered regions. We discuss the impact of electrostatic interactions on protein diffusion, including the effects of charged residues and ionizable groups. Additionally, we examine the role of disordered regions, such as flexible loops and coils, in facilitating protein diffusion. Our analysis reveals that electrostatics and disordered regions can significantly influence protein diffusion rates and patterns, with implications for understanding DNA search and transcription. The findings of this review have important implications for the development of computational models and experimental approaches to study protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices.", "label": 1}
