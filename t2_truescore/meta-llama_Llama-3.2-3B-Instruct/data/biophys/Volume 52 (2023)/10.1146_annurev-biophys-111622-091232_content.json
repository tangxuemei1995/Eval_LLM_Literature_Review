{"grounding": "ABC transporters are essential for cellular physiology. Humans have 48 ABC genes organized into seven distinct families. Of these genes, 44 (in five distinct families) encode for membrane transporters, of which several are involved in drug resistance and disease pathways resulting from transporter dysfunction. Over the last decade, advances in structural biology have vastly expanded our mechanistic understanding of human ABC transporter function, revealing details of their molecular arrangement, regulation, and interactions, facilitated in large part by advances in cryo-EM that have rendered hitherto inaccessible targets amenable to high-resolution structural analysis. As a result, experimentally determined structures of multiple members of each of the five families of ABC transporters in humans are now available. Here we review this recent progress, highlighting the physiological relevance of human ABC transporters and mechanistic insights gleaned from their direct structure determination. We also discuss the impact and limitations of model systems and structure prediction methods in understanding human ABC transporters and discuss current challenges and future research directions.", "generated_text": "Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a crucial role in maintaining lipid homeostasis, drug extrusion, and overall human health. These membrane proteins utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport a wide range of substrates across cellular membranes. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the high-resolution structural characterization of human ABC transporters, revealing intricate mechanisms of substrate recognition and translocation. Structural studies have also highlighted the importance of specific residues and domains in regulating transporter activity and substrate specificity. Furthermore, the functional implications of these structural findings have been validated through biochemical and cellular assays. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of human ABC transporter structure and mechanism, with a focus on the implications for human disease and drug development. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of these transporters is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and the optimization of existing treatments.", "label": 1}
