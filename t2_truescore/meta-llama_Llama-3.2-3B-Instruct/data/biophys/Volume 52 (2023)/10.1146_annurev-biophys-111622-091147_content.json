{"grounding": "Large biomolecular systems are at the heart of many essential cellular processes. The dynamics and energetics of an increasing number of these systems are being studied by computer simulations. Pushing the limits of length- and timescales that can be accessed by current hard- and software has expanded the ability to describe biomolecules at different levels of detail. We focus in this review on the ribosome, which exemplifies the close interplay between experiment and various simulation approaches, as a particularly challenging and prototypic nanomachine that is pivotal to cellular biology due to its central role in translation. We sketch widely used simulation methods and demonstrate how the combination of simulations and experiments advances our understanding of the function of the translation apparatus based on fundamental physics.", "generated_text": "The ribosome, a crucial component of the translation machinery in cells, poses a significant challenge for computational modeling due to its complex structure and dynamic behavior. This study employs a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data to investigate the ribosome's conformational changes during translation. By integrating cryo-EM structures with molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate the ribosome's conformational dynamics and interactions with antibiotics. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and suggest potential strategies for the development of novel therapeutic agents. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the ribosome's complex behavior and its role in translation, with implications for the design of more effective treatments for bacterial infections.", "label": 1}
