{"grounding": "Hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods have become indispensable tools for the study of biomolecules. In this article, we briefly review the basic methodological details of QM/MM approaches and discuss their applications to various energy transduction problems in biomolecular machines, such as long-range proton transports, fast electron transfers, and mechanochemical coupling. We highlight the particular importance for these applications of balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Using several recent examples, we illustrate the value and limitations of QM/MM methodologies for both ground and excited states, as well as strategies for calibrating them in specific applications. We conclude with brief comments on several areas that can benefit from further efforts to make QM/MM analyses more quantitative and applicable to increasingly complex biological problems.", "generated_text": "This study employs a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach to investigate energy transduction in biomolecular machines. By combining the strengths of quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics, the QM/MM method allows for the accurate simulation of electronic and nuclear processes in complex biological systems. The method is applied to model proton transfers, electron transfers, and nucleotide hydrolysis in biomolecular machines, with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of energy transduction. The results show that the QM/MM method is capable of accurately predicting the energy landscape of these processes, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of biomolecular machines. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of biological energy transduction and the development of novel biomimetic systems.", "label": 0}
