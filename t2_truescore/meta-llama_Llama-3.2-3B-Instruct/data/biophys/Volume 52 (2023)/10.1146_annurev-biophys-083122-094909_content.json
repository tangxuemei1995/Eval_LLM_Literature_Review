{"grounding": "Rhodopsin is the photoreceptor in human rod cells responsible for dim-light vision. The visual receptors are part of the large superfamily of G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate signal transduction in response to diverse diffusible ligands. The high level of sequence conservation within the transmembrane helices of the visual receptors and the family A GPCRs has long been considered evidence for a common pathway for signal transduction. I review recent studies that reveal a comprehensive mechanism for how light absorption by the retinylidene chromophore drives rhodopsin activation and highlight those features of the mechanism that are conserved across the ligand-activated GPCRs.", "generated_text": "Rhodopsin, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), plays a crucial role in initiating visual transduction in the retina. Upon activation by 11-cis retinal, a conformational change in the receptor's structure triggers a signaling cascade. This cascade involves the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein, activation of downstream effectors, and subsequent generation of a visual signal. The precise mechanism of rhodopsin activation has been elucidated through a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies. Understanding the molecular basis of rhodopsin activation is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for visual disorders.", "label": 1}
