{"grounding": "Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has matured into a robust method for the determination of biological macromolecule structures in the past decade, complementing X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Constant methodological improvements in both cryo-EM hardware and image processing software continue to contribute to an exponential growth in the number of structures solved annually. In this review, we provide a historical view of the many steps that were required to make cryo-EM a successful method for the determination of high-resolution protein complex structures. We further discuss aspects of cryo-EM methodology that are the greatest pitfalls challenging successful structure determination to date. Lastly, we highlight and propose potential future developments that would improve the method even further in the near future.", "generated_text": "High-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized the field of structural biology by enabling the determination of atomic-resolution 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes. This technique has overcome the limitations of traditional cryo-EM by reducing optical aberrations and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the prospects of cryo-EM are not without limitations, including the need for sophisticated sample preparation and the potential for artifacts introduced during the imaging process. Despite these challenges, advances in cryo-EM technology have led to significant improvements in resolution and accuracy, paving the way for further elucidation of the complex structures of biological molecules.", "label": 1}
