{"grounding": "Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have marked only the beginning of the potential of this technique. To bring structure into cell biology, the modality of cryo-electron tomography has fast developed into a bona fide in situ structural biology technique where structures are determined in their native environment, the cell. Nearly every step of the cryo-focused ion beam-assisted electron tomography (cryo-FIB-ET) workflow has been improved upon in the past decade, since the first windows were carved into cells, unveiling macromolecular networks in near-native conditions. By bridging structural and cell biology, cryo-FIB-ET is advancing our understanding of structure\u2013function relationships in their native environment and becoming a tool for discovering new biology.", "generated_text": "Cryo-electron tomography (CET) has revolutionized the field of structural biology by enabling the high-resolution, in situ imaging of complex cellular structures. By reconstructing 3D models of cells and their organelles, CET provides unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture of cells. This technique has been successfully applied to various cell types, revealing the intricate relationships between different cellular components. Biophysical modeling and quantitative cell biology approaches have further enhanced the understanding of CET data, allowing for the prediction of molecular interactions and dynamics. The integration of CET with these approaches has the potential to transform our understanding of cellular function and disease mechanisms.", "label": 1}
