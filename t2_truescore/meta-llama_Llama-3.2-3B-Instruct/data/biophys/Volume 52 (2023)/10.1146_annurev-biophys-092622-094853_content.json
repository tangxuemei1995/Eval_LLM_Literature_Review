{"grounding": "Mitochondria are involved in multiple cellular tasks, such as ATP synthesis, metabolism, metabolite and ion transport, regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, signaling, and inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. The majority of the correct functioning of mitochondria is based on the large electrochemical proton gradient, whose component, the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, is strictly controlled by ion transport through mitochondrial membranes. Consequently, mitochondrial function is critically dependent on ion homeostasis, the disturbance of which leads to abnormal cell functions. Therefore, the discovery of mitochondrial ion channels influencing ion permeability through the membrane has defined a new dimension of the function of ion channels in different cell types, mainly linked to the important tasks that mitochondrial ion channels perform in cell life and death. This review summarizes studies on animal mitochondrial ion channels with special focus on their biophysical properties, molecular identity, and regulation. Additionally, the potential of mitochondrial ion channels as therapeutic targets for several diseases is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial ion channels play a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. These channels, including calcium, potassium, chloride, and porin channels, facilitate the exchange of ions across the mitochondrial inner membrane, influencing mitochondrial membrane potential, pH, and reactive oxygen species production. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of mitochondrial megachannels, which are large pores formed by the assembly of multiple porin subunits, in modulating mitochondrial calcium uptake and release. The dysregulation of mitochondrial ion channels has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of mitochondrial ion channels and their interactions with other mitochondrial proteins is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on mitochondrial ion channels, their functions, and their implications in human disease.", "label": 1}
