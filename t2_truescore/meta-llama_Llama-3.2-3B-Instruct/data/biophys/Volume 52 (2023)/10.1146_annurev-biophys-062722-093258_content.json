{"grounding": "Efforts to combine theory and experiment to advance our knowledge of molecular processes relevant to biophysics have been considerably enhanced by the contribution of statistical-mechanics simulations. Key to the understanding of such molecular processes is the underlying free-energy change. Being able to accurately predict this change from first principles represents an appealing prospect. Over the past decades, the synergy between steadily growing computational resources and unrelenting methodological developments has brought free-energy calculations into the arsenal of tools commonly utilized to tackle important questions that experiment alone has left unresolved. The continued emergence of new options to determine free energies has also bred confusion amid the community of users, who may find it difficult to choose the best-suited algorithm to address the problem at hand. In an attempt to clarify the current landscape, this review recounts how the field has been shaped and how the broad gamut of methods available today is rooted in a few foundational principles laid down many years ago.Three examples of molecular processes central to biophysics illustrate where free-energy calculations stand and what are the conceptual and practical obstacles that we must overcome to increase their predictive power.", "generated_text": "The description of molecular processes, such as permeation and conformational transitions, is crucial in understanding various biological and chemical phenomena. Free energy methods, including importance sampling and enhanced sampling, have emerged as powerful tools for simulating these processes. Importance sampling techniques, such as weighted ensemble methods and umbrella sampling, enable the exploration of high-energy regions, while enhanced sampling methods, like parallel tempering and replica exchange, facilitate the convergence of simulations. Recognition and association methods, which involve the identification of relevant molecular interactions, have also been employed to enhance the accuracy of free energy calculations. The application of these methods has been demonstrated in various systems, including protein-ligand binding, membrane permeation, and conformational transitions. By leveraging the strengths of these approaches, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of molecular processes, ultimately informing the design of novel therapeutics and materials. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of free energy methods for the description of molecular processes, highlighting their importance and potential applications.", "label": 1}
