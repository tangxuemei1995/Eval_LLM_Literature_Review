{"grounding": "The recent proliferation of cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques has led to the cryo-ET resolution revolution. Meanwhile, significant efforts have been made to improve the identification of targets in the cellular context and the throughput of cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Together, these developments led to a surge of in situ discoveries on how enveloped viruses are assembled and how viruses interact with cells in infected hosts. In this article, we review the recent advances in cryo-ET, high-resolution insights into virus assembly, and the findings from inside infected eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.", "generated_text": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has revolutionized the field of structural biology by enabling the high-resolution imaging of intact biological samples. Recent advancements in cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) sample preparation have further enhanced the resolution and accuracy of cryo-ET, facilitating the discovery of novel viral structures and dynamics. This technology has led to a surge of in situ virological discoveries, revealing the intricate mechanisms of viral replication and transmission. The integration of cryo-ET and cryo-FIB has opened new avenues for understanding viral biology and has the potential to transform our understanding of viral diseases.", "label": 1}
