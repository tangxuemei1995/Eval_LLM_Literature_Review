{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy allows the investigation of cellular structures at nanoscale resolution using light. Current developments in super-resolution microscopy have focused on reliable quantification of the underlying biological data. In this review, we first describe the basic principles of super-resolution microscopy techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), and then give a broad overview of methodological developments to quantify super-resolution data, particularly those geared toward SMLM data. We cover commonly used techniques such as spatial point pattern analysis, colocalization, and protein copy number quantification but also describe more advanced techniques such as structural modeling, single-particle tracking, and biosensing. Finally, we provide an outlook on exciting new research directions to which quantitative super-resolution microscopy might be applied.", "generated_text": "Quantitative Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized the field of nanoscopy by enabling the visualization of individual molecules with unprecedented resolution. By leveraging advanced computational algorithms and machine learning techniques, SMLM allows for the accurate quantification of molecular localization and dynamics in living cells. This abstract reviews the current state of quantitative SMLM, highlighting its applications in quantitative cell biology, including the study of protein localization, trafficking, and interactions. We discuss the key challenges and limitations of SMLM, including photobleaching, photodamage, and computational complexity, and explore strategies for overcoming these hurdles. The future of SMLM holds great promise for advancing our understanding of cellular biology and its potential applications in fields such as medicine and biotechnology.", "label": 1}
