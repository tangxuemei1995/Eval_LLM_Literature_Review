{"grounding": "The advent of biotechnology has enabled metabolic engineers to assemble heterologous pathways in cells to produce a variety of products of industrial relevance, often in a sustainable way. However, many pathways face challenges of low product yield. These pathways often suffer from issues that are difficult to optimize, such as low pathway flux and off-target pathway consumption of intermediates. These issues are exacerbated by the need to balance pathway flux with the health of the cell, particularly when a toxic intermediate builds up. Nature faces similar challenges and has evolved spatial organization strategies to increase metabolic pathway flux and efficiency. Inspired by these strategies, bioengineers have developed clever strategies to mimic spatial organization in nature. This review explores the use of spatial organization strategies, including protein scaffolding and protein encapsulation inside of proteinaceous shells, toward overcoming bottlenecks in metabolic engineering efforts.", "generated_text": "Theoretical and practical aspects of multienzyme organization and encapsulation are crucial for advancing metabolic engineering. Bacterial microcompartments, protein scaffolds, and other biotechnological tools enable the compartmentalization of metabolic pathways, enhancing efficiency and product yield. This review synthesizes the current understanding of multienzyme organization, focusing on the theoretical frameworks and practical applications of these systems. Theoretical models, such as the 'catalytic site density' and 'enzyme loading' approaches, are discussed in relation to protein scaffold design and microcompartment formation. Practical aspects, including the engineering of metabolic pathways, protein expression, and microcompartment assembly, are also examined. The review highlights recent advances in the field, including the development of novel protein scaffolds and microcompartment types, and their potential applications in biotechnological processes, such as biofuel production and bioremediation. The integration of theoretical and practical knowledge is essential for the design of efficient and scalable metabolic engineering systems.", "label": 1}
