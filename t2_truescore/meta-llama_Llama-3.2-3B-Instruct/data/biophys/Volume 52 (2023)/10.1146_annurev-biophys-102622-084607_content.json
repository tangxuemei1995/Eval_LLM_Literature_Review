{"grounding": "Advances in a scientific discipline are often measured by small, incremental steps. In this review, we report on two intertwined disciplines in the protein structure prediction field, modeling of single chains and modeling of complexes, that have over decades emulated this pattern, as monitored by the community-wide blind prediction experiments CASP and CAPRI. However, over the past few years, dramatic advances were observed for the accurate prediction of single protein chains, driven by a surge of deep learning methodologies entering the prediction field. We review the mainscientific developments that enabled these recent breakthroughs and feature the important role of blind prediction experiments in building up and nurturing the structure prediction field. We discuss how the new wave of artificial intelligence\u2013based methods is impacting the fields of computational and experimental structural biology and highlight areas in which deep learning methods are likely to lead to future developments, provided that major challenges are overcome.", "generated_text": "The prediction of 3D structures of proteins and protein complexes has become a crucial aspect of structural biology, with significant implications for understanding protein function and disease mechanisms. However, the accuracy and reliability of these predictions remain a subject of ongoing debate. This critical assessment evaluates the current methods and tools used for protein structure prediction, with a focus on their strengths and limitations. A comprehensive analysis of the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) and Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) experiments reveals that artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown significant promise in improving prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, the evaluation of protein interactions remains a challenging task, with many methods exhibiting poor performance. This review highlights the current state of the field, discusses the key challenges and limitations, and provides recommendations for future research directions to improve the accuracy and reliability of protein structure prediction and interaction prediction methods.", "label": 1}
