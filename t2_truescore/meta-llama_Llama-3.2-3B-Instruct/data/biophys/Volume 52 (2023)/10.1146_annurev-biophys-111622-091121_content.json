{"grounding": "An ideal biosensor material at room temperature, with an extremely large surface area per unit mass combined with the possibility of harnessing quantum mechanical attributes, would be comprised of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials. The sensing of a variety of sizes and types of biomolecules involves modulation of the electrical charge density of (current through) the 2D material and manifests through specific components of the capacitance (resistance). While sensitive detection at the single-molecule level, i.e., at zeptomolar concentrations, may be achieved, specificity in a complex mixture is more demanding. Attention should be paid to the influence of inevitably present defects in the 2D materials on the sensing, as well as calibration of obtained results with acceptable standards. The consequent establishment of a roadmap for the widespread deployment of 2D material\u2013based biosensors in point-of-care platforms has the potential to revolutionize health care.", "generated_text": "Graphene and two-dimensional materials have emerged as promising platforms for biomolecule sensing due to their unique properties, including high specific surface area (SSA) and density of states (DOS). The integration of these materials into field effect transistors (FETs) enables the detection of biomolecules through changes in electrical conductivity. However, the sensitivity and selectivity of these devices are often limited by defects and impurities. To overcome these challenges, standardized protocols for material synthesis and device fabrication are essential. Recent studies have employed impedance models to investigate the effects of defects on FET performance, revealing a correlation between defect density and biomolecule binding. By optimizing material properties and device design, graphene-based FETs have shown great promise for biomolecule sensing applications, including label-free detection and real-time monitoring. Further research is needed to standardize the fabrication and characterization of graphene-based biosensors to unlock their full potential.", "label": 1}
