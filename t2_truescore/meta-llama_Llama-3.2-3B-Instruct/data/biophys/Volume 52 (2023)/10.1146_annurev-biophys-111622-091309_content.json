{"grounding": "The Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90 chaperone families are ancient, highly conserved, and critical to cellular protein homeostasis. Hsp40 chaperones can transfer their protein clients to Hsp70, and Hsp70 can transfer clients to Hsp90, but the functional benefits of these transfers are unclear. Recent structural and mechanistic work has opened up the possibility of uncovering how Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90 work together as unified system. In this review, we compile mechanistic data on the ER J-domain protein 3 (ERdj3) (an Hsp40), BiP (an Hsp70), and Grp94 (an Hsp90) chaperones within the endoplasmic reticulum; what is known about how these chaperones work together; and gaps in this understanding. Using calculations, we examine how client transfer could impact the solubilization of aggregates, the folding of soluble proteins, and the triage decisions by which proteins are targeted for degradation. The proposed roles of client transfer among Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp90 chaperones are new hypotheses, and we discuss potential experimental tests of these ideas.", "generated_text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical organelle responsible for protein folding, modification, and quality control. A coordinated system of molecular chaperones, including Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90, plays a pivotal role in maintaining ER homeostasis. This system functions in concert to facilitate protein folding, prevent protein aggregation, and regulate protein degradation. Hsp40 chaperones interact with Hsp70, which then binds to client proteins, facilitating their folding or unfolding. Hsp90, a co-chaperone of Hsp70, enhances the stability and activity of its client proteins. The coordinated action of this Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp90 system ensures the proper folding and quality control of ER-resident proteins, preventing ER stress and promoting cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of this system has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of ER protein quality control.", "label": 0}
