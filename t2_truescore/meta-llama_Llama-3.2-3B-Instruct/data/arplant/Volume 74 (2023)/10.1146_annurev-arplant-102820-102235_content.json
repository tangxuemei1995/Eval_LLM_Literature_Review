{"grounding": "Temperature is a key environmental cue that influences the distribution and behavior of plants globally. Understanding how plants sense temperature and integrate this information into their development is important to determine how plants adapt to climate change and to apply this knowledge to the breeding of climate-resilient crops. The mechanisms of temperature perception in eukaryotes are only just beginning to be understood, with multiple molecular phenomena with inherent temperature dependencies, such as RNA melting, phytochrome dark reversion, and protein phase change, being exploited by nature to create thermosensory signaling networks. Here, we review recent progress in understanding how temperature sensing in four major pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana occurs: vernalization, cold stress, thermomorphogenesis, and heat stress. We discuss outstanding questions in the field and the importance of these mechanisms in the context of breeding climate-resilient crops.", "generated_text": "Temperature sensing in plants is a crucial mechanism for regulating growth, development, and stress responses. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely used model organism, thermosensors play a pivotal role in thermomorphogenesis, the process by which plants adapt to changing temperatures. This study investigates the role of thermosensors in heat and cold stress responses in Arabidopsis. We found that thermosensors are activated in response to both heat and cold stress, triggering a signaling cascade that regulates gene expression and stress responses. Our results demonstrate that thermomorphogenesis is a complex process involving multiple thermosensors and signaling pathways. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature sensing in plants and have implications for understanding plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions.", "label": 1}
