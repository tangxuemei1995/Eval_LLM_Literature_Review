{"grounding": "The aboveground parts of terrestrial plants are colonized by a variety of microbes that collectively constitute the phyllosphere microbiota. Decades of pioneering work using individual phyllosphere microbes, including commensals and pathogens, have provided foundational knowledge about how individual microbes adapt to the phyllosphere environment and their role in providing biological control against pathogens. Recent studies have revealed a more complete repertoire of phyllosphere microbiota across plant taxa and how plants respond to and regulate the level and composition of phyllosphere microbiota. Importantly, the development of several gnotobiotic systems is allowing causative and mechanistic studies to determine the contributions of microbiota to phyllosphere health and productivity. New insights into how the phyllosphere carries out key biological processes, including photosynthesis, biomass accumulation, reproduction, and defense against biotic and abiotic insults, in either the presence or absence of a normal microbiota could unleash novel plant- and microbiota-based technologies to improve agriculturally relevant traits of crop plants.", "generated_text": "The phyllosphere microbiome, comprising microorganisms residing on plant surfaces, plays a crucial role in plant health and immunity. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between phytobiomes and their host plants, including the exchange of nutrients and signaling molecules. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the phyllosphere microbiome, has been linked to various plant diseases and reduced plant immunity. Endophytes, microorganisms living within plant tissues, contribute to plant defense against pathogens and abiotic stresses. Epiphytes, microorganisms growing on plant surfaces, can also modulate plant immunity and nutrient uptake. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the phyllosphere microbiome, its dynamics, and its impact on plant health and immunity. We discuss the mechanisms of phytobiome-endophyte interactions and the consequences of dysbiosis on plant immunity, highlighting the potential for phytobiome manipulation as a novel approach to improve plant health and resistance to diseases.", "label": 1}
