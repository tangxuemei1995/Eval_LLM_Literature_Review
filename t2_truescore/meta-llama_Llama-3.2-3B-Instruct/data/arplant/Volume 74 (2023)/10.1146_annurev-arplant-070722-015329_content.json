{"grounding": "Plant hormones are a group of small signaling molecules produced by plants at very low concentrations that have the ability to move and function at distal sites. Hormone homeostasis is critical to balance plant growth and development and is regulated at multiple levels, including hormone biosynthesis, catabolism, perception, and transduction. In addition, plants move hormones over short and long distances to regulate various developmental processes and responses to environmental factors. Transporters coordinate these movements, resulting in hormone maxima, gradients, and cellular and subcellular sinks. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of most of the characterized plant hormone transporters with respect to biochemical, physiological, and developmental activities. We further discuss the subcellular localizations of transporters, their substrate specificities, and the need for multiple transporters for the same hormone in the context of plant growth and development.", "generated_text": "Plant hormone transport and localization are crucial for maintaining hormone homeostasis and regulating plant growth and development. Phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), and ethylene (ET), play vital roles in various physiological processes. The transport of these signaling molecules is mediated by a family of transporters, which facilitate their movement across cell membranes and between tissues. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying hormone transport, including the role of auxin transporters in regulating cell elongation and division. The localization of hormone transporters is also critical, with specific transporters localized to distinct tissues and cell types. Understanding the complex interactions between hormone transport and localization is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth and development, and for developing strategies to improve crop yields and plant productivity.", "label": 1}
