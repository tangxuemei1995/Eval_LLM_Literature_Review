{"grounding": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) genes encode ion channels with demonstrated roles in electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling. The expansion of the GLR family along the lineage of land plants, culminating in the appearance of a multiclade system among flowering plants, has been a topic of interest since their discovery nearly 25 years ago. GLRs are involved in many physiological processes, from wound signaling to transcriptional regulation to sexual reproduction. Emerging evidence supports the notion that their fundamental functions are conserved among different groups of plants as well. In this review, we update the physiological and genetic evidence for GLRs, establishing their role in signaling and cell\u2013cell communication. Special emphasis is given to the recent discussion of GLRs\u2019 atomic structures. Along with functional assays, a structural view of GLRs\u2019 molecular organization presents a window for novel hypotheses regarding the molecular mechanisms underpinning signaling associated with the ionic fluxes that GLRs regulate. Newly uncovered transcriptional regulations associated with GLRs\u2014which propose the involvement of genes from all clades ofArabidopsis thaliana in ways not previously observed\u2014are discussed in the context of the broader impacts of GLR activity. We posit that the functions of GLRs in plant biology are probably much broader than anticipated, but describing their widespread involvement will only be possible with (a) a comprehensive understanding of the channel's properties at the molecular and structural levels, including protein\u2013protein interactions, and (b) the design of new genetic approaches to explore stress and pathogen responses where precise transcriptional control may result in more precise testable hypotheses to overcome their apparent functional redundancies.", "generated_text": "Plant glutamate receptors (GLRs) are a family of ion channels that play a crucial role in regulating plant excitability and cell-cell communication. These receptors are activated by the amino acid glutamate, leading to the influx of ions and subsequent changes in membrane potential. The functions of GLRs are diverse, including the regulation of calcium transport and signaling, which are essential for various plant processes such as growth, development, and stress responses. In this context, GLRs can modulate calcium signaling pathways, influencing the activity of downstream targets and ultimately affecting plant excitability. The mechanisms underlying GLR function involve the binding of glutamate to specific binding sites, triggering a conformational change that opens the ion channel and allows ions to flow through. This process is accompanied by changes in membrane potential, which can lead to the generation of action potentials in plant cells. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of glutathione in regulating GLR activity, suggesting that this antioxidant plays a key role in modulating the activity of these receptors. Overall, the study of GLRs has provided valuable insights into the complex mechanisms of plant signaling and the regulation of plant excitability. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the functions and mechanisms of GLRs, with potential applications in the development of novel plant growth regulators and stress management strategies.", "label": 1}
