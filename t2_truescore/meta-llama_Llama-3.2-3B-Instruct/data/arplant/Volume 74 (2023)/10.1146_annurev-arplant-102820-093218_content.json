{"grounding": "SWITCH deficient SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) class chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to facilitate access of proteins to the genomic DNA for transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Uniquely, SWI/SNF CRCs can both slide the histone octamer along the DNA or eject it from the DNA. Given their ability to change the chromatin status quo, SWI/SNF remodelers are critical for cell fate reprogramming with pioneer and other transcription factors, for responses to environmental challenges, and for disease prevention. Recent cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry approaches have uncovered different subtypes of SWI/SNF complexes with unique properties and functions. At the same time, tethering or rapid depletion and inactivation of SWI/SNF have provided novel insight into SWI/SNF requirements for enhancer activity and into balancing chromatin compaction and accessibility in concert with Polycomb complexes. Given their importance, SWI/SNF recruitment to genomic locations by transcription factors and their biochemical activity is tightly controlled. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of SWI/SNF CRCs in animals and plants and discusses the multiple nuclear and biological roles of SWI/SNF CRCs and how SWI/SNF activity is altered by complex subunit composition, posttranslational modifications, and the chromatin context to support proper development and response to extrinsic cues.", "generated_text": "SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers are a family of ATP-dependent enzymes that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular development by dynamically altering chromatin structure. These remodelers consist of a catalytic subunit and a scaffold subunit, which interact with transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to modulate nucleosome positioning and accessibility. The SWI/SNF complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including stimulus response, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation. In development, SWI/SNF remodelers have been shown to regulate the expression of key developmental genes, influencing cell fate decisions and tissue patterning. The activity of SWI/SNF remodelers is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, and epigenetic marks, allowing for precise control over chromatin dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of SWI/SNF remodelers in disease, including cancer, where dysregulation of these enzymes can contribute to tumorigenesis and epigenetic instability. Understanding the mechanisms of SWI/SNF remodeling and its role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression is essential for elucidating the molecular basis of cellular development and disease, and for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting these enzymes.", "label": 0}
