{"grounding": "Photoperiod-measuring mechanisms allow organisms to anticipate seasonal changes to align reproduction and growth with appropriate times of the year. This review provides historical and modern context to studies of plant photoperiodism. We describe how studies of photoperiodic flowering in plants led to the first theoretical models of photoperiod-measuring mechanisms in any organism. We discuss how more recent molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis and rice have revisited these concepts. We then discuss how photoperiod transcriptomics provides new lessons about photoperiodic gene regulatory networks and the discovery of noncanonical photoperiod-measuring systems housed in metabolic networks of plants. This leads to an examination of nonflowering developmental processes controlled by photoperiod, including metabolism and growth. Finally, we highlight the importance of understanding photoperiodism in the context of climate change, delving into the rapid latitudinal migration of plant species and the potential role of photoperiod-measuring systems in generating photic barriers during migration.", "generated_text": "Plant photoperiodism is a complex process by which plants respond to the duration of daylight to regulate growth and development. Recent advances in our understanding of external coincidence and metabolic daylength measurement systems have expanded the scope of photoperiodism research. Noncanonical photoperiod measurement approaches, such as those utilizing novel sensors and machine learning algorithms, have emerged as promising tools for deciphering the intricacies of plant circadian rhythms. Furthermore, studies on photosynthetic photoperiod have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying photosynthetic adaptation to changing light conditions. This review synthesizes the latest findings on photoperiodism, highlighting the interplay between external cues, internal clocks, and metabolic pathways. By exploring the frontiers of photoperiodism research, we aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing plant growth and development in response to environmental light conditions, ultimately informing strategies for crop improvement and agricultural optimization.", "label": 1}
