{"grounding": "Plant invasions, a byproduct of globalization, are increasing worldwide. Because of their ecological and economic impacts, considerable efforts have been made to understand and predict the success of non-native plants. Numerous frameworks, hypotheses, and theories have been advanced to conceptualize the interactions of multiple drivers and context dependence of invasion success with the aim of achieving robust explanations with predictive power. We review these efforts from a community-level perspective rather than a biogeographical one, focusing on terrestrial systems, and explore the roles of intrinsic plant properties in determining species invasiveness, as well as the effects of biotic and abiotic conditions in mediating ecosystem invasibility (or resistance) and ecological and evolutionary processes. We also consider the fundamental influences of human-induced changes at scales ranging from local to global in triggering, promoting, and sustaining plant invasions and discuss how these changes could alter future invasion trajectories.", "generated_text": "Invasive plants have become a significant threat to global ecosystems, outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem processes. This review examines the factors contributing to the success of invasive plants, with a focus on biotic interactions, functional traits, and ecosystem invasibility. We discuss how non-native plants exploit vacant niches, overcome native defenses, and interact with other organisms to achieve dominance. Key functional traits, such as rapid growth rates, high reproductive capacities, and ability to tolerate stress, are identified as critical determinants of invasiveness. Biotic interactions, including herbivory, predation, and competition, also play a crucial role in shaping the success of invasive plants. Our analysis highlights the complex interplay between ecological, evolutionary, and environmental factors that enable invasive plants to thrive in new environments, and underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of these processes to inform effective management and control strategies.", "label": 1}
