{"grounding": "Plant cells accumulate small RNA molecules that regulate plant development, genome stability, and environmental responses. These small RNAs fall into three major classes based on their function and mechanisms of biogenesis\u2014microRNAs, heterochromatic small interfering RNAs, and secondary small interfering RNAs\u2014plus several other less well-characterized categories. Biogenesis of each small RNA class requires a pathway of factors, some specific to each pathway and others involved in multiple pathways. Diverse sequenced plant genomes, along with rapid developments in sequencing, imaging, and genetic transformation techniques, have enabled significant progress in understanding the biogenesis, functions, and evolution of plant small RNAs, including those that had been poorly characterized because they were absent or had low representation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we review recent findings about plant small RNAs and discuss our current understanding of their biogenesis mechanisms, targets, modes of action, mobility, and functions in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including economically important crops.", "generated_text": "Plant small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and phasiRNAs, play crucial roles in regulating various aspects of plant development and stress responses. The biogenesis of these small RNAs involves complex interactions between RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA-binding proteins, and other factors. miRNAs primarily function in post-transcriptional gene silencing, targeting mRNAs for degradation or translational repression, thereby modulating gene expression. In contrast, siRNAs and phasiRNAs are involved in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and the regulation of endogenous retroelements. Mobile siRNAs, which are derived from transposable elements, also contribute to the regulation of plant development and stress responses. This review provides an overview of the biogenesis, regulatory roles, and functions of plant small RNAs, highlighting their importance in understanding plant development and stress responses, and their potential applications in crop improvement and plant breeding.", "label": 1}
