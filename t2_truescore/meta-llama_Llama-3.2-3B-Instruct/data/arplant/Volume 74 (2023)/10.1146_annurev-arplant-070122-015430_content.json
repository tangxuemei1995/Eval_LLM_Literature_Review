{"grounding": "Parasitic plants use a special organ, the haustorium, to attach to and penetrate host tissues, forming phloem and/or xylem fusion with the host vascular systems. Across this haustorium\u2013host interface, not only water and nutrients are extracted from the host by the parasitic plant, but also secondary metabolites, messenger RNAs, noncoding RNAs, proteins, and systemic signals are transported between the parasite and host and even among different hosts connected by a parasite. Furthermore, mycorrhizal fungi can form common mycelial networks (CMNs) that simultaneously interconnect multiple plants. Increasing lines of evidence suggest that CMNs can function as conduits, transferring stress-related systemic signals between plants. Between-plant signaling mediated by haustoria and CMNs likely has a profound impact on plant interactions with other organisms and adaptation to environmental factors. Here, we summarize the findings regarding between-plant transfer of biomolecules and systemic signals and the current understanding of the physiological and ecological implications of between-plant signaling.", "generated_text": "Interplant signaling through common mycelial networks and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been increasingly recognized as a crucial mechanism facilitating communication between plants. This phenomenon, known as between-plant signaling, enables plants to share information about environmental cues, pathogens, and nutrient availability, thereby modulating their growth, defense, and resource allocation strategies. Research has shown that AMF can act as hubs in complex networks of mycelia, connecting multiple plants and facilitating the exchange of signaling molecules. In contrast, parasitic plants, such as dodder and mistletoe, have evolved to exploit these networks for their own benefit, using them to tap into the nutrient resources of their host plants. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of between-plant signaling is essential for elucidating the intricate relationships between plants and their environment, and for developing novel strategies for improving plant health and productivity in agricultural systems.", "label": 0}
