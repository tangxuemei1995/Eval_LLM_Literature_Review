{"grounding": "The plant hormone auxin is certainly the most studied developmental regulator in plants. The many functions of auxin during development, from the embryo to the root and shoot construction, are mediated by an ever-growing collection of molecular regulators, with an overwhelming degree of both ubiquity and complexity that we are still far from fully understanding and that biological experiments alone cannot grasp. In this review, we discuss how bioinformatics and computational modeling approaches have helped in recent years to explore this complexity and to push the frontiers of our understanding of auxin biology. We focus on how analysis of massive amounts of genomic data and construction of computational models to simulate auxin-regulated processes at different scales have complemented wet experiments to increase the understanding of how auxin acts in the nucleus to regulate transcription and how auxin movement between cells regulates development at the tissular scale.", "generated_text": "The auxin matrix, a complex network of polar auxin transport and signaling pathways, plays a pivotal role in plant development and evolution. Recent advances in bioinformatics and computational modeling have enabled researchers to decipher the intricacies of auxin biology, revealing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing this critical process. By integrating large-scale datasets and machine learning algorithms, computational models have been developed to simulate the dynamics of auxin transport and signaling, allowing for the prediction of auxin response and the identification of key regulatory nodes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of plant development, from embryogenesis to senescence, and have the potential to inform the design of synthetic biological systems for the manipulation of auxin signaling. Ultimately, the decoding of the auxin matrix through the eye of the computer promises to revolutionize our understanding of plant biology and its applications in agriculture and biotechnology.", "label": 1}
