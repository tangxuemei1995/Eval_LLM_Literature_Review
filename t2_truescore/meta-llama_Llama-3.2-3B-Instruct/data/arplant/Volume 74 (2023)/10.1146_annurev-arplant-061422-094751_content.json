{"grounding": "Living structures constantly interact with the biotic and abiotic environment by sensing and responding via specialized functional parts. In other words, biological bodies embody highly functional machines and actuators. What are the signatures of engineering mechanisms in biology? In this review, we connect the dots in the literature to seek engineering principles in plant structures. We identify three thematic motifs\u2014bilayer actuator, slender-bodied functional surface, and self-similarity\u2014and provide an overview of their structure\u2013function relationships. Unlike human-engineered machines and actuators, biological counterparts may appear suboptimal in design, loosely complying with physical theories or engineering principles. We postulate what factors may influence the evolution of functional morphology and anatomy to dissect and comprehend better the why behind the biological forms.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationships between the structural and functional aspects of plant forms, revealing a complex interplay of biomechanical principles. Through a comprehensive analysis of plant morphology and anatomy, we demonstrate the existence of self-similar patterns and bilayer structures that optimize plant performance. The slender body shape of plants is shown to be a result of evolutionary adaptations that minimize water loss and maximize photosynthetic efficiency. Our research highlights the significance of structure-function relationships in plant biology, demonstrating that the intricate design of plant forms is a testament to the power of biological design. These findings have implications for our understanding of plant development and evolution.", "label": 1}
