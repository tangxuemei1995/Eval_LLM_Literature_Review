{"grounding": "Plant roots associate with diverse microbes (including bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists, and viruses) collectively called the root-associated microbiome. Among them, mycorrhizal fungi colonize host roots and improve their access to nutrients, usually phosphorus and nitrogen. In exchange, plants deliver photosynthetic carbon to the colonizing fungi. This nutrient exchange affects key soil processes, the carbon cycle, and plant health and therefore has a strong influence on the plant and microbe ecosystems. The framework of nutrient exchange and regulation between host plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has recently been established. The local and systemic regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by plant nutrient status and the autoregulation of mycorrhizae are strategies by which plants maintain a stabilizing free-market symbiosis. A better understanding of the synergistic effects between mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizosphere microorganisms is an essential precondition for their use as biofertilizers and bioprotectors for sustainable agriculture and forestry management.", "generated_text": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a complex, plant-fungal relationship that plays a crucial role in plant growth and stress adaptation. This symbiosis involves the exchange of nutrients between plants and fungi, facilitating enhanced nutrient uptake and utilization. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of common mycorrhizal networks, where multiple plants share resources through fungal connections. Helper bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, also contribute to mycorrhizal symbiosis by producing plant growth-promoting substances. The autoregulation of mycorrhizae, where fungi regulate their own growth in response to plant needs, is another key mechanism. This review synthesizes current knowledge on mycorrhizal symbiosis, from the molecular level of gene expression to the ecosystem level of nutrient cycling and stress resistance. Understanding the intricate relationships between plants, fungi, and bacteria is essential for optimizing agricultural productivity and promoting ecosystem resilience in the face of environmental stressors.", "label": 1}
