{"grounding": "My research career started with an ambition to work out how genes are regulated in plants. I tried out various experimental systems\u2014artichoke tissue culture in Edinburgh; soybean root nodules in Montreal; soybean hypocotyls in Athens, Georgia; and cereal aleurones in Cambridge\u2014but eventually I discovered plant viruses. Viral satellite RNAs were my first interest, but I then explored transgenic and natural disease resistance and was led by curiosity into topics beyond virology, including RNA silencing, epigenetics, and more recently, genome evolution. On the way, I have learned about approaches to research, finding tractable systems, and taking academic research into the real world. I have always tried to consider the broader significance of our work, and my current projects address the definition of epigenetics, the arms race concept of disease resistance, and Darwin's abominable mystery.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of an RNA world, where RNA plays a central role in the evolution of life on Earth. By examining the genetic material of plant viruses, we uncover the mechanisms by which RNA-based systems confer disease resistance in plants. Through a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from molecular biology, virology, and evolutionary biology, we demonstrate how RNA can be harnessed to improve crop yields and disease resistance in agriculture. Our research also delves into the historical context of the RNA world hypothesis, tracing its development from the early 20th century to the present day. By integrating cutting-edge technology in agriculture with our understanding of RNA-based systems, we aim to create innovative solutions for sustainable food production and disease management.", "label": 0}
