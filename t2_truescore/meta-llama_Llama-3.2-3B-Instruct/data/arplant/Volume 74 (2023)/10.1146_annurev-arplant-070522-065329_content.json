{"grounding": "Recurring patterns are an integral part of life on Earth. Through evolution or breeding, plants have acquired systems that coordinate with the cyclic patterns driven by Earth's movement through space. The biosystem responses to these physical rhythms result in biological cycles of daily and seasonal activity that feed back into the physical cycles. Signaling networks to coordinate growth and molecular activities with these persistent cycles have been integrated into plant biochemistry. The plant circadian clock is the coordinator of this complex, multiscale, temporal schedule. However, we have detailed knowledge of the circadian clock components and functions in only a few species under controlled conditions. We are just beginning to understand how the clock functions in real-world conditions. This review examines what we know about the circadian clock in diverse plant species, the challenges with extrapolating data from controlled environments, and the need to anticipate how plants will respond to climate change.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between circadian rhythms and environmental changes has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of climate change. This intersection of biological and environmental factors has profound implications for organismal adaptation and survival. Research has shown that circadian rhythms, which govern the body's internal clock, are sensitive to external cues such as temperature, light, and humidity. As environmental conditions shift in response to climate change, these cues can disrupt the normal functioning of circadian signaling networks, leading to altered physiological responses and behavioral adaptations. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of the interplay between circadian rhythms and environmental change, with a focus on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this complex relationship. By elucidating the key players and pathways involved, this review seeks to provide a framework for understanding the adaptive responses of organisms to a changing environment.", "label": 1}
