{"grounding": "Since the discovery of the first ribonucleic acid (RNA) modifications in transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), scientists have been on a quest to decipher the identities and functions of RNA modifications in biological systems. The last decade has seen monumental growth in the number of studies that have characterized and assessed the functionalities of RNA modifications in the field of plant biology. Owing to these studies, we now categorize RNA modifications based on their chemical nature and the RNA on which they are found, as well as the array of proteins that are involved in the processes that add, read, and remove them from an RNA molecule. Beyond their identity, another key piece of the puzzle is the functional significance of the various types of RNA modifications. Here, we shed light on recent studies that help establish our current understanding of the diversity of RNA modifications found in plant transcriptomes and the functions they play at both the molecular (e.g., RNA stability, translation, and transport) and organismal (e.g., stress response and development) levels. Finally, we consider the key research questions related to plant gene expression and biology in general and highlight developments in various technologies that are driving our insights forward in this research area.", "generated_text": "Plant RNA modifications, including mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA modifications, play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stresses. Recent studies have elucidated the diversity of RNA modifications in plants, with m6A, m5C, and other modifications being identified as key regulators of gene expression. The functional diversity of RNA modification is evident in their involvement in various cellular processes, including stress response, development, and defense against pathogens. For instance, m6A modifications have been shown to regulate stress-induced gene expression, while m5C modifications are involved in the regulation of rRNA processing. The functional diversity of RNA modification is further underscored by their ability to interact with RNA-binding proteins and other regulatory factors. Despite significant progress in understanding the diversity and functions of plant RNA modifications, there is still much to be discovered. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying RNA modification and their interactions with other regulatory networks, as well as exploring the potential applications of RNA modification in plant breeding and stress response. By continuing to investigate the complex relationships between RNA modifications and cellular processes, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanisms governing plant biology and develop new strategies for improving crop yields and stress tolerance.", "label": 1}
