{"grounding": "Proteins are workhorses in the cell; they form stable and more often dynamic, transient protein\u2013protein interactions, assemblies, and networks and have an intimate interplay with DNA and RNA. These network interactions underlie fundamental biological processes and play essential roles in cellular function. The proximity-dependent biotinylation labeling approach combined with mass spectrometry (PL-MS) has recently emerged as a powerful technique to dissect the complex cellular network at the molecular level. In PL-MS, by fusing a genetically encoded proximity-labeling (PL) enzyme to a protein or a localization signal peptide, the enzyme is targeted to a protein complex of interest or to an organelle, allowing labeling of proximity proteins within a zoom radius. These biotinylated proteins can then be captured by streptavidin beads and identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. Recently engineered PL enzymes such as TurboID have a much-improved enzymatic activity, enabling spatiotemporal mapping with a dramatically increased signal-to-noise ratio. PL-MS has revolutionized the way we perform proteomics by overcoming several hurdles imposed by traditional technology, such as biochemical fractionation and affinity purification mass spectrometry. In this review, we focus on biotin ligase\u2013based PL-MS applications that have been, or are likely to be, adopted by the plant field. We discuss the experimental designs and review the different choices for engineered biotin ligases, enrichment, and quantification strategies. Lastly, we review the validation and discuss future perspectives.", "generated_text": "Proximity labeling is a powerful tool for elucidating protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleotide interactions within the subcellular proteome of plants. By enabling the quantitative analysis of protein interactions, proximity labeling has the potential to reveal novel protein partners and elucidate their functional roles in plant biology. Recent advances in proximity labeling technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas13 and BioID, have facilitated the detection of protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleotide interactions in plant cells. These methods have been successfully applied to investigate protein interactions in various plant cell types, including Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. The resulting data have provided valuable insights into the subcellular organization of the plant proteome and have shed light on the functional significance of protein interactions in plant development, stress response, and metabolism. This review provides an overview of the current state of proximity labeling in plants, highlighting its applications, advantages, and limitations. We discuss the use of proximity labeling to investigate protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleotide interactions in the subcellular proteome of plants and highlight the potential of this approach for elucidating the complex interactions that govern plant biology.", "label": 0}
