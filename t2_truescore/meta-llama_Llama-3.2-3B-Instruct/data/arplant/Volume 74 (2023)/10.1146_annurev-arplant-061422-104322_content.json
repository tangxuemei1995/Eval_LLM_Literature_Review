{"grounding": "Despite the numerous advances made in our understanding of the physiology and molecular genetics of salinity tolerance, there have been relatively few applications of these to improve the salt tolerance of crops. The most significant advances have historically utilized intraspecific variation, introgression of traits from close crop wild relatives, or, less frequently, introgression from more distant relatives. Advanced lines often fail due to difficulties in the introgression or tracking of traits or due to yield penalties associated with the alleles in nonsaline environments. However, the greatest limitation is that salinity is not a primary trait for breeders. We must close the gap between research and delivery, especially for farmers who have precious few alternatives. These efforts should include a reassessment of old techniques such as grafting current crops with salt-tolerant hybrid rootstocks. Alternatively, future crops can be produced via domestication of salt-tolerant wild species\u2014an approach that is now feasible in our lifetime.", "generated_text": "The increasing global demand for food, coupled with the rising frequency of saltwater intrusion and soil salinization, poses a significant threat to crop yields and food security. To address this challenge, researchers have been exploring the potential of salt-tolerant crops, which can thrive in saline environments. This review synthesizes recent advances in the development of salinity-tolerant crops through traditional breeding, crop wild relatives (CWRs) utilization, and genetic modification. The integration of CWRs into domesticated crops has shown promise in enhancing salinity tolerance, while genetic modification has enabled the introduction of novel salt-tolerant genes. Neodomestication, the process of re-domesticating wild relatives, has also emerged as a promising approach. By harnessing the genetic diversity of CWRs and leveraging cutting-edge biotechnology, it is possible to deliver salt-tolerant crops that can sustainably improve crop yields and enhance food security in saline environments.", "label": 0}
