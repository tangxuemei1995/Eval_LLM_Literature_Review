{"grounding": "There is intense interest in using genome editing technologies to domesticate wild plants, or accelerate the improvement of weakly domesticated crops, in de novo domestication. Here, we discuss promising genetic strategies, with a focus on plant development. Importantly, genome editing releases us from dependence on random mutagenesis or intraspecific diversity, allowing us to draw solutions more broadly from diversity. However, sparse understanding of the complex genetics of diversity limits innovation. Beyond genetics, we urge the ethical use of indigenous knowledge, indigenous plants, and ethnobotany. De novo domestication still requires conventional breeding by phenotypic selection, especially in the development of crops for diverse environments and cultures. Indeed, uniting genome editing with selective breeding could facilitate faster and better outcomes than either technology alone. Domestication is complex and incompletely understood, involving changes to many aspects of plant biology and human culture. Success in de novo domestication requires careful attention to history and collaboration across traditional boundaries.", "generated_text": "The advent of genome editing technologies has revolutionized the field of plant domestication, enabling the rapid creation of novel crop varieties with desirable traits. De novo domestication using genome editing holds immense promise for addressing the challenges posed by climate change, such as increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. By introducing specific genetic modifications, researchers can enhance crop resilience, yield, and nutritional content. However, the uncharted territory of de novo domestication also raises concerns regarding the unintended consequences of these modifications on plant developmental genetics and ecosystem balance. Ethnobotanical studies have highlighted the complex relationships between humans and plants, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of the cultural and environmental contexts in which crops are domesticated. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on de novo domestication using genome editing, highlighting both the power and perils of this emerging approach and its potential to reshape the future of plant breeding and food security.", "label": 0}
