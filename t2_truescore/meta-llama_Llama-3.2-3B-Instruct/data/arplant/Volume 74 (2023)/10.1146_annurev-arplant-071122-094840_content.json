{"grounding": "Optogenetics is a technique employing natural or genetically engineered photoreceptors in transgene organisms to manipulate biological activities with light. Light can be turned on or off, and adjusting its intensity and duration allows optogenetic fine-tuning of cellular processes in a noninvasive and spatiotemporally resolved manner. Since the introduction of Channelrhodopsin-2 and phytochrome-based switches nearly 20 years ago, optogenetic tools have been applied in a variety of model organisms with enormous success, but rarely in plants. For a long time, the dependence of plant growth on light and the absence of retinal, the rhodopsin chromophore, prevented the establishment of plant optogenetics until recent progress overcame these difficulties. We summarize the recent results of work in the field to control plant growth and cellular motion via green light\u2013gated ion channels and present successful applications to light-control gene expression with single or combined photoswitches in plants. Furthermore, we highlight the technical requirements and options for future plant optogenetic research.", "generated_text": "Optogenetic methods have revolutionized the field of plant biology by enabling precise control over plant physiological processes. By harnessing the power of light, researchers can manipulate photoreceptors, such as phytochromes and cryptochromes, to modulate plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. The introduction of optogenetic tools, including rhodopsin-based biosensors and optoswitches, has expanded the scope of optogenetic applications in plants. These tools allow for the selective activation or inhibition of specific photoreceptors, enabling researchers to study the complex interactions between light, plant hormones, and developmental pathways. Recent advances in optogenetic methods have also enabled the creation of novel plant models, such as optogenetically modified Arabidopsis thaliana, which have greatly enhanced our understanding of plant biology. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of optogenetic methods in plant biology and their potential applications in agriculture and basic research.", "label": 0}
