{"grounding": "\ncis-Regulatory elements encode the genomic blueprints that ensure the proper spatiotemporal patterning of gene expression necessary for appropriate development and responses to the environment. Accumulating evidence implicates changes to gene expression as a major source of phenotypic novelty in eukaryotes, including acute phenotypes such as disease and cancer in mammals. Moreover, genetic and epigenetic variation affecting cis-regulatory sequences over longer evolutionary timescales has become a recurring theme in studies of morphological divergence and local adaptation. Here, we discuss the functions of and methods used to identify various classes of cis-regulatory elements, as well as their role in plant development and response to the environment. We highlight opportunities to exploit cis-regulatory variants underlying plant development and environmental responses for crop improvement efforts. Although a comprehensive understanding of cis-regulatory mechanisms in plants has lagged behind that in animals, we showcase several breakthrough findings that have profoundly influenced plant biology and shaped the overall understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes.", "generated_text": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in plant development, adaptation, and evolution by regulating gene expression in response to environmental cues. These non-coding DNA sequences interact with chromatin to modulate transcription, influencing various physiological processes such as growth, stress response, and reproductive development. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of CREs in plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions, including drought, temperature, and salinity stress. The evolution of CREs has been linked to the development of novel gene regulatory networks, enabling plants to adapt to diverse ecological niches. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the function and evolution of CREs in plant development, adaptation, and evolution, highlighting their potential as targets for crop improvement and stress tolerance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CRE-mediated transcription regulation is crucial for elucidating the complex interactions between plants and their environment.", "label": 1}
