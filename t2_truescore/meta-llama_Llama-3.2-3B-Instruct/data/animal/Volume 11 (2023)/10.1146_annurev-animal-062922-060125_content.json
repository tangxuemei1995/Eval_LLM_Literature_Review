{"grounding": "Zoonoses are diseases and infections naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals. Over the years, zoonoses have become increasingly significant threats to global health. They form the dominant group of diseases among the emerging infectious diseases (EID) and currently account for 73% of EID. Approximately 25% of zoonoses originate in domestic animals. The etiological agents of zoonoses include different pathogens, with viruses accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly, by contact, via aerosols, through a vector, or vertically in utero. Zoonotic diseases are found in every continent except Antarctica. Numerous factors associated with the pathogen, human activities, and the environment play significant roles in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Effective response and control of zoonotic diseases call for multiple-sector involvement and collaboration according to the One Health concept.", "generated_text": "Domestic animals play a crucial role in the transmission of zoonotic viral diseases to humans, highlighting the importance of the One Health approach. Emerging and endemic viral zoonoses, such as avian influenza, swine flu, and SARS-CoV-2, have been linked to domestic animal reservoirs. These animals can serve as amplifying hosts, facilitating the spread of pathogens to humans. The close interaction between humans and domestic animals increases the risk of zoonotic transmission. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on domestic animal reservoirs of zoonotic viral diseases, including the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control measures. Understanding the role of domestic animals in zoonotic disease transmission is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent pandemics and mitigate the impact of emerging viral zoonoses.", "label": 0}
