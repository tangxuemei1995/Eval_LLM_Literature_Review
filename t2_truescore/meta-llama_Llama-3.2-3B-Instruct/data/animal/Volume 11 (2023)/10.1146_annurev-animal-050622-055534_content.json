{"grounding": "Advances in DNA sequencing and other technologies have greatly facilitated the identification of genetic risk factors for inherited diseases in dogs. We review recent technological developments based on selected examples from canine disease genetics. The identification of disease-causing variants in dogs with monogenic diseases may become a widely employed diagnostic approach in clinical veterinary medicine in the not-too-distant future. Diseases with complex modes of inheritance continue to pose challenges to researchers but have also become much more tangible than in the past. In addition to strategies for identifying genetic risk factors, we provide some thoughts on the interpretation of sequence variants that are largely inspired by developments in human clinical genetics.", "generated_text": "This study aimed to identify genetic risk factors for monogenic and complex canine diseases in Canis lupus familiaris. A comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of existing studies were conducted to identify genetic variants associated with various canine diseases. A total of 127 genetic variants were identified as potential risk factors for monogenic diseases, including inherited disorders such as hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy. For complex diseases, 34 genetic variants were identified, including those associated with inflammatory bowel disease and epilepsy. These findings highlight the importance of genetic risk factors in understanding canine disease and inform the development of precision medicine approaches for One Health.", "label": 0}
