{"grounding": "Over the past three decades, coronavirus (CoV) diseases have impacted humans more than any other emerging infectious disease. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), has resulted in huge economic disruptions and loss of human lives. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was found to mutate more rapidly due to sustained transmission in humans and potentially animals, resulting in variants of concern (VOCs) that threaten global human health. However, the primary difficulties are filling in the current knowledge gaps in terms of the origin and modalities of emergence for these viruses. Because many CoVs threatening human health are suspected to have a zoonotic origin, identifying the animal hosts implicated in the spillover or spillback events would be beneficial for current pandemic management and to prevent future outbreaks. In this review, wesummarize the animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission of the emerging human CoVs. Finally, we comment on potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOCs and the new SARS-CoV-2 recombinants currently under investigation.", "generated_text": "The rapid emergence of human-infecting coronaviruses poses significant threats to global health. This review focuses on the role of animal models and zoonotic reservoirs in the cross-species transmission of emerging coronaviruses. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that animal models, particularly those derived from bats and other wild animals, have played a crucial role in the identification and characterization of novel coronaviruses. The zoonotic reservoirs of these viruses, often found in wildlife populations, serve as a primary source of transmission to humans. Cross-species transmission events, facilitated by recombination and genetic exchange, have contributed to the emergence of new coronaviruses. Effective surveillance and monitoring of animal populations, as well as the development of animal models, are essential for early detection and prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. Understanding the complex interactions between animal reservoirs and human populations is critical for developing targeted interventions and mitigating the risk of future pandemics.", "label": 1}
