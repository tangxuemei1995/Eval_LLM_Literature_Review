{"grounding": "Addressing important questions in animal ecology, physiology, and environmental science often requires in situ information from wild animals. This difficulty is being overcome by biologging and biotelemetry, or the use of miniaturized animal-borne sensors. Although early studies recorded only simple parameters of animal movement, advanced devices and analytical methods can now provide rich information on individual and group behavior, internal states, and the surrounding environment of free-ranging animals, especially those in marine systems. We summarize the history of technologies used to track marine animals. We then identify seven major research categories of marine biologging and biotelemetry and explain significant achievements, as well as future opportunities. Big data approaches via international collaborations will be key to tackling global environmental issues (e.g., climate change impacts), and curiosity about the secret lives of marine animals will also remain a major driver of biologging and biotelemetry studies.", "generated_text": "Biologging and biotelemetry technologies have revolutionized the study of marine animal behavior, ecology, and physiology. By attaching sensors and tracking devices to marine animals, researchers can gain insights into their movement patterns, habitat use, and social interactions. This abstract reviews the current state of biologging and biotelemetry in marine research, highlighting its applications in movement ecology, predator-prey interaction, and social behavior. The impact of anthropogenic stressors, such as climate change and pollution, on marine animal populations is also discussed. Field physiology studies have shown that biologging and biotelemetry can provide valuable information on the physiological responses of marine animals to environmental changes. The integration of biologging and biotelemetry data with other research methods, such as genetic analysis and remote sensing, offers a powerful tool for understanding the complex interactions between marine animals and their environments. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of biologging and biotelemetry in marine research and its potential for informing conservation and management efforts.", "label": 1}
