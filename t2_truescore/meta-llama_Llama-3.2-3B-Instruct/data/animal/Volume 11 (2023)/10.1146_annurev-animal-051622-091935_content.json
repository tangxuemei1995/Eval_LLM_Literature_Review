{"grounding": "This article addresses the underrepresentation of Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences by challenging the exclusive use of Western scientific paradigms in research and education. Because of the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples, Indigenous perspectives have rarely been represented through empirical study, leading us to believe this is a key reason for the underrepresentation of Native people in these fields. We conducted a literature review, searching for Indigenous contributions in animal sciences and finding a handful of articles in three areas: human\u2013animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Given the interconnected paradigm of Indigenous worldviews, we suggest that the ongoing siloes of scientific disciplines and the hierarchy of methodology contribute to the dearth of Indigenous perspectives. We suggest increased support for proper tribal consultation, contextualization of the history of research in Native communities, and the creation of scholarly spaces to support these conversations.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes existing literature on the intersection of Indigenous perspectives and animal biosciences, highlighting the significance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in informing animal science research and practice. The American Indian and Native American communities have long demonstrated a profound understanding of the intricate relationships between animals, humans, and the environment, which is often overlooked in mainstream scientific discourse. One Health approaches, which integrate human, animal, and environmental health, can benefit from the incorporation of TEK. This review examines the historical and contemporary contexts of Indigenous knowledge production, its relevance to animal biosciences, and the potential for collaborative research and knowledge co-production. By centering Indigenous voices and perspectives, this review aims to promote a more inclusive and equitable understanding of animal sciences, ultimately contributing to the development of more sustainable and culturally responsive animal health practices.", "label": 1}
