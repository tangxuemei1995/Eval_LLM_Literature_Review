{"grounding": "For nearly a century, evolutionary biologists have observed chromosomes that cause lethality when made homozygous persisting at surprisingly high frequencies (>25%) in natural populations of many species. The evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of such detrimental mutations have been heavily debated\u2014are some lethal mutations under balancing selection? We suggest that mutation\u2013selection balance alone cannot explain lethal variation in nature and the possibility that other forces play a role. We review the potential that linked selection in particular may drive maintenance of lethal alleles through associative overdominance or linkage to beneficial mutations or by reducing effective population size. Over the past five decades, investigation into this mystery has tapered. During this time, key scientific advances have provided the ability to collect more accurate data and analyze them in new ways, making the underlying genetic bases and evolutionary forces of lethal alleles timely for study once more.", "generated_text": "Recessive lethal variation (RLV) is a phenomenon where deleterious mutations are maintained in natural populations due to specific evolutionary mechanisms. This study investigates the roles of mutation-selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in maintaining RLV. We review the literature on the various mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of RLV, including associative overdominance and supergene effects. Our analysis reveals that mutation-selection balance plays a crucial role in maintaining RLV by allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate in the population. Heterozygote advantage and linked selection also contribute to the persistence of RLV by providing a selective advantage to individuals carrying deleterious mutations. The findings of this study highlight the complex interplay between these mechanisms and their importance in maintaining RLV in natural populations. The results have implications for our understanding of the evolution of deleterious mutations and the maintenance of genetic variation in the wild.", "label": 1}
