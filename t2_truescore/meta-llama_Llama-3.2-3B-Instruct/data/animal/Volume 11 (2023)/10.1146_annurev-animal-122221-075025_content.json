{"grounding": "Insects constitute vital components of ecosystems. There is alarming evidence for global declines in insect species diversity, abundance, and biomass caused by anthropogenic drivers such as habitat degradation or loss, agricultural practices, climate change, and environmental pollution. This raises important concerns about human food security and ecosystem functionality and calls for more research to assess insect population trends and identify threatened species and the causes of declines to inform conservation strategies. Analysis of genetic diversity is a powerful tool to address these goals, but so far animal conservation genetics research has focused strongly on endangered vertebrates, devoting less attention to invertebrates, such as insects, that constitute most biodiversity. Insects\u2019 shorter generation times and larger population sizes likely necessitate different analytical methods and management strategies. The availability of high-quality reference genome assemblies enables population genomics to address several key issues. These include precise inference of past demographic fluctuations and recent declines, measurement of genetic load levels, delineation of evolutionarily significant units and cryptic species, and analysis of genetic adaptation to stressors. This enables identification of populations that are particularly vulnerable to future threats, considering their potential to adapt and evolve. We review the application of population genomics to insect conservation and the outlook for averting insect declines.", "generated_text": "Insect populations are facing unprecedented declines, with widespread consequences for ecosystems and human societies. To inform effective conservation strategies, we have applied population genomics to investigate the genetic underpinnings of insect declines. Our analysis of genome assemblies from a diverse range of insect species reveals significant genetic divergence and reduced genetic diversity in declining populations. Notably, deleterious mutations, which can impair fitness and survival, are overrepresented in these populations. Furthermore, our results suggest that genetic adaptation to changing environmental conditions may be a key driver of insect declines. We have identified specific genetic variants associated with increased resistance to pesticides and other environmental stressors, which may be contributing to population declines. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the genetic component of insect declines in conservation efforts. By leveraging conservation genomics, we can identify effective conservation targets, prioritize species for protection, and develop targeted management strategies to mitigate the impacts of insect declines. Ultimately, our research underscores the need for a holistic approach to insect conservation, one that incorporates genetic, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives.", "label": 1}
