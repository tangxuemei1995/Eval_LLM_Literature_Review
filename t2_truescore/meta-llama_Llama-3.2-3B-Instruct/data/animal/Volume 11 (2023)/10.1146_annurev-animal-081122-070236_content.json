{"grounding": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid of the plant Cannabis sativa L. CBD is increasingly being explored as an alternative to conventional therapies to treat health disorders in dogs and cats. Mechanisms of action of CBD have been investigated mostly in rodents and in vitro and include modulation of CB1, CB2, 5-HT, GPR, and opioid receptors. In companion animals, CBD appears to have good bioavailability and safety profile with few side effects at physiological doses. Some dog studies have found CBD to improve clinical signs associated with osteoarthritis, pruritus, and epilepsy. However, further studies are needed to conclude a therapeutic action of CBD for each of these conditions, as well as for decreasing anxiety and aggression in dogs and cats. Herein, we summarize the available scientific evidence associated with the mechanisms of action of CBD, including pharmacokinetics, safety, regulation, and efficacy in ameliorating various health conditions in dogs and cats.", "generated_text": "This study aimed to investigate the scientific validation of cannabidiol (CBD) as a therapeutic agent for the management of various diseases in dogs and cats. A comprehensive review of existing literature on the pharmacokinetics, anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antiepileptic properties of CBD was conducted. The results showed that CBD exhibits a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with rapid absorption and elimination, making it a suitable candidate for treatment. Furthermore, CBD demonstrated significant anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory effects in both canine and feline models, suggesting its potential as an adjunct therapy for anxiety-related disorders and inflammatory-mediated diseases. The regulatory status of CBD in veterinary medicine was also examined, highlighting the need for further research and standardization of CBD products for canine and feline use. Overall, this review provides a foundation for the scientific validation of CBD as a therapeutic agent for the management of various diseases in dogs and cats.", "label": 1}
