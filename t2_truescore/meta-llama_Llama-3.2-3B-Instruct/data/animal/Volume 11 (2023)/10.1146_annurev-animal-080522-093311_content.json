{"grounding": "Deleterious mutations decrease reproductive fitness and are ubiquitous in genomes. Given that many organisms face ongoing threats of extinction, there is interest in elucidating the impact of deleterious variation on extinction risk and optimizing management strategies accounting for such mutations. Quantifying deleterious variation and understanding the effects of population history on deleterious variation are complex endeavors because we do not know the strength of selection acting on each mutation. Further, the effect of demographic history on deleterious mutations depends on the strength of selection against the mutation and the degree of dominance. Here we clarify how deleterious variation can be quantified and studied in natural populations. We then discuss how different demographic factors, such as small population size, nonequilibrium population size changes, inbreeding, and gene flow, affect deleterious variation. Lastly, we provide guidance on studying deleterious variation in nonmodel populations of conservation concern.", "generated_text": "Deleterious variation, including deleterious mutations and inbreeding depression, poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of natural populations. This phenomenon, known as genetic load, can lead to a decline in population fitness and reduced adaptability to changing environments. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, we examine the impact of deleterious variation on conservation genetics, highlighting the need for effective management strategies to mitigate its effects. Our analysis reveals that simulations demonstrate the cumulative effect of deleterious mutations can lead to significant inbreeding depression, compromising population viability. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of genetic load for conservation breeding programs, emphasizing the importance of incorporating genetic diversity and reducing inbreeding to maintain population health. By understanding the deleterious effects of variation, conservation biologists can develop targeted interventions to safeguard the long-term survival of threatened species.", "label": 1}
