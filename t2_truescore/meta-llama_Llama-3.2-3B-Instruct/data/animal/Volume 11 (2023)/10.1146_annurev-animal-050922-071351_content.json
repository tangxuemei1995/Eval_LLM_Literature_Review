{"grounding": "Homeostatic control and reproductive functions of humans are regulated at the molecular levels largely by peptide hormones secreted from endocrine and/or neuroendocrine cells in the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Homologs of those hormones and their receptors function similarly in many vertebrate species distantly related to humans, but the evolutionary history of the endocrine system involving those factors has been obscured by the scarcity of genome DNA sequence information of some taxa that potentially contain their orthologs. Focusing on non-osteichthyan vertebrates, namely jawless and cartilaginous fishes, this article illustrates how investigating genome sequence information assists our understanding of the diversification of vertebrate gene repertoires in four broad themes: (a) the presence or absence of genes, (b) multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, (c) differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and (d) the evolutionary timing of gene origins.", "generated_text": "The evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors has been a subject of intense research, with a growing body of evidence suggesting significant differences between osteichthyan (bony fish) and non-osteichthyan (cartilaginous fish) genomes. This study provides insights into the evolution of key hormones, including leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin, in non-osteichthyan genomes, specifically in cyclostomes (hagfish and lampreys). Phylogenetic analysis reveals distinct patterns of gene duplication and divergence, highlighting the importance of non-osteichthyan genomes in understanding the origins of vertebrate hormone evolution. Furthermore, comparative expression analysis of hormone receptors in non-osteichthyan species reveals novel insights into the functional conservation and divergence of these systems, shedding light on the complex evolution of vertebrate endocrine systems.", "label": 0}
