{"grounding": "Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are the longest-lived rodents with a maximum life span exceeding 37 years. They exhibit a delayed aging phenotype and resistance to age-related functional decline/diseases. Specifically, they do not display increased mortality with age, maintain several physiological functions until nearly the end of their lifetime, and rarely develop cancer and Alzheimer's disease. NMRs live in a hypoxic environment in underground colonies in East Africa and are highly tolerant of hypoxia. These unique characteristics of NMRs have attracted considerable interest from zoological and biomedical researchers. This review summarizes previous studies of the ecology, hypoxia tolerance, longevity/delayed aging, and cancer resistance of NMRs and discusses possible mechanisms contributing to their healthy aging. In addition, we discuss current issues and future perspectives to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying delayed aging and resistance to age-related diseases in NMRs.", "generated_text": "The naked mole-rat (NMR) has garnered significant attention as a model organism for studying healthy aging due to its remarkable longevity and resistance to age-related diseases. These subterranean rodents exhibit a unique physiology characterized by a high concentration of myeloperoxidase, which confers protection against cancer and oxidative stress. Notably, NMRs live in large, eusocial colonies, where social hierarchy and cooperation play a crucial role in maintaining health and longevity. Furthermore, their ability to thrive in low-oxygen environments, a condition often associated with aging, has sparked interest in the role of hypoxia in promoting healthy aging. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the NMR's remarkable longevity and its potential applications in understanding the biology of healthy aging, with a focus on the interplay between sociality, hypoxia, and cancer resistance.", "label": 1}
