{"grounding": "Talpid moles and spotted hyenas have become the paradigms of anatomical and behavioral female masculinization. Females of many mole species develop ovotestes that produce testosterone, show external genitalia that resemble that of males, and close their vaginal orifice after every estrus, and female spotted hyenas lack an external vaginal orifice and develop a pseudoscrotum and a large pseudopenis through which they urinate, mate, and give birth. We review current knowledge about several significant aspects of the biology and evolution of these females, including (a) their specific study methods; (b) their unique anatomical features, and how these peculiarities influence certain physiological functions; and (c) the role that steroid hormones as well as genetic and environmental factors may have in urogenital system development, aggressive behavior, and social dominance. Nevertheless, both mole and hyena females are exceptionally efficient mothers, so their peculiar genitalia should not call into question their femininity.", "generated_text": "The Biology and Evolution of Fierce Females (Moles and Hyenas) explores the unique characteristics of female mammals that exhibit aggressive and dominant behaviors, exemplified by moles and spotted hyenas. This study delves into the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the reproductive biology of these species, including the presence of ovotestes and pseudopenises in females. The authors examine the role of these anatomical features in facilitating aggressive behavior, including territorial defense and mate competition. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, the researchers highlight the convergent evolution of female masculinization in these species, allowing them to access and utilize male-dominated resources. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between sex, aggression, and evolution in mammals, with implications for our understanding of female reproductive biology and behavior.", "label": 1}
