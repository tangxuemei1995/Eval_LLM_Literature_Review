{"grounding": "For real-valued parameters, significance tests can be motivated as three-decision methods, in which we either assert the sign of the parameter above or below a specified null value, or say nothing either way. Tukey viewed this as a \u201csensible formulation\u201d of tests, unlike the widely taught null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) system that is today's default. We review the three-decision framework, collecting the substantial literature on how other statistical tools can be usefully motivated in this way. These tools include close Bayesian analogs of frequentist power calculations, p-values, confidence intervals, and multiple testing corrections. We also show how three-decision arguments can straightforwardly resolve some well-known difficulties in the interpretation and criticism of testing results. Explicit results are shown for simple conjugate analyses, but the methods discussed apply generally to real-valued parameters.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a comprehensive framework for three-decision methods, which provide a sensible formulation of significance tests and address the challenges of multiple testing. By integrating decision theory and sensitivity analysis, these methods enable researchers to evaluate the power of their tests and account for the impact of multiple testing on Type I error rates. The proposed framework offers a flexible and generalizable approach to significance testing, allowing for the incorporation of various decision criteria and sensitivity analyses. The results demonstrate that three-decision methods can significantly improve the accuracy of significance tests, particularly in scenarios with multiple testing. This work provides a valuable contribution to the field of statistical inference, offering a more nuanced understanding of significance testing and its limitations.", "label": 1}
