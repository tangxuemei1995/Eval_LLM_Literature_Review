{"grounding": "The value of research data has grown as the emphasis on research transparency and data-intensive research has increased. Data sharing is now required by funders and publishers and is becoming a disciplinary expectation in many fields. However, practices promoting data reusability and research transparency are poorly understood, making it difficult for statisticians and other researchers to reframe study methods to facilitate data sharing. This article reviews the larger landscape of open research and describes contextual information that data reusers need to understand, evaluate, and appropriately analyze shared data. The article connects data reusability to statistical thinking by considering the impact of the type and quality of shared research artifacts on the capacity to reproduce or replicate studies and examining quality evaluation frameworks to understand the nature of data errors and how they can be mitigated prior to sharing. Actions statisticians can take to update their research approaches for their own and collaborative investigations are suggested.", "generated_text": "The increasing complexity of scientific research has led to a proliferation of data, creating a pressing need for data reusability and research transparency. Statistics plays a pivotal role in promoting these values by ensuring the quality and reliability of data. This review synthesizes existing literature on the intersection of statistics and data reusability, highlighting the importance of data quality control, standardization, and documentation. We discuss the impact of open science initiatives on data sharing and the role of statistical methods in facilitating reproducibility and replicability. Our analysis reveals that the integration of statistical techniques, such as data validation and visualization, can significantly enhance data reusability and research transparency. By adopting these strategies, researchers can increase the value and impact of their work, ultimately contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge and the integrity of the research process.", "label": 1}
