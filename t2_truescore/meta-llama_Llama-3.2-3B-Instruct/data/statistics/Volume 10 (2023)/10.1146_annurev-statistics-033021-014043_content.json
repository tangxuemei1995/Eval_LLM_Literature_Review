{"grounding": "The Cox model is now 50 years old. The seminal paper of Sir David Cox has had an immeasurable impact on the analysis of censored survival data, with applications in many different disciplines. This work has also stimulated much additional research in diverse areas and led to important theoretical and practical advances. These include semiparametric models, nonparametric efficiency, and partial likelihood. In addition to quickly becoming the go-to method for estimating covariate effects, Cox regression has been extended to a vast number of complex data structures, to all of which the central idea of sampling from the set of individuals at risk at time t can be applied. In this article, we review the Cox paper and the evolution of the ideas surrounding it. We then highlight its extensions to competing risks, with attention to models based on cause-specific hazards, and to hazards associated with the subdistribution or cumulative incidence function. We discuss their relative merits and domains of application. The analysis of recurrent events is another major topic of discussion, including an introduction to martingales and complete intensity models as well as the more practical marginal rate models. We include several worked examples to illustrate the main ideas.", "generated_text": "The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced by David Cox in 1972, has been a cornerstone of survival analysis for over five decades. This seminal model has been widely adopted to investigate the relationship between time-to-event outcomes and a set of covariates, accounting for competing risks and independent censoring. The Cox model has been extended to incorporate intensity and marginal rate models, which provide a more nuanced understanding of the underlying hazard function. Partial likelihood estimation has been employed to estimate model parameters, offering a computationally efficient approach to model fitting. The incorporation of time-dependent covariates has also been a significant development, enabling researchers to capture the dynamic nature of the relationship between covariates and the hazard rate. Over the past fifty years, the Cox model has been extensively validated and has been applied to a diverse range of fields, including oncology, cardiology, and epidemiology. Despite its widespread adoption, the Cox model remains a subject of ongoing research and development, with recent advances in model extension and application to recurrent events data. This review aims to provide an overview of the key developments and applications of the Cox model, highlighting its enduring relevance in modern survival analysis.", "label": 1}
