{"grounding": "By linking conceptual theories with observed data, generative models can support reasoning in complex situations. They have come to play a central role both within and beyond statistics, providing the basis for power analysis in molecular biology, theory building in particle physics, and resource allocation in epidemiology, for example. We introduce the probabilistic and computational concepts underlying modern generative models and then analyze how they can be used to inform experimental design, iterative model refinement, goodness-of-fit evaluation, and agent based simulation. We emphasize a modular view of generative mechanisms and discuss how they can be flexibly recombined in new problem contexts. We provide practical illustrations throughout, and code for reproducing all examples is available at \nhttps://github.com/krisrs1128/generative_review\n. Finally, we observe how research in generative models is currently split across several islands of activity, and we highlight opportunities lying at disciplinary intersections.", "generated_text": "Generative models have revolutionized various fields by enabling the simulation of complex systems and the estimation of uncertain parameters. This interdisciplinary perspective explores the applications of generative models in decision-making, agent-based modeling, and experimental design. By leveraging techniques from particle filter and model evaluation, researchers can assess the goodness-of-fit of generative models to real-world data. The integration of generative models with simulation techniques allows for the estimation of uncertain parameters and the prediction of system behavior. This review highlights the key challenges and opportunities in the development of generative models, including model evaluation, parameter estimation, and the incorporation of uncertainty. By examining the intersection of generative models and decision-making, agent-based modeling, and experimental design, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential applications and limitations of these models in various fields.", "label": 0}
