{"grounding": "In the era of precision medicine, time-to-event outcomes such as time to death or progression are routinely collected, along with high-throughput covariates. These high-dimensional data defy classical survival regression models, which are either infeasible to fit or likely to incur low predictability due to overfitting. To overcome this, recent emphasis has been placed on developing novel approaches for feature selection and survival prognostication. In this article, we review various cutting-edge methods that handle survival outcome data with high-dimensional predictors, highlighting recent innovations in machine learning approaches for survival prediction. We cover the statistical intuitions and principles behind these methods and conclude with extensions to more complex settings, where competing events are observed. We exemplify these methods with applications to the Boston Lung Cancer Survival Cohort study, one of the largest cancer epidemiology cohorts investigating the complex mechanisms of lung cancer.", "generated_text": "High-dimensional survival analysis is a crucial aspect of precision medicine, where the complexity of biological systems necessitates the integration of multiple variables to predict patient outcomes. This review article discusses novel methods and applications of high-dimensional survival analysis, focusing on feature screening techniques and machine learning algorithms. We explore the use of artificial neural networks to improve predictive accuracy and discuss the importance of statistical inference in high-dimensional datasets. Our analysis highlights the challenges and opportunities in high-dimensional survival analysis, including the need for robust feature selection and the potential of machine learning to improve predictive models. By integrating insights from data science and statistical inference, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for high-dimensional survival analysis and its applications in precision medicine.", "label": 1}
