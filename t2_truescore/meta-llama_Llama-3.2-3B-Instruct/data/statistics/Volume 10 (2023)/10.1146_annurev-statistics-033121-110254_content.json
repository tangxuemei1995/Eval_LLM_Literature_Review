{"grounding": "Rich data generating mechanisms are ubiquitous in this age of information and require complex statistical models to draw meaningful inference. While Bayesian analysis has seen enormous development in the last 30 years, benefitting from the impetus given by the successful application of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, the combination of big data and complex models conspire to produce significant challenges for the traditional MCMC algorithms. We review modern algorithmic developments addressing the latter and compare their performance using numerical experiments.", "generated_text": "This study explores approximate Bayesian computation methods, focusing on Bayesian synthetic likelihood, coreset-based approaches, and divide-and-conquer strategies. By leveraging subsampling techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, researchers can efficiently approximate complex Bayesian models. The proposed methods, including Bayesian synthetic likelihood and coreset-based methods, demonstrate improved computational efficiency and accuracy in Bayesian inference, making them suitable for large-scale applications and high-dimensional data.", "label": 0}
