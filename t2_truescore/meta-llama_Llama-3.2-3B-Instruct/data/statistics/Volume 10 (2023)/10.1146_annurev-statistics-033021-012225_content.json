{"grounding": "Exoplanets can be detected with various observational techniques. Among them, radial velocity (RV) has the key advantages of revealing the architecture of planetary systems and measuring planetary mass and orbital eccentricities. RV observations are poised to play a key role in the detection and characterization of Earth twins. However, the detection of such small planets is not yet possible due to very complex, temporally correlated instrumental and astrophysical stochastic signals. Furthermore, exploring the large parameter space of RV models exhaustively and efficiently presents difficulties. In this review, we frame RV data analysis as a problem of detection and parameter estimation in unevenly sampled, multivariate time series. The objective of this review is two-fold: to introduce the motivation, methodological challenges, and numerical challenges of RV data analysis to nonspecialists, and to unify the existing advanced approaches in order to identify areas for improvement.", "generated_text": "The detection of exoplanets using radial velocity measurements has been a cornerstone of exoplanetary science for decades. However, the analysis of these data is often plagued by correlated noise and uneven sampling, which can lead to model misspecification and biased results. This study presents a comprehensive framework for statistical methods to address these challenges. We develop a multivariate time series model that accounts for correlated noise and uneven sampling, and compare its performance to existing models. Our results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for model misspecification in exoplanet detection, and provide guidelines for model selection and validation. The proposed methods have significant implications for the detection and characterization of exoplanets, and can be applied to a wide range of radial velocity datasets.", "label": 0}
