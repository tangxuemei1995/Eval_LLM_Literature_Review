{"grounding": "Recent technological advances allow for the collection of massive data in the study of complex phenomena over time and/or space in various fields. Many of these data involve sequences of high-dimensional or non-Euclidean measurements, where change-point analysis is a crucial early step in understanding the data. Segmentation, or offline change-point analysis, divides data into homogeneous temporal or spatial segments, making subsequent analysis easier; its online counterpart detects changes in sequentially observed data, allowing for real-time anomaly detection. This article reviews a nonparametric change-point analysis framework that utilizes graphs representing the similarity between observations. This framework can be applied to data as long as a reasonable dissimilarity distance among the observations can be defined. Thus, this framework can be applied to a wide range of applications, from high-dimensional data to non-Euclidean data, such as imaging data or network data. In addition, analytic formulas can be derived to control the false discoveries, making them easy off-the-shelf data analysis tools.", "generated_text": "Graph-based change-point analysis is a novel approach to detecting abrupt changes in high-dimensional network data, particularly in non-Euclidean spaces. By leveraging graph-theoretic concepts, such as network topology and community structure, this method extends traditional change-point detection techniques to accommodate nonparametric and high-dimensional data. The proposed graph-based scan statistic is designed to efficiently identify changes in the tail probability of network properties, allowing for the detection of subtle changes in network behavior. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various network data sets, including social networks, biological networks, and transportation networks. The results show that the graph-based change-point analysis outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. This work provides a significant contribution to the field of network science and change-point analysis, offering a powerful tool for detecting changes in complex network data.", "label": 1}
