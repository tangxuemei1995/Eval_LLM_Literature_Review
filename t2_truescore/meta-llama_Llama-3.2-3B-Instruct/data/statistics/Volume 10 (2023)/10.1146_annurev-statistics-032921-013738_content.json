{"grounding": "We expose the statistical foundations of deep learning with the goal of facilitating conversation between the deep learning and statistics communities. We highlight core themes at the intersection; summarize key neural models, such as feedforward neural networks, sequential neural networks, and neural latent variable models; and link these ideas to their roots in probability and statistics. We also highlight research directions in deep learning where there are opportunities for statistical contributions.", "generated_text": "This review provides a statistical perspective on deep learning, highlighting the underlying principles of neural networks and their applications in pattern recognition. We discuss the optimization techniques used to train deep neural networks, including stochastic gradient descent and its variants. The statistical properties of deep neural networks are also examined, including their capacity for generalization and the role of regularization. The implications of these findings for deep learning are discussed.", "label": 0}
