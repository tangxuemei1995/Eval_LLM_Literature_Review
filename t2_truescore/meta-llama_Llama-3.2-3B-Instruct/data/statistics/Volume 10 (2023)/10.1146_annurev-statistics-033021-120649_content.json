{"grounding": "Machine learning algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in modern life. When used to help inform human decision making, they have been criticized by some for insufficient accuracy, an absence of transparency, and unfairness. Many of these concerns can be legitimate, although they are less convincing when compared with the uneven quality of human decisions. There is now a large literature in statistics and computer science offering a range of proposed improvements. In this article, we focus on machine learning algorithms used to forecast risk, such as those employed by judges to anticipate a convicted offender's future dangerousness and by physicians to help formulate a medical prognosis or ration scarce medical care. We review a variety of conceptual, technical, and practical features common to risk algorithms and offer suggestions for how their development and use might be meaningfully advanced. Fairness concerns are emphasized.", "generated_text": "This study examines the fairness of risk algorithms in the context of criminal justice, leveraging techniques from optimal transport and conformation prediction to mitigate discrimination. By analyzing the performance of machine learning models in risk assessment, we identify biases in the data and algorithms that can lead to disparate treatment of marginalized groups. Our results show that traditional fairness metrics are insufficient to detect and address these issues, highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches. We propose a novel framework that incorporates conformation prediction to identify and correct biases in the data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing discrimination. The findings of this research have significant implications for the development of fair risk algorithms in high-stakes applications, and contribute to the ongoing debate on the ethics of machine learning in the criminal justice system.", "label": 0}
