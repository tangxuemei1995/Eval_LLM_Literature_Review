{"grounding": "Researchers studying the evolution of viral pathogens and other organisms increasingly encounter and use large and complex data sets from multiple different sources. Statistical research in Bayesian phylogenetics has risen to this challenge. Researchers use phylogenetics not only to reconstruct the evolutionary history of a group of organisms, but also to understand the processes that guide its evolution and spread through space and time. To this end, it is now the norm to integrate numerous sources of data. For example, epidemiologists studying the spread of a virus through a region incorporate data including genetic sequences (e.g., DNA), time, location (both continuous and discrete), and environmental covariates (e.g., social connectivity between regions) into a coherent statistical model. Evolutionary biologists routinely do the same with genetic sequences, location, time, fossil and modern phenotypes, and ecological covariates. These complex, hierarchical models readily accommodate both discrete and continuous data and have enormous combined discrete/continuous parameter spaces including, at a minimum, phylogenetic tree topologies and branch lengths. The increasedsize and complexity of these statistical models have spurred advances in computational methods to make them tractable. We discuss both the modeling and computational advances, as well as unsolved problems and areas of active research.", "generated_text": "The integration of diverse data types is a crucial aspect of Bayesian phylogenetics, enabling the estimation of complex phylogenetic relationships and the inference of evolutionary processes. This review synthesizes recent advances in data integration using Bayesian networks, continuous-time Markov processes, and Gaussian processes. Bayesian networks have been employed to model the relationships between phylogenetic and ecological data, allowing for the estimation of phylogenetic effects on trait evolution. Continuous-time Markov processes have been used to model the dynamics of phylogenetic trees, enabling the estimation of rates of speciation and extinction. Gaussian processes have been applied to integrate phylogenetic and environmental data, facilitating the estimation of species distribution models. Phylogeographic data have been integrated with phylogenetic data using phylogenetic comparative methods, enabling the estimation of gene flow and migration patterns. The integration of these approaches has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of evolutionary processes and the relationships between organisms and their environments. By leveraging the strengths of each approach, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions that shape the evolution of life on Earth.", "label": 1}
