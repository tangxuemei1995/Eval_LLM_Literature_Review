{"grounding": "This article reviews recent progress in high-dimensional bootstrap. We first review high-dimensional central limit theorems for distributions of sample mean vectors over the rectangles, bootstrap consistency results in high dimensions, and key techniques used to establish those results. We then review selected applications of high-dimensional bootstrap: construction of simultaneous confidence sets for high-dimensional vector parameters, multiple hypothesis testing via step-down, postselection inference, intersection bounds for partially identified parameters, and inference on best policies in policy evaluation. Finally, we also comment on a couple of future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the application of the multiplier bootstrap method to high-dimensional data, leveraging the high-dimensional central limit theorem to improve empirical bootstrap accuracy. By accounting for multiple testing, the method mitigates the risk of false positives and enhances simultaneous inference capabilities. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the multiplier bootstrap approach in reducing bias and improving precision in high-dimensional data, with implications for statistical inference and hypothesis testing in various fields.", "label": 0}
