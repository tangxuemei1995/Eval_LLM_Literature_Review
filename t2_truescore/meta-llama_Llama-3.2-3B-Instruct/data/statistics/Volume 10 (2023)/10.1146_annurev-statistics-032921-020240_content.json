{"grounding": "Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation are closely related tasks, with the former concerning in-sample goodness (or lack) of fit and the latter addressing predictive performance out-of-sample. We review the ubiquitous setting in which forecasts are cast in the form of quantiles or quantile-bounded prediction intervals. We distinguish unconditional calibration, which corresponds to classical coverage criteria, from the stronger notion of conditional calibration, as can be visualized in quantile reliability diagrams. Consistent scoring functions\u2014including, but not limited to, the widely used asymmetricpiecewise linear score or pinball loss\u2014provide for comparative assessment and ranking, and link to the coefficient of determination and skill scores. We illustrate the use of these tools on Engel's food expenditure data, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub.", "generated_text": "This study focuses on the development of model diagnostics and forecast evaluation methods for quantile regression models. A calibration plot and Murphy diagram are employed to assess the accuracy of quantile forecasts, while a reliability diagram is used to evaluate the robustness of the model. Additionally, a scoring function is proposed to quantify the performance of the model in terms of quantile coverage. The proposed methods are applied to a real-world dataset, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying model issues and evaluating forecast accuracy. The results show that the proposed methods provide a comprehensive assessment of quantile regression models, enabling researchers to make informed decisions about model selection and improvement.", "label": 1}
