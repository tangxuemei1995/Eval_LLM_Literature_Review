{"grounding": "Dependent survival data arise in many contexts. One context is clustered survival data, where survival data are collected on clusters such as families or medical centers. Dependent survival data also arise when multiple survival times are recorded for each individual. Frailty models are one common approach to handle such data. In frailty models, the dependence is expressed in terms of a random effect, called the frailty. Frailty models have been used with both the Cox proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time model. This article reviews recent developments in the area of frailty models in a variety of settings. In each setting we provide a detailed model description, assumptions, available estimation methods, and R packages.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes recent advances in shared frailty methods for complex survival data, focusing on applications in clustered, competing event, and recurrent event settings. The accelerated failure time (AFT) model and Cox regression are discussed, highlighting their limitations in handling unbalanced data and competing events. Regression trees and random survival forests are also examined, showcasing their potential in modeling shared frailty in clustered data. The review highlights the importance of accounting for shared frailty in survival analysis, particularly in the presence of competing events and recurrent events. Recent methodological developments and their applications are discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of shared frailty methods in survival analysis.", "label": 1}
