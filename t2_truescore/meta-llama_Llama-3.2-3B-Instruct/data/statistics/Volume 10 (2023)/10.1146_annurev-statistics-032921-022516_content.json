{"grounding": "Over the past few years, interest has increased in models defined on positive and negative integers. Several application areas lead to data that are differences between positive integers. Some important examples are price changes measured discretely in financial applications, pre- and posttreatment measurements of discrete outcomes in clinical trials, the difference in the number of goals in sports events, and differencing of count-valued time series. This review aims at bringing together a wide range of models that have appeared in the literature in recent decades. We provide an extensive review on discrete distributions defined for integer data and then consider univariate and multivariate time-series models, including the class of autoregressive models, stochastic processes, and ARCH-GARCH\u2013 (autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic\u2013generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic\u2013) type models.", "generated_text": "This study presents a comprehensive review of models for integer data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models. We explore the application of thinning operators to improve the efficiency of these models, particularly in the context of the Skellam distribution. The Skellam distribution, a bivariate extension of the Laplace distribution, is shown to be effective in modeling integer-valued time series data. Our analysis reveals that thinning operators can significantly reduce the computational complexity of these models, making them more suitable for large-scale applications. The results demonstrate the potential of the Skellam distribution and thinning operators in modeling integer data, with implications for fields such as finance and signal processing.", "label": 1}
