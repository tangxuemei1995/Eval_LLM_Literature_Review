{"grounding": "When assessing causal effects, determining the target population to which the results are intended to generalize is a critical decision. Randomized and observational studies each have strengths and limitations for estimating causal effects in a target population. Estimates from randomized data may have internal validity but are often not representative of the target population. Observational data may better reflect the target population, and hence be more likely to have external validity, but are subject to potential bias due to unmeasured confounding. While much of the causal inference literature has focused on addressing internal validity bias, both internal and external validity are necessary for unbiased estimates in a target population. This article presents a framework for addressing external validity bias, including a synthesis of approaches for generalizability and transportability, and the assumptions they require, as well as tests for the heterogeneity of treatment effects and differences between study and target populations.", "generated_text": "This review examines the concepts of generalizability and transportability in the context of causal inference, with a focus on their implications for external validity and treatment effect heterogeneity. Generalizability refers to the extent to which findings from a specific study can be applied to other contexts, while transportability refers to the ability to replicate results in new settings. The authors discuss the theoretical underpinnings of generalizability and transportability, including the role of treatment effect heterogeneity in limiting the generalizability of causal inferences. A comprehensive review of the literature reveals that generalizability and transportability are critical concerns in causal inference, particularly in fields such as public health and social sciences. The authors highlight the need for researchers to carefully consider the generalizability and transportability of their findings, and to develop strategies for improving these aspects of causal inference. Ultimately, this review aims to contribute to the development of a more nuanced understanding of generalizability and transportability, and to inform best practices in causal inference research.", "label": 1}
