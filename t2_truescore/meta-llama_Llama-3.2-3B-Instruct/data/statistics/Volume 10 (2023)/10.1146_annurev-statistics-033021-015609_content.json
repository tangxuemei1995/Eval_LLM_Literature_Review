{"grounding": "Several major global challenges, including climate change and water scarcity, warrant a scientific approach to generating solutions. Developing high quality and robust capacity in (bio)statistics is key to ensuring sound scientific solutions to these challenges, so collaboration between academic and research institutes should be high on university agendas. To strengthen capacity in the developing world, South\u2013North partnerships should be a priority. The ideas and examples of statistical capacity-building presented in this article are the result of several monthly online discussions between a mixedgroup of authors having international experience and formal links with Hasselt University in Belgium. The discussion focuses on statistical capacity-building through education (teaching), research, and societal impact. We have adopted an example-based approach, and in view of the background of the authors, the examples refer mainly to biostatistical capacity-building. Although many universities worldwide have already initiated university collaborations for development, we hope and believe that our ideas and concrete examples can serve as inspiration to further strengthen South\u2013North partnerships on statistical capacity-building.", "generated_text": "This study examines the importance of sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa, with a focus on biostatistics. The authors highlight the need for enhanced human capital in the region, particularly in the field of biostatistics, to address the growing demand for data-driven decision-making in healthcare and research. A mixed-methods approach was employed to investigate the current state of biostatistical capacity in Africa, with a focus on the role of South-North collaboration in addressing knowledge gaps. The findings indicate that existing biostatistical capacity in Africa is limited, with a significant shortage of skilled professionals and inadequate infrastructure. The authors propose a sustainable capacity-building framework that incorporates consulting, education, and research initiatives, with a focus on building partnerships between African institutions and international organizations. This framework aims to enhance human capital, improve statistical infrastructure, and promote data-driven decision-making in Africa.", "label": 0}
