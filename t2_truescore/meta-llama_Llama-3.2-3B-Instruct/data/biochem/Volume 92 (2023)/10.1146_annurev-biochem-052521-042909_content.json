{"grounding": "Muscles are essential for movement and heart function. Contraction and relaxation of muscles rely on the sliding of two types of filaments\u2014the thin filament and the thick myosin filament. The thin filament is composed mainly of filamentous actin (F-actin), tropomyosin, and troponin. Additionally, several other proteins are involved in the contraction mechanism, and their malfunction can lead to diverse muscle diseases, such as cardiomyopathies. We review recent high-resolution structural data that explain the mechanism of action of muscle proteins at an unprecedented level of molecular detail. We focus on the molecular structures of the components of the thin and thick filaments and highlight the mechanisms underlying force generation through actin\u2013myosin interactions, as well as Ca2+-dependent regulation via the dihydropyridine receptor, the ryanodine receptor, and troponin. We particularly emphasize the impact of cryo\u2013electron microscopy and cryo\u2013electron tomography in leading muscle research into a new era.", "generated_text": "Muscle contraction is a complex process involving the coordinated interaction of multiple proteins, including actin and myosin filaments, and regulatory molecules such as troponin and ryanodine receptor. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have enabled the high-resolution structural characterization of muscle contraction. Cryo-EM studies have revealed the detailed architecture of the actin-myosin complex, including the binding sites for myosin heads and the regulation of muscle contraction by troponin and tropomyosin. Cryo-ET has provided insights into the ultrastructure of muscle fibers, including the organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the distribution of ryanodine receptors. These structural studies have significant implications for our understanding of muscle physiology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for muscle-related diseases. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle contraction and to translate these findings into clinical applications.", "label": 1}
