{"grounding": "Chemical modifications on mRNA represent a critical layer of gene expression regulation. Research in this area has continued to accelerate over the last decade, as more modifications are being characterized with increasing depth and breadth. mRNA modifications have been demonstrated to influence nearly every step from the early phases of transcript synthesis in the nucleus through to their decay in the cytoplasm, but in many cases, the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes remain mysterious. Here, we highlight recent work that has elucidated the roles of mRNA modifications throughout the mRNA life cycle, describe gaps in our understanding and remaining open questions, and offer some forward-looking perspective on future directions in the field.", "generated_text": "The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) by RNA modifications is a crucial aspect of posttranscriptional control, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of RNA modifications, such as 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), and N6-methyladenosine (N6-meA), in modulating mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and localization. The epitranscriptome, the complete set of RNA modifications, has been shown to play a key role in regulating mRNA metabolism, interacting with various RNA-binding proteins and influencing the expression of key genes. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of mRNA regulation by RNA modifications, highlighting the complex interplay between these modifications and the epitranscriptome in regulating gene expression.", "label": 1}
