{"grounding": "In this autobiographical article, I reflect on my Swedish background. Then I discuss endogenous DNA alterations and the base excision repair pathway and alternative repair strategies for some unusual DNA lesions. Endogenous DNA damage, such as loss of purine bases and cytosine deamination, is proposed as a major source of cancer-causing mutations.", "generated_text": "This personal account of DNA fragility and repair recounts the author's experiences with endogenous DNA damage and its consequences on cellular function. Through the lens of base excision repair and DNA glycosylases, the narrative explores the intricate mechanisms underlying cancer mutations, shedding light on the complex interplay between genetic instability and disease.", "label": 0}
