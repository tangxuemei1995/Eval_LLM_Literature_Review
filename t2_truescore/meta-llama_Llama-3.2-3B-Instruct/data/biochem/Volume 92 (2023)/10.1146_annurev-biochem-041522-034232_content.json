{"grounding": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR), discovered as preferential nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers located in transcribed mammalian genes compared to those in nontranscribed regions of the genome, is defined as faster repair of the transcribed strand versus the nontranscribed strand in transcribed genes. The phenomenon, universal in model organisms including Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, mice, and humans, involves a translocase that interacts with both RNA polymerase stalled at damage in the transcribed strand and nucleotide excision repair proteins to accelerate repair. Drosophila, a notable exception, exhibits TCR but lacks an obvious TCR translocase. Mutations inactivating TCR genes cause increased damage-induced mutagenesis in E. coli and severe neurological and UV sensitivity syndromes in humans. To date, only E. coli TCR has been reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins. Detailed investigations of TCR using genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, cryo\u2013electron microscopy, single-molecule analysis, and other approaches have revealed fascinating mechanisms.", "generated_text": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a crucial DNA repair pathway that coordinates transcription and repair processes to maintain genome stability. The molecular mechanisms underlying TCR involve the interaction between the transcription-repair coupling factor (Mfd) and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the chromatin remodeling factor CSB in regulating TCR activity. Mutagenesis studies have also revealed that TCR plays a key role in maintaining genome integrity in response to UV-induced damage. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that TCR may also be linked to the circadian clock, with implications for our understanding of the interplay between transcription, repair, and time-dependent gene regulation. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of TCR mechanisms, highlighting the complex interplay between transcription, repair, and chromatin remodeling, and exploring the potential implications for our understanding of genome stability and time-dependent gene regulation.", "label": 1}
