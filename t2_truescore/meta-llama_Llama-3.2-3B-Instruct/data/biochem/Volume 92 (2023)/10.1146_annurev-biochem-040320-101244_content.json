{"grounding": "Carbon fixation is the process by which CO2 is converted from a gas into biomass. The Calvin\u2013Benson\u2013Bassham cycle (CBB) is the dominant carbon-consuming pathway on Earth, driving >99.5% of the \u223c120 billion tons of carbon that are converted to sugar by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The carboxylase enzyme in the CBB, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), fixes one CO2 molecule per turn of the cycle into bioavailable sugars. Despite being critical to the assimilation of carbon, rubisco's kinetic rate is not very fast, limiting flux through the pathway. This bottleneck presents a paradox: Why has rubisco not evolved to be a better catalyst? Many hypothesize that the catalytic mechanism of rubisco is subject to one or more trade-offs and that rubisco variants have been optimized for their native physiological environment. Here, we review the evolution and biochemistry of rubisco through the lens of structure and mechanism in order to understand what trade-offs limit its improvement. We also review the many attempts to improve rubisco itself and thereby promote plant growth.", "generated_text": "Rubisco, a crucial enzyme in the Calvin cycle, plays a pivotal role in carbon fixation and oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere. This enzyme, responsible for the fixation of CO2 into organic compounds, has been the subject of extensive research on its function, evolution, and engineering. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate mechanisms underlying rubisco's catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of its unique active site and allosteric regulation. The evolution of rubisco has been shaped by its ability to adapt to diverse environments, with various species exhibiting distinct substrate specificities and kinetic properties. In response to the increasing demand for sustainable bioenergy and agriculture, rubisco engineering has emerged as a promising strategy for improving crop yields and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By harnessing the power of enzyme engineering, researchers are developing novel rubisco variants with enhanced activity, stability, and specificity, paving the way for the development of more efficient carbon fixation pathways and a more sustainable future.", "label": 1}
