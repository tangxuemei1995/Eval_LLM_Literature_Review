{"grounding": "Ligands of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway are paracrine signaling molecules that coordinate tissue development in metazoans. A remarkable feature of HH signaling is the repeated use of cholesterol in steps spanning ligand biogenesis, secretion, dispersal, and reception on target cells. A cholesterol molecule covalently attached to HH ligands is used as a molecular baton by transfer proteins to guide their secretion, spread, and reception. On target cells, a signaling circuit composed of a cholesterol transporter and sensor regulates transmission of HH signals across the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The repeated use of cholesterol in signaling supports the view that the HH pathway likely evolved by coopting ancient systems to regulate the abundance or organization of sterol-like lipids in membranes.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between cholesterol and hedgehog signaling has been elucidated through a comprehensive analysis of primary cilium biology and cell surface receptor interactions. Cholesterol plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including those involved in hedgehog signaling. The presence of cholesterol in biological membranes influences the conformation and function of these receptors, thereby affecting the downstream signaling cascades. This study highlights the critical involvement of cholesterol in regulating hedgehog signaling, with implications for our understanding of primary cilium function and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with hedgehog signaling dysregulation.", "label": 0}
