{"grounding": "The insulin receptor (IR) is a type II receptor tyrosine kinase that plays essential roles in metabolism, growth, and proliferation. Dysregulation of IR signaling is linked to many human diseases, such as diabetes and cancers. The resolution revolution in cryo\u2013electron microscopy has led to the determination of several structures of IR with different numbers of bound insulin molecules in recent years, which have tremendously improved our understanding of how IR is activated by insulin. Here, we review the insulin-induced activation mechanism of IR, including (a) the detailed binding modes and functions of insulin at site 1 and site 2 and (b) the insulin-induced structural transitions that are required for IR activation. We highlight several other key aspects of the activation and regulation of IR signaling and discuss the remaining gaps in our understanding of the IR activation mechanism and potential avenues of future research.", "generated_text": "The insulin receptor plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis, and its activation mechanism is a complex process involving multiple steps. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structural characterization of the insulin receptor in its active state. This study provides a detailed structural perspective on the activation mechanism of the insulin receptor, focusing on the insulin-binding sites. The insulin-binding site 1 (IBS1) and insulin-binding site 2 (IBS2) are critical regions for insulin binding and signaling. Cryo-EM structures reveal the conformational changes that occur upon insulin binding, including the rearrangement of IBS1 and IBS2. The study highlights the importance of IBS1 and IBS2 in mediating insulin-induced receptor activation, and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin signaling. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diabetes and insulin resistance.", "label": 0}
