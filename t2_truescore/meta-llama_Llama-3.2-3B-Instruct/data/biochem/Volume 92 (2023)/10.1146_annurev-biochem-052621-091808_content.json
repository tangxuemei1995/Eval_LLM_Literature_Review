{"grounding": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translational efficiency are two crucial aspects of the post-transcriptional process that profoundly impact protein production in a cell. While it is widely known that ribosomes produce proteins, studies during the past decade have surprisingly revealed that ribosomes also control mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner, a process referred to as codon optimality. Therefore, codons, the three-nucleotide words read by the ribosome, have a potent effect on mRNA stability and provide cis-regulatory information that extends beyond the amino acids they encode. While the codon optimality molecular mechanism is still unclear, the translation elongation rate appears to trigger mRNA decay. Thus, transfer RNAs emerge as potential master gene regulators affecting mRNA stability. Furthermore, while few factors related to codon optimality have been identified in yeast, the orthologous genes in vertebrates do not necessary share the same functions. Here, we discuss codon optimality findings and gene regulation layers related to codon composition in different eukaryotic species.", "generated_text": "Translation and mRNA stability control are intricately linked processes that govern protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of codon optimality in ensuring efficient translation elongation, while also influencing mRNA stability. The interaction between codon usage and tRNA availability plays a crucial role in regulating translation rates. Furthermore, the degradation of mRNA through various mechanisms, including nonsense-mediated decay and microRNA-mediated regulation, can impact protein synthesis. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of the interplay between codon optimality, tRNA, translation elongation, mRNA decay, codon usage, and mRNA stability. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes and their implications for protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, and disease. By elucidating the complex relationships between these factors, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the regulation of translation and mRNA stability.", "label": 0}
