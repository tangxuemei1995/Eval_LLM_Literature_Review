{"grounding": "The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are abundant polycations of vital importance in mammalian cells. Their cellular levels are tightly regulated by degradation and synthesis, as well as by uptake and export. Here, we discuss the delicate balance between the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of polyamines in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyamine levels decline with aging and are altered in patients with PD, whereas recent mechanistic studies on ATP13A2 (PARK9) demonstrated a driving role of a disturbed polyamine homeostasis in PD. Polyamines affect pathways in PD pathogenesis, such as \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, and influence PD-related processes like autophagy, heavy metal toxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and lysosomal/mitochondrial dysfunction. We formulate outstanding research questions regarding the role of polyamines in PD, their potential as PD biomarkers, and possible therapeutic strategies for PD targeting polyamine homeostasis.", "generated_text": "Polyamines play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in neurons. While polyamines can exhibit neurotoxic effects by disrupting mitochondrial function and inducing oxidative stress, they also possess neuroprotective properties by modulating astrocyte activity and regulating lysosomal endo/lysosomal dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between polyamines and \u03b1-synuclein, suggesting that polyamines may influence the formation and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of polyamines in PD, focusing on their role in balancing neurotoxicity and neuroprotection, and exploring potential therapeutic strategies that target polyamine metabolism to mitigate PD progression. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying polyamine-mediated neuroprotection, this review seeks to provide a framework for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for PD treatment.", "label": 1}
