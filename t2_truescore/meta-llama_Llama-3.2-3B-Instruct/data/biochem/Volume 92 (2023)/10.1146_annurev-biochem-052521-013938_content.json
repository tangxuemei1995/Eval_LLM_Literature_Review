{"grounding": "DNA-editing enzymes perform chemical reactions on DNA nucleobases. These reactions can change the genetic identity of the modified base or modulate gene expression. Interest in DNA-editing enzymes has burgeoned in recent years due to the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems, which can be used to direct their DNA-editing activity to specific genomic loci of interest. In this review, we showcase DNA-editing enzymes that have been repurposed or redesigned and developed into programmable base editors. These include deaminases, glycosylases, methyltransferases, and demethylases. We highlight the astounding degree to which these enzymes have been redesigned, evolved, and refined and present these collective engineering efforts as a paragon for future efforts to repurpose and engineer other families of enzymes. Collectively, base editors derived from these DNA-editing enzymes facilitate programmable point mutation introduction and gene expression modulation by targeted chemical modification of nucleobases.", "generated_text": "The development of base editors has revolutionized the field of genome editing, enabling precise and efficient modifications to DNA sequences. By harnessing the catalytic capabilities of deaminases, methyltransferases, and demethylases, base editors can introduce specific base substitutions, modifications, or removals at targeted locations within the genome. Recent advances in protein engineering have facilitated the design and optimization of base editors, allowing for improved specificity, efficiency, and scalability. This review provides an overview of the design principles and applications of base editors, highlighting their potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and advancing synthetic biology. The integration of base editors with other genome editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, has also been explored, enabling the creation of hybrid systems with enhanced capabilities. The future of base editors holds great promise for transforming the field of genome editing and beyond.", "label": 0}
