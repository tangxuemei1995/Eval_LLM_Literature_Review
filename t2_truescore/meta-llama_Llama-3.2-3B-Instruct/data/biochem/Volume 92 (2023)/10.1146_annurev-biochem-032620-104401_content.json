{"grounding": "According to the endosymbiotic theory, most of the DNA of the original bacterial endosymbiont has been lost or transferred to the nucleus, leaving a much smaller (\u223c16 kb in mammals), circular molecule that is the present-day mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The ability of mtDNA to escape mitochondria and integrate into the nuclear genome was discovered in budding yeast, along with genes that regulate this process. Mitochondria have emerged as key regulators of innate immunity, and it is now recognized that mtDNA released into the cytoplasm, outside of the cell, or into circulation activates multiple innate immune signaling pathways. Here, we first review the mechanisms through which mtDNA is released into the cytoplasm, including several inducible mitochondrial pores and defective mitophagy or autophagy. Next, we cover how the different forms of released mtDNA activate specific innate immune nucleic acid sensors and inflammasomes. Finally, we discuss how intracellular and extracellular mtDNA release, including circulating cell-free mtDNA that promotes systemic inflammation, are implicated in human diseases, bacterial and viral infections, senescence and aging.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release plays a crucial role in innate immune signaling, serving as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that triggers the activation of immune cells. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of mtDNA in the regulation of inflammation and the initiation of immune responses. The mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) pore, also known as the permeability transition pore (PTP), is a key mechanism by which mtDNA is released into the cytosol. This process is mediated by the opening of the MOMP pore, which allows the passage of mtDNA and other pro-inflammatory molecules. The release of mtDNA has been implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms underlying mtDNA release and its role in innate immune signaling is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating inflammation and immune responses. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between mtDNA, immune cells, and the mitochondrial PTP.", "label": 1}
