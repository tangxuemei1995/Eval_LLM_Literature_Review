{"grounding": "Thiolases are CoA-dependent enzymes that catalyze the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA, as well as its reverse reaction, which is the thioester-dependent Claisen condensation reaction. Thiolases are dimers or tetramers (dimers of dimers). All thiolases have two reactive cysteines: (a) a nucleophilic cysteine, which forms a covalent intermediate, and (b) an acid/base cysteine. The best characterized thiolase is the Zoogloea ramigera thiolase, which is a bacterial biosynthetic thiolase belonging to the CT-thiolase subfamily. The thiolase active site is also characterized by two oxyanion holes, two active site waters, and four catalytic loops with characteristic amino acid sequence fingerprints. Three thiolase subfamilies can be identified, each characterized by a unique sequence fingerprint for one of their catalytic loops, which causes unique active site properties. Recent insights concerning the thiolase reaction mechanism, as obtained from recent structural studies, as well as from classical and recent enzymological studies, are addressed, and open questions are discussed.", "generated_text": "Thiolase, a biocatalyst utilizing coenzyme A-thioester chemistry, plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation and cleavage of C-C bonds. This enzyme's unique mechanism involves the creation of an oxyanion hole, a proton wire, and a hydrogen-bond network, which synergistically enhance its catalytic activity. By leveraging these structural features, thiolase enables the efficient execution of Claisen condensation reactions, a type of C-C bond-forming process. Furthermore, the enzyme's ability to facilitate the breaking of C-C bonds is attributed to its capacity to form a thioester intermediate, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to release the desired product. The intricate interplay between coenzyme A, the oxyanion hole, and the hydrogen-bond network underscores the remarkable versatility of thiolase as a biocatalyst, with far-reaching implications for the development of novel biochemical pathways and synthetic organic chemistry applications.", "label": 0}
