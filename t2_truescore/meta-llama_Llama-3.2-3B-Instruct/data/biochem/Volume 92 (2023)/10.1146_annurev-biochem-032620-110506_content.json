{"grounding": "SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) protein complexes are an evolutionarily conserved family of motor proteins that hold sister chromatids together and fold genomes throughout the cell cycle by DNA loop extrusion. These complexes play a key role in a variety of functions in the packaging and regulation of chromosomes, and they have been intensely studied in recent years. Despite their importance, the detailed molecular mechanism for DNA loop extrusion by SMC complexes remains unresolved. Here, we describe the roles of SMCs in chromosome biology and particularly review in vitro single-molecule studies that have recently advanced our understanding of SMC proteins. We describe the mechanistic biophysical aspects of loop extrusion that govern genome organization and its consequences.", "generated_text": "The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes play a crucial role in genome organization by facilitating the looping of chromatin domains. Recent advances in single-molecule studies have provided insights into the mechanisms of DNA loop extrusion, a process mediated by SMC complexes. These studies have revealed that SMC complexes can form dynamic loops that connect distant chromatin regions, influencing gene expression and genome stability. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA loop extrusion is essential for elucidating the functional roles of SMC complexes in genome organization and its implications for human disease. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on SMC complexes and DNA loop extrusion, highlighting recent findings and future directions.", "label": 1}
