{"grounding": "Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes use a site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] cluster and SAM to initiate radical reactions through liberation of the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl (5\u2032-dAdo\u2022) radical. They form the largest enzyme superfamily, with more than 700,000 unique sequences currently, and their numbers continue to grow as a result of ongoing bioinformatics efforts. The range of extremely diverse, highly regio- and stereo-specific reactions known to be catalyzed by radical SAM superfamily members is remarkable. The common mechanism of radical initiation in the radical SAM superfamily is the focus of this review. Most surprising is the presence of an organometallic intermediate, \u03a9, exhibiting an Fe\u2013C5\u2032-adenosyl bond. Regioselective reductive cleavage of the SAM S\u2013C5\u2032 bond produces 5\u2032-dAdo\u2022 to form \u03a9, with the regioselectivity originating in the Jahn\u2013Teller effect. \u03a9 liberates the free 5\u2032-dAdo\u2022 as the catalytically active intermediate through homolysis of the Fe\u2013C5\u2032 bond, in analogy to Co\u2013C5\u2032 bond homolysis in B12, which was once viewed as biology's choice of radical generator.", "generated_text": "The radical SAM enzyme superfamily is a diverse group of enzymes that utilize S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a cofactor to catalyze a wide range of reactions, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and the synthesis of complex biomolecules. A key mechanism underlying the enzymatic activity of these enzymes is the formation of a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is generated through the cleavage of SAM. This radical is then transferred to a substrate, facilitating the reaction. Recent studies have elucidated the organometallic mechanism of radical SAM enzyme catalysis, revealing a complex interplay between the metal cofactor, the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical, and the substrate. Understanding the mechanism of radical initiation in these enzymes is crucial for elucidating their biological functions and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the mechanism of radical initiation in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily, highlighting the key steps and players involved in this process.", "label": 1}
