{"grounding": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and other genotoxic stresses induce bulky DNA lesions, which threaten genome stability and cell viability. Cells have evolved two main repair pathways to remove such lesions: global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The modes by which these subpathways recognize DNA lesions are distinct, but they converge onto the same downstream steps for DNA repair. Here, we first summarize the current understanding of these repair mechanisms, specifically focusing on the roles of stalled RNA polymerase II, Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), CSA and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) in TC-NER. We also discuss the intriguing role of protein ubiquitylation in this process. Additionally, we highlight key aspects of the effect of UV irradiation on transcription and describe the role of signaling cascades in orchestrating this response. Finally, we describe the pathogenic mechanisms underlying xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, the two main diseases linked to mutations in NER factors.", "generated_text": "UV-induced DNA damage triggers a complex transcriptional response that involves the activation of DNA repair pathways, including transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER). TC-NER is a specialized DNA repair mechanism that prioritizes the repair of transcribed DNA regions, while GG-NER is a more general mechanism that repairs DNA damage throughout the genome. Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between TC-NER and RNA polymerase II, the primary transcriptional machinery in eukaryotes. In Cockayne syndrome, a disorder characterized by impaired GG-NER, mutations in RNA polymerase II subunits have been linked to the disease. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage, with a focus on the interplay between TC-NER, RNA polymerase II, and GG-NER, and the implications for our understanding of human diseases such as Cockayne syndrome.", "label": 1}
