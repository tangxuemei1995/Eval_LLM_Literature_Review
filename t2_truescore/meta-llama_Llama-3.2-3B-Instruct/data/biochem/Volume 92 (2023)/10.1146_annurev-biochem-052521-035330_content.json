{"grounding": "Over the past decade, mRNA modifications have emerged as important regulators of gene expression control in cells. Fueled in large part by the development of tools for detecting RNA modifications transcriptome wide, researchers have uncovered a diverse epitranscriptome that serves as an additional layer of gene regulation beyond simple RNA sequence. Here, we review the proteins that write, read, and erase these marks, with a particular focus on the most abundant internal modification, N\n6-methyladenosine (m6A). We first describe the discovery of the key enzymes that deposit and remove m6A and other modifications and discuss how our understanding of these proteins has shaped our views of modification dynamics. We then review current models for the function of m6A reader proteins and how our knowledge of these proteins has evolved. Finally, we highlight important future directions for the field and discuss key questions that remain unanswered.", "generated_text": "The epitranscriptome, comprising RNA modifications, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular function. This complex post-transcriptional landscape is shaped by a dynamic interplay between writers, readers, and erasers of RNA modifications. Methyltransferases (writers) introduce modifications such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), while reader proteins recognize and bind to these marks, influencing mRNA stability, translation, and splicing. Conversely, demethylases (erasers) remove these modifications, thereby modulating their effects. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying m6A modification, highlighting its involvement in various biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and disease. Understanding the intricate relationships between writers, readers, and erasers of the epitranscriptome is essential for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes and for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting RNA modifications. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex interplay between these RNA modification machineries and their impact on cellular function.", "label": 1}
