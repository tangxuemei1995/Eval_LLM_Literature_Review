{"grounding": "Formation of the 3\u2032 end of a eukaryotic mRNA is a key step in the production of a mature transcript. This process is mediated by a number of protein factors that cleave the pre-mRNA, add a poly(A) tail, and regulate transcription by protein dephosphorylation. Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) in humans, or cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) in yeast, coordinates these enzymatic activities with each other, with RNA recognition, and with transcription. The site of pre-mRNA cleavage can strongly influence the translation, stability, and localization of the mRNA. Hence, cleavage site selection is highly regulated. The length of the poly(A) tail is also controlled to ensure that every transcript has a similar tail when it is exported from the nucleus. In this review, we summarize new mechanistic insights into mRNA 3\u2032-end processing obtained through structural studies and biochemical reconstitution and outline outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "Eukaryotic mRNA 3\u2032-end processing is a complex and highly regulated process that plays a crucial role in gene expression. The process involves the removal of introns, ligation of exons, and addition of a poly(A) tail, which is mediated by a multi-protein complex known as the polyadenylation machinery. This machinery consists of several endonucleases, including the cleavage factor I (CFI) and the cleavage factor II (CFII), which work in conjunction with the polyadenylation factor (PAP) to generate the poly(A) tail. The regulation of pre-mRNA processing is tightly controlled by a network of transcription factors, splicing factors, and post-transcriptional regulators, which modulate the activity of the polyadenylation machinery. The impact of 3\u2032-end processing on gene expression is significant, as it influences mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and subcellular localization. Dysregulation of pre-mRNA processing has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process.", "label": 1}
