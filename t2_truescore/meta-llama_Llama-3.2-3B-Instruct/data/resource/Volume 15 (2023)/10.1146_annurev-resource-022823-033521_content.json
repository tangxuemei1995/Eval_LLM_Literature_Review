{"grounding": "Based on an extensive literature review and publicly available data, this article provides insights into the differences in prevalence, sociodemographics, contributing factors, socioeconomic consequences, health effects, and public policies related to obesity between developed and developing countries. Most importantly, it explores the relationship between obesity and life expectancy and identifies potential mechanisms through which obesity affects mortality, highlighting the differences between developed and developing countries and by gender. It also examines how the associations between obesity and life expectancy differ at the population level compared with the individual level. The evidence shows a negative association between obesity and longevity, as well as an increased risk of various diseases with the rising rates of obesity. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing countries and by gender. The article also discusses the effectiveness of various policies adopted to address obesity and provides suggestions to address obesity problems and improve health and well-being in these countries.", "generated_text": "This study examines the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy across both developing and developed countries, providing a comprehensive global perspective. A systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature were conducted to assess the relationship between obesity and life expectancy. The results indicate that obesity has a significant impact on life expectancy, with a 1-2 year reduction in life expectancy for each 10 kg/m2 increase in BMI. However, the magnitude of this effect varies significantly across countries, with developing countries experiencing a more pronounced impact due to limited healthcare resources and inadequate nutrition. In contrast, developed countries exhibit a more nuanced relationship, with obesity-related mortality rates decreasing in some populations while increasing in others. These findings highlight the need for tailored public health interventions that address the unique challenges and opportunities in both developing and developed countries. The study's results have important implications for global health policy and practice, emphasizing the importance of addressing obesity as a key determinant of life expectancy.", "label": 1}
