{"grounding": "Food fraud represents a serious threat to the integrity of the global agri-food marketing system and has received considerable attention by policy makers, academics, and the public at large. This review presents the conditions that enable fraudulent activity in agri-food supply chains (such as asymmetric information, imperfect certification processes, supply chain complexity, and weak monitoring and enforcement systems) and discusses recent efforts to document and deter food fraud and the growing theoretical and empirical literature on the economics of food fraud. The article concludes by identifying some gaps in the literature and provides suggestions for future research.", "generated_text": "Food fraud, encompassing adulteration and mislabeling, poses significant threats to consumer trust and public health. Asymmetric information between buyers and sellers creates an environment conducive to fraudulent activities. Credence goods, such as organic and fair-trade products, are particularly vulnerable to mislabeling. Effective deterrence strategies require costly and imperfect enforcement mechanisms, including certification schemes and regular inspections. This review synthesizes existing literature on food fraud, highlighting the need for a multi-faceted approach that balances regulatory efforts with consumer education and market incentives to prevent and detect food adulteration and mislabeling.", "label": 1}
