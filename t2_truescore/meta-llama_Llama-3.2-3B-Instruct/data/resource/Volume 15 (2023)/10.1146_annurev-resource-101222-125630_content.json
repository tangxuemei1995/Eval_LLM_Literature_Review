{"grounding": "This article reviews recent economic studies on the causal effects of temperature on labor productivity. The negative effects of extreme temperatures are widespread, and the magnitudes of the impact differ across social and economic factors. In addition to physical outputs, extreme temperatures also impair mental productivity, including cognition and learning. In utero exposure to extreme temperatures has profound effects on human development. Although the literature has detected various adaptation strategies, the conclusions are mixed. We discuss some limitations of existing studies and propose several directions for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the relationship between temperature and labor productivity, focusing on the distributional effects of early-life exposure to varying temperatures on mental productivity. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that temperature can significantly impact cognitive function, with optimal temperatures ranging between 22-25\u00b0C. However, early-life exposure to extreme temperatures can lead to long-term adaptations, influencing labor productivity. The findings suggest that temperature distributional effects may be a critical factor in understanding the relationship between temperature and labor productivity.", "label": 0}
