{"grounding": "R&D is slow magic. It takes many years before research investments begin to affect productivity, but then they can affect productivity for a long time. Many economists get this wrong. Here, we revisit the conceptual foundations for R&D lag models used to represent the temporal links between research investments and impact, review prevalent practice, and document and discuss a range of evidence on R&D lags in agriculture and other industries. Our theory and evidence consistently support the use of longer lags with a different overall lag profile than is typically imposed in studies of industrial R&D and government compilations of R&D knowledge stocks. Many studies systematically fail to recognize the many years of investment and effort typically required to create a new technology and bring it to market and the subsequent years as the technology is diffused and adopted. Consequential distortions in the measures and economic understanding are implied.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the lag models of Research and Development (R&D) in the agricultural and industrial sectors, focusing on the dynamics of knowledge stocks and flows. By analyzing historical data from 1960 to 2020, we identify significant differences in R&D adoption and technological change between the two sectors. Our results show that the agricultural sector exhibits a slower pace of R&D adoption, characterized by a lag of approximately 10-15 years compared to the industrial sector. This lag is attributed to the sector's unique characteristics, such as limited access to capital, specialized labor, and distinct knowledge stocks. The findings have implications for policymakers and researchers seeking to promote innovation and technological progress in these sectors. By understanding the underlying drivers of R&D lag, we can develop targeted strategies to bridge the gap and foster more inclusive and sustainable growth.", "label": 0}
