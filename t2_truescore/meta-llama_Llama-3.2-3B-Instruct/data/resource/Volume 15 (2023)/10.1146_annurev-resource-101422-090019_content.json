{"grounding": "More than five billion metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually worldwide. Despite having multiple uses and significant potential to augment crop and livestock production, a large share of crop residues is burned, especially in Asian countries. This unsustainable practice causes tremendous air pollution and health hazards while restricting soil nutrient recycling. In this review, we examine the economic rationale for unsustainable residue management. The sustainability of residue utilization is determined by several economic factors, such as local demand for and quantity of residue production, development and dissemination of technologies to absorb excess residue, and market and policy instruments to internalize the social costs of residue burning. The intervention strategy to ensure sustainable residue management depends on public awareness of the private and societal costs of open residue burning.", "generated_text": "This study examines the economics of crop residue management, focusing on the environmental and climate change implications for smallholder farmers. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining econometric analysis with case studies of crop residue burning and technology adoption. The results show that crop residue burning, a common practice in developing countries, has significant environmental costs, including greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. In contrast, adopting technology-based residue management practices, such as mechanical harvesting and anaerobic digestion, can reduce these costs and generate additional income streams for farmers. The study highlights the need for policy interventions that support the adoption of sustainable residue management practices among smallholder farmers, and provides recommendations for future research and policy development.", "label": 1}
