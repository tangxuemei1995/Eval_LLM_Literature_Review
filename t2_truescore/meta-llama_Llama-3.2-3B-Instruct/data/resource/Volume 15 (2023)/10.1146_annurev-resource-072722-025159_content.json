{"grounding": "In 2015, the United Nations and the G20 put food loss and food waste on the global agenda. While progress has been made since then, the scale of the problem persists because food loss and food waste are measured together, not separately. The paucity of data also poses a challenge. This article reviews the measurements, causes, and determinants of food loss as well as the interventions to reduce it. The review finds that food loss is considered in isolation, even though it is one of the causes and results of how agrifood systems function. The review calls for improved microdata collection and standardized measurements to separate food loss from food waste. Such efforts would help integrate feedback loops and cascading effects across the value chain with agrifood systems to identify intervention hot spots, trade-offs, and synergies of interventions as well as the effects of food loss reduction on socioeconomic, environmental, and food security goals.", "generated_text": "Food losses in agrifood systems are a pervasive issue, resulting in significant economic and nutritional burdens. This phenomenon encompasses post-harvest losses, processing and distribution losses, and retail and consumer losses. The determinants of food loss are multifaceted, involving factors such as infrastructure, storage, transportation, and consumer behavior. Understanding the measurement and characterization of food loss is crucial for developing effective interventions. Research has identified various value chain interventions, including improved storage facilities, enhanced logistics, and consumer education programs, as potential solutions to mitigate food loss. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varies across different contexts and value chains. This review synthesizes existing literature on food loss in agrifood systems, highlighting the current state of knowledge on measurement, determinants, and interventions. The findings have implications for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking to address this pressing global issue and ensure food security.", "label": 1}
