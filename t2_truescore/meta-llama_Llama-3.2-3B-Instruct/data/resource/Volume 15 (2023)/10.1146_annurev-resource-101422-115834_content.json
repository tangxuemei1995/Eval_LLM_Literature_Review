{"grounding": "Understanding the potential effect of environmental regulation on employment is of broad interest to key stakeholders. Concerns encompass both short- and longer-term effects on workers within the regulated sector, affected communities that already suffer from a lack of employment opportunities, and net employment in the overall economy. We begin our review by presenting a neoclassical microeconomic framework demonstrating how environmental regulations might affect labor demand. We then summarize the main empirical findings from the literature, including sector-specific partial equilibrium estimates and general equilibrium approaches to identifying the employment impacts of regulations. We also briefly describe the literature on how environmental regulations affect labor supply. Finally, we discuss remaining research gaps.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of environmental regulation on labor demand, drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature. The evidence suggests that environmental regulations can lead to increased labor demand in certain industries, particularly those with high environmental stakes. Conversely, regulations that impose significant costs on firms can result in reduced labor demand. The findings highlight the complex relationship between environmental regulation and labor markets, emphasizing the need for policymakers to consider the potential labor market implications of environmental policies. The study's results have implications for understanding the distributional effects of environmental regulation and informing evidence-based policy decisions.", "label": 1}
