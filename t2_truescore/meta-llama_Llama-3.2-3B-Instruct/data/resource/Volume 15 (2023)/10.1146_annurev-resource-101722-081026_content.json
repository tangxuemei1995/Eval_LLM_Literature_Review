{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the recent economics literature analyzing the effect of air pollution on health outcomes. We review the common approaches to measuring and modeling air pollution exposures and the epidemiological and biological literature on health outcomes that undergird federal air regulations in the United States. The article contrasts the methods used in the epidemiology literature with the causal inference framework used in economics. In particular, we review the common sources of estimation bias in epidemiological approaches that the economics literature has sought to overcome with research designs that take advantage of natural experiments. We review new promising research designs for estimating concentration-response functions and identify areas for further research.", "generated_text": "This study synthesizes advances in causal inference to investigate the complex relationships between air pollution and health outcomes. By leveraging natural experiments and integrated science assessments, we examine the causal effects of particulate matter and ozone on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Our analysis incorporates machine learning algorithms to account for confounding variables and selection bias. The results suggest that exposure to high levels of air pollution is associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations. These findings have significant implications for policy-making and public health interventions aimed at mitigating the health impacts of air pollution.", "label": 0}
