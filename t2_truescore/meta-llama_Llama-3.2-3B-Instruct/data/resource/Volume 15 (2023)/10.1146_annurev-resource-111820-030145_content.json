{"grounding": "Having experienced low prices for about a decade, the European Union Emissions Trading System has been supplemented with the market stability reserve (MSR) that adjusts the supply of allowances to market outcomes. We critically review the literature assessing the performance of the MSR against several policy objectives. In doing so, we cover both conceptual aspects and quantitative assessments. We conclude by pointing out important policy implications and open issues for further research.", "generated_text": "This critical review examines the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), a key stability mechanism designed to mitigate market volatility. The review assesses the MSR's effectiveness in addressing overlapping policies and its implications for climate policy. It discusses the reserve's operation, its impact on emissions trading, and the need for further refinement to ensure the EU ETS remains a robust and effective climate policy tool.", "label": 1}
