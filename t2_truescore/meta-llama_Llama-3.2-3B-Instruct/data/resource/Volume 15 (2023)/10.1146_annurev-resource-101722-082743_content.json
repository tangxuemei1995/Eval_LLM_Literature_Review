{"grounding": "Identifying mechanisms of real-life human decision-making is central to inform effective, human-centric public policy. Here, we report larger trends and synthesize preliminary lessons from behavioral economic and neuro-economic investigations focusing on environmental values. We review the currently available evidence at different levels of granularity, from insights into how individuals value natural resources (individual level), evidence from work on group externalities, common pool resources, and social norms (social group level) to the study of incentives, policies, and their impact (institutional level). At each level, we identify viable directions for future scientific research and actionable items for policy-makers. Coupled with new technological and methodological advances, we suggest that behavioral economic and neuroeconomic insights may inform an effective strategy to optimize environmental resources. We conclude that the time is ripe for action to enrich policies with scientifically grounded insights, making an impact in the interest of current and future generations.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics to understand the underlying mechanisms driving individual decision-making regarding environmental values. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that behavioral economics and neuroeconomics offer valuable insights into the cognitive biases and neural processes influencing human choices related to environmental conservation. The findings suggest that individuals' perceptions of environmental values are shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including personal experiences, social norms, and cognitive heuristics. Neuroimaging studies have shown that environmental decisions are associated with activation in brain regions involved in emotion, motivation, and decision-making. The study highlights the importance of considering these factors in the development of effective policies for managing common pool resources, such as forests and fisheries. By integrating behavioral economics and neuroeconomics, policymakers can design more effective strategies to promote sustainable environmental practices and mitigate the impacts of human activities on the environment.", "label": 1}
