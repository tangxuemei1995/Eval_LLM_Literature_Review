{"grounding": "This review evaluates three micro and three macro estimation approaches to determine whether unrealistic differences exist in estimating the size of nonobserved/shadow economies. While some macro-MIMIC estimates are higher than estimates using the statistical discrepancy approach, when adjusting for double-counting, MIMIC approaches provide similar results. Macro approaches usually cover not only typical shadow economy activities, but also voluntary work, do-it-yourself activities, and classical crime activities; by nature, macro approaches will lead to higher and more accurate estimates than micro approaches. However, if certain adjustments are made, the estimated size of the shadow economy using the MIMIC approach comes close to the size of the shadow economy indicated by micro survey approaches. Hence, claims that macro approaches are unrealistically high and rely on unrealistic assumptions must be reconsidered.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of estimation methods on the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. Using a consumption-income gap approach and micro survey data, we apply three different estimation methods: MIMIC, micro survey approach, and survey technique. Our results indicate that the estimated size of the shadow economy varies significantly across methods, with implausible differences ranging from 10% to 50%. These discrepancies suggest that the choice of estimation method can lead to substantial biases in estimating the size of the shadow economy. Our findings highlight the need for a critical evaluation of estimation methods and the importance of considering the underlying assumptions and data quality when estimating the size of nonobserved economies. The study provides a preliminary answer to the question of whether different estimation methods lead to implausible differences in the size of shadow economies, and it sets the stage for further research on this topic.", "label": 0}
