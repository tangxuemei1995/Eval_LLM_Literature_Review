{"grounding": "Little progress has been made in reducing deaths from chronic noncommunicable diseases associated with being overweight or obese worldwide, prompting the World Health Organization and others to recommend the implementation of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). In response, SSB taxes have been widely implemented over the last decade, and a burgeoning literature aims at understanding their effects. We assess the state of knowledge regarding the impacts of SSB taxes and provide context for the results reported to date based on the recent consumer behavior literature and incentives of supply-chain intermediaries in modern food markets. Evidence suggests only a portion of a tax on distributors or manufacturers is passed forward to consumers, inducing only mild and highly variable impacts on SSB purchases. We argue that the literature provides no consistent evidence that SSB taxes have incentivized increased purchases of healthier beverages and caused overall SSB consumption to decrease. Finally, we consider the efficacy of SSB taxes, alone or in combination with other policies, as part of jurisdictions\u2019 policy goals, including promoting healthier diets, generating revenue, and improving equity.", "generated_text": "The implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes has been a cornerstone of public health policy aimed at reducing the consumption of unhealthy drinks and mitigating the burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases (CNDs) such as obesity. Since their introduction, numerous studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these taxes in achieving policy goals. While some jurisdictions have reported significant declines in sales and consumption of taxed beverages, others have experienced limited or no impact. This review synthesizes evidence from a range of countries and contexts to assess the current state of sugar-sweetened beverage tax policy and its outcomes. We examine the design and implementation of taxes, as well as the resulting changes in consumption patterns and CND prevalence. Our analysis highlights areas for improvement, including the need for more effective tax design, increased transparency, and enhanced monitoring and evaluation. Ultimately, this review aims to inform the development of more effective policies to promote healthier diets and reduce the burden of CNDs.", "label": 1}
