{"grounding": "Traditionally, competition law and practice serve to preserve competition, with a focus on the maximization of consumer welfare. This has been criticized as conflicting with society's overarching goal of achieving greater (environmental) sustainability. Consequently, various jurisdictions have recently reformed their laws and guidance allowing them to account for sustainability benefits in the assessment of cooperation between competitors, with potentially considerable implications for how firms can jointly develop and introduce more sustainable technologies and products. This has opened a new research frontier in the long-standing tradition of marrying the theory of industrial organization with the field of environmental and resource economics. The consideration of sustainability benefits in competition analysis also requires both the transfer and adaptation of measurement techniques. We summarize recent developments and sketch potential research opportunities.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, exploring the role of cooperation and firm green preferences in shaping the competitive landscape. Through a comprehensive analysis of antitrust regulations and sustainability agreements, we investigate how firms engage in cooperative behavior to reduce environmental impacts while maintaining competitive pressures. Our findings suggest that cooperation can lead to more sustainable outcomes, but also raise concerns about potential anticompetitive effects. We discuss the implications of these trade-offs for competition policy and propose a framework for evaluating the sustainability benefits of cooperation in the context of environmental regulations. The results have significant implications for industrial organization theory and policy-making in the context of climate change and sustainable development.", "label": 0}
