{"grounding": "This article reviews the literature on the financial sector impacts of natural disasters and physical climate change risks, covering banking, insurance, stock markets, bond markets, and international financial flows. Most studies have applied statistical approaches to historical data from developed countries to identify these impacts, while some have also used theoretical and computational modeling to assess future risks under climate change scenarios. The findings show that natural disasters and climate change risks generally lower insurer profitability and risk-sharing capacity, bank stability and credit supply, returns and stability of stock and bond markets, foreign direct investment inflows, and international lending. Factors such as income levels, rigorous financial regulations, capital abundance, market diversification, and adaptation strategies mitigate the negative effects. Natural disasters increase remittance inflows and financial assistance to low- and middle-income countries. We recommend future research on forward-looking computational modeling to assess the future financial sector impacts of climate change, while accounting for adaptation actions and their drivers. Future research should also consider hazard correlations and the interactions between financial industries and regions to more comprehensively assess the economic effects of natural disasters in general and for vulnerable countries in particular.", "generated_text": "Climate change poses significant risks to the financial sector, manifesting through increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, which can disrupt financial markets and institutions. This review examines the financial sector impacts of risks associated with climate change, with a focus on natural disasters, banking, insurance, and financial markets. The literature reveals that climate-related disasters can lead to losses in financial assets, damage to infrastructure, and increased costs for insurance companies. The financial sector's vulnerability to climate-related risks is exacerbated by its interconnectedness with other sectors, such as agriculture and energy. The review highlights the need for financial institutions to adopt climate-resilient strategies, including risk management, diversification, and investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Furthermore, policymakers and regulators must develop and implement effective climate risk governance frameworks to ensure the financial sector's resilience in the face of climate-related disruptions. Ultimately, this review underscores the imperative for the financial sector to prioritize climate risk management and mitigation to maintain financial stability and support sustainable development.", "label": 1}
