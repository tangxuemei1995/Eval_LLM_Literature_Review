{"grounding": "Despite progress made toward increasing women's interest and involvement in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), women continue to be underrepresented and experience less equity and inclusion in some STEM fields. In this article, I review the psychological literature relevant to understanding and mitigating women's lower fit and inclusion in STEM. Person-level explanations concerning women's abilities, interests, and self-efficacy are insufficient for explaining these persistent gaps. Rather, women's relatively lower interest in male-dominated STEM careers such as computer science and engineering is likely to be constrained by gender stereotypes. These gender stereotypes erode women's ability to experience self-concept fit, goal fit, and/or social fit. Such effects occur independently of intentional interpersonal biases and discrimination, and yet they create systemic barriers to women's attraction to, integration in, and advancement in STEM. Dismantling these systemic barriers requires a multifaceted approach to changing organizational and educational cultures at the institutional, interpersonal, and individual level.", "generated_text": "This study examines the relationship between gender inclusion and fit in STEM fields, with a focus on the impact of person-environment fit on career satisfaction and job performance. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of STEM professionals. The results indicate that individuals who reported higher levels of gender inclusion in their workplaces experienced greater person-environment fit, leading to improved job satisfaction and performance. Conversely, those who felt excluded or marginalized due to their gender reported lower levels of fit, resulting in decreased job satisfaction and performance. The findings suggest that promoting gender inclusion and addressing stereotypes in STEM fields is crucial for fostering a positive work environment that supports the well-being and success of all employees. The study's implications highlight the need for organizations to prioritize diversity and inclusion initiatives to create a more inclusive and supportive STEM workforce.", "label": 0}
