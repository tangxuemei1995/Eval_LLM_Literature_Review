{"grounding": "Pride is a self-conscious emotion, comprised of two distinct facets known as authentic and hubristic pride, and associated with a cross-culturally recognized nonverbal expression. Authentic pride involves feelings of accomplishment and confidence and promotes prosocial behaviors, whereas hubristic pride involves feelings of arrogance and conceit and promotes antisociality. Each facet of pride, we argue, contributes to a distinct means of attaining social rank: Authentic pride seems to promote prestige\u2014a rank based on earned respect\u2014whereas hubristic pride seems to promote dominance\u2014a rank based on aggression and coercion. Both prestige and dominance are effective routes to power and influence in human groups, so both facets of pride are likely to be functional adaptations. Overall, the reviewed research suggests that pride is likely to be a human universal, critical for social relationships and rank attainment across human societies.", "generated_text": "This study examines the emotional foundation of social rank attainment, focusing on the role of pride in shaping individual and group behavior. Drawing on theories of self-conscious emotion and social identity, we argue that pride serves as a crucial motivator for individuals to strive for social status and prestige. Through a mixed-methods approach combining survey data and experimental designs, we investigate the relationship between pride, social rank, and dominance. Our findings suggest that individuals who experience higher levels of pride are more likely to engage in behaviors that enhance their social status, such as assertiveness and competition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pride can also foster a sense of self-conscious emotion, leading individuals to evaluate themselves in relation to others and strive for dominance. The implications of our study highlight the importance of pride in understanding social rank attainment and its role in shaping human behavior.", "label": 1}
