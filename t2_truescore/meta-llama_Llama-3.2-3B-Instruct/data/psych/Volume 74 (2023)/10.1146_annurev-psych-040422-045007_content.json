{"grounding": "Surveys administered online have several benefits, but they are particularly prone to careless responding, which occurs when respondents fail to read item content or give sufficient attention, resulting in raw data that may not accurately reflect respondents\u2019 true levels of the constructs being measured. Careless responding can lead to various psychometric issues, potentially impacting any area of psychology that uses self-reported surveys and assessments. This review synthesizes the careless responding literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of careless responding and ways to prevent, identify, report, and clean careless responding from data sets. Further, we include recommendations for different levels of screening for careless responses. Finally, we highlight some of the most promising areas for future work on careless responding.", "generated_text": "Careless responding in survey data poses a significant threat to the validity and reliability of survey research findings. This phenomenon encompasses various forms of invalid responding, including insufficient effort, random, and lazy responses. To address this issue, this review synthesizes existing literature on prevention, identification, and best practices for dealing with careless responding in survey data. The findings highlight the importance of survey design, question wording, and respondent engagement strategies in minimizing careless responding. Additionally, techniques for identifying and handling invalid responses, such as data cleaning and weighting methods, are discussed. By adopting these best practices, researchers can enhance the quality and accuracy of their survey data, ultimately informing more informed decision-making and policy development.", "label": 1}
