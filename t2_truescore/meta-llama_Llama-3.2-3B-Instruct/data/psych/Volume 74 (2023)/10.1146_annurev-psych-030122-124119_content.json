{"grounding": "Cancer diagnosis and treatment constitute profoundly stressful experiences involving unique and common challenges that generate uncertainty, fear, and emotional distress. Individuals with cancer must cope with multiple stressors, from the point of diagnosis through surgical and adjuvant treatments and into survivorship, that require substantial psychological and physiological adaptation. This can take a toll on quality of life and well-being and may also promote cellular and molecular changes that can exacerbate physical symptoms and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis, thereby contributing to negative long-term health outcomes. Since modifying responses tostressors might improve psychological and physiological adaptation, quality of life, and clinical health outcomes, several randomized controlled trials have tested interventions that aim to facilitate stress management. We review evidence for the effects of stress management interventions on psychological and physiological adaptation and health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors and summarize emerging research in the field to address unanswered questions.", "generated_text": "Cancer-related stressors pose a significant threat to the psychological and physiological well-being of cancer patients and survivors, compromising optimal health outcomes. This review synthesizes existing literature on stress management interventions aimed at facilitating psychological and physiological adaptation in cancer populations. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and stress management interventions have emerged as effective strategies to mitigate cancer-related stressors and promote resilience. These interventions focus on enhancing coping skills, emotional regulation, and social support, ultimately leading to improved psychological adaptation and physiological resilience. The review highlights the importance of integrating stress management interventions into comprehensive cancer care, with a focus on optimizing health outcomes and enhancing quality of life. By exploring the efficacy of CBT and stress management interventions, this review provides a framework for healthcare providers to develop evidence-based strategies for supporting cancer patients and survivors in navigating the complex landscape of cancer-related stressors.", "label": 1}
