{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires guidance not only by sensations that are available immediately but also by relevant mental contents carried forward through working memory. Therefore, selective-attention functions that modulate the contents of working memory to guide behavior (inside-out) are just as important as those operating on sensory signals to generate internal contents (outside-in). We review the burgeoning literature on selective attention in the inside-out direction and underscore its functional, flexible, and future-focused nature. We discuss in turn the purpose (why), targets (what), sources (when), and mechanisms (how) of selective attention inside working memory, using visual working memory as a model. We show how the study of internal selective attention brings new insights concerning the core cognitive processes of attention and working memory and how considering selective attention and working memory together paves the way for a rich and integrated understanding of how mind serves behavior.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the relationship between working memory and behavior, focusing on the role of selective attention in shaping anticipatory processes. By examining the neural mechanisms underlying vision-action coupling, our research reveals that working memory plays a critical role in modulating selective attention, thereby influencing behavior. We demonstrate that individuals with enhanced working memory capacity exhibit improved anticipation and expectation of visual stimuli, leading to more accurate and efficient action execution. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the neural networks involved in working memory and selective attention interact to facilitate the integration of sensory information and motor responses. These results have implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between cognitive and motor processes, and highlight the importance of working memory in guiding behavior.", "label": 0}
