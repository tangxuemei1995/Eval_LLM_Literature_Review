{"grounding": "Conspiracy theories are abundant in social and political discourse, with serious consequences for individuals, groups, and societies. However, psychological scientists have started paying close attention to them only in the past 20 years. We review the spectacular progress that has since been made and some of the limitations of research so far, and we consider the prospects for further progress. To this end, we take a step back to analyze the defining features that make conspiracy theories different in kind from other beliefs and different in degree from each other. We consider how these features determine the adoption, consequences, and transmission of belief in conspiracy theories, even though their role as causal or moderating variables has seldom been examined. We therefore advocate for a research agenda in the study of conspiracy theories that starts\u2014as is routine in fields such as virology and toxicology\u2014with a robust descriptive analysis of the ontology of the entity at its center.", "generated_text": "Conspiracy theories are complex and multifaceted phenomena that have garnered significant attention in recent years. This definitional approach examines the correlates, consequences, and communication patterns of conspiracy theories. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that conspiracy theories are characterized by a unique blend of cognitive biases, social influences, and emotional appeals. The predictors of conspiracy theory adoption include factors such as cognitive dissonance, social identity theory, and exposure to misinformation. The consequences of conspiracy theories are far-reaching, influencing not only individual attitudes and behaviors but also societal norms and institutions. Effective communication strategies are crucial in mitigating the spread of conspiracy theories, requiring a nuanced understanding of their underlying psychological and social mechanisms. By elucidating the definitional characteristics of conspiracy theories, this research aims to inform the development of targeted interventions and counter-narratives to promote critical thinking and media literacy.", "label": 1}
