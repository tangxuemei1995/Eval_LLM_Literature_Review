{"grounding": "Culture and personality are two central topics in psychology. Individuals are culturally influenced influencers of culture, yet the research linking culture and personality has been limited and fragmentary. We integrate the literatures on culture and personality with recent advances in socioecology and genetics to formulate the Socioecological-Genetic Framework of Culture and Personality. Our framework not only delineates the mutual constitution of culture and personality but also sheds light on (a) the roots of culture and personality, (b) how socioecological changes partly explain temporal trends in culture and personality, and (c) how genes and culture/socioecology interact to influence personality (i.e., nature \u00d7 nurture interactions). By spotlighting the roles of socioecology and genetics, our integrative framework advances the understanding of culture and personality.", "generated_text": "This study integrates socioecological and genetic perspectives to examine the complex interplay between culture and personality. By analyzing trends in cultural values and personality traits across historical periods, we identify the roots of these dynamics in socioecological factors such as environmental pressures, social norms, and technological advancements. Genetic influences on personality are also considered, with a focus on the interaction between genes and environment. Our framework highlights the dynamic interplay between nature and nurture, demonstrating how cultural and genetic factors shape and influence each other. The findings have implications for understanding cultural and personality change, and the nature\u2013nurture debate, shedding light on the complex relationships between culture, personality, and the human experience.", "label": 1}
