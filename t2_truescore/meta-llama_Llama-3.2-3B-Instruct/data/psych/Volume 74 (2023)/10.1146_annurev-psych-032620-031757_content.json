{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the fields of psychosocial and integrative oncology, highlighting common psychological reactions to being diagnosed with and treated for cancer, including distress, anxiety, depression, fear of cancer recurrence and caregiver burden, as well as symptoms of fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance. Patterns of symptomatology across the disease continuum are also discussed. Interventions targeted at treating these symptoms are reviewed, including acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, mind-body therapies, and meaning-based approaches designed for people with advanced stages of disease, including psychedelic therapy. Common methodological issues and shortcomings of the evidence base are summarized with design recommendations, and a discussion of trends in future research including pragmatic research design, digital health interventions, and implementation science completes the article.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes the current state of psychosocial and integrative oncology interventions across the disease trajectory, from diagnosis to end-of-life care. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, and mindfulness-based mind-body therapies have been shown to alleviate anxiety, depression, and distress in cancer patients. Emerging mind-body therapies, including psychedelic-assisted interventions, demonstrate promise in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Integrative oncology approaches, combining conventional treatments with complementary therapies, have been found to enhance patient well-being and survival outcomes. The review highlights the need for further research on the efficacy and optimal integration of these interventions, as well as their potential to address the complex psychosocial needs of cancer patients and their families.", "label": 1}
