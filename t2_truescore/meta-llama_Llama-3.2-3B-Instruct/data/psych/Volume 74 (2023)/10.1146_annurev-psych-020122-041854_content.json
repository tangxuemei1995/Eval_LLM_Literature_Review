{"grounding": "Exposure to adversity (e.g., poverty, bereavement) is a robust predictor of disruptions in psychological functioning. However, people vary greatly in their responses to adversity; some experience severe long-term disruptions, others experience minimal disruptions or even improvements. We refer to the latter outcomes\u2014faring better than expected given adversity\u2014as psychological resilience. Understanding what processes explain resilience has critical theoretical and practical implications. Yet, psychology's understanding of resilience is incomplete, for two reasons: (a) We lack conceptual clarity, and (b) two major approaches to resilience\u2014the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach\u2014have limitations and are relatively isolated from one another. To address these two obstacles,we first discuss conceptual questions about resilience. Next, we offer an integrative affect-regulation framework that capitalizes on complementary strengths of both approaches. This framework advances our understanding of resilience by integrating existing findings, highlighting gaps in knowledge, and guiding future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the role of affect-regulation in psychological resilience, particularly in the context of adversity and stress. Affect-regulation refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one's emotions, which is a critical component of psychological resilience. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research investigates the relationship between affect-regulation and resilience in individuals facing adversity. The results show that individuals with high affect-regulation skills exhibit better resilience outcomes, including reduced stress and improved psychological health. The findings suggest that affect-regulation is a key mediator between adversity and resilience, highlighting the importance of emotional awareness and management in promoting psychological well-being. The study contributes to the understanding of the affect-regulation framework as a crucial component of psychological resilience, with implications for the development of interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in individuals facing adversity.", "label": 1}
