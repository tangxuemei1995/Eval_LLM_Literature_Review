{"grounding": "Color is a pervasive feature of our psychological experience, having a role in many aspects of human mind and behavior such as basic vision, scene perception, object recognition, aesthetics, and communication. Understanding how humans encode, perceive, talk about, and use color has been a major interdisciplinary effort. Here, we present the current state of knowledge on how color perception and cognition develop. We cover the development of various aspects of the psychological experience of color, ranging from low-level color vision to perceptual mechanisms such as color constancy to phenomena such as color naming and color preference. We also identify neurodiversity in the development of color perception and cognition and implications for clinical and educational contexts. We discuss the theoretical implications of the research for understanding mature color perception and cognition, for identifying the principles of perceptual and cognitive development, and for fostering a broader debate in the psychological sciences.", "generated_text": "The development of color perception and cognition is a complex and multifaceted process that spans from infancy to adulthood. Research has shown that infants as young as a few months old can distinguish between different colors, with color vision maturing significantly by 6-12 months of age. As children progress through childhood, their color perception and cognitive abilities continue to evolve, with studies demonstrating improved color recognition and identification skills. This abstract reviews the current literature on the development of color perception and cognition in infancy and childhood, highlighting key findings and theoretical perspectives. The findings suggest that color perception is closely tied to cognitive development, with color recognition playing a critical role in learning and memory. Understanding the developmental trajectory of color perception and cognition has important implications for education and visual development interventions.", "label": 1}
