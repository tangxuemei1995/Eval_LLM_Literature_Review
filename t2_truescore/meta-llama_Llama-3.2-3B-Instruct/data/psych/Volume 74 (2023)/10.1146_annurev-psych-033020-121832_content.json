{"grounding": "This review focuses on conceptual and empirical research on determinants of social cognitive aging. We present an integrated model [the social cognitive resource (SCoRe) framework] to organize the literature and describe how social cognitive resilience is determined jointly by capacity and motivational resources. We discuss how neurobiological aging, driven by genetic and environmental influences, is associated with broader sensory, neural, and physiological changes that are direct determinants of capacity as well as indirect determinants of motivation via their influence on expectation of loss versus reward and cognitive effort valuation. Research is reviewed that shows how contextual factors, such as relationship status, familiarity, and practice, are fundamental to understanding the availability of both types of resource. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of social cognitive change in late adulthood for everyday social functioning and with recommendations for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the determinants of social cognitive aging, focusing on the interplay between social resources, contextual factors, motivation, cognitive effort, and ecological validity. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of older adults (n = 200). Results indicate that social resources, such as strong social connections and supportive networks, are positively associated with resilience and negatively with risk of cognitive decline. Contextual factors, including socioeconomic status and access to healthcare, also emerged as significant predictors. Motivation and cognitive effort were found to moderate the relationship between social resources and cognitive aging outcomes. Finally, ecological validity was assessed through the use of real-world scenarios, highlighting the importance of generalizing findings to diverse populations. The study contributes to our understanding of the complex factors influencing social cognitive aging and provides practical implications for promoting healthy aging and mitigating cognitive decline.", "label": 0}
