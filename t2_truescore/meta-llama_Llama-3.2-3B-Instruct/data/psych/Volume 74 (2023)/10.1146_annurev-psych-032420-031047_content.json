{"grounding": "Self-compassion refers to being supportive toward oneself when experiencing suffering or pain\u2014be it caused by personal mistakes and inadequacies or external life challenges. This review presents my theoretical model of self-compassion as comprised of six different elements: increased self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness as well as reduced self-judgment, isolation, and overidentification. It discusses the methodology of self-compassion research and reviews the increasingly large number of empirical studies that indicate self-compassion is a productive way of approaching distressing thoughts and emotions that engenders mental and physical well-being. It also reviews research that dispels common myths about self-compassion (e.g., that it is weak, selfish, self-indulgent or undermines motivation). Interventions designed to increase self-compassion, such as compassion-focused therapy and mindful self-compassion, are discussed. Finally, the review considers problematic issues in the field, such as the differential effects fallacy, and considers limitations and future research directions in the field of self-compassion research.", "generated_text": "Self-compassion is a multifaceted construct that encompasses the ability to acknowledge and accept oneself with kindness, understanding, and acceptance in the face of adversity. This concept has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance psychological well-being and resilience. Theoretical frameworks, such as the self-compassion model, provide a foundation for understanding the complex relationships between self-compassion, mindfulness, and emotional regulation. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated the positive correlations between self-compassion and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression. Interventional studies have also shown that self-compassion-based programs can be effective in promoting resilience and enhancing overall well-being. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of self-compassion research, highlighting key findings, theoretical perspectives, and practical applications. By synthesizing existing literature, this review seeks to contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions aimed at promoting self-compassion and improving mental health outcomes.", "label": 1}
