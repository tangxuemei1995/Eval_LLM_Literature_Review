{"grounding": "Self-continuity is the subjective sense of connection between one's past and present selves (past\u2013present self-continuity), between one's present and future selves (present\u2013future self-continuity), or among one's past, present, and future selves (global self-continuity). We consider the motivational character of the three forms of self-continuity, their regulatory properties, and the internal or external factors that consolidate them. We also review their consequences for attitudes and judgments or decisions, motivation, intentions and behavior, and psychological and physical health. We further detail the psychological and behavioral benefits of self-discontinuity (i.e., a sense of disconnect among temporal selves). We next turn to the brain regions that are activated synchronously with self-continuity. We consider developmental perspectives on self-continuity, discuss collective self-continuity (along with its consequences and regulatory properties), and elaborate on cultural differences in self-continuity. This inaugural Annual Reviews chapter demonstrates the breadth, excitement, and sense of synergy among self-continuity researchers and points to promising research directions.", "generated_text": "This study examines the concept of self-continuity, a fundamental aspect of psychological health, and its relationship with attitudes, behavior, and cultural influences. Drawing on theories of collective self and social identity, the research investigates how individuals perceive and maintain a sense of continuity with their past selves, present identities, and future selves. A mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and content analysis was employed to collect data from a diverse sample of participants. The findings suggest that self-continuity is positively correlated with positive attitudes towards oneself and one's life, as well as adaptive behavior. Cultural factors, such as collectivist versus individualist orientations, were found to shape self-continuity experiences. The study's results have implications for our understanding of psychological health, self-concept, and the role of culture in shaping individual experiences of self-continuity. The findings also highlight the importance of promoting self-continuity as a means of fostering psychological well-being and resilience.", "label": 1}
