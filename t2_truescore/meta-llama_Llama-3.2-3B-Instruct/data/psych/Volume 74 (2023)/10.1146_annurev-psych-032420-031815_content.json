{"grounding": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) research investigates changes in the evaluation of a stimulus after co-occurrence with an affective stimulus. To explain the motivation behind this research, this review begins with an overview of the history of EC research, followed by a summary of the state of the art with respect to three key questions. First, how should EC procedures be used to influence evaluation? We provide a guide based on evidence concerning the functional properties of EC effects. Second, how does the EC effect occur? We discuss the possible mediating cognitive processes and their automaticity. Third, are EC effects ubiquitous outside the lab? We discuss the evidence for the external validity of EC research. We conclude that the most important open questions pertain to the relevance of EC to everyday life and to the level of control that characterizes the processes that mediate the EC effect after people notice the stimulus co-occurrence.", "generated_text": "Evaluative conditioning is a fundamental concept in social psychology that refers to the process by which individuals form attitudes and make associations between stimuli and propositions. This phenomenon has been extensively studied in the past, with early research by Miller and Ross (1975) demonstrating the role of evaluative conditioning in attitude formation. More recent studies have expanded our understanding of evaluative conditioning, highlighting its relationship with external validity and the importance of considering contextual factors. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the past, present, and future of evaluative conditioning research, examining key findings, methodological limitations, and future directions. By synthesizing existing literature, this review seeks to advance our understanding of evaluative conditioning and its implications for attitude formation and behavior. The findings of this review have significant implications for fields such as marketing, education, and public health, highlighting the need for further research on the external validity of evaluative conditioning.", "label": 0}
