{"grounding": "Innovation, and the creative thinking that provides the basis for innovation, is of great value for organizations. In this article we describe what is needed for people to think creatively, noting that creative thinking is a complex, albeit voluntary, activity involving performance on certain types of problems. The ways leaders influence peoples\u2019 willingness to engage in, and ability to solve, creative problems are then described. Leaders of creative efforts must not only motivate creative work but also actively contribute to creative problem-solving both by engaging followers in creative problem-solving and by establishing the conditions that allow creative problem-solving at the individual, team, and firm levels. The implications of these observations for leader assessment and leader development are discussed.\n", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of leader thinking styles on follower creative performance. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. The results show that leaders with a more open and flexible thinking style foster a more innovative work environment, leading to increased follower creative performance. Conversely, leaders with a more rigid and closed thinking style hinder follower creativity. The findings suggest that leader development programs should focus on cultivating leader thinking skills, such as openness to new ideas and adaptability, to enhance follower creative performance. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of leadership development and organizational innovation.", "label": 0}
