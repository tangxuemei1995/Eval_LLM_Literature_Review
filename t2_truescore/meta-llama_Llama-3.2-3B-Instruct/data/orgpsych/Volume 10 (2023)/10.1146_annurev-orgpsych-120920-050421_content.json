{"grounding": "Environmental sustainability has become an ethical and strategic imperative for organizations, and more and more employees are interested, encouraged, or instructed to act in environmentally sustainable ways. Consequently, organizational scholars have increasingly studied individual-level antecedents of employee pro-environmental or employee green behavior (EGB). We argue that, to advance this literature and to inform effective interventions, research should investigate how EGB, as a compound performance domain, is associated with antecedents and consequences at multiple levels (i.e., individual, team, work context, organization, society). Accordingly, we pursue three interrelated goals with this review. We first present a comprehensive review of research on EGB, including definitions, theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. Second, we develop an integrative conceptual model of EGB as the core of organizational environmental sustainability. Third, we conclude with recommendations for future theory development and methodological improvements, as well as practical implications for employees, leaders, and human resource management.", "generated_text": "This study examines the role of employee green behavior as a core component of environmentally sustainable organizations. Drawing on ecological behavior theory and environmental psychology, the research investigates the relationships between employee pro-environmental behavior, organizational environmental sustainability, and employee well-being. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 200 employees in environmentally conscious organizations. The results indicate a positive correlation between employee green behavior and organizational environmental sustainability, as well as a significant positive impact on employee well-being. Furthermore, thematic analysis revealed that employees' pro-environmental behavior is influenced by organizational leadership, communication, and culture. The findings suggest that employee green behavior is a critical factor in promoting environmental sustainability and organizational well-being. The study contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between employee behavior, organizational sustainability, and employee outcomes, highlighting the importance of fostering a culture of environmental responsibility within organizations.", "label": 1}
