{"grounding": "Some assert that noise (i.e., unwanted variance) is the most neglected yet most important source of error in judgment. We suggest that this problem was discovered nearly 100 years ago in the area of personnel selection and that a century of selection research has shown that noise can be demonstrably reduced by structuring the process (i.e., decomposing the component parts, agreeing on standards, and applying those standards consistently) and by aggregating judgments independently. Algorithms can aid significantly in this process but are often confused with methods that, in their current form, can substantially increase noise in judgment (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning).", "generated_text": "This study synthesizes a century of research on personnel selection, highlighting the pervasive impact of noise on workplace judgments. By examining the effects of unwanted variance on forecasting and strategic decision making, we identify key lessons for mitigating noise in selection processes. Our analysis reveals that noise can be reduced through the implementation of noise-reducing strategies, such as data preprocessing and model validation. By applying these strategies, organizations can improve the accuracy of their judgments and enhance overall performance. The findings of this study contribute to the development of evidence-based best practices for reducing noise in personnel selection.", "label": 0}
