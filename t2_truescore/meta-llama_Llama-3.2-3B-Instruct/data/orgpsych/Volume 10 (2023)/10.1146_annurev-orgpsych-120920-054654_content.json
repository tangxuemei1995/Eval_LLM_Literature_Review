{"grounding": "Over the past decade, hundreds of studies have been published on employee voice and silence. In this review, I summarize that body of work, with an emphasis on the progress that has been made in our understanding of when and why employees choose to speak up or remain silent, as well as the individual and organizational implications of these choices. I identify underexplored issues, limitations in how voice has been conceptualized and studied, and promising avenues for future research. Although there has been notable progress in our knowledge of voice and silence, numerous key questions remain, and there are opportunities for the literature on voice to adopt a broader view of that construct. One of the objectives of this review is to motivate and guide research that will address those questions and explore that broader view.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a retrospective analysis of the concept of employee voice and silence, a decade after its inception. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that employee voice refers to the proactive behavior of employees in sharing information and influencing organizational decisions, while employee silence is characterized by the absence of such engagement. The findings suggest that employee voice is positively correlated with organizational performance, job satisfaction, and employee well-being. Conversely, employee silence is linked to decreased job satisfaction, increased turnover intentions, and reduced organizational performance. The study highlights the importance of creating a culture that encourages open communication, active listening, and employee empowerment to foster a more proactive and engaged workforce. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of organizational development and human resource management.", "label": 1}
