{"grounding": "There is no situation where leadership is more important than during a crisis, and yet crisis leadership is a relatively underdeveloped field. This article explores what we know and what remains unknown about crisis leadership. We begin with an overview of what crises are, including different types and key dynamics of crises. We then review four leadership theories that offer insights into crisis leadership before elucidating five key competencies for crisis leadership. Three distinct avenues for future research are proposed, including exploring the distinctions and intersections of crisis leadership and crisis management, the cross-national and intercultural implications for leading through crises, and the role of ethics in leading well through crisis. Crises are increasingly frequent and complex, warranting a concerted effort to research, teach, and develop good crisis leadership.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complexities of crisis leadership, a critical aspect of organizational resilience in the face of adversity. Drawing on crisis dynamics and leadership competencies, the research explores the interplay between situational factors, leader characteristics, and team dynamics in crisis situations. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative data from case studies and surveys. The findings highlight the importance of situational awareness, effective communication, and adaptability in crisis leadership. Furthermore, the study identifies key competencies, including emotional intelligence, decision-making, and collaboration, as essential for effective crisis leadership. The implications of the research are discussed in terms of best practices for crisis leadership and the development of leadership competencies in crisis situations.", "label": 1}
