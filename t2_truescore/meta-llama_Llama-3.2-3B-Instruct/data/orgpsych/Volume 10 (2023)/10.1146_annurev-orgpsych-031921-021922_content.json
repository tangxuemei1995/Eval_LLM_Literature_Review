{"grounding": "Meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for integrating findings from the research literature and building statistical models to explore trends and inconsistencies in the research base. Meta-analysis starts with a process for translating results from each study into an effect size that represents all findings in a common metric. Statistical models are then applied to estimate the mean, variance, and moderators of effect size. This article explores several key decision points in conducting a meta-analysis, including issues in obtaining a common metric, accounting for psychometric artifacts, and choosing an appropriate statistical model. It provides recommendations for choosing among alternate approaches and reporting results to ensure transparency.", "generated_text": "This guide provides an overview of meta-analysis in organizational research, highlighting methodological options for validity generalization and effect size estimation. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that psychometric artifacts can significantly impact meta-analysis outcomes, emphasizing the need for rigorous study design and measurement development. The guide discusses various meta-analysis approaches, including fixed-effects and random-effects models, and addresses the importance of addressing heterogeneity and publication bias. By providing a structured framework for researchers, this guide aims to enhance the validity and generalizability of organizational research findings, ultimately informing evidence-based decision-making in the workplace.", "label": 0}
