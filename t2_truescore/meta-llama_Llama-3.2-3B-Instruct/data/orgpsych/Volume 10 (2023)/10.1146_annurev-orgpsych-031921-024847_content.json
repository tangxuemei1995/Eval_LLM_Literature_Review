{"grounding": "Emerging from distinct perspectives, decent work and meaningful work are fundamental aspects of contemporary work with profound implications for individuals, organizations, and society. Decent work reflects basic workplace conditions to which all employees are entitled, whereas meaningful work is aspirational, reflecting significance at work. Following a conceptual and empirical review of scholarship on decent work and meaningful work, we draw from psychology of working theory to connect the two constructs. We argue that need satisfaction serves as the primary connector, and societal context, organizational conditions, and individual practices (in order of effectiveness) promote access to each type of work. We suggest future research directions broadening the available scholarship and methods used, promoting a focus on the complex intersection of macrolevel and psychological factors as well as interdisciplinary approaches in determining the quality of work, and engaging in intervention research to improve the way in which people live and work together.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concepts of decent work and meaningful work, examining their interplay and implications for employee well-being and organizational success. Drawing on psychological theories of motivation, job design, and work conditions, the research investigates how work characteristics influence an individual's sense of meaning and fulfillment. A mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and case studies is employed to gather data from a diverse sample of employees. The findings suggest that decent work, characterized by fair compensation, safe working conditions, and social recognition, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for meaningful work. Meaningful work, in turn, is contingent upon job design that aligns with an individual's values, skills, and interests. The study highlights the importance of considering the interplay between work conditions, job characteristics, and individual psychological needs in promoting decent and meaningful work. The implications for organizational practice and policy are discussed, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced understanding of work and its impact on human well-being.", "label": 1}
