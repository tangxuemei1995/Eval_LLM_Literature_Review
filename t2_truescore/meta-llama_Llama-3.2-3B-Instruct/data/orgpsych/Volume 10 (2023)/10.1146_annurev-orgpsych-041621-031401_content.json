{"grounding": "The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) has grown substantially over the past 40 years within organizational research and beyond. There have been many different developments in SEM that make it increasingly useful for a variety of data types, research designs, research questions, and research contexts in the organizational sciences. To give researchers a better understanding of how and why SEM is used, our article (a) presents a review of SEM applications within organizational research; (b) discusses SEM best practices; and (c) explores advanced SEM applications, including instrumental variable methods, latent variable interactions and nonlinear measurement models, multilevel SEM, cross-lagged panel models and dynamic structural equation models, and meta-analytic SEM. We conclude by discussing concerns and debates that are both methodological (i.e., cross-validation and regularization) and theoretical (i.e., understanding causal evidence) as they relate to SEM and its application in organizational research and beyond.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of structural equation modeling (SEM) in organizational research, highlighting its applications, limitations, and future directions. A review of the literature reveals that SEM has become a dominant method for testing complex relationships and latent variable models in organizational studies. However, the model fit indices often used in SEM research are criticized for their lack of robustness and reliability. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of latent interactions and the need for more nuanced understanding of organizational phenomena necessitate the development of new SEM approaches. This paper proposes several avenues for advancing the field, including the integration of machine learning techniques, the development of more sophisticated model fit indices, and the exploration of SEM's potential for capturing dynamic and nonlinear relationships in organizational contexts. By addressing these challenges, SEM can continue to evolve as a powerful tool for organizational research.", "label": 1}
