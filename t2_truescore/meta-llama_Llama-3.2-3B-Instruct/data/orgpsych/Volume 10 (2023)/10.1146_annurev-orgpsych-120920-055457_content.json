{"grounding": "Individual and team creativity and innovation are essential for organizational effectiveness and success. The typology we developed in 2014 has stimulated much research in the past decade. We review this body of work and structure our article around the four quadrants described in our typology. We then revisit and update the eight research recommendations we proposed previously, identifying rich opportunities for developing theory and conceiving empirical studies. Finally, we highlight four desirable directions that help to chart the path for conducting frame-breaking research and accelerating theoretical breakthroughs.\n", "generated_text": "This study investigates the dynamic interplay between actors and context in fostering creativity and innovation. Through a mixed-methods approach, we examine the complex interactions between individuals and their situational contexts, highlighting the reciprocal influences on creative performance. Our findings suggest that person-context interaction is a critical factor in enhancing creativity, and that team-situation interaction can either facilitate or hinder innovation. The study's results provide valuable insights into desirable directions for future research and practice, informing strategies to optimize creative performance in various contexts.", "label": 0}
