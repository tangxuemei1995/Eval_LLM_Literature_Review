{"grounding": "Technology has changed the way that organizational researchers obtain participants for their research studies. Although technology has facilitated the collection of large quantities of data through online platforms, it has also highlighted potential data quality issues for many of our samples. In this article, we review different sampling techniques, including convenience, purposive, probability-based, and snowball sampling. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each approach to help organizational researchers choose the most appropriate sampling techniques for their research questions. We identify best practices that researchers can use to improve the quality of their samples, including reviewing screening techniques to increase the quality of online sampling. Finally, as part of our review we examined the sampling procedures of all empirical research articles published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in the past 5 years, and we use observations from these results to make conclusions about the lack of methodological and sample diversity in organizational research, the overreliance on a few sampling techniques, the need to report key aspects of sampling, and concerns about participant quality.", "generated_text": "Organizational research relies heavily on the quality and appropriateness of samples to ensure the validity and reliability of findings. However, sampling methods often fall short, leading to biased and unrepresentative results. This study examines the current state of sampling in organizational research, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods and the consequences of insufficient effort responding and participant dishonesty. A review of existing literature reveals that online samples are particularly susceptible to these issues, with low response rates and high levels of non-response. To address these concerns, this study investigates the effectiveness of innovative sampling techniques, including stratified sampling and snowball sampling, in improving data quality. The results suggest that these methods can significantly increase response rates and reduce non-response, leading to more accurate and reliable findings. The implications of these findings are discussed, highlighting the need for researchers to adopt more rigorous sampling methods to ensure the validity of their results.", "label": 1}
