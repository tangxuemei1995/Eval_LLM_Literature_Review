{"grounding": "Burnout refers to a work-related state of exhaustion and a sense of cynicism. In contrast, work engagement is a positive motivational state of vigor, dedication, and absorption. In this article, we discuss the concepts of burnout and work engagement and review their antecedents and consequences. We look back at our inaugural Annual Reviews article (Bakker et al. 2014) and highlight new empirical findings and theoretical innovations in relationship to job demands\u2013resources (JD-R) theory. We discuss four major innovations of the past decade, namely (a) the person \u00d7 situation approach of JD-R, (b) multilevel JD-R theory, (c) new proactive approaches in JD-R theory, and (d) the work\u2013home resources model. After discussing practical implications, we elaborate on more opportunities for future research, including JD-R interventions, team-level approaches, and demands and resources from other life domains.", "generated_text": "This article provides a decade-long review of the job demands-resources (JD-R) theory, a widely accepted framework for understanding the relationship between job demands and employee outcomes. Since its inception, the JD-R theory has been extensively tested and validated across various occupational settings, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. The theory posits that job demands, such as workload and time pressure, can be mitigated by the availability of resources, including social support, autonomy, and skill utilization. Research has consistently shown that employees who experience high job demands and low resources are at risk of burnout, while those with balanced job demands and resources exhibit high levels of work engagement. The article highlights the key findings and implications of the JD-R theory, including its relevance to job design and proactive work behavior, and discusses future research directions for advancing our understanding of this critical theory.", "label": 1}
