{"grounding": "We review the research on the psychology of entrepreneurship of the last decade. We focus on two key topics in entrepreneurship research: action and process. Combining action and process in a model of the psychology of entrepreneurship, we present the action theory process model of entrepreneurship and use it as a guiding framework for the review. We discuss theories of action, such as effectuation/causation, bricolage, theory of planned behavior, and action theory. Furthermore, we adopt a process perspective to discuss antecedents of actions in terms of cognition, motivation, and emotion and how they develop during the entrepreneurial process. The process perspective considers recursive relationships and dynamic changes in actions and their antecedents over time. We conclude that the action theory process model is a useful starting point to explain the psychological dynamics of entrepreneurship.", "generated_text": "This study explores the psychological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, focusing on the interplay between action and process. Drawing on action theory and bricolage, we examine how entrepreneurs' cognitive processes, motivational states, and emotional experiences influence their entrepreneurial endeavors. Specifically, we investigate the role of effectuation, a concept that highlights the importance of intuition and adaptability in entrepreneurial decision-making. Our analysis reveals that entrepreneurs who employ a more effectual approach tend to exhibit higher levels of motivation and emotional engagement, leading to more successful business outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of the entrepreneurial mindset and the development of effective entrepreneurial interventions. The results of this study contribute to the growing body of research on the psychology of entrepreneurship, highlighting the complex interplay between cognition, emotion, and motivation in entrepreneurial action.", "label": 1}
