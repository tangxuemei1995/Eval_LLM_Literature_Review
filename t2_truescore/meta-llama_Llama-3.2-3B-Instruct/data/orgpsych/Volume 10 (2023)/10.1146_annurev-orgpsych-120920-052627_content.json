{"grounding": "It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the workplace impact of race from the organizational psychology and organizational behavior literature. Topical coverage is spotty and the findings are fragmented, with little existing theory to orient, integrate, and reconcile them. Consequently, it is unsurprising that public opinion is highly divergent about the influence of race at work, and practitioners are left largely unassisted in determining evidence-based approaches to leveraging this form of difference among their personnel. To fill this void, we review the relevant findings through the lens of organizational justice to help clarify the impact of race on organizational experiences. Our findings suggest that justice indeed varies as a function of race, the magnitude of differences depends on the type of justice, and there are several potentially fruitful areas for additional inquiry.", "generated_text": "This review examines the intersection of organizational justice and racioethnic differences in the workplace, challenging the notion of colorblindness in the pursuit of fairness and equality. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that racioethnic differences persist in organizational justice, manifesting as disparate treatment, unequal opportunities, and biased decision-making. The review highlights the role of implicit bias, microaggressions, and systemic racism in perpetuating these disparities. Furthermore, it discusses the impact of organizational justice on racioethnic differences, including the effects of perceived fairness, trust, and commitment on employee outcomes. The findings of this review underscore the need for organizations to acknowledge and address racioethnic differences in organizational justice, promoting a more inclusive and equitable work environment. By doing so, organizations can foster a culture of fairness, respect, and belonging for all employees.", "label": 0}
