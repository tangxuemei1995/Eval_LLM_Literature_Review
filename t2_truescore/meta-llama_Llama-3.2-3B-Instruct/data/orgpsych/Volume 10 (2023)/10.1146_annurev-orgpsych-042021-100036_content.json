{"grounding": "This article describes my journey as an organizational behavior scholar, including reflections on the state of the field of organizational scholarship. I organize the article into two main sections. First, I provide my autobiographical review, beginning with my early years and ending with the five universities where I have been employed in my career. Second, I provide a set of observations about the state of the organizational sciences, focusing specifically on the two areas of my most significant focus\u2014personality and leadership\u2014as well as offering some general observations about the field. The organizational sciences have seen many positive advances: Research is more rigorous theoretically and methodologically, and more concern is devoted to replication and research ethics. However, partly owing to prioritizing these advancements over other concerns, new problems have developed, and other long-standing concerns have been exacerbated. I discuss my own changing perspectives on these issues and present some thoughts on how they might be addressed.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical study explores the evolution of perspective and perspectives on change throughout a career, drawing on insights from organizational behavior, personality, and leadership research.

The findings highlight the dynamic interplay between individual personality traits, leadership styles, and organizational context in shaping perspectives on change. The study contributes to our understanding of the complex relationships between personal and organizational factors in facilitating or hindering change, and offers implications for leadership development and organizational transformation initiatives.
