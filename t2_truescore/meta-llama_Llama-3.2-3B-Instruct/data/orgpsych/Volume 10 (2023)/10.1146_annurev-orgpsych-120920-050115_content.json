{"grounding": "The growth in virtual work is reshaping how leaders interface with their followers: Face-to-face interactions are increasingly being supplanted by virtual exchanges. To advance understanding of the implications of leading in this changing environment, we apply functional leadership theory to synthesize the findings of the virtual leadership research that has been conducted across different leadership perspectives and levels of analysis. We identify four traditional leadership functions that empirical research suggests have a stronger effect on follower need satisfaction in virtual settings and highlight a new function\u2014facilitate the use of technology\u2014as particularly germane to virtual leadership. Our review reveals several promising future research directions, including the need to examine the effects of leadership along the full spectrum of virtuality and to consider the unique challenges that leaders may encounter in hybrid work environments. We also outline important practical implications for organizations, leaders, and their followers.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of leadership in virtual and hybrid work environments, where traditional hierarchical structures are disrupted by the proliferation of remote work. Through a dyadic lens, examining the interactions between leaders and their team members, we investigate the dynamics of effective leadership in these contexts. Our research reveals that leaders who adopt a more flexible and adaptable approach to communication, fostering a sense of trust and autonomy among team members, are better equipped to navigate the challenges of virtual and hybrid work. The findings suggest that leaders who prioritize emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-awareness are more effective in leading high-performing teams in these environments. The study contributes to our understanding of leadership in the digital age, highlighting the importance of dyadic relationships and the need for leaders to adapt their leadership styles to the unique demands of virtual and hybrid work.", "label": 1}
