{"grounding": "It is difficult to fathom how an organization could be successful without its employees engaging in self-reflection. Gone would be its personnel's capacity to problem-solve, learn from past experiences, and engage in countless other introspective activities that are vital to success. Indeed, a large body of research highlights the positive value of reflection. Yet, as both common experience and a wealth of findings demonstrate, engaging in this introspective process while focusing on negative experiences often backfires, undermining people's health, well-being, performance, and relationships. Here we synthesize research on the benefits and costs of self-reflection in organizational contexts and discuss the role that psychological distance plays in allowing people to harness the potential of self-reflection while avoiding its common pitfalls.", "generated_text": "Self-reflection at work is a crucial practice that enables individuals to examine their thoughts, emotions, and actions, leading to enhanced emotional regulation, improved leadership skills, and increased job satisfaction. By engaging in regular self-reflection, employees can identify areas for personal and professional growth, develop a greater sense of self-awareness, and cultivate a more positive and adaptive mindset. However, excessive rumination and distancing from one's emotions can hinder the benefits of self-reflection, leading to decreased motivation and well-being. This study explores the importance of self-reflection in the workplace, highlighting strategies for harnessing its potential while avoiding its pitfalls, and providing guidance for leaders and individuals seeking to integrate self-reflection into their daily practice.", "label": 1}
