{"grounding": "Plants and herbivores are remarkably variable in space and time, and variability has been considered a defining feature of their interactions. Empirical research, however, has traditionally focused on understanding differences in means and overlooked the theoretically significant ecological and evolutionary roles of variability itself. We review the literature with the goal of showing how variability-explicit research expands our perspective on plant\u2013herbivore ecology and evolution. We first clarify terminology for describing variation and then review patterns, causes, and consequences of variation in herbivory across scales of space, time, and biological organization. We consider how incorporating variability improves existing hypotheses and leads to new ones. We conclude by suggesting future work that reports full distributions, integrates effects of variation across scales, describes nonlinearities, and considers how stochastic and deterministic variation combine to determine herbivory distributions.", "generated_text": "Plant-herbivore interactions are a fundamental component of ecological systems, influencing plant fitness, community composition, and ecosystem function. This variability in interactions is shaped by the complex interplay between plant defense strategies and herbivore feeding behaviors. Research has shown that plant species exhibit diverse defense mechanisms, including chemical, physical, and behavioral responses, to deter herbivore attacks. Herbivores, in turn, have evolved various adaptations to overcome these defenses, leading to a dynamic and context-dependent co-evolutionary process. This variability in plant-herbivore interactions is influenced by factors such as species identity, environmental conditions, and ecological context, resulting in a rich and complex web of interactions that underpin ecosystem functioning. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change and informing conservation and management strategies.", "label": 0}
