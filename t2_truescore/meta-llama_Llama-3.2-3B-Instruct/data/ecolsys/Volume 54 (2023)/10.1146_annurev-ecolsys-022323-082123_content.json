{"grounding": "Greenhouse gas emissions are warming the ocean with profound consequences at all levels of organization, from organismal rates to ecosystem processes. The proximate driver is an interplay between anthropogenic warming (the trend) and natural fluctuations in local temperature. These two properties cause anomalously warm events such as marine heatwaves to occur with increasing frequency and magnitude. Because warming and variance are not uniform, there is a large degree of geographic variation in temporal temperature variability. We review the underappreciated interaction between trend and variance in the ocean and how it modulates ecological responses to ocean warming. For example, organisms in more thermally variable environments are often more acclimatized and/or adapted to temperature extremes and are thus less sensitive to anthropogenic heatwaves. Considering both trend and variability highlights the importance of processes like legacy effects and extinction debt that influence the rate of community transformation.", "generated_text": "Marine climate change ecology is increasingly recognizing the importance of variability in the face of warming temperatures. While heatwaves and rising sea temperatures pose significant threats to marine ecosystems, variability in temperature and other environmental factors can provide refuge for certain species. This variability can manifest as depth refuge, where species migrate to deeper waters to escape surface heat stress. Acclimation to changing conditions is also crucial, allowing species to adapt to new thermal regimes. However, legacy effects of past climate change can persist, influencing the responses of species to current and future climate change. This review synthesizes the current literature on the importance of variability in marine climate change ecology, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between climate change, species responses, and ecosystem resilience. By examining the interplay between variability and climate change, we can better predict the impacts of warming on marine ecosystems and inform effective conservation and management strategies.", "label": 1}
