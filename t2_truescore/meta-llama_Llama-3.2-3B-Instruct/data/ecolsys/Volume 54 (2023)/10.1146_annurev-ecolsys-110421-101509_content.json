{"grounding": "The origin of life entails a continuum from simple prebiotic chemistry to cells with genes and molecular machines. Using life as a guide to this continuum, we consider how selection could promote increased complexity before the emergence of genes. Structured, far-from-equilibrium environments such as hydrothermal systems drive the reaction between CO2 and H2 to form organics that self-organize into protocells. CO2 fixation within protocells generates a reaction network with a topology that prefigures the universal core of metabolism. Positive feedback loops amplify flux through this network, giving a metabolic heredity that promotes growth. Patterns in the genetic code show that genes and proteins arose through direct biophysical interactions between amino acids and nucleotides in this protometabolic network. Random genetic sequences template nonrandom peptides, producing selectable function in growing protocells. This context-dependent emergence of information gives rise seamlessly to an autotrophic last universal common ancestor.", "generated_text": "The origin of life remains one of the most profound mysteries in the history of our planet. Recent studies have shed light on the crucial role of CO2 fixation in the emergence of life, with FeS clusters serving as key catalysts in this process. The concept of protocells, or self-replicating vesicles, has also gained significant attention as a potential precursor to modern cells. The proton-motive force, generated by the flow of protons across membranes, is thought to have played a pivotal role in the development of metabolism. The RNA world hypothesis posits that RNA molecules, capable of storing and transmitting genetic information, were the first genetic molecules to emerge. The discovery of FeS clusters in ancient RNA molecules has provided evidence for the RNA world hypothesis, and the subsequent development of the genetic code is believed to have arisen from the interactions between RNA and metal ions. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of the origin of life, with a focus on the interplay between CO2 fixation, protocells, and the emergence of metabolism and the genetic code.", "label": 0}
