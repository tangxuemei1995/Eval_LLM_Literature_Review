{"grounding": "Pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon of one gene or one mutation affecting multiple phenotypic traits. While the concept of pleiotropy is as old as Mendelian genetics, functional genomics has finally allowed the first glimpses of the extent of pleiotropy for a large fraction of genes in a genome. After describing conceptual and operational difficulties in quantifying pleiotropy and the pros and cons of various methods for measuring pleiotropy, I review empirical data on pleiotropy, which generally show an L-shaped distribution of the degree of pleiotropy (i.e., the number of traits affected), with most genes having low pleiotropy. I then review the current understanding of the molecular basis of pleiotropy. In the rest of the review, I discuss evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on advances in topics including the cost of complexity, regulatory versus coding evolution, environmental pleiotropy and adaptation, evolution of ageing and other seemingly harmful traits, and evolutionary resolution of pleiotropy.", "generated_text": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single genetic variant influences multiple phenotypic traits, has been a long-standing topic of interest in evolutionary biology. This review examines the patterns and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, with a focus on its role in adaptation, disease, and the cost of complexity. We discuss the various types of pleiotropy, including antagonistic pleiotropy, where a variant's beneficial effect on one trait is detrimental to another, and the costs associated with pleiotropy, such as increased disease susceptibility. Our analysis reveals that pleiotropy can lead to the evolution of complex traits, but also increases the risk of deleterious effects. We also explore the role of mutation in shaping pleiotropic relationships and the potential consequences for adaptation and disease. By integrating insights from evolutionary genetics, population biology, and disease ecology, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between pleiotropy, adaptation, and disease.", "label": 1}
