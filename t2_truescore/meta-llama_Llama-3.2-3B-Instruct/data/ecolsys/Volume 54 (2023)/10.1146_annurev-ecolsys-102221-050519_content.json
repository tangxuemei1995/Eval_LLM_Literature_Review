{"grounding": "Parenting is considered a key evolutionary innovation that contributed to the diversification and expansion of vertebrates. However, we know little about how such diversity evolved. Amphibians are an ideal group in which to identify the ecological factors that have facilitated or constrained the evolution of different forms of parental care. Among, but also within, the three amphibian orders\u2014Anura, Caudata, and Gymnophiona\u2014there is a high level of variation in habitat use, fertilization mode, mating systems, and parental sex roles. Recent work using broad phylogenetic, experimental, and physiological approaches has helped to uncover the factors that have selected for the evolution of care and transitions between different forms of parenting. Here, we highlight the exceptional diversity of amphibian parental care, emphasize the unique opportunities this group offers for addressing key questions about the evolution of parenting, and give insights into promising novel directions of research.", "generated_text": "The evolution of parental care in amphibians has been shaped by the unique demands of their life cycle, which involves aquatic larval development and terrestrial adult life. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diverse strategies employed by amphibians to ensure the survival of their offspring, including fertilization modes, protection, transport, and nutrition. Terrestrial species have evolved complex parental care behaviors, such as brooding and guarding, to protect their eggs and tadpoles from predators and environmental stressors. In contrast, aquatic species often rely on parental sex roles, where males and females take on distinct reproductive and parental responsibilities. By examining the interplay between fertilization mode, terrestriality, and parental care, this review highlights the importance of considering the ecological context in which parental care evolves. Understanding these strategies can provide insights into the evolution of parental care in other vertebrates and inform conservation efforts for amphibian populations.", "label": 1}
