{"grounding": "The way in which terrestrial organisms use the acoustic realm is fundamentally important and shapes behavior, populations, and communities, but how background acoustics, or noise, influence the patterns and processes in ecology is still relatively understudied. In this review, we summarize how background acoustics have traditionally been studied from the signaling perspective, discuss what is known from a receiver's perspective, and explore what is known about population- and community-level responses to noise. We suggest that there are major gaps linking animal physiology and behavior in noise to fitness; that there is a limited understanding of variation in hearing within and across species, especially in the context of real-world acoustic conditions; and that many puzzling responses to noise could be clarified with a community-level lens that considers indirect effects. Failing to consider variation in acoustic conditions, and the many ways organisms use and interact via this environmental dimension, risks a limited understanding of natural systems.", "generated_text": "Background acoustics, or the ambient soundscape, plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior and ecology of terrestrial organisms. Research has shown that sound can have both direct and indirect effects on animal behavior, influencing foraging, mating, and predator avoidance. In community ecology, background acoustics can also impact the distribution and abundance of species, with certain sounds masking or enhancing the presence of other species. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on the role of background acoustics in terrestrial ecology, highlighting the complex interactions between sound, behavior, and community structure. We discuss the mechanisms by which background acoustics influences animal behavior, including hearing and sound masking, and examine the empirical evidence for the indirect effects of background acoustics on community ecology. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between sound, behavior, and ecology in terrestrial ecosystems.", "label": 1}
