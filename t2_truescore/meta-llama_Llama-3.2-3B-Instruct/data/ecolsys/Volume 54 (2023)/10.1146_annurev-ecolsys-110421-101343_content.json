{"grounding": "Terrestrial ecosystems encompass a vast and vital component of Earth's biodiversity and ecosystem services. The effect of increased anthropogenic dominance on terrestrial communities defines major challenges for ecosystem conservation, including habitat destruction and fragmentation, climate change, species invasions and extinctions, and disease spread. Here, we integrate fossil, historical, and present-day organismal and ecological data to investigate how conservation paleobiology provides deep-time perspectives on terrestrial organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems impacted by anthropogenic processes. We relate research tools to conservation outputs and highlight gaps that currently limit conservation paleobiology from reaching its full impact on conservation practice and management. In doing so, we also highlight how the colonial legacies of conservation biology and paleobiology confound our understanding of present-day biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and conservation outlooks, and we make recommendations for more inclusive and ethical practices moving forward.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes the intersection of conservation paleobiology and the Anthropocene, highlighting the significance of terrestrial communities in understanding the dynamics of ecosystems under environmental stress. By examining fossil records, we demonstrate the resilience and adaptability of ancient ecosystems in response to climate change, anthropogenic disturbances, and other environmental stressors. The analysis of fossilized species and ecosystems reveals a complex interplay between biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the impact of human activities on the environment. This study underscores the importance of considering the long-term history of terrestrial communities in informing conservation strategies for the Anthropocene era, and highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between human activities, environmental stressors, and ecosystem resilience.", "label": 1}
