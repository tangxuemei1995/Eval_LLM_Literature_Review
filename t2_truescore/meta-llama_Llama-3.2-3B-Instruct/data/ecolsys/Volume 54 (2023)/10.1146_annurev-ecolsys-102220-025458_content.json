{"grounding": "Whales are an extraordinary study group for questions about ecology and evolution because their combinations of extreme body sizes and unique foraging strategies are unparalleled among animals. From a terrestrial ancestry, whales evolved specialized oceanic foraging mechanisms that characterize the two main groups of living cetaceans: echolocation by toothed whales and bulk filter feeding by baleen whales. In toothed whales, lineage-specific increases in body size, enhanced diving capacity, and echolocation enable them to hunt the most abundant prey on the planet: deep-sea fish and cephalopods. Even greater body size increases, along with filter feeding and fasting capacity, permit large baleen whales to migrate long distances and exploit epipelagic patches of schooling prey, such as krill or fish, which are highly abundant but ephemeral. For both groups, prey abundance and distribution limit foraging performance, yielding divergent energetic niches that have shaped their convergent evolution to gigantism.", "generated_text": "The evolution of cetaceans has been shaped by the need to optimize foraging in aquatic environments, where energy availability is limited. This study investigates the ecophysiological drivers and limits of foraging in cetaceans, focusing on the relationships between body size, diving behavior, and foraging efficiency. Using a comparative analysis of 15 cetacean species, we found that larger body size is associated with increased diving depth and duration, but also with reduced foraging efficiency due to increased energy expenditure. Scaling theory predicts that gigantism should be energetically costly, and our results support this prediction. However, we also found that some species have evolved unique foraging strategies that allow them to exploit high-energy prey, such as deep-diving fish-eaters. Our study highlights the complex interplay between body size, diving behavior, and foraging efficiency in the evolution of cetaceans, and has implications for our understanding of the predator-prey dynamics in marine ecosystems.", "label": 1}
