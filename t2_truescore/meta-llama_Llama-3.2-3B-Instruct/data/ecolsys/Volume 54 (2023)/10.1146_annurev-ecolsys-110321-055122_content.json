{"grounding": "Large Old World fruit bats (LOWFBs), species of Pteropus, Acerodon, and related genera of large bats in the pteropodid subfamily Pteropodinae, play important roles as agents of dispersal and pollination across the Paleotropics. LOWFBs are also collectively the most threatened group of bats in the world, with 71% of extant species assessed as threatened by International Union for Conservation of Nature. As highlighted here, contrary to other bats, the vast majority of LOWFBs face multiple simultaneous threats. Most importantly, biological and ecological traits, in particular life history characteristics, diet, movement, social ecology, and physiology, intensify threats and accelerate species declines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LOWFBs are to be considered keystone species and express concern about the erosion of this role and the cascading effects expected on native ecosystems. In response to this alarming situation, we advance general recommendations and identify overarching research and conservation actions.", "generated_text": "Large Old World fruit bats, commonly referred to as flying foxes, are facing unprecedented threats to their survival, with many species on the brink of extinction. This study examines the causes and consequences of the decline of Pteropus species, with a focus on the impact of hunting and climate change. Our analysis reveals that habitat loss and fragmentation, driven by deforestation and land conversion, have led to a decline in fruit bat populations. Additionally, the increasing frequency and severity of hunting, often driven by local communities and wildlife trade, have further exacerbated the decline. Climate change is also having a profound impact, altering the availability of food resources and disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems. The loss of these keystone species has significant consequences for ecosystem function and biodiversity, highlighting the need for urgent conservation action to protect these iconic animals and the ecosystems they inhabit.", "label": 1}
