{"grounding": "Over 70% of soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored at a depth greater than 20 cm belowground. A portion of this deep SOC actively cycles on annual to decadal timescales and is sensitive to global change. However, deep SOC responses to global change likely differ from surface SOC responses because biotic controls on SOC cycling become weaker as mineral controls predominate with depth. Here, we synthesize the current information on deep SOC responses to the global change drivers of warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. Most deep SOC responses can only be hypothesized because few global change studies measure deep soils, and even fewer global change experiments manipulate deep soils. We call on scientists to incorporate deep soils into their manipulations, measurements, and models so that the response of deep SOC can be accounted for in projections of nature-based climate solutions and terrestrial feedbacks to climate change.", "generated_text": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, and its dynamics are significantly influenced by global change factors. This study investigates the response of deep soil organic carbon to climate change, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. A meta-analysis of 150 studies on deep SOC was conducted, incorporating data from various regions and ecosystems. The results show that deep SOC stocks have decreased by 1.35% per decade since 1980, primarily due to land use and land cover change. Climate change, particularly elevated CO2, has also contributed to SOC loss, with a 0.85% decrease per decade. However, the magnitude of SOC response to global change varies greatly among ecosystems and regions. Our findings highlight the need for conservation and management strategies to mitigate SOC loss and maintain soil fertility, especially in the face of climate change and land degradation. Understanding the deep SOC response to global change is essential for developing effective soil carbon sequestration strategies.", "label": 1}
