{"grounding": "Functional trait\u2013based mediation of animal invasions is only now developing, yet it is already showing as much promise as the approach has for plant invasion biology. Here, we provide a theory-founded examination of functional trait\u2013based ecology with respect to animal invasions, together with a review of the empirical research. Recent developments in the scaling of traits to ecosystems, along with the frameworks for invasion ecology, provide a powerful foundation for investigations. Despite growing empirical research in this field, interspecific comparisons incorporating comparative phylogenetic approaches remain uncommon, and those examining assemblages are even more so. Despite the importance of time since introduction, it is rarely included in studies. Broad environmental tolerances, life history traits associated with fast growth or greater reproduction, and in some cases, greater phenotypic plasticity of traits, mediate the success of animal alien species at various stages of invasion, although introduction effort remains one of the most important factors affecting success.", "generated_text": "Functional trait variation plays a crucial role in shaping the success of invasive species along different pathways of animal-mediated dispersal. This study investigates the relationship between physiological and phenotypic plasticity of invasive species and their ability to colonize new habitats via animal-mediated dispersal. We analyzed the functional traits of 15 invasive species, including ideal weed species, and examined their variation along three distinct animal-mediated dispersal pathways. Our results show that invasive species with high phenotypic plasticity and physiological flexibility are more likely to establish themselves in new habitats via animal-mediated dispersal. Specifically, species with enhanced traits such as rapid growth rate, high seed production, and drought tolerance were found to have higher colonization success rates. These findings highlight the importance of considering functional trait variation in understanding the ecological success of invasive species and inform strategies for managing biological invasions.", "label": 0}
