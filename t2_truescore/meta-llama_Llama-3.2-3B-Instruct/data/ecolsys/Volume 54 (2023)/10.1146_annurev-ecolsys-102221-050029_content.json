{"grounding": "Sky islands are unique geologic formations, home to populations of organisms that have weathered climate change since the Pleistocene. Long-term isolation and climatic differences between sky islands and adjacent mountain chains result in natural laboratories well suited for examining the direct effects of climate change. Here, we review the global sky island literature to examine how taxa have responded to climate change. Results show lineage formation, reduced genetic variation, and trait evolution across taxa driven by genetic drift and natural selection. These effects continue today due to ongoing habitat reduction and steep selective gradients on sky islands relative to mountain chains. Comparative studies and experimental manipulations are needed to build broad inference into how past climate change has shaped the structure and function of whole ecosystems. The next era of sky island research is poised to create a model for climate change responses and eco-evolutionary dynamics, with profound conservation implications.", "generated_text": "Sky islands, isolated landmasses with unique geological histories, serve as a global tool for predicting the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change. By examining the genetic variation and relict populations found in these isolated ecosystems, researchers can gain insights into the potential impacts of climate-driven changes on biodiversity. The convergent evolution of species in sky islands, where similar environmental pressures have shaped distinct adaptations, provides a natural laboratory for studying the evolutionary responses to climate change. This research highlights the importance of sky islands as a model system for understanding the complex interactions between climate, evolution, and ecology. By leveraging the unique characteristics of sky islands, scientists can develop more accurate predictions of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change, ultimately informing conservation efforts and management strategies to mitigate its impacts.", "label": 1}
