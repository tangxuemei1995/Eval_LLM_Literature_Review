{"grounding": "Biological toxins are entrenched within ecosystems. Thus, animals are often exposed to such toxins, and how they adapt can be a key determinant of their evolutionary trajectories. In this review, we provide an overview of the diversity of toxin resistance mechanisms, with a focus on animals that sequester toxins from their diet and their natural predators and parasites. We propose a structured framework in which to study toxin resistance by recategorizing and reorganizing known mechanisms into avoidance, metabolism, and target categories. Then, using this framework, we review evidence regarding how animals resist four widely studied compounds: tetrodotoxin, batrachotoxin, cardiotonic steroids, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Based on the available data, we conclude that toxin resistance and sequestration are interrelated from both ecological and evolutionary perspectives. To conclude, we highlight open questions regarding toxin resistance and review its importance as a field.\nEn los ecosistemas las toxinas de origen biol\u00f3gico son componentes intr\u00ednsecos. Por esta raz\u00f3n, los animales se ven expuestos frecuenciamente a dichas toxinas y la forma en que se adaptan puede ser un factor que determina su trayectoria evolutiva. Esta revisi\u00f3n ofrece una visi\u00f3n general de la diversidad de mecanismos de resistencia a toxinas, centr\u00e1ndose en animales que secuestran toxinas de su dieta y en sus depredadores y par\u00e1sitos naturales. En este texto se propone un marco estructural para estudiar la resistencia a toxinas mediante la recategorizaci\u00f3n y reorganizaci\u00f3n de mecanismos conocidos en categor\u00edas de: evaci\u00f3n, metabolismo y mol\u00e9culas diana. A continuaci\u00f3n, utilizando este marco, revisamos la literatura cient\u00edfica en busca de evidencia sobre c\u00f3mo los animales resisten a cuatro compuestos ampliamente estudiados: tetrodotoxina, batracotoxina, esteroides cardiot\u00f3nicos y alcaloides de pirrolizidina. A partir de los datos disponibles, llegamos a la conclusi\u00f3n de que la resistencia y la retenci\u00f3n de toxinas est\u00e1n interrelacionadas tanto desde el punto de vista ecol\u00f3gico como evolutivo. Por \u00faltimo, destacamos algunas preguntas abiertas en torno a la resistencia a las toxinas y resaltamos su importancia como campo de estudio en el futuro.", "generated_text": "The ability of animals to resist toxins is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has evolved to ensure their survival in a wide range of environments. This review aims to provide an overview of the diverse mechanisms that animals use to resist toxins, with a focus on the chemical defense strategies employed by various species. Tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin found in pufferfish and blue-ringed octopuses, is one of the most toxic substances known, yet some animals have evolved mechanisms to neutralize its effects. Batrachotoxin, another potent neurotoxin found in certain frogs and toads, is also resisted by some species through the production of cardiotonic steroids, which can counteract its effects on the heart. In contrast, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, a class of toxic compounds found in certain plants, are resisted by animals that have evolved mechanisms to detoxify these compounds, such as the production of enzymes that can break down the alkaloids. Chemical defense strategies are also employed by animals to resist toxins, such as the production of chemical signals that can deter predators. For example, certain species of frogs and toads produce chemical signals that can repel predators, while others produce signals that can attract prey. The mechanisms used by animals to resist toxins are often highly specific and can be influenced by a range of factors, including diet, environment, and evolutionary history. This review highlights the diversity of chemical defense strategies employed by animals to resist toxins and provides insights into the complex interactions between animals and their environment. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can gain a deeper appreciation for the remarkable adaptability of animals and the importance of chemical defense in their survival.", "label": 1}
