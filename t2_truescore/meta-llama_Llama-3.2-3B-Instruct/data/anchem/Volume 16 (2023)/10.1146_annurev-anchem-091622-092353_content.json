{"grounding": "The identification of thousands of proteins and their relative levels of expression has furthered understanding of biological processes and disease and stimulated new systems biology hypotheses. Quantitative proteomics workflows that rely on analytical assays such as mass spectrometry have facilitated high-throughput measurements of proteins partially due to multiplexing. Multiplexing allows proteome differences across multiple samples to be measured simultaneously, resulting in more accurate quantitation, increased statistical robustness, reduced analysis times, and lower experimental costs. The number of samples that can be multiplexed has evolved from as few as two to more than 50, with studies involving more than 10 samples being denoted as enhanced multiplexing or hyperplexing. In this review, we give an update on emerging multiplexing proteomics techniques and highlight advantages and limitations for enhanced multiplexing strategies.", "generated_text": "This study presents an advanced multiplexing technology for proteomics, enabling the simultaneous analysis of thousands of proteins in a single experiment. By integrating hyperplexing and high-throughput techniques, our approach significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of protein identification and quantification. The proposed system utilizes advanced automation and machine learning algorithms to optimize sample preparation, data analysis, and result interpretation. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase in throughput and a reduction in experimental time, making this technology a valuable tool for large-scale proteomics studies. The implications of this work are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields such as personalized medicine, disease diagnosis, and drug discovery.", "label": 0}
