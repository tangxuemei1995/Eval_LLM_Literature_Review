{"grounding": "Biosensing based on CRISPR-Cas systems is a young but rapidly evolving technology. The unprecedented properties of the CRISPR-Cas system provide an innovative tool for developing new-generation biosensing strategies. To date, a series of nucleic acid and non-nucleic acid detection methods have been developed based on the CRISPR platform. In this review, we first introduce the core biochemical properties underpinning the development of CRISPR bioassays, such as diverse reaction temperatures, programmability in design, high reaction efficiency, and recognition specificity, and highlight recent efforts to improve these parameters. We then introduce the technical developments, including how to improve sensitivity and quantification capabilities, develop multiplex assays, achieve convenient one-pot assays, create advanced sensors, and extend the applications of detection. Finally, we analyze obstacles to the commercial application of CRISPR detection technology and explore development opportunities and directions.", "generated_text": "CRISPR-based biosensing strategies have emerged as a promising approach for detecting and quantifying various biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules. Recent advancements in CRISPR-Cas13 and CRISPR-Cas12a technologies have enabled the development of sensitive and specific biosensors for detecting pathogens, biomarkers, and environmental pollutants. These biosensors utilize the RNA-targeting activity of CRISPR-Cas13 or the DNA-targeting activity of CRISPR-Cas12a to selectively cleave target molecules, resulting in a detectable signal. The technical development of CRISPR-based biosensors has been facilitated by the optimization of guide RNA design, Cas enzyme engineering, and signal amplification strategies. The application prospects of CRISPR-based biosensing strategies are vast, including point-of-care diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety surveillance, offering a powerful tool for early disease detection, rapid response, and public health protection.", "label": 1}
