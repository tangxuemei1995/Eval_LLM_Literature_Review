{"grounding": "In situ water monitoring sensors are critical to gain an understanding of ocean biochemistry and ecosystem health. They enable the collection of high-frequency data and capture ecosystem spatial and temporal changes, which in turn facilitate long-term global predictions. They are used as decision support tools in emergency situations and for risk mitigation, pollution source tracking, and regulatory monitoring. Advanced sensing platforms exist to support various monitoring needs together with state-of-the-art power and communication capabilities. To be fit-for-purpose, sensors must withstand the challenging marine environment and provide data at an acceptable cost. Significant technological advancements have catalyzed the development of new and improved sensors for coastal and oceanographic applications. Sensors are becoming smaller, smarter, more cost-effective, and increasingly specialized and diversified. This article, therefore, provides a review of the state-of-the art oceanographic and coastal sensors. Progress in sensor development is discussed in terms of performance and the key strategies used for achieving robustness, marine rating, cost reduction, and antifouling protection.", "generated_text": "The deployment of in situ sensors for coastal and ocean monitoring has become increasingly crucial for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change, ocean acidification, and human activities on marine ecosystems. This review synthesizes the current state of sensor technologies and their applications in coastal and ocean monitoring, highlighting the benefits and challenges associated with sensor networks. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that biofouling, a major concern for sensor longevity and performance, can be mitigated through the use of anti-fouling coatings and sensor design innovations. The review also discusses the importance of sensor networks in providing real-time data on ocean currents, temperature, salinity, and other parameters, which are essential for predicting and managing coastal erosion, marine pollution, and fisheries management. By integrating cutting-edge sensor technologies and innovative data analytics, this review aims to provide a framework for the development of effective sensor systems for coastal and ocean monitoring, ultimately informing policy and management decisions that support sustainable ocean management and conservation.", "label": 0}
