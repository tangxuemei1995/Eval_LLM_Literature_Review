{"grounding": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect tropical and subtropical countries and are caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. These kinds of diseases spread quickly due to the tropical climate and limited access to clean water, sanitation, and health care, which make exposed people more vulnerable. NTDs are reported to be difficult and inefficient to diagnose. As mentioned, most NTDs occur in countries that are socially vulnerable, and the lack of resources and access to modern laboratories and equipment intensify the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment, leading to an increase in the mortality rate. Portable and low-cost microfluidic systems have been widely applied for clinical diagnosis, offering a promising alternative that can meet the needs for fast, affordable, and reliable diagnostic tests in developing countries. This review provides a critical overview of microfluidic devices that have been reported in the literature for the detection of the most common NTDs over the past 5 years.", "generated_text": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose a significant public health burden worldwide, with limited access to diagnostic tools and healthcare infrastructure in endemic regions. This study presents a low-cost, paper-based microfluidic system for the detection of NTDs, leveraging lateral flow assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principles. The system, designed for point-of-care testing, utilizes a simple, portable format and minimal reagents, enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Chagas disease. The microfluidic device integrates a sample inlet, reaction chamber, and output channel, allowing for efficient mixing and separation of analytes. The system was evaluated for its sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use, demonstrating promising results in a clinical setting. The low-cost, user-friendly design of this microfluidic system has the potential to revolutionize NTD diagnosis and treatment in resource-limited settings, improving health outcomes and reducing the global burden of these diseases.", "label": 0}
