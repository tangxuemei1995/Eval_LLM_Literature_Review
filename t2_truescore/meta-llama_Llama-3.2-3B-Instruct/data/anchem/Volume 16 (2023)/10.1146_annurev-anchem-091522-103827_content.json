{"grounding": "Biofilms are multicellular communities held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix and exhibit a set of properties that distinguish them from free-living bacteria. Biofilms are exposed to a variety of mechanical and chemical cues resulting from fluid motion and mass transport. Microfluidics provides the precise control of hydrodynamic and physicochemical microenvironments to study biofilms in general. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in microfluidics-based biofilm research, including understanding the mechanism of bacterial adhesion and biofilm development, assessment of antifouling and antimicrobial properties, development of advanced in vitro infection models, and advancement in methods to characterize biofilms. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future direction of microfluidics-assisted biofilm research.", "generated_text": "Microfluidics plays a crucial role in biofilm studies by enabling in situ visualization, manipulation, and analysis of complex microbial communities. This technology allows for the creation of microfluidic devices that mimic the flow dynamics and shear stress experienced by biofilms in their natural environments. Antifouling surfaces and antimicrobial agents can be integrated into these devices to investigate the effects of surface modifications on biofilm formation and resistance to antimicrobials. Organ-on-chip devices and biosensors can also be integrated to study the interactions between biofilms and host tissues. By leveraging microfluidics, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of biofilm biology and develop innovative solutions for biofilm-related diseases and infections.", "label": 1}
