{"grounding": "This review summarizes the current status of development in photoluminescent probes, multidimensional photoluminescence detection, and multivariate data analysis methods. It then highlights reports featuring multivariate analysis of multidimensional measurements of photoluminescent probes published between June 2015 and June 2022, emphasizing work in the last 5 years. Important trends include the development of probe arrays, which provide fingerprint responses to the analyte(s) of interest and facilitate the analysis of complex samples; the application of neural networks and deep learning to pattern recognition and feature selection in photoluminescence images; and the application of multiway multivariate analysis to mining matrices, three-way arrays, and higher-order measurements, including hyperspectral intensity and lifetime images. These examples illustrate the increase in information extraction provided by the combination of multidimensional measurements and multivariate analysis.", "generated_text": "Photoluminescence probes have emerged as powerful tools for multidimensional sensing, enabling the detection of multiple analytes in complex matrices. By harnessing the principles of multidimensional fluorescence and phosphorescence, these probes can provide a wealth of information on the chemical and physical properties of the analytes. Recent advances in image analysis and N-way analysis have further expanded the capabilities of photoluminescence probes, allowing for the simultaneous analysis of multiple variables in a single experiment. This review provides an overview of the current state of photoluminescence probes in data-enabled sensing, highlighting their applications in fields such as chemistry, biology, and materials science. The potential of these probes for advancing our understanding of complex systems is discussed, along with future directions for research and development.", "label": 1}
