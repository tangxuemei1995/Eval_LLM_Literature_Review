{"grounding": "The goal of protecting the health of future generations is a blueprint for future biosensor design. Systems-level decision support requires that biosensors provide meaningful service to society. In this review, we summarize recent developments in cyber physical systems and biosensors connected with decision support. We identify key processes and practices that may guide the establishment of connections between user needs and biosensor engineering using an informatics approach. We call for data science and decision science to be formally connected with sensor science for understanding system complexity and realizing the ambition of biosensors-as-a-service. This review calls for a focus on quality of service early in the design process as a means to improve the meaningful value of a given biosensor. We close by noting that technology development, including biosensors and decision support systems, is a cautionary tale. The economics of scale govern the success, or failure, of any biosensor system.", "generated_text": "The integration of biosensors into a connected world has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing real-time, system-level support for decision-making. This concept is rooted in the idea of a knowledge network, where biosensors serve as the backbone, facilitating the exchange of health-related data between various stakeholders. By leveraging biosensors, healthcare systems can optimize quality of service, ensuring seamless communication and data sharing. The meaningful use of biosensors can be achieved through the development of sophisticated decision support systems, which analyze health data to provide actionable insights. This abstract explores the intersection of biosensors, decision support, and quality of service, highlighting the importance of a connected world in enhancing healthcare outcomes. By fostering a collaborative knowledge network, biosensors can play a pivotal role in shaping the future of healthcare.", "label": 1}
