{"grounding": "Offering superb speed, chemical specificity, and analytical sensitivity, direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies are highly amenable for the molecular analysis of complex tissues to aid in disease characterization and help identify new diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers. By enabling detection of clinically actionable molecular profiles from tissues and cells, direct MS technologies have the potential to guide treatment decisions and transform sample analysis within clinical workflows. In this review, we highlight recent health-related developments and applications of direct MS technologies that exhibit tangible potential to accelerate clinical research and disease diagnosis, including oncological and neurodegenerative diseases and microbial infections. We focus primarily on applications that employ direct MS technologies for tissue analysis, including MS imaging technologies to map spatial distributions of molecules in situ as well as handheld devices for rapid in vivo and ex vivo tissue analysis.", "generated_text": "Direct mass spectrometry technologies have revolutionized the field of tissue analysis, enabling the non-invasive and high-resolution imaging of biomolecules in various tissues. Recent advances in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) have expanded its clinical diagnostics applications, allowing for the detection of biomarkers for diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and infectious diseases. Ambient ionization (AI) techniques have further enhanced the portability and accessibility of MSI, enabling the development of handheld mass spectrometry-based devices for point-of-care diagnostics. These emerging technologies have the potential to transform the field of clinical diagnostics, enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis, and facilitating personalized medicine. This review highlights the current state of the art in direct mass spectrometry technologies for tissue analysis, and discusses their potential applications in clinical diagnostics and beyond.", "label": 1}
