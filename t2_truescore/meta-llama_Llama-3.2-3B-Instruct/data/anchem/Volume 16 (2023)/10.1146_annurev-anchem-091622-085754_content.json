{"grounding": "Label-free electrochemical biosensing leverages the advantages of label-free techniques, low cost, and fewer user steps, with the sensitivity and portability of electrochemical analysis. In this review, we identify four label-free electrochemical biosensing mechanisms: (a) blocking the electrode surface, (b) allowing greater access to the electrode surface, (c) changing the intercalation or electrostatic affinity of a redox probe to a biorecognition unit, and (d) modulating ion or electron transport properties due to conformational and surface charge changes. Each mechanism is described, recent advancements are summarized, and relative advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are discussed. Furthermore, two avenues for gaining further diagnostic information from label-free electrochemical biosensors, through multiplex analysis and incorporating machine learning, are examined.", "generated_text": "This review focuses on label-free electrochemical methods for disease detection, highlighting their potential in biosensing and diagnostics. Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as a promising approach for disease diagnosis, offering high sensitivity, rapid response times, and low cost. Label-free electrochemical methods, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), enable real-time monitoring of biomarker interactions without the need for fluorescent labels. These methods have been successfully applied to detect various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and infectious diseases. The review discusses the principles, advantages, and limitations of label-free electrochemical methods, as well as their potential for integration into point-of-care diagnostics and clinical settings.", "label": 1}
