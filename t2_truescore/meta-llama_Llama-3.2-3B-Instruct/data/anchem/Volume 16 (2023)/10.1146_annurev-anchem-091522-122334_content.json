{"grounding": "Electrochemical additive manufacturing is an advanced microfabrication technology capable of producing features of almost unlimited geometrical complexity. A unique combination of the capacity to process conductive materials, design freedom, and micro- to nanoscale resolution offered by these electrochemical techniques promises tremendous opportunities for a multitude of future applications spanning microelectronics, sensing, robotics, and energy storage. This review aims to equip readers with the basic principles of electrochemical 3D printing at the small length scale. By describing the basic principles of electrochemical additive manufacturing technology and using the recent advances in the field, this beginner's guide illustrates how controlling the fundamental phenomena that underpin the print process can be used to vary dimensions, morphology, and microstructure of printed structures.", "generated_text": "This beginner's guide provides an overview of micro- and nanoscale electrochemical additive manufacturing techniques, including meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED), fluid dynamics-based methods such as electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), and advanced imaging techniques like scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and fluid force microscopy (FluidFM). The guide covers the fundamental principles and applications of these techniques, including the deposition of metals, alloys, and other materials at the micro- and nanoscale. The use of nanopipettes and other specialized equipment is also discussed, highlighting the potential for precise control over the manufacturing process. By exploring these cutting-edge technologies, researchers and engineers can unlock new possibilities for additive manufacturing and nanotechnology applications.", "label": 0}
