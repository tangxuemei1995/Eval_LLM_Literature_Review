{"grounding": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging records spatially resolved molecular vibrational spectra, enabling a comprehensive measurement of the chemical makeup and heterogeneity of biological tissues. Combining this novel contrast mechanism in microscopy with the use of artificial intelligence can transform the practice of histopathology, which currently relies largely on human examination of morphologic patterns within stained tissue. First, this review summarizes IR imaging instrumentation especially suited to histopathology, analyses of its performance, and major trends. Second, an overview of data processing methods and application of machine learning is given, with an emphasis on the emerging use of deep learning. Third, a discussion on workflows in pathology is provided, with four categories proposed based on the complexity of methods and the analytical performance needed. Last, a set of guidelines, termed experimental and analytical specifications for spectroscopic imaging in histopathology, are proposed to help standardize the diversity of approaches in this emerging area.", "generated_text": "Digital histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging represents a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis. By integrating infrared spectroscopic imaging with machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, this method enables the non-invasive analysis of tissue samples. Infrared spectroscopic imaging captures chemical information from tissue samples, which is then processed by deep learning models to identify specific biomarkers associated with cancer. The proposed approach has been validated on a dataset of histopathological images and corresponding infrared spectroscopic data, demonstrating a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional methods. The results show that digital histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging can be a valuable tool for the early detection and monitoring of cancer, offering a promising alternative to conventional histopathological analysis. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this technology in clinical settings.", "label": 0}
