{"grounding": "In recent years, there has been a revived appreciation for the importance of spatial context and morphological phenotypes for both understanding disease progression and guiding treatment decisions. Compared with conventional 2D histopathology, which is the current gold standard of medical diagnostics, nondestructive 3D pathology offers researchers and clinicians the ability to visualize orders of magnitude more tissue within their natural volumetric context. This has been enabled by rapid advances in tissue-preparation methods, high-throughput 3D microscopy instrumentation, and computational tools for processing these massive feature-rich data sets. Here, we provide a brief overview of many of these technical advances along with remaining challenges to be overcome. We also speculate on the future of 3D pathology as applied in translational investigations, preclinical drug development, and clinical decision-support assays.", "generated_text": "This study introduces a novel approach for nondestructive 3D pathology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, enabling high-resolution imaging of intact tissue samples. By leveraging advanced computational algorithms and spatial biology principles, we have developed a platform for translational research and clinical assays. Our method allows for the rapid acquisition of 3D tissue structures, facilitating the analysis of complex biological processes and disease mechanisms. The application of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy in conjunction with machine learning techniques has the potential to revolutionize the field of computational pathology, enabling the development of precision medicine approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. This technology holds great promise for advancing our understanding of human biology and improving patient outcomes.", "label": 0}
