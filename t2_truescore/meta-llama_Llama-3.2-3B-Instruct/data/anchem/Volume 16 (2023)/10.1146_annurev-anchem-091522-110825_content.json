{"grounding": "Despite the fact that oil chemistry and oils spills have been studied for many years, there are still emerging techniques and unknown processes to be explored. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a revival of oil spill research across a wide range of fields. These studies provided many new insights, but unanswered questions remain. Over 1,000 journal articles related to the Deepwater Horizon spill are indexed by the Chemical Abstract Service. Numerous ecological, human health, and organismal studies were published. Analytical tools applied to the spill include mass spectrometry, chromatography, and optical spectroscopy. Owing to the large scale of studies, this review focuses on three emerging areas that have been explored but remain underutilized in oil spill characterization: excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy, black carbon analysis, and trace metal analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.", "generated_text": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 released an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in widespread contamination of marine ecosystems. Following this event, emerging chemical methods have been developed to analyze petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been employed to quantify petrogenic elements and black carbon in marine sediments and water samples. Fluorescence-based techniques have also been utilized to identify and quantify petrogenic DOM, which is a key component of the oil spill's impact on marine ecosystems. This study reviews the current state of chemical methods for analyzing petroleum and petrogenic DOM in the context of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, highlighting the advantages and limitations of ICP-MS and fluorescence-based approaches. The findings of this review have implications for our understanding of the long-term effects of oil spills on marine ecosystems and the development of effective remediation strategies.", "label": 0}
