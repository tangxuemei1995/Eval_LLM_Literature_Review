{"grounding": "This article critically reviews analytical method validation and quality control applied to the environmental chemistry field. The review focuses on the determination of organic micropollutants (OMPs), specifically emerging contaminants and pesticides, in the aquatic environment. The analytical technique considered is (gas and liquid) chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), including high-resolution MS for wide-scope screening purposes. An analysis of current research practices outlined in the literature has been performed, and key issues and analytical challenges are identified and critically discussed. It is worth emphasizing the lack of specific guidelines applied to environmental analytical chemistry and the minimal regulation of OMPs in waters, which greatly affect method development and performance, requirements for method validation, and the subsequent application to samples. Finally, a proposal is made for method validation and data reporting, which can be understood as starting points for further discussion with specialists in environmental analytical chemistry.", "generated_text": "The accurate detection and quantification of organic micropollutants in water samples are crucial for environmental monitoring and public health protection. This review highlights the importance of efficient validation strategies in environmental analytical chemistry, with a focus on liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS and GC-MS) methods. A comprehensive evaluation of method validation protocols, including matrix effects, method robustness, and inter-laboratory comparability, is presented. The impact of sample preparation, instrumental parameters, and calibration standards on method performance is also discussed. Furthermore, the application of quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) principles, such as proficiency testing and certified reference materials, is emphasized. The review concludes by highlighting the need for standardized validation protocols and the importance of inter-laboratory collaboration to ensure the accuracy and reliability of environmental analytical results.", "label": 0}
