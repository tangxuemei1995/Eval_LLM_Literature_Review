{"grounding": "Cell functions rely on signal transduction\u2014the cascades of molecular interactions and biochemical reactions that relay extracellular signals to the cell interior. Dissecting principles governing the signal transduction process is critical for the fundamental understanding of cell physiology and the development of biomedical interventions. The complexity of cell signaling is, however, beyond what is accessible by conventional biochemistry assays. Thanks to their unique physical and chemical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly used for the quantitative measurement and manipulation of cell signaling. Even though research in this area is still in its infancy, it has the potential to yield new, paradigm-shifting knowledge of cell biology and lead to biomedical innovations. To highlight this importance, we summarize in this review studies that pioneered the development and application of NPs for cell signaling, from quantitative measurements of signaling molecules to spatiotemporal manipulation of cell signal transduction.", "generated_text": "The interrogation of cell signaling pathways is crucial for understanding cellular behavior and developing novel therapeutic strategies. Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising tool for intracellular sensing and manipulation of cell signaling. These nanoscale entities can be engineered to target specific cell types, manipulate signaling pathways, and provide quantitative imaging of cellular responses. This review highlights the recent advances in the development of nanoparticles for interrogation of cell signaling, including magnetic and optical manipulation techniques. We discuss the design and synthesis of nanoparticles for specific applications, such as sensing of biomarkers, modulation of signaling pathways, and imaging of cellular dynamics. The potential of nanoparticles in cell signaling interrogation is also discussed in the context of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The future directions of nanoparticle-based cell signaling interrogation are also explored, including the development of nanoscale biosensors and therapeutic agents.", "label": 0}
