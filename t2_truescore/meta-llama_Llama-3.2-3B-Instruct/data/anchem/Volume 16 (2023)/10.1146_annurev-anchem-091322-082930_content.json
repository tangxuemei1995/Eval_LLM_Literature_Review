{"grounding": "The development of wearable devices provides approaches for the realization of self-health care. Easily carried wearable devices allow individual health monitoring at any place whenever necessary. There are various interesting monitoring targets, including body motion, organ pressure, and biomarkers. An efficient use of space in one small device is a promising resolution to increase the functions of wearable devices. Through integration of a microfluidic system into wearable devices, embedding complicated structures in one design becomes possible and can enable multifunction analyses within a limited device volume. This article reviews the reported microfluidic wearable devices, introduces applications to different biofluids, discusses characteristics of the design strategies and sensing principles, and highlights the attractive configurations of each device. This review seeks to provide a detailed summary of recent advanced microfluidic wearable devices. The overview of advanced key components is the basis for the development of future microfluidic wearable devices.", "generated_text": "This study presents a wearable microfluidics device designed for continuous biomarker sensing and analysis. The device integrates a microfluidic channel, a biochemical assay, and a sensing mechanism into a compact, wearable form factor. The microfluidic channel is fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and photolithography, allowing for the creation of complex geometries and precise control over fluid flow. The biochemical assay is based on a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol, which enables the detection of biomarkers in real-time. The sensing mechanism utilizes a nanoscale optical sensor, which provides high sensitivity and selectivity for biomarker detection. The wearable device is designed to be user-friendly, with a user-friendly interface and a rechargeable battery that provides up to 5 days of continuous operation. The device has been validated through a series of experiments, demonstrating its ability to detect biomarkers with high accuracy and reliability.", "label": 0}
