{"grounding": "Developing a deeper understanding of dynamic chemical, electronic, and morphological changes at interfaces is key to solving practical issues in electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs). To unravel this complexity, an assortment of tools with distinct capabilities and spatiotemporal resolutions have been used to creatively visualize interfacial processes as they occur. This review highlights how electrochemical scanning probe techniques (ESPTs) such as electrochemical atomic force microscopy, scanning electrochemical microscopy, scanning ion conductance microscopy, and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy are uniquely positioned to address these challenges in EESSs. We describe the operating principles of ESPTs, focusing on the inspection of interfacial structure and chemical processes involved in Li-ion batteries and beyond. We discuss current examples, performance limitations, and complementary ESPTs. Finally, we discuss prospects for imaging improvements and deep learning for automation. We foresee that ESPTs will play an enabling role in advancing EESSs as we transition to renewable energies.", "generated_text": "The development of efficient energy storage systems, such as batteries, requires a deep understanding of the interfaces between electrodes and electrolytes. Scanning probe methods, including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM), and Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Microscopy (SICM), have emerged as powerful tools for electrochemical imaging of interfaces. These techniques enable the spatially resolved analysis of electrode-electrolyte interactions, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of energy storage. Recent advancements in automation and machine learning, including deep learning algorithms, have further enhanced the capabilities of these methods. This review provides an overview of the current state of the art in electrochemical imaging of interfaces via scanning probe methods, highlighting their techniques, applications, and prospects for future research.
