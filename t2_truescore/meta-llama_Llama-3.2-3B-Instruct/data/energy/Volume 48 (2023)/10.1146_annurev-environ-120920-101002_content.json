{"grounding": "There are large disparities in access to green technologies between countries and among different demographic groups within countries. Unless carefully managed, the energy transition risks exacerbating some of these inequalities, for example, by burdening those who are excluded from efficient new technologies with the costs of maintaining legacy infrastructure. The energy transition will create new interdependencies between sectors\u2014for example, between buildings, the power sector, and transportation\u2014requiring integrated design of policies and infrastructure in different sectors. The equitable adoption of new technologies is contingent on broadening access to enabling technologies such as the Internet and payment systems. Decisionmakers must focus on new technologies that remove disparities in access to services but do not replicate current inefficiencies in providing those services (e.g., equitable access to mobility\u2014not only to motorized personal vehicles). Data at higher resolutions and with broader coverage are needed to design equitable technology deployment strategies and evaluate their success.", "generated_text": "The integration of green technologies is crucial for achieving environmental justice, particularly in marginalized communities. A just transition towards a low-carbon economy requires a modal shift towards electrification of transportation, heating, and industry, as well as the adoption of sustainable building practices. However, the distributional implications of these changes must be carefully considered to ensure that the benefits are equitably distributed. This study examines the implications of green technologies for environmental justice, with a focus on the distributional justice framework. The results suggest that a well-designed just transition can reduce health disparities and promote environmental justice, but that unequal access to green technologies and benefits can perpetuate existing inequalities. The study highlights the need for policy interventions that prioritize community engagement, education, and economic support to ensure a fair and equitable transition to a low-carbon economy.", "label": 0}
