{"grounding": "Brine contains cations such as K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Li+, B3+, Rb2+, and Cs2+, as well as anions such as SO4\n2\u2212, Cl\u2212, HCO3\n\u2212, CO3\n2\u2212, NO3\n\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212, which are valuable elements. Brines are widely distributed in salt lakes in the world's three enormous plateaus and beyond and are classified into three types: sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines. Sulfate-type brine forms in salt lakes, whereas carbonate-type brine results from magmatic and hydrothermal activity. Chloride-type brine forms in deep basins due to the reduction and transformation of buried brine. Li in brine plays a critical role in clean energy transitions, and K in brine is important for potash production. Recently, new techniques for extracting Li from brine have been developed, and the large-scale, comprehensive development pattern of brines has formed the basis for a recycling economic model, which contributes to the efficient use of brines for potash and Li2CO3 development and CO2 emission reduction. This article reviews the genesis of brines and highlights new utilization techniques, trends, and sustainable development.", "generated_text": "Brine, a high-salinity water solution, is a ubiquitous resource found in salt lakes and salt domes worldwide. The formation of brine is a complex process involving geological, geochemical, and hydrological factors. This review aims to provide an overview of the genesis of brine and its sustainable recovery as a valuable resource. Brine is a significant source of potash and lithium, essential minerals for various industrial applications. The processing techniques employed to recover these minerals from brine are crucial for their comprehensive utilization. Recent advances in membrane technology, solvent extraction, and electrochemical methods have improved the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of brine processing. However, the environmental and social impacts of brine recovery must be carefully considered to ensure sustainable development. This review highlights the current state of brine formation, processing, and utilization, and discusses the challenges and opportunities for sustainable brine recovery worldwide. By exploring the complexities of brine genesis and processing, this review aims to contribute to the development of innovative and environmentally responsible brine management strategies.", "label": 1}
