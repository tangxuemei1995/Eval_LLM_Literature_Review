{"grounding": "Groundwater deterioration due to enrichment with contaminants of either geogenic or anthropogenic origin has adversely affected safe water supply for drinking and irrigation, with pervasive impacts on human health and ecosystem functions. However, the spatiotemporal evolution and public health effects of groundwater quality remain unclarified, posing a grand challenge for the safe and sustainable supply of global groundwater resources. This article provides a state-of-the-art review of the complexity and dynamics of groundwater quality, as well as the impacts of various groundwater substances on human health. In particular, knowledge is growing about the health impacts of key substances ranging from nutritional elements (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+) to pollutants (e.g., heavy metals/metalloids, persistent organic pollutants, and emerging contaminants) and, further, to pathogenic microorganisms to which the human body can be exposed through multiple patterns of groundwater use. Proliferating concerns at the same time call for enhancing science-based governance directives, economic policies, and management strategies coordinating groundwater quality. We propose that safeguarding groundwater-dependent public health needs concerted efforts in source control, cross-scale rehabilitation, and social hydrology-based groundwater governance.", "generated_text": "Groundwater is a vital source of drinking water for millions of people worldwide, yet its quality is increasingly threatened by geogenic contaminants and emerging pollutants. This study examines the impact of geogenic contaminants and key substances on groundwater quality and human health. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that geogenic contaminants, such as heavy metals and radionuclides, can have severe health consequences, including cancer and neurological damage. Emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, are also being detected in groundwater, posing significant risks to human health. Sustainable groundwater management practices, including monitoring, remediation, and protection, are essential to mitigate these risks. This study highlights the need for integrated approaches to manage groundwater quality, incorporating both technical and non-technical strategies to ensure safe and sustainable water supplies. By understanding the complex relationships between groundwater quality, geogenic contaminants, and human health, policymakers and practitioners can develop effective strategies to protect this vital resource.", "label": 1}
