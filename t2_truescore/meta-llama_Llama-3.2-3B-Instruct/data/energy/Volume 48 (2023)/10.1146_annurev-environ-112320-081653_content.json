{"grounding": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) impact lakes, estuaries, and freshwater reservoirs worldwide. The duration, severity, and spread of CyanoHABs have markedly increased over the past decades and will likely continue to increase. This article addresses the universal phenomena of cyanobacterial blooms occurring in many freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Based on analysis of ecophysiological traits of bloom-forming cyanobacteria and their interactions with environmental processes, we summarize and decipher the driving forces leading to the initiation, outbreak, and persistence of the blooms. Due to the coupling effects of eutrophication, rising CO2 levels and global warming, a multidisciplinary joint research approach is critical for better understanding the CyanoHAB phenomenon and its prediction, remediation, and prevention. There is an urgent need to evaluate and guide proper use of bloom control techniques at large scales, using science-based and environmentally friendly approaches.", "generated_text": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) pose a significant threat to freshwater ecosystems worldwide, exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication. These blooms are characterized by the rapid growth of cyanobacteria, resulting in the production of cyanotoxins that can be toxic to humans, animals, and plants. The biological traits of HCBs, including their ability to fix nitrogen and produce secondary metabolites, contribute to their persistence and spread. Climate change and eutrophication create ideal conditions for HCBs, leading to increased blooms and associated risks. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying HCBs, including nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and toxin production. It also discusses the risks associated with HCBs, including human health impacts and ecosystem damage. Finally, this review examines control strategies, including nutrient management, algaecides, and biological control agents, to mitigate the impacts of HCBs on freshwater ecosystems.", "label": 1}
