{"grounding": "Visions of planting walls of trees to block the expansion of the desert have long been promoted but never realized. The green wall myth persists today even though it is premised on outdated understandings of desertification. We review the history of the idea of green walls and focus on two sets of contemporary initiatives to assess their outcomes: peri-Saharan programs (Algeria's Green Dam and Great Green Wall in sub-Saharan Africa) and China's Three Norths Shelterbelt Program. This review reveals a mixed record of technical success with low rates of the establishment of monocultures of fast-growing trees vulnerable to disease. While there is evidence for reduced wind erosion in some areas, afforestation is also associated with reduced soil moisture and lowering of water tables. Social impacts include increased water scarcity for people and livestock in some cases, and resource enclosures that particularly work against pastoralist livelihoods.", "generated_text": "Great Green Walls (GGWs) are large-scale ecological restoration initiatives aimed at combating desertification and improving livelihoods in arid and semi-arid regions. Despite their widespread adoption, the scientific community has raised concerns regarding the efficacy and sustainability of GGWs. This review synthesizes existing literature on the environmental, social, and economic implications of GGWs in the Sahel region of Algeria and the Chinese drylands. Our analysis reveals that while GGWs can provide short-term benefits in terms of soil erosion control and increased vegetation cover, their long-term effectiveness is often hindered by factors such as inadequate funding, insufficient community engagement, and limited scientific understanding of the complex interactions between vegetation, soil, and climate. Furthermore, the environmental rehabilitation of degraded lands through GGWs may not necessarily address the root causes of desertification, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and integrated approach to addressing these complex environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
