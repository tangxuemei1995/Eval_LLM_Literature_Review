{"grounding": "Urban overheating is the most documented phenomenon of climate change impacting humans. This article presents the most recent developments on the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating and the potential synergies with global climatic change. It analyses the latest qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of higher urban temperatures on buildings\u2019 energy supply and demand, heat-related mortality, morbidity and wellbeing, human productivity, survivability of low-income populations, and environmental quality of cities. It describes the state of the art on the development of innovative mitigation materials, advanced urban greenery, heat dissipation, and evaporative techniques as the main mitigation and adaptation technologies to offset the impact of urban overheating. It also analyses the current knowledge on the impact of each mitigation technology on energy, health, environmental quality, urban economy, and survivability. Finally, this article presents the main future challenges related to urban overheating and proposes a specific research agenda to alleviate and counterbalance its impact on human life.", "generated_text": "Urban overheating, a pressing issue in contemporary cities, refers to the excessive increase in temperature within urban areas compared to surrounding rural regions. This phenomenon is primarily caused by the urban heat island (UHI) effect, where built-up environments and human activities lead to the concentration of heat. The magnitude of urban overheating varies globally, with cities in tropical and subtropical regions experiencing the most severe temperatures. The impact of overheating is multifaceted, affecting human health, energy consumption, and urban infrastructure. Mitigation strategies, such as green infrastructure, cool pavements, and urban planning, can reduce the urban heat island effect. Adaptation measures, including heat-resilient design and climate-resilient urban planning, are also essential. However, future challenges, including climate change, population growth, and urbanization, will necessitate innovative and integrated approaches to address the complex issue of urban overheating, ensuring sustainable and livable cities for generations to come.", "label": 0}
