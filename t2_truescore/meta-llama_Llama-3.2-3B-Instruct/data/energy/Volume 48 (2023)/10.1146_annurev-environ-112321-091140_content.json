{"grounding": "Renewable electricity generation will need to be rapidly scaled to address climate change and other environmental challenges. Doing so effectively will require an understanding of resource availability. We review estimates for renewable electricity of the global technical potential, defined as the amount of electricity that could be produced with current technologies when accounting for geographical and technical limitations as well as conversion efficiencies; economic potential, which also includes cost; and feasible potential, which accounts for societal and environmental constraints. We consider utility-scale and rooftop solar photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind, hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean (wave, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion, and salinity gradient energy) technologies. We find that the reported technical potential for each energy resource ranges over several orders of magnitude across and often within technologies. Therefore, we also discuss the main factors explaining why authors find such different results. According to this review and on the basis of the most robust studies, we find that technical potentials for utility-scale solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore wind, and offshore wind are above 100 PWh/year. Hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean thermal energy conversion have technical potentials above 10 PWh/year. Rooftop solar photovoltaic, wave, and tidal have technical potentials above 1 PWh/year. Salinity gradient has a technical potential above 0.1 PWh/year. The literature assessing the global economic potential of renewables, which considers the cost of each renewable resource, shows that the economic potential is higher than current and near-future electricity demand. Fewer studies have calculated the global feasible potential, which considers societal and environmental constraints. While these ranges are useful for assessing the magnitude of available energy sources, they may omit challenges for large-scale renewable portfolios.", "generated_text": "The increasing demand for electricity worldwide has led to a growing interest in renewable energy sources as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. This study examines the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity, focusing on various technologies such as solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. A comprehensive review of existing literature and data was conducted to assess the technical potential of each technology, considering factors such as resource availability, capacity factors, and energy conversion efficiencies. The economic potential was evaluated based on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the potential for job creation and economic growth. The feasible potential was assessed considering the current policy and regulatory frameworks, as well as the availability of financing mechanisms. The results show that the technical potential of renewable electricity is substantial, with solar PV and wind energy being the most promising technologies. The economic potential is also significant, with the LCOE of solar PV and wind energy decreasing dramatically over the past decade. However, the feasible potential is limited by the current policy and regulatory frameworks, which often favor fossil fuels. The study highlights the need for policy reforms and investments in renewable energy infrastructure to unlock the full potential of renewable electricity and achieve a low-carbon energy system. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and industry stakeholders seeking to transition to a renewable energy-based economy.", "label": 1}
