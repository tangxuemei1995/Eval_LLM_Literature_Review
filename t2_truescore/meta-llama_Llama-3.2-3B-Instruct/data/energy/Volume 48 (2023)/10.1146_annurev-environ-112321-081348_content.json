{"grounding": "Increased conservation action to protect more habitat and species is fueling a vigorous debate about the relative effectiveness of different sorts of protected areas. Here we review the literature that compares the effectiveness of protected areas managed by states and areas managed by Indigenous peoples and/or local communities. We argue that these can be hard comparisons to make. Robust comparative case studies are rare, and the epistemic communities producing them are fractured by language, discipline, and geography. Furthermore the distinction between these different forms of protection on the ground can be blurred. We also have to be careful about the value of this sort of comparison as the consequences of different forms of conservation for people and nonhuman nature are messy and diverse. Measures of effectiveness, moreover, focus on specific dimensions of conservation performance, which can omit other important dimensions. With these caveats, we report on findings observed by multiple study groups focusing on different regions and issues whose reports have been compiled into this article. There is a tendency in the data for community-based or co-managed governance arrangements to produce beneficial outcomes for people and nature. These arrangements are often accompanied by struggles between rural groups and powerful states. Findings are highly context specific and global generalizations have limited value.", "generated_text": "Effective governance is crucial for the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity in protected areas and indigenous and locally managed areas. This study examines the relationship between governance and conservation effectiveness in these areas. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from 20 protected areas and 15 indigenous and locally managed areas in a tropical region. The results show that strong governance structures, including clear policies, effective institutions, and community engagement, are positively correlated with conservation effectiveness. However, the study also highlights the challenges of implementing effective governance in these areas, including limited resources, corruption, and conflicting interests. The findings suggest that a more nuanced approach to governance, one that takes into account the unique cultural and social contexts of these areas, is needed to achieve sustainable conservation outcomes. The study's results have implications for conservation practitioners, policymakers, and researchers seeking to improve governance and conservation effectiveness in protected areas and indigenous and locally managed areas. Ultimately, the study demonstrates the importance of effective governance in achieving conservation goals and promoting sustainable development in these critical ecosystems.", "label": 0}
