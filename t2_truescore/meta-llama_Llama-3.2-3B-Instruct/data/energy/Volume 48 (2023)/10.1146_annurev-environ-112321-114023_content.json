{"grounding": "Global agreement on 30\u00d730 means an unprecedented last push to define how much nature will be left on the planet. At the same time that space for nature is being defined, climate change will be moving nature around. Species are now on the move to track climate change both on land and in the oceans, a process that is accelerating under dramatic new extreme events. This is an opportune time to review conservation recommendations made early in the millennium, to see how many have been taken on board over the past 20 years, and how much is left to be done to adapt to climate change as conservation pushes toward 30\u00d730. The history of Climate Change\u2013Integrated Conservation Strategies begins with two papers published by a group of prominent climate change biologists in 2002. The importance of including adaptation to climate change in conservation was underscored by the first estimates of extinction risk due to climate change in 2004. Subsequent literature has developed concepts such as velocity of climate change and assisted migration. Regional modeling of biodiversity change, expanding protected areas to facilitate species range movements, and managing productive landscapes to facilitate species movements are all now considered \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for conservation planning for climate change. Regional coordination of conservation efforts to ensure that species on the move are managed for climate change consistently across their range, on the other hand, is under-represented in literature and practice. Improving both theory and practice of regional coordination for climate change is an important priority for conservation now and in the future. Conservation for climate change has focused mostly on warming scenarios, but failure to act on climate change emissions reduction means that meeting Paris Agreement targets will almost certainly have to include both warming past those targets and subsequent cooling back to the target. Managing this double transition is a second critical point of emphasis for climate change biology as the world moves to 30\u00d730.", "generated_text": "The 30\u00d730 initiative, launched in 2021, aims to protect 30% of the world's land and sea by 2030 to address the pressing issue of climate change. This ambitious goal is rooted in the understanding that climate change is a pressing global threat, with far-reaching consequences for biodiversity, ecosystems, and human societies. The history of climate change is marked by decades of scientific research, policy development, and conservation efforts, which have collectively highlighted the need for integrated conservation strategies. These strategies must account for the impacts of climate change on species on the move, including migration patterns, habitat shifts, and population dynamics. The 30\u00d730 initiative recognizes the importance of regional coordination and systematic conservation planning in addressing the complex and interconnected challenges of climate change. By protecting and restoring natural habitats, conserving biodiversity, and promoting ecosystem resilience, the 30\u00d730 initiative seeks to build a more sustainable future for all. Climate change biology plays a critical role in informing conservation efforts, as it provides insights into the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and species. This paper provides an overview of the history and future of climate change-integrated conservation strategies, highlighting the key challenges, opportunities, and successes of the 30\u00d730 initiative. It also explores the role of climate change biology in informing conservation efforts and the potential for regional coordination and systematic conservation planning to address the complex challenges of climate change. By examining the intersection of conservation and climate change, this paper aims to contribute to the development of effective and sustainable conservation strategies for the 30\u00d730 goal.", "label": 0}
