{"grounding": "For millennia, agriculture has been shaping landscapes on Earth. Technological change has increased agricultural productivity dramatically, especially in the past six decades, but also resulted in trade-offs such as land and soil degradation, emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and spreading of toxic substances. In this article we review the impacts of agriculture on the world's arable land. We start by synthesizing information on the extent of arable land and associated agricultural practices, followed by a review of the state of the art of soil health and soil carbon. We review processes of land degradation, emission of GHGs, and threats to biodiversity. To conclude, we review key social and economic aspects of arable land and identify some important concerns for the future. The article ends on a positive note describing a potential new pathway for agriculture\u2014to gradually adopt polycultures of novel perennial grain crops.", "generated_text": "The world's arable land is facing unprecedented threats, with widespread land degradation and habitat loss compromising global food security and biodiversity. This study examines the current state of the world's arable land, focusing on the impact of land use on greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Our analysis reveals that intensive agricultural practices are leading to significant soil erosion and nutrient depletion, resulting in reduced soil carbon stocks and increased greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, sustainable land use practices, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture, can enhance soil carbon sequestration and mitigate climate change. We also explore the economic implications of land degradation on rural economies, highlighting the need for policy interventions to promote sustainable land use and support rural livelihoods. Our findings underscore the urgent need for a paradigm shift in land use practices to ensure the long-term health of the world's arable land and mitigate the impacts of climate change.", "label": 0}
