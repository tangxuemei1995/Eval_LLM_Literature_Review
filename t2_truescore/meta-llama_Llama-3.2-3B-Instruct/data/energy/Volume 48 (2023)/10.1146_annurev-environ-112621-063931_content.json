{"grounding": "Getting to net-zero-carbon cities while advancing well-being (W), health (H), social equity (E), and climate resilience (R) (referred to as the WHER outcomes) is critical for local and global sustainability. However, science is nascent on the linkages between zero-carbon pathways and WHER outcomes. This article presents a transboundary urban metabolism framework, rooted in seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems, to connect urban decarbonization strategies with WHER outcomes. Applying the framework along with a literature review, we find the evidence for co-beneficial decarbonization to be strong for health; limited for well-being; uncertain for resilience; and requiring intentional design to advance equity, including distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects. We describe the evidence base, identify key knowledge gaps, and delineate broad parameters of a new urban nexus science to enable zero-carbon urban transitions with WHER co-benefits. We highlight the need for fine-scale data encompassing all seven sectors across scales, along with multiple and multiscale climate risks, accompanied by next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models.", "generated_text": "This study examines the nexus linkages between zero-carbon urban transitions, health, climate resilience, and equity co-benefits. By analyzing the intersections of urban metabolism, sustainable development goals, and the health-climate-resilience nexus, this research assesses the potential for decarbonization to enhance urban well-being while promoting equity and resilience. A mixed-methods approach combining literature reviews, stakeholder interviews, and case studies is employed to investigate the relationships between urban planning, energy systems, transportation, and waste management. The findings highlight the importance of integrating health, climate, and equity considerations into urban planning strategies to achieve sustainable development goals. The study demonstrates that zero-carbon urban transitions can co-benefit health, climate resilience, and equity, and provides recommendations for policymakers and urban practitioners to design more resilient, equitable, and sustainable cities. The research contributes to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the nexus linkages between urban transitions, health, climate resilience, and equity co-benefits.", "label": 1}
