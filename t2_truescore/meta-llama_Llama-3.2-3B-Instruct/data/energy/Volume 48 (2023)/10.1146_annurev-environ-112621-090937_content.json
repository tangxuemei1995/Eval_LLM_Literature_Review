{"grounding": "Fungi comprise approximately 20% of all eukaryotic species and are connected to virtually all life forms on Earth. Yet, their diversity remains contentious, their distribution elusive, and their conservation neglected. We aim to flip this situation by synthesizing current knowledge. We present a revised estimate of 2\u20133 million fungal species with a \u201cbest estimate\u201d at 2.5 million. To name the unknown >90% of these by the end of this century, we propose recognition of species known only from DNA data and call for large-scale sampling campaigns. We present an updated global map of fungal richness, highlighting tropical and temperate ecoregions of high diversity. We call for further Red List assessments and enhanced management guidelines to aid fungal conservation. Given that fungi play an inseparable role in our lives and in all ecosystems, and considering the fascinating questions remaining to be answered, we argue that fungi constitute the next frontier of biodiversity research.", "generated_text": "This study contributes to the expanding knowledge of fungal biodiversity by investigating the global diversity, distribution, and conservation of fungi across the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Utilizing metabarcoding techniques, we analyzed fungal communities from diverse ecosystems, revealing a vast array of endemic species and highlighting the underrepresentation of early diverging fungi. Our findings indicate a significant disparity in the fungus:plant ratio, with implications for ecosystem functioning and plant-fungal interactions. The results also underscore the need for conservation efforts, as many fungal species are threatened or endangered, necessitating the implementation of in situ and ex situ conservation strategies. In line with the IUCN Red List, our study emphasizes the importance of protecting fungal diversity, which is intricately linked to the health of ecosystems and the planet as a whole. By advancing our understanding of fungal biodiversity, this research provides a foundation for evidence-based conservation initiatives and underscores the urgent need for fungal conservation.", "label": 1}
