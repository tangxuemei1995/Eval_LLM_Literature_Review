{"grounding": "Qualitative research methods examine a wide range of topics in the study of environment and resource management. This first review on the topic highlights innovative and impactful research over the past few decades, drawing from social science disciplines that include sociology, geography, anthropology, political science, public policy, and psychology. We describe qualitative research methods that have addressed five scientific goals: (a) describing what the world is like, (b) predicting what the world can be like, (c) acknowl-edging researcher positionality and reflexivity and diversifying ways of knowing in theorizing and research designs, (d) integrating imaginaries into empirical research and building narratives to make sense of possible futures and to broaden our view of scientific inquiry, and (e) helping scholars grapple with the deep complexity of socioecological systems. As we explore these themes, we explain foundational qualitative approaches and highlight examples of environmental qualitative research that apply them.", "generated_text": "This study synthesizes recent advances in qualitative methods in environmental research, with a focus on participatory approaches and socioecological systems. Climate change has underscored the need for nuanced, context-specific research methods that capture the complexities of human-environment interactions. Participatory research methods, such as co-design and co-production, have emerged as key strategies for engaging stakeholders and fostering collaborative knowledge production. By integrating insights from environmental sociology, ecology, and anthropology, this review highlights the potential of qualitative methods to elucidate the socioecological dynamics underlying environmental issues. The findings suggest that qualitative methods can provide rich, contextualized understandings of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies, informing evidence-based policy and practice. The review also underscores the importance of considering the epistemological and methodological implications of climate change research, and the need for continued innovation and collaboration in the development of qualitative methods for environmental research.", "label": 0}
