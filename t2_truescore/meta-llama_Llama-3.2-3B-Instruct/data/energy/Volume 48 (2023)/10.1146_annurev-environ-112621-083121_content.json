{"grounding": "The few percent of soil organic carbon (SOC) among mineral components form the interface of climate, plant growth, soil biological processes, physical transport infrastructure, and chemical transformations. We explore maps, models, myths, motivation, means of implementation, and modalities for transformation. Theories of place relate geographic variation in SOC to climate, soil types, land cover, and profile depth. Process-level theories of biophysical change and socioeconomic theories of induced change explain SOC transitions that follow from land use change when a declining curve is bent and recovery toward SOC saturation starts. While the desirability of recovering from SOC deficits has been mainstreamed into climate policy, the effectiveness of proposed measures taken remains contested. Process-level requirements for transitions at plot and landscape scales remain uncertain. Expectations of policy-induced SOC transitions have to align with national cross-sectoral C accounting and be managed realistically with land users (farmers) and commodity supply chains (private sector, consumers).", "generated_text": "Soils play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, serving as both carbon stores and sinks. This review synthesizes existing knowledge on the expectations, patterns, processes, and prospects of transitions in soil carbon dynamics, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation. We examine the implications of decomposition, litter, and root turnover on soil carbon sequestration, highlighting the importance of soil health and mapping in informing climate policy. The Century and Millennial models are discussed in relation to their limitations and potential applications in predicting soil carbon changes. Our analysis reveals that effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies require a comprehensive understanding of soil carbon dynamics, including the role of decomposition, litter, and root turnover. By integrating soil mapping and monitoring, we can better anticipate and respond to transitions in soil carbon stores and sinks, ultimately supporting more effective climate policy and sustainable land management practices.", "label": 0}
