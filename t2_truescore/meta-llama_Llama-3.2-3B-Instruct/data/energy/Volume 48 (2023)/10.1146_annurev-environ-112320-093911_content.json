{"grounding": "Food demand is projected to increase significantly over the coming decades. Sustainable intensification (SI) is essential to meet this demand. SI is particularly important in smallholder systems, yet to date it remains unclear what the most promising SI strategies are to increase food production and farmer incomes at scale. We review the literature on SI to identify the most promising strategies, as manifest in replicated findings of favorable causal impacts. Adoption of improved cultivars generated the largest, most consistent, positive yield and economic outcomes. Two agroecological practices, push-pull systems and the System of Rice Intensification, also repeatedly led to large positive impacts. These strategies have considerable potential to scale to reach more than 50% of smallholder farmers who plant staple crops. Significant barriers to adoption remain, however, and identifying ways to overcome barriers to scale these successful strategies will be critical to meeting Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 by 2030.", "generated_text": "Sustainable intensification of smallholder agricultural systems is crucial for enhancing food production and improving livelihoods in the Global South. This review synthesizes evidence on various strategies, including the adoption of improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and System of Rice Intensification (SRI), to promote sustainable intensification. Staple crops, such as maize, wheat, and rice, are often targeted for intensification. The review highlights the potential of these strategies to increase crop yields, reduce post-harvest losses, and improve water and nutrient use efficiency. Push-pull systems, which combine the use of insecticides and crop rotation, have shown promise in reducing pest pressure and improving crop productivity. SRI, which emphasizes conservation agriculture practices, has been successful in improving soil health and reducing water usage. The review also notes the importance of integrating these strategies with other approaches, such as agroforestry and climate-smart agriculture, to achieve sustainable intensification. Overall, the evidence suggests that a combination of these strategies can contribute to more sustainable and resilient smallholder agricultural systems.", "label": 1}
