{"grounding": "Energy equity and justice have become priority considerations for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars alike. To ensure that energy equity is incorporated into actual decisions and analysis, it is necessary to design, use, and continually improve energy equity metrics. In this article, we review the literature and practices surrounding such metrics. We present a working definition for energy justice and equity, and connect them to both criteria for and frameworks of metrics. We then present a large sampling of energy equity metrics, including those focused on vulnerability, wealth creation, energy poverty, life cycle, and comparative country-level dynamics.We conclude with a discussion of the limitations, gaps, and trade-offs associated with these various metrics and their interactions thereof.", "generated_text": "This study examines the development of metrics for decision-making in energy justice, a critical aspect of achieving distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining literature reviews, stakeholder interviews, and expert consultations. The findings highlight the need for metrics that account for the intersectional impacts of energy policies on vulnerable populations. A proposed framework, 'Energy Justice Metrics' (EJM), is introduced, incorporating indicators of energy equity, environmental justice, and social justice. The EJM framework provides a structured approach to evaluating the distributive, procedural, and recognition justice implications of energy decisions, enabling more informed decision-making and promoting energy justice. The study's contributions have significant implications for energy policy development and implementation.", "label": 0}
