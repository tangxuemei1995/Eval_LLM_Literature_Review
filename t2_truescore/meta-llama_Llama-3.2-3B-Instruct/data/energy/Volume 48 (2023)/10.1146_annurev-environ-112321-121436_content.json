{"grounding": "Since the early 2000s, many private companies, public-private coalitions, and governments have committed to remove deforestation from commodity supply chains. Despite these zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs), high rates of deforestation persist and may even be increasing. On the upside, a few region- and commodity-specific ZDCs have contributed to reductions by up to hundreds of thousands of hectares of deforestation, with mixed evidence on associated leakage. ZDCs have also spurred progress in monitoring, traceability, and awareness of deforestation. On the downside, as currently implemented, supply chain initiatives only cover a small share of tropical deforestation. Government- and company-led ZDCs are just two components of broader policy mixes aimed at reducing deforestation. To be more impactful, ZDCs needs to cover entire biomes, supply bases of companies, and export and domestic markets, with special attention not to exclude marginal producers.", "generated_text": "This study examines the feasibility of deforestation-free commodity supply chains, a concept increasingly promoted as a key strategy for achieving sustainable land use and mitigating deforestation. A comprehensive review of existing literature on forest governance, policy mix, and land use practices reveals that while some companies have made significant progress in sourcing commodities without contributing to deforestation, the reality remains complex and context-dependent. The findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between policy, market, and social factors in driving deforestation-free practices. The study's results have implications for policymakers, companies, and civil society organizations seeking to promote sustainable land use and reduce deforestation, and underscore the importance of continued research and collaboration in this critical area.", "label": 1}
