{"grounding": "Coastal systems are sensitive to direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Approximately 90% of all coastal areas will be affected by climate change to varying degrees. Nearly half of the world's major cities are located within 50 km of a coast, and coastal population densities are 2.6 times greater than those of inland areas, with a steep rise over the years. While coastal critical infrastructure is expanding, more social and physical systems are increasingly exposed to climate-induced hazards. The interconnectedness and interdependencies of critical infrastructure systems increase their systemic instability and fragility, resulting in greater dynamic risk and cascading impacts. Coastal critical infrastructure systems on several continents are at risk from the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events. Therefore, it is necessary to build and run climate-resilient infrastructure that is planned, designed, implemented, and operated to predict, be prepared for, and adapt to changing climatic circumstances. This review provides an up-to-date, objective, and critical assessment based on the literature to help determine what is known and what needs the future attention of researchers.", "generated_text": "Climate change poses significant threats to coastal critical infrastructure, compromising the resilience of essential services and facilities that underpin regional economies and communities. Rising sea levels, increased storm frequency, and more intense coastal erosion events create a complex landscape of cascading hazards that can have devastating consequences for critical infrastructure. This study examines the intersection of climate change and coastal critical infrastructure, with a focus on the risks associated with cascading hazards. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to climate-related disruptions is exacerbated by factors such as aging infrastructure, inadequate maintenance, and insufficient emergency preparedness. The findings of this research highlight the need for proactive measures to enhance the resilience of coastal critical infrastructure, including the implementation of climate-informed design and construction practices, enhanced emergency preparedness and response protocols, and the development of adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of cascading hazards. By addressing these risks, policymakers and infrastructure managers can work towards creating more resilient and sustainable coastal critical infrastructure that can withstand the challenges of a changing climate.", "label": 1}
