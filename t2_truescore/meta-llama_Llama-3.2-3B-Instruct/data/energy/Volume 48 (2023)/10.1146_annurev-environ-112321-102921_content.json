{"grounding": "Buildings are key in supporting human activities and well-being by providing shelter and other important services to their users. Buildings are, however, also responsible for major energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during their life cycle. Improving the quality of services provided by buildings while reaching low energy demand (LED) levels is crucial for climate and sustainability targets. Building sector models have become essential tools for decision support on strategies to reduce energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet current models have significant limitations in their ability to assess the transformations required for LED. We review building sector models ranging from the subnational to the global scale to identify best practices and critical gaps in representing transformations toward LED futures. We focus on three key dimensions of intervention (socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological), three megatrends (digitalization, sharing economy, and circular economy), and decent living standards. This review recommends the model developments needed to better assess LED transformations in buildings and support decision-making toward sustainability targets.", "generated_text": "The built environment is a significant contributor to global energy demand, with residential and commercial buildings accounting for approximately 40% of total energy consumption. As climate change mitigation efforts intensify, there is a pressing need to model low energy demand futures for buildings to inform policy and investment decisions. This review synthesizes current state-of-the-art approaches to modeling building energy demand, with a focus on scenarios development and energy demand transformation. We identify key megatrends, including electrification of transportation, smart grids, and building information modeling, that are driving the transformation of the built environment. Our analysis highlights the importance of integrating climate change mitigation goals with building energy demand modeling to achieve decent living standards while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Future research directions are outlined, including the development of more sophisticated scenarios development methodologies and the integration of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to enhance the accuracy and applicability of building energy demand models.", "label": 0}
