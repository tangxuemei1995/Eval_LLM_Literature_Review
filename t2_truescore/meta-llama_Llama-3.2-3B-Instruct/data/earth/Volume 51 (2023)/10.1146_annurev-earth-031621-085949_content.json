{"grounding": "Carbonate minerals contain stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen with different masses whose abundances and bond arrangement are governed by thermodynamics. The clumped isotopic value \u0394i is a measure of the temperature-dependent preference of heavy C and O isotopes to clump, or bond with or near each other, rather than with light isotopes in the carbonate phase. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry uses \u0394i values measured by mass spectrometry (\u039447, \u039448) or laser spectroscopy (\u0394638) to reconstruct mineral growth temperature in surface and subsurface environments independent of parent water isotopic composition. Two decades of analytical and theoretical development have produced a mature temperature proxy that can estimate carbonate formation temperatures from 0.5 to 1,100\u00b0C, with up to 1\u20132\u00b0C external precision (2 standard error of the mean). Alteration of primary environmental temperatures by fluid-mediated and solid-state reactions and/or \u0394i values that reflect nonequilibrium isotopic fractionations reveal diagenetic history and/or mineralization processes. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has contributed significantly to geological and biological sciences, and it is poised to advance understanding of Earth's climate system, crustal processes, and growth environments of carbonate minerals.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tClumped heavy isotopes in carbonate minerals record robust temperatures and fluid compositions of ancient Earth surface and subsurface environments.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMature analytical methods enable carbonate clumped \u039447, \u039448, and \u0394638 measurements to address diverse questions in geological and biological sciences.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThese methods are poised to advance marine and terrestrial paleoenvironment and paleoclimate, tectonics, deformation, hydrothermal, and mineralization studies.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry (CCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for reconstructing paleotemperatures in geological systems, offering a more precise and robust alternative to traditional stable isotope methods. By analyzing the clumped isotopic composition of carbonates, researchers can infer temperature conditions under which these minerals formed. Recent advances in CCT have expanded its applications to a wide range of geological settings, including sedimentary basins, hydrothermal systems, and metamorphic terranes. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge in CCT, highlighting its theoretical foundations, analytical techniques, and applications in various fields of geochemistry. The review also discusses the limitations and challenges associated with CCT, including the need for high-precision measurements and the potential for contamination and degradation of clumped isotopes. Furthermore, the review explores the potential of CCT to integrate with other geochemical and geophysical methods, enabling more comprehensive understanding of complex geological systems. By examining the frontiers of CCT, this review aims to provide a framework for future research and development of this rapidly evolving field, ultimately advancing our understanding of Earth's thermal evolution and the geological processes that shape our planet.", "label": 1}
