{"grounding": "The continental crust in the overriding plate of the India-Asia collision zone in southern Tibet is characterized by an overthickened layer of felsic composition with an underlying granulite-eclogite layer. A large data set indicates that this crust experienced magmatism from 245 to 10 Ma, as recorded by the Gangdese Batholith. Magmatism was punctuated by flare-ups at 185\u2212170, 90\u221275, and 55\u221245 Ma caused by a combination of external and internal factors. The growth of this crust starts with a period dominated by fractional crystallization and the formation of voluminous (ultra)mafic arc cumulates in the lower crust during subduction, followed by their melting during late-subduction and collision, due to changes in convergence rate. This combined accumulation-melting process resulted in the vertical stratification and density sorting of the Gangdese crust. Comparisons with other similarly thickened collision zones suggests that this is a general process that leads to the stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records the time-integrated development of the world's thickest crust, reaching greater than 50 km at 55\u201345 Ma and greater than 70 km after 32 Ma.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records three magmatic flare-ups in response to distinct drivers; the last one at 55\u221245 Ma marks the arrival of India.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMagmatism was first dominated by fractional crystallization (accumulation) followed by crustal melting: the accumulation-melting process.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tAccumulation-melting in other collision zones provides a general process for vertical stratification and stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Gangdese Batholith, a large igneous complex in southern Tibet, provides a unique window into the continental crustal growth processes that occurred during the Indian-Eurasian collision. This collision, which began approximately 50 million years ago, resulted in the formation of the Himalayan mountain range and the thickening of the Indian crust. The Gangdese Batholith, a magmatic arc that formed in response to this collision, exhibits a complex stratification of crustal rocks, including granites, gabbros, and basalts. Geochemical and petrological analysis of the batholith's rocks reveal a distinct crustal growth process, characterized by the incremental addition of magma to the crust, followed by the emplacement of granitic rocks. This process, known as crustal accretion, resulted in the formation of a thickened crust that was later deformed and metamorphosed during the collision. The Gangdese Batholith's crustal growth process is also reflected in its stratigraphic structure, which shows a clear sequence of crustal formation and deformation. The study of the Gangdese Batholith provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of continental crustal growth and the geological processes that shape the Earth's surface during periods of intense tectonic activity. By understanding these processes, researchers can better comprehend the complex geological history of the Himalayan region and the ongoing effects of the Indian-Eurasian collision.", "label": 1}
