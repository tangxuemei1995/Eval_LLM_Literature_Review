{"grounding": "An oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals. The early Earth had an anoxic atmosphere, and understanding the rise and maintenance of high O2 levels is critical for investigating what drove our own evolution and for assessing the likely habitability of exoplanets. A growing number of techniques aim to reproduce changes in O2 levels over the Phanerozoic Eon (the past 539 million years). We assess these methods and attempt to draw the reliable techniques together to form a consensus Phanerozoic O2 curve. We conclude that O2 probably made up around 5\u201310% of the atmosphere during the Cambrian and rose in pulses to \u223c15\u201320% in the Devonian, reaching a further peak of greater than 25% in the Permo-Carboniferous before declining toward the present day. Evolutionary radiations in the Cambrian and Ordovician appear consistent with an oxygen driver, and the Devonian \u201cAge of the Fishes\u201d coincides with oxygen rising above 15% atm.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tAn oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals such as humans.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe review the methods for reconstructing past variation in oxygen levels over the past 539 million years (the Phanerozoic Eon).\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe produce a consensus plot of the most likely evolution of atmospheric oxygen levels.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEvolutionary radiations in the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Devonian periods may be linked to rises in oxygen concentration.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels has been a subject of intense debate among scientists, with various theories attempting to explain the significant increase in O2 concentrations over the Phanerozoic eon. This review revisits the current understanding of O2 evolution, integrating recent geochemical and paleontological findings. Our analysis suggests that the oxygenation of the atmosphere was a complex, multi-stage process involving the interplay of various biological and geochemical mechanisms. The earliest evidence of oxygenation dates back to the Neoproterozoic era, approximately 2.7 billion years ago, when oxygen-producing cyanobacteria first emerged. However, it was not until the Cambrian explosion, around 541 million years ago, that oxygen levels began to rise significantly, likely due to the evolution of complex animal life. The development of the carbon cycle and the formation of the modern ocean-atmosphere system also played crucial roles in shaping O2 levels. Our review highlights the importance of considering the geochemical context in which life evolved, and underscores the need for further research into the mechanisms driving O2 evolution. By integrating insights from paleontology, geochemistry, and biology, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this critical process and its implications for the Earth's climate and life on Earth.", "label": 1}
