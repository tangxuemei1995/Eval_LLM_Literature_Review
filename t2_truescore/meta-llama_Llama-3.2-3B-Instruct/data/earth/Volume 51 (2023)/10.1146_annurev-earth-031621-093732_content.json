{"grounding": "Future sea-level rise poses an existential threat for many river deltas, yet quantifying the effect of sea-level changes on these coastal landforms remains a challenge. Sea-level changes have been slow compared to other coastal processes during the instrumental record, such that our knowledge comes primarily from models, experiments, and the geologic record. Here we review the current state of science on river delta response to sea-level change, including models and observations from the Holocene until 2300 CE. We report on improvements in the detection and modeling of past and future regional sea-level change, including a better understanding of the underlying processes and sources of uncertainty. We also see significant improvements in morphodynamic delta models. Still, substantial uncertainties remain, notably on present and future subsidence rates in and near deltas. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern sea-level rise also remain elusive, posing major challenges to model validation.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThere are large differences in the initiation time and subsequent delta progradation during the Holocene, likely from different sea-level and sediment supply histories.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tModern deltas are larger and will face faster sea-level rise than during their Holocene growth, making them susceptible to forced transgression.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tRegional sea-level projections have been much improved in the past decade and now also isolate dominant sources of uncertainty, such as the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tVertical land motion in deltas can be the dominant source of relative sea-level change and the dominant source of uncertainty; limited observations complicate projections.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tRiver deltas globally might lose 5% (\u223c35,000 km2) of their surface area by 2100 and 50% by 2300 due to relative sea-level rise under a high-emission scenario.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "River deltas are complex and dynamic systems that play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, coastal protection, and biodiversity hotspots. However, the increasing frequency and severity of sea-level rise pose a significant threat to the very existence of these ecosystems. This study examines the impact of sea-level rise on river deltas, with a focus on geomorphological changes, sedimentary processes, and shoreline evolution. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that sea-level rise can lead to increased sedimentation, changes in river flow patterns, and coastal erosion, ultimately resulting in the loss of deltaic land and the degradation of ecosystem services. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interplay between climate change, river discharge, and sediment supply in predicting the vulnerability of river deltas to sea-level rise. Geomorphological modeling and sediment transport simulations are used to investigate the effects of sea-level rise on deltaic morphology and shoreline dynamics. The results suggest that river deltas are highly susceptible to sea-level rise, and that early warning systems and adaptive management strategies are essential for mitigating the impacts of climate change on these ecosystems. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex relationships between river deltas, sea-level rise, and climate change, and highlights the need for integrated approaches to managing these ecosystems in the face of global change.", "label": 1}
