{"grounding": "Uncertainty about sea-level rise is dominated by uncertainty about iceberg calving, mass loss from glaciers or ice sheets by fracturing. Review of the rapidly growing calving literature leads to a few overarching hypotheses. Almost all calving occurs near or just downglacier of a location where ice flows into an environment more favorable for calving, so the calving rate is controlled primarily by flow to the ice margin rather than by fracturing. Calving can be classified into five regimes, which tend to be persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations in flow velocity, ice characteristics, or environmental forcing; these regimes can be studied instrumentally. Sufficiently large perturbations may cause sometimes-rapid transitions between regimes or between calving and noncalving behavior, during which fracturing may control the rate of calving. Regime transitions underlie the largest uncertainties in sea-level rise projections, but with few, important exceptions, have not been observed instrumentally. This is especially true of the most important regime transitions for sea-level rise. Process-based models informed by studies of ongoing calving, and assimilation of deep-time paleoclimatic data, may help reduce uncertainties about regime transitions. Failure to include calving accurately in predictive models could lead to large underestimates of warming-induced sea-level rise.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIceberg calving, the breakage of ice from glaciers and ice sheets, affects sea level and many other environmental issues.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tModern rates of iceberg calving usually are controlled by the rate of ice flow past restraining points, not by the brittle calving processes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCalving can be classified into five regimes, which are persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tTransitions between calving regimes are especially important, and with warming might cause faster sea-level rise than generally projected.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Iceberg calving, the process by which large chunks of ice break off from glaciers and ice shelves, plays a critical role in shaping the dynamics of ice sheets and contributing to sea-level rise. This phenomenon is particularly significant in the context of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which are the largest sources of freshwater to the oceans. Research has shown that iceberg calving regimes can be characterized by distinct patterns of calving intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution, which are influenced by a range of factors including climate variability, ice sheet geometry, and ocean-ice interactions. The Greenland ice sheet, for example, has experienced significant calving activity in recent decades, with the Larsen C ice shelf in West Antarctica being a notable example of a rapidly calving ice shelf. In contrast, the Antarctic ice sheet has a more complex calving regime, with both rapid and slow calving events occurring across different regions. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these calving regimes is essential for predicting future changes in ice sheet stability and sea-level rise. This review synthesizes existing research on iceberg calving regimes and transitions, highlighting the key factors that influence calving intensity and frequency, and discussing the implications for ice sheet stability and sea-level rise. By examining the complex interactions between climate, ice sheet geometry, and ocean-ice interactions, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of iceberg calving and its role in shaping the future of the world's ice sheets.", "label": 1}
