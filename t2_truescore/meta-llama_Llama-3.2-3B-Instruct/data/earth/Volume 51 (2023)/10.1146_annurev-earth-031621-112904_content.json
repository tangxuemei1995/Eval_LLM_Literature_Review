{"grounding": "Kimberlite-borne xenolithic eclogites, typically occurring in or near cratons, have long been recognized as remnants of Precambrian subducted oceanic crust that have undergone partial melting to yield granitoids similar to the Archean continental crust. While some eclogitized oceanic crust was emplaced into cratonic lithospheres, the majority was deeply subducted to form lithologic and geochemical heterogeneities in the convecting mantle. If we accept that most xenolithic eclogites originally formed at Earth's surface, then their geodynamic significance encompasses four tectonic environments: (a) spreading ridges, where precursors formed by partial melting of convecting mantle and subsequent melt differentiation; (b) subduction zones, where oceanic crust was metamorphosed and interacted with other slab lithologies; (c) the cratonic mantle lithosphere, where the eclogite source was variably modified subsequent to emplacement in Mesoarchean to Paleoproterozoic time; and (d) the convecting mantle, into which the vast majority of subduction-modified oceanic crust not captured in the cratonic lithosphere was recycled.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tXenolithic eclogites are fragments of ca. 3.0\u20131.8 Ga oceanic crust and signal robust subduction tectonics from the Mesoarchean.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMultiple constraints indicate an origin as variably differentiated oceanic crust, followed by subduction metamorphism, and prolonged mantle residence.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tXenolithic eclogites thus permit investigation of deep geochemical cycles related to recycling of Precambrian oceanic crust.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThey help constrain asthenosphere thermal plus redox evolution and contribute to cratonic physical properties and mineral endowments.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Xenolithic eclogites are enigmatic rocks that exhibit a complex mixture of eclogitic and granulitic facies, often formed through the interaction of kimberlite magmas with the surrounding lithospheric mantle. These rocks provide valuable insights into the paleo-subduction zones and deep geochemical cycles that have shaped the evolution of continents. This review synthesizes the current understanding of petrogenesis and geodynamic significance of xenolithic eclogites, with a focus on their formation mechanisms, geochemical characteristics, and implications for the convecting mantle. Kimberlite-borne xenolithic eclogites are found in various parts of the world, including the Kaapvaal Craton, the Slave Craton, and the Siberian Traps. These rocks exhibit a range of geochemical signatures, from magnesium-rich to aluminum-poor, and display a variety of textures, including eclogitic and granulitic facies. The presence of xenolithic eclogites in these regions suggests that they formed in paleo-subduction zones, where the lithospheric mantle was subjected to high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. The geochemical characteristics of these rocks provide evidence for the deep geochemical cycles that have operated in the convecting mantle, influencing the evolution of continents and the formation of economic deposits. This review highlights the importance of xenolithic eclogites as a window into the Earth's mantle evolution and the deep geochemical cycles that have shaped the Earth's surface.", "label": 0}
