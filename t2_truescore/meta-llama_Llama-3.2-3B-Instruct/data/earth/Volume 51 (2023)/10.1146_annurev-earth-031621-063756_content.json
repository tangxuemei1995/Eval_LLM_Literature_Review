{"grounding": "The strength of lithospheric plates is a central component of plate tectonics, governed by brittle processes in the shallow portion of the plate and ductile behavior in the deeper portion. We review experimental constraints on ductile deformation of olivine, the main mineral in the upper mantle and thus the lithosphere. Olivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (GBS), and diffusion-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (diffusion creep). Deformation in most of the lithosphere is dominated by GBS, except in shear zones\u2014in which diffusion creep dominates\u2014and in the brittle-ductile transition\u2014in which low-temperature plasticity may dominate. We find that observations from naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of the experimentally constrained olivine flow laws to geological conditions but that geophysical observations predict a weaker lithosphere. The causes of this discrepancy are unresolved but likely reside in the uncertainty surrounding processes in the brittle-ductile transition, at which the lithosphere is strongest.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDuctile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is constrained by experimental data for olivine.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tOlivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, and diffusion creep.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tObservations of naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of olivine flow laws from experimental conditions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tExperiments predict stronger lithosphere than geophysical observations, likely due to gaps in constraints on deformation in the brittle-ductile transition.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The lithospheric mantle, a critical component of the Earth's lithosphere, exhibits ductile deformation under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. This deformation is characterized by the plastic flow of minerals, such as olivine, and the resulting strain hardening of the mantle. The deformation mechanisms underlying ductile flow in the lithospheric mantle are complex and involve the interaction of multiple minerals and microstructures. This study investigates the deformation mechanisms of the lithospheric mantle using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. Olivine, a key mineral in the mantle, is subjected to high-pressure and high-temperature conditions to simulate the conditions found in the Earth's mantle. The resulting deformation is characterized by the formation of subgrains and the development of strain hardening. Theoretical models are used to simulate the deformation of the mantle and to understand the role of olivine in controlling the deformation mechanisms. The results of this study provide new insights into the ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle and have implications for our understanding of the Earth's lithospheric evolution. The findings of this research contribute to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the deformation mechanisms underlying the lithospheric mantle and highlight the importance of olivine in controlling the deformation processes.", "label": 1}
