{"grounding": "As atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations rise and climate change becomes more destructive, geoengineering has become a subject of serious consideration. By reflecting a fraction of incoming sunlight, solar geoengineering could cool the planet quickly, but with uncertain effects on regional climatology, particularly hydrological patterns. Here, we review recent work on projected hydrologic outcomes of solar geoengineering, in the context of a robust literature on hydrological responses to climate change. While most approaches to solar geoengineering are expected to weaken the global hydrologic cycle, regional effects will vary based on implementation method and strategy. The literature on the hydrologic outcomes and impacts of geoengineering demonstrates that its implications for human welfare will depend on assumptions about underlying social conditions and objectives of intervention as well as the social lens through which projected effects are interpreted. We conclude with suggestions to reduce decision-relevant uncertainties in this novel field of Earth science inquiry.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe expected hydrological effects of reducing insolation are among the most uncertain and consequential impacts of solar geoengineering (SG).\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tTheoretical frameworks from broader climate science can help explain SG's effects on global precipitation, relative humidity, and other aspects of hydroclimate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe state of the knowledge on hydrological impacts of SG is unevenly concentrated among regions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tProjected hydrological impacts from SG are scenario dependent and difficult to characterize as either harmful or beneficial.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The increasing concern over climate change has led to the exploration of geoengineering as a potential means to mitigate its effects. One such approach is solar geoengineering, which involves modifying solar radiation to reflect a portion of it back into space. This can alter the Earth's energy balance and, in turn, impact the hydrological cycle. Research has shown that solar geoengineering can lead to changes in precipitation patterns, with some studies suggesting a decrease in precipitation in certain regions and an increase in others. The hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering are complex and multifaceted, involving interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces. This study examines the potential hydrological impacts of solar geoengineering, with a focus on the effects on precipitation patterns and water resources. Using a combination of climate models and hydrological simulations, we investigate the potential changes in precipitation and water availability resulting from solar geoengineering. Our results suggest that solar geoengineering could lead to significant changes in the hydrological cycle, with far-reaching implications for water resources and ecosystems. The findings of this study highlight the need for further research into the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering and the development of strategies to mitigate its potential impacts.", "label": 1}
