{"grounding": "Volcanic eruptions are driven by bubbles that form when volatile species exsolve from magma. The conditions under which bubbles form depend mainly on magma composition, volatile concentration, presence of crystals, and magma decompression rate. These are all predicated on the mechanism by which volatiles exsolve from the melt to form bubbles. We critically review the known or inferred mechanisms of bubble formation in magmas: homogeneous nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation on crystal surfaces, and spontaneous phase separation (spinodal decomposition). We propose a general approach for calculating bubble nucleation rates as the sum of the contributions from homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, suggesting that nucleation may not be limited to a single mechanism prior to eruption. We identify three major challenges in which further experimental, analytical, and theoretical work is required to permit the development of a general model for bubble formation under natural eruption conditions.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe review the mechanisms of bubble formation in magma and summarize the conditions under which the various mechanisms are understood to operate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tBubble formation mechanisms may evolve throughout magma ascent as conditions change such that bubbles may form simultaneously and sequentially via more than one mechanism.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tContributions from both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation on multiphase crystal phases can be captured via a single equation.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFuture work should focus on constraining macroscopic surface tension, characterizing the microphysics, and developing a general framework for modeling bubble formation, via all mechanisms, over natural magma ascent pathways.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of bubbles in magma is a critical process that governs the dynamics of volcanic eruptions. This phenomenon is influenced by the interplay between volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, and the physical properties of the magma. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of spinodal decomposition, a thermodynamic process that leads to the formation of stable interfaces between immiscible phases. In this context, the nucleation of bubbles in magma can be viewed as a spinodal decomposition process, where volatiles and magma components interact to form a network of stable interfaces. The resulting bubble dynamics are characterized by complex interactions between buoyancy, viscosity, and surface tension. Experimental and numerical studies have shown that the formation of bubbles in magma is influenced by factors such as magma composition, temperature, and pressure. The study of bubble formation in magma has significant implications for our understanding of volcanic eruptions, including the prediction of eruption styles and the estimation of eruption volumes. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of bubble formation in magma, with a focus on the role of spinodal decomposition and the dynamics of bubble interactions. By integrating experimental and theoretical approaches, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex processes that govern bubble formation in magma.", "label": 1}
