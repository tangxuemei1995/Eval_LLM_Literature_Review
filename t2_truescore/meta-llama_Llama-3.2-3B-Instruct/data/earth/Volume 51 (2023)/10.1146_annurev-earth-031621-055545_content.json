{"grounding": "Planets are expected to conclude their growth through a series of giant impacts: energetic, global events that significantly alter planetary composition and evolution. Computer models and theory have elucidated the diverse outcomes of giant impacts in detail, improving our ability to interpret collision conditions from observations of their remnants. However, many open questions remain, as even the formation of the Moon\u2014a widely suspected giant-impact product for which we have the most information\u2014is still debated. We review giant-impact theory, the diverse nature of giant-impact outcomes, and the governing physical processes. We discuss the importance of computer simulations, informed by experiments, for accurately modeling the impact process. Finally, we outline how the application of probability theory and computational advancements can assist in inferring collision histories from observations, and we identify promising opportunities for advancing giant-impact theory in the future.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGiant impacts exhibit diverse possible outcomes leading to changes in planetary mass, composition, and thermal history depending on the conditions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tImprovements to computer simulation methodologies and new laboratory experiments provide critical insights into the detailed outcomes of giant impacts.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWhen colliding planets are similar in size, they can merge or escape one another with roughly equal probability, but with different effects on their resulting masses, densities, and orbits.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDifferent sequences of giant impacts can produce similar planets, encouraging the use of probability theory to evaluate distinct formation hypothesis.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of planets is a complex process that has been shaped by various mechanisms, including giant impacts. These high-energy collisions between planetary embryos and protoplanets have been proposed as a key driver of planetary differentiation, core formation, and the delivery of volatile compounds to planetary surfaces. This review synthesizes the current understanding of giant impacts in planet formation, highlighting their role in shaping the architecture of planetary systems. We discuss the evidence for giant impacts, including the presence of impact basins, shocked quartz, and melt rocks on planetary bodies such as the Moon, Vesta, and the asteroid 16 Psyche. We also examine the theoretical frameworks that describe the dynamics of giant impacts, including the role of gravitational interactions, orbital resonances, and the effects of impact-induced melting and re-melting. Furthermore, we explore the implications of giant impacts for planetary differentiation, core formation, and the delivery of volatile compounds, highlighting the complex interplay between these processes. Our review highlights the importance of giant impacts in planet formation, and demonstrates that these high-energy collisions played a critical role in shaping the architecture of planetary systems. The findings of this review have significant implications for our understanding of the early solar system and the formation of planets beyond our solar system.", "label": 1}
