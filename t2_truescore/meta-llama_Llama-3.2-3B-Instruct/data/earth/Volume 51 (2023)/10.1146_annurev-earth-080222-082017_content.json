{"grounding": "Terrestrial plants have transformed Earth's surface environments by altering water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. Studying vegetation-climate interaction in deep time has necessarily relied on modern-plant analogs to represent paleo-ecosystems\u2014as methods for reconstructing paleo- and, in particular, extinct-plant function were lacking. This approach is potentially compromised given that plant physiology has evolved through time, and some paleo-plants have no clear modern analog. Advancements in the quantitative reconstruction of whole-plant function provide new opportunities to replace modern-plant analogs and capture age-specific vegetation-climate interactions. Here, we review recent investigations of paleo-plant performance through the integration of fossil and geologic data with process-based ecosystem- to Earth system\u2013scale models to explore how early vascular plants responded to and influenced climate. First, we present an argument for characterizing extinct plants in terms of ecological and evolutionary theory to provide a framework for advancing reconstructed vegetation-climate interactions in deep time. We discuss the novel mechanistic understanding provided by applying these approaches to plants of the late Paleozoic ever-wet tropics and at higher latitudes. Finally, we discuss preliminary applications to paleo-plants in a state-of-the-art Earth system model to highlight the potential implications of different plant functional strategies on our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFor hundreds of millions of years, plants have been a keystone in maintaining the status of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and climate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tExtinct plants have functioned differently across time, limiting our understanding of how processes on Earth interact to produce climate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tNew methods, reviewed here, allow quantitative reconstruction of extinct-plant function based on the fossil record.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIntegrating extinct plants into ecosystem and climate models will expand our understanding of vegetation's role in past environmental change.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "During the late Paleozoic era, approximately 300-250 million years ago, plants underwent a profound transformation that significantly impacted the Earth's environment. This transformation was characterized by the evolution of complex plant functional traits and strategies, which enabled plants to adapt to changing environmental conditions and ultimately shape the course of the Earth's ecosystems. This study employs a systems approach to understand the dynamics of vegetation-climate interactions during this critical period in Earth's history. By integrating insights from plant functional traits, ecosystem modeling, and Earth system modeling, we reconstruct the evolution of plant functional strategies and their impact on the Earth's climate and ecosystems. Our results suggest that the evolution of plant functional traits, such as root depth and leaf morphology, played a crucial role in modulating the Earth's climate and influencing the development of ecosystems. We also demonstrate that vegetation-climate interactions during the late Paleozoic era were characterized by complex feedback loops, where changes in plant functional traits and ecosystem processes interacted to shape the Earth's climate and ecosystems. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's history and the role of plants in shaping the planet's environment. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between plants, climate, and ecosystems during the late Paleozoic era.", "label": 1}
