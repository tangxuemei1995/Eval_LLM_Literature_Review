{"grounding": "Large seismogenic faults consist of approximately meter-thick fault cores surrounded by hundreds-of-meters-thick damage zones. Earthquakes are generated by rupture propagation and slip within fault cores and dissipate the stored elastic strain energy in fracture and frictional processes in the fault zone and in radiated seismic waves. Understanding this energy partitioning is fundamental in earthquake mechanics to explain fault dynamic weakening and causative rupture processes operating over different spatial and temporal scales. The energy dissipated in the earthquake rupture propagation along a fault is called fracture energy or breakdown work. Here we review fracture energy estimates from seismological, modeling, geological, and experimental studies and show that fracture energy scales with fault slip. We conclude that although material-dependent constant fracture energies are important at the microscale for fracturing grains of the fault zone, they are negligible with respect to the macroscale processes governing rupture propagation on natural faults.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEarthquake ruptures propagate on geological faults and dissipate energy in fracture and frictional processes from micro- (less than a millimeter) to macroscale (centimeters to kilometers).\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe energy dissipated in earthquake rupture propagation is called fracture energy (G) or breakdown work (W\nb) and scales with coseismic slip.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFor earthquake ruptures in natural faults, the estimates of G and W\nb are consistent with a macroscale description of causative processes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe energy budget of an earthquake remains controversial, and contributions from different disciplines are required to unravel this issue.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Fracture energy and breakdown work are critical components of earthquake rupture dynamics, governing the release of seismic energy and the resulting fault damage. This study investigates the interplay between fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes, with a focus on dynamic weakening and rupture dynamics. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of earthquake rupture processes, we demonstrate that fracture energy and breakdown work are closely linked, with increased breakdown work leading to enhanced fracture energy release. Our results show that the fault zone structure plays a crucial role in modulating the relationship between fracture energy and breakdown work, with varying fault geometries and materials influencing the efficiency of energy release. Furthermore, we find that dynamic weakening, a process characterized by the gradual degradation of fault strength during rupture, is a key mechanism governing the earthquake energy budget. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the underlying physics of earthquake rupture and the development of more accurate earthquake hazard assessments. By integrating fracture energy and breakdown work into a comprehensive framework of rupture dynamics, we provide new insights into the complex processes governing earthquake rupture and the resulting fault damage. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the earthquake energy budget and the role of fault zone structure in modulating seismic energy release.", "label": 1}
