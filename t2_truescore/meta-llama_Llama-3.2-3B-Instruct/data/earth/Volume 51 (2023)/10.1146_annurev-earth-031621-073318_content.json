{"grounding": "For the first time, from early 2019 to the end of 2022, Mars\u2019 shallow and deep interiors have been explored by seismology with the InSight mission. Thanks to the performances of its seismometers and the quality of their robotic installation on the ground, 1,319 seismic events have been detected, including about 90 marsquakes at teleseismic distances, with Mw from 2.5 to 4.7 and at least 6 impacts, the largest ones with craters larger than 130 m. A large fraction of these marsquakes occur in Cerberus Fossae, demonstrating active regional tectonics. Records of pressure-induced seismic noise and signals from the penetration of a heat flow probe have provided subsurface models below the lander. Deeper direct and secondary body wave phase travel time, receiver function, and surface wave analysis have provided the first interior models of Mars, including crustal thickness and crustal layering, mantle structure, thermal lithospheric thickness, and core radius and state.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWith InSight's SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure of Mars) experiment and for the first time in planetary exploration, Mars\u2019 internal structure and seismicity are constrained.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMore than 1,300 seismic events and seismic noise records enable the first comparative seismology studies together with Earth and lunar seismic data.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tInversion of seismic travel times and waveforms provided the first interior model of another terrestrial planet, down to the core.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSeveral impacts were also seismically recorded with their craters imaged from orbit, providing the first data on impact dynamic on Mars.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Mars seismology has emerged as a vital tool for understanding the Martian interior structure and geological evolution. The discovery of marsquakes, also known as marsquakes, has provided valuable insights into the planet's internal dynamics and composition. These seismic events are generated by impacts, tectonic activity, and other processes that shape the Martian crust. The Cerberus Fossae, a vast impact basin located in the southern hemisphere, has been identified as a significant source of marsquakes. By analyzing the seismic data from the InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and seismometer networks, researchers have been able to reconstruct the Martian interior structure and infer the presence of a partially molten core. The study of marsquakes has also shed light on the planet's tectonic history, including the formation of the Tharsis bulge and the evolution of the Martian crust. Furthermore, the analysis of marsquake data has revealed the presence of a crust-mantle boundary, which is thought to be a key factor in the planet's geological evolution. This research highlights the importance of seismology in understanding the complex and dynamic interior of Mars, and its potential to provide valuable insights into the planet's geological history and evolution.", "label": 1}
