{"grounding": "This article explores the effects of the state on the creation of social trust. It identifies four theories connecting these two variables. The first and probably most important one stresses the role of the state as a third-party punisher of free-riders, especially in large societies where people have continuous interactions with strangers. The second claims that citizens extrapolate state officers\u2019 corruption levels to ordinary citizens\u2019 trustworthiness. The third claims that the state promotes trust by increasing income equality, and the final one claims that the state fosters trust by providing information about types of people. Finally, the article discusses how the empirical models relating to the state and trust deal with endogeneity problems, how outcomes from experimental analyses question the results obtained from observational data, and how this work affects our ideas about what trust ultimately refers to.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationship between trust and state capacity, with a particular focus on the impact of corruption and sanctions on trust in institutions. A mixed-methods approach is employed, combining quantitative and qualitative data from 20 countries to investigate the effects of corruption and sanctions on trust in government, economy, and civil society. The results indicate that corruption and sanctions can erode trust in institutions, leading to decreased state capacity and social cohesion. Conversely, effective governance and anti-corruption measures can enhance trust and promote state capacity. The study highlights the need for policymakers to address corruption and sanctions as key factors in building trust in institutions and promoting sustainable development. The findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners seeking to promote trust and state capacity in post-conflict and fragile states.", "label": 0}
