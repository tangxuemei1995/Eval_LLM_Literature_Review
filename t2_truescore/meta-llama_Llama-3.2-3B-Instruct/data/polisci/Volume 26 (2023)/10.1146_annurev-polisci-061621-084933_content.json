{"grounding": "Bureaucracy is everywhere. Unelected bureaucrats are a key link between government and citizens, between policy and implementation. Bureaucratic politics constitutes a growing share of research in political science. But the way bureaucracy is studied varies widely, permitting theoretical and empirical blind spots as well as opportunities for innovation. Scholars of American politics tend to focus on bureaucratic policy making at the national level, while comparativists often home in on local implementation by street-level bureaucrats. Data availability and professional incentives have reinforced these subfield-specific blind spots over time. We highlight these divides in three prominent research areas: the selection and retention of bureaucratic personnel, oversight of bureaucratic activities, and opportunities for influence by actors external to the bureaucracy. Our survey reveals how scholars from the American and comparative politics traditions can learn from one another.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex dynamics of bureaucratic politics, highlighting blind spots and opportunities for improvement in the field of political science. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key areas of influence, including personnel appointments, performance evaluations, and oversight mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that bureaucratic politics is often characterized by a lack of transparency and accountability, allowing for undue influence from special interest groups and lobby firms. Furthermore, procurement processes are frequently opaque, creating opportunities for corruption and favoritism. By shedding light on these blind spots, this research provides a nuanced understanding of the intricate relationships between bureaucracy, politics, and power. The findings have significant implications for policymakers seeking to promote more effective and accountable governance.", "label": 1}
