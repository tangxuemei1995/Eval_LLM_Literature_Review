{"grounding": "The concept of racist dehumanization is essential for political scientists who seek to understand the nature, scope, and consequences of white racial prejudice in the United States today. Racist dehumanization consists of a variety of processes that construct, refashion, and maintain race by coding some people as white and therefore fully human and others as other than white and therefore less than fully human. In this review, we focus on the racist dehumanization of Indigenous people and Black people, arguing that processes of dehumanization have long been implicated in both the practice of race-making and concurrent efforts to exploit and dominate racialized groups. We posit that contemporary white racial prejudice can be understood, in part, as the residue of these processes, and we conclude by describing how accounting for racist dehumanization can transform the study of white racial prejudice.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex and multifaceted phenomenon of racist dehumanization in the United States, with a particular focus on its impact on Black and Indigenous populations. Through a critical discourse analysis of media representations and public discourse, this research reveals how racist dehumanization is perpetuated and normalized, contributing to the perpetuation of systemic racism and prejudice. The findings suggest that dehumanization is not only a tool of oppression but also a means of maintaining racial hierarchies and justifying discriminatory policies. The study also highlights the ways in which white racial attitudes and privilege are embedded in the very fabric of American society, perpetuating a culture of dehumanization and exclusion. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of the politics of racist dehumanization and its far-reaching consequences for marginalized communities.", "label": 1}
