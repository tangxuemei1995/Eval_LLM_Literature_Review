{"grounding": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing scholarly interest in nonviolent resistance\u2014a method of conflict in which unarmed people mobilize collective protests, strikes, and boycotts in a coordinated way. Mass movements that rely overwhelmingly on nonviolent resistance sometimes feature unarmed collective violence, fringe violence, or even organized armed action. What do we know about the effects of violent flanks on movement outcomes? This article reviews findings on the relationships between nonviolent and unarmed resistance, violence, and the outcomes of mass mobilization, as well as the directionality of these relationships. The balance of empirical evidence suggests that organized armed violence appears to reduce the chances for otherwise nonviolent movements to succeed, whereas unarmed collective violence has more ambiguous effects. The field will benefit from greater analytical precision in comparing the units of analysis, scope, intensity, and media framing of violent flank activity.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationship between violence and nonviolent resistance, exploring the phenomenon of unarmed collective violence as a strategic component of nonviolent movements. Through a critical discourse analysis of historical and contemporary case studies, including the Indian independence movement, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and the Arab Spring protests, this research reveals how violent flanks can both empower and undermine nonviolent resistance. The findings suggest that the presence of unarmed collective violence can create a sense of urgency and momentum, while also increasing the risk of state repression and violence. The study argues that a nuanced understanding of the interplay between violence and nonviolence is essential for developing effective strategies of nonviolent resistance in the face of authoritarian regimes and oppressive power structures.", "label": 1}
