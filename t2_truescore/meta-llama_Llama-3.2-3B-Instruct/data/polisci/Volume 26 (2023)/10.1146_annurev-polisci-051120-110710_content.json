{"grounding": "Recent years have seen a renewed interest in southern distinctiveness within the United States and its ramifications for the nation. This review provides an analysis of recent works and the interpretive issues they raise. I argue that collectively they have broken with the long-established image of the South in political science, the study of which was long organized around the region's anticipated convergence to the patterns of the post\u2013New Deal North. Recent texts have instead emphasized an enduring commitment to white supremacy and a determining influence for the region in shaping national politics and institutions. I identify two broad pathways of southern influence and discuss the debates over its sources. I then discuss recent works on southern regimes and the debates these have provoked. I conclude by suggesting that overcoming the limits of recent works will ultimately undermine some of our more sweeping interpretive claims and foundational premises.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex and multifaceted role of the South in shaping American political development, particularly in the context of the 20th century. Through a critical analysis of historical and contemporary data, this research explores the enduring legacy of Jim Crow laws and the perpetuation of white supremacy in southern politics. The author argues that the South's unique cultural and institutional dynamics have contributed to the rise of authoritarianism and the erosion of democratic norms. Conversely, the New Deal policies of the 1930s represent a pivotal moment in southern politics, as they marked a significant shift towards greater federal intervention and social welfare programs. This research demonstrates how the South's influence on national politics has been shaped by a complex interplay of historical, cultural, and economic factors, with profound implications for American democracy and governance.", "label": 0}
