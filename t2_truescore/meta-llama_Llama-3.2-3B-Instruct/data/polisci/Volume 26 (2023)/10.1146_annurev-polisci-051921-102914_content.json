{"grounding": "In political science, one issue still in need of greater theorizing is the proper measurement of bureaucratic autonomy, that is, the degree of discretion that political principals should grant to bureaucratic agents. This article reviews the literature on bureaucratic autonomy both in US administrative law and in political science. It uses the American experience to define five mechanisms by which political principals grant and limit autonomy, then goes on to survey the comparative literature on other democratic systems using the American framework as a baseline. Other democracies use different mixtures of these mechanisms, for example by substituting stronger ex post review for ex ante procedures or using appointment and removal power in place of either. We find that the administrative law and social science literatures on this topic approach it very differently, and that each would profit from greater awareness of the other discipline.", "generated_text": "This study examines the concept of bureaucratic autonomy, a crucial aspect of comparative administrative law, and its relationship with political control. By analyzing the delegation of authority and the exercise of discretion within bureaucratic organizations, this research aims to clarify the boundaries of bureaucratic autonomy and its implications for the distribution of power between governments and administrative agencies. Through a comparative analysis of institutional frameworks and case studies from various countries, this study reveals that bureaucratic autonomy is shaped by the degree of delegation, the nature of discretion, and the level of political control exerted by governments. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between bureaucratic autonomy and political control in shaping the effectiveness and accountability of administrative agencies, with significant implications for comparative politics and public administration.", "label": 1}
