{"grounding": "The article reviews the recent advances in comparative political economy. It reconnects knowledge on growth regimes and welfare regimes by analyzing how growth and welfare regimes covary over both time and space. It underlines the fact that governments pursue different growth strategies to adjust to new economic environments, focusing in particular on welfare state reforms. Synthesizing the literature, we propose a definition of growth and welfare regimes that integrates different engines of growth as a way to track general trends in the evolution of capitalism. We analyze the main trends of three eras of capitalism: Fordism, neoliberal financialization, and the digitalized knowledge-based economy. We trace the various paths of change by identifying the five growth strategies governments have pursued to adapt their growth and welfare regimes to the new capitalist era. The result is not a typology of fixed types of capitalist models but a dynamic process of adjustment.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolution of growth and welfare regimes across time and space, exploring how similar trends in economic development have led to divergent paths in institutional arrangements. Through a comparative analysis of the transition from Fordist to knowledge-based economies, we investigate how financialization and the rise of the service sector have reshaped the welfare state. Our research reveals that countries with similar economic profiles have adopted distinct institutional frameworks, reflecting divergent priorities and values. We argue that the growth and welfare regimes of today are characterized by a complex interplay between institutional, social, and economic factors, and that understanding these dynamics is crucial for policymakers seeking to promote sustainable and equitable development. By shedding light on the nuances of growth and welfare regimes, this study contributes to the ongoing debate in comparative political economy and highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between economic development, institutional change, and social welfare.", "label": 1}
