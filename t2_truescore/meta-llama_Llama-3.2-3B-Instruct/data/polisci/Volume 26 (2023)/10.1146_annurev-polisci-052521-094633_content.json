{"grounding": "This article reviews the state of the literature on the politics of global health governance and associated political dynamics of actors involved in this issue space. We identify seven eras in the field, beginning with the period of empire and colonialism and ending with the COVID-19 outbreak. The field of global health has long had a focus on infectious disease, often rooted within a state-centered approach to transnational global health problems with recurrent debates about whether and how restrictions on trade and travel should be imposed in the wake of disease outbreaks. This statist focus is in tension with more cosmopolitan visions of global health, which require broader health system strengthening. In the mid-2000s, a golden age emerged with the influx of new financing and political attention to addressing HIV/AIDS and malaria, as well as reducing the risk posed by infectious disease outbreaks to economies of the Global North. Despite increased awareness of noncommunicable diseases and the importance of health systems, events of recent years (including but not limited to the COVID-19 outbreak) reinforced the centrality of states to global health efforts and the primacy of infectious diseases.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolution of global health governance from the era of imperialism to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the complex interplay between politics, power dynamics, and health outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) emerged as a key international health organization, initially shaped by colonial interests and later influenced by the Cold War. The post-Cold War period saw a shift towards a more multilateral approach, with the WHO playing a central role in responding to global health crises. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the limitations and vulnerabilities of global health governance, revealing deep-seated power imbalances and inequities in health systems. This research analyzes the historical context of global health governance, tracing the trajectory from the 'Golden Age' of international cooperation to the Great Lockdown, and exploring the implications for future health security. By examining the politics of global health, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between health, power, and politics, and to inform strategies for strengthening global health governance in the face of emerging health threats.", "label": 0}
