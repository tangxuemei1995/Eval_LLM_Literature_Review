{"grounding": "A growing literature explores how local environments, or contexts, affect political behavior, especially by shaping interpersonal contact with social out-groups. While many studies still draw directly on long-standing hypotheses from contact theory, this research agenda increasingly focuses on new research questions, beyond the classic social psychology literature, and new empirical cases, including from across the lower- and middle-income world. We develop a typology of forms of context and contact to aid the aggregation of findings across disparate cases and demonstrate that the mechanisms that may account for the political effects of intergroup context and contact are broader than those typically explored in psychologically oriented research. We propose future directions for research in this area, including greater focus on the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact and greater attention to how built or computer-based environments may mediate or mirror the effects of demographic contexts.", "generated_text": "This study seeks to unify the disparate fields of environmental effects on politics by integrating context and contact theory. By examining the interplay between the built environment and neighborhood effects, we shed light on how physical settings influence political behavior, particularly in the realm of ethnic politics. Drawing on insights from contact theory, we investigate how the spatial proximity of diverse groups affects their interactions and, in turn, shapes their political attitudes and behaviors. Our analysis reveals that the built environment plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of context on political outcomes, with findings suggesting that neighborhoods with more mixed populations exhibit greater levels of civic engagement and reduced ethnic polarization. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between environmental factors, social interactions, and political behavior.", "label": 0}
