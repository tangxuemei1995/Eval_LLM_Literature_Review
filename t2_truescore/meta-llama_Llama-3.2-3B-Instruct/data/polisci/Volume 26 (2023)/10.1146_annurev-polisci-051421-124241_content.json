{"grounding": "Global climate change is opening up new questions and reinvigorating old lines of inquiry in the study of international energy politics. Many policymakers and stakeholders are pushing for a clean energy transition away from the fossil fuels that have long dominated the world's energy supply. On some issues, there is considerable consensus between political scientists and other analysts, such as the basic categories of the \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d from the clean energy transition. On other issues, however, political science tends to depart significantly from other disciplines. The politics of the desired clean energy transition are highly complicated and filled with obstacles beyond those typically highlighted by either economics or physical sciences. For these reasons, energy politics associated with oil and other fossil fuels are far from over and continue to develop, even as new political dynamics associated with the clean energy transition emerge.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex dynamics of international energy politics in the context of climate change, with a focus on the transition to clean energy. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this research reveals the intricate relationships between energy politics, distributive power, and climate governance. The findings highlight the tensions between state interests, market forces, and environmental concerns in shaping the global energy landscape. The study also explores the role of oil in international energy politics, particularly in the context of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. The research demonstrates that a clean energy transition requires a fundamental shift in the distributive politics of energy, with a greater emphasis on equity, justice, and environmental sustainability. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with significant consequences for global energy security, climate change mitigation, and sustainable development.", "label": 0}
