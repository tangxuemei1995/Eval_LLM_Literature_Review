{"grounding": "We provide a unified language for studying power sharing in authoritarian regimes. Power-sharing deals entail not only sharing spoils between a ruler and challenger, but also establishing an enforcement mechanism. An arrangement does not truly share power without reallocating power to make it costly for the ruler to renege. Institutional concessions, such as delegating agenda control over policy decisions or empowering third-party enforcers, can reallocate power. However, weak institutions create a Catch-22 that inhibits credible commitment. When institutions are weak, self-enforcing power sharing is still possible if challengers have coercive means to defend their spoils. However, challengers can leverage their coercive capabilities to overthrow the ruler. This double-edged sword implies that a strategic dictator shares power only under specific conditions: challengers can credibly punish an autocratic ruler; if the ruler shares power, the challenger must willingly forgo taking harmful actions; and the ruler willingly acquiesces to diminished power and rents.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex dynamics of authoritarian power sharing, a phenomenon prevalent in civil wars and post-conflict societies. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key concepts, mechanisms, and strategies employed by authoritarian regimes to maintain power and stability. Our analysis reveals that commitment problems, institutional weaknesses, and the presence of external actors can significantly impact the effectiveness of power-sharing agreements. We discuss the role of coups, patronage networks, and clientelism in undermining power-sharing institutions and highlight the importance of building trust and credibility among key stakeholders. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with authoritarian power sharing, offering insights for policymakers and scholars seeking to promote more stable and sustainable peace in conflict-affected regions.", "label": 1}
