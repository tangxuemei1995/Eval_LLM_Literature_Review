{"grounding": "This article reviews the field of citizenship studies, with attention to the causes and consequences of policy. It summarizes key findings and points of consensus across three research domains: the determinants of citizenship policy, the consequences of citizenship policy, and the consequences of citizenship, i.e., the utility of obtaining citizenship for immigrant integration. After identifying strengths and weaknesses of each, I propose new directions in research that widen the field in terms of cases and generalizable theory while also deepening the field through serious attention to approaches that center the immigrant experience.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationships between policy causes and consequences of citizenship in Western Europe, with a focus on naturalization and immigration. Analyzing existing literature and empirical data, the research reveals how policy changes in citizenship regimes have influenced integration outcomes and shaped the experiences of immigrant populations. The findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between policy and social outcomes, and underscore the importance of considering the long-term consequences of citizenship policy decisions in Western Europe.", "label": 0}
