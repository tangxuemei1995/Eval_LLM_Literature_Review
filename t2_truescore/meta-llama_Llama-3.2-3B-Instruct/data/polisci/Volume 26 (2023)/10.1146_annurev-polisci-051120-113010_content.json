{"grounding": "There is an unexamined paradox in the history of government in the West. The so-called absolutist monarchs of Europe overwhelmingly chartered republican corporations\u2014e.g., towns, universities, and guilds whose members elected their leaders. Indeed, modern constitutional democracy is patterned after them. Yet, modern democracies themselves have overwhelmingly chartered authoritarian corporations\u2014e.g., universities and business corporations whose subjects have no vote. After this Great Inversion, corporations, which once distributed power and wealth, now concentrate them, straining constitutional democracy. Against this backdrop, this article analyzes the major types of relation maintained between states and corporations: constitutive (states charter corporations), mimetic (states and corporations recurrently copy one another's organizational features), and instrumental (each leans on the other, and sometimes captures it, to better advance its own purposes). The article then examines the special challenges that corporate economies pose to constitutional democracy and considers whether a partial reversal of the Great Inversion could reduce them.", "generated_text": "This study undertakes a historical and conceptual examination of the complex relationship between democracy and the corporation, tracing its evolution from the early modern period to the present day. Drawing on the traditions of republican thought and constitutionalism, the research explores how the rise of the corporation has shaped and been shaped by democratic ideals. Through a critical analysis of key texts, case studies, and empirical evidence, the study reveals how the increasing concentration of corporate power has contributed to growing inequality and the erosion of democratic institutions. Conversely, it also highlights instances where corporate enterprise has been harnessed to promote democratic values and social justice. By examining the long view of this relationship, the research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the tensions between economic and democratic goals in modern societies.", "label": 0}
