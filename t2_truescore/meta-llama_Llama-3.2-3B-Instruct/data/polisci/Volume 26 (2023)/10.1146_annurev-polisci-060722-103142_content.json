{"grounding": "Political scientist Hakeem Jefferson (Stanford University) facilitated a discussion about race, policing, and the state of American democracy with fellow political scientists Cathy J. Cohen (University of Chicago), Yanilda M. Gonz\u00e1lez (Harvard Kennedy School), Rebecca U. Thorpe (University of Washington), and Vesla M. Weaver (Johns Hopkins University) on May 26, 2021. The conversation occurred a year after George Perry Floyd Jr., a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Moving beyond common notions of democracy that focus primarily on voting and electoral participation, the panelists discussed how American policing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, redefine citizenship, redistribute power, and shape marginalized people's understanding of their place in society. Closing remarks addressed the potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people and how political scientists can more usefully contribute to efforts that strengthen democracy for all. This is an edited transcript of the conversation and includes a bibliography of the sources mentioned. A video of the conversation is available online at \nhttps://www.annualreviews.org/r/BeyondtheBallotBox\n.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationship between democracy and policing in the United States, highlighting the tensions between multiracial democratic ideals and the reality of racial authoritarianism in law enforcement. Through a critical discourse analysis of policy documents, academic literature, and media reports, this research reveals how policing practices perpetuate racial disparities and undermine democratic values. The findings suggest that the criminal justice system in the US is characterized by a 'democratic deficit,' where marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by police violence and mass incarceration. The study argues that a multiracial democracy requires a critical examination of the intersections between identity, power, and policing. By exploring the ways in which policing shapes and is shaped by democratic ideals, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the challenges facing democratic governance in the US and offers insights into potential strategies for promoting more equitable and just policing practices. Ultimately, the study seeks to spark a national conversation about the need for democratic reform and the importance of addressing racial authoritarianism in policing.", "label": 0}
