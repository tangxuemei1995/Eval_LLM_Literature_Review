{"grounding": "A recent wave of research in political science examines the past using statistical methods for causal inference and formal theory\u2014a field widely known as historical political economy (HPE). We examine the development of this field. Our survey reveals three common uses of history in HPE: understanding the past for its own sake, using history as a way to understand the present, and using history as a setting to explore theoretical conjectures. We present important work in each area and discuss trade-offs of each approach. We further identify key practical and analytical challenges for scholars of HPE, including the accessibility of data that do exist and obstacles to inference when they do not. Looking to the future, we see improved training for scholars entering the field, a heightened focus on the accumulation of knowledge, and greater attention to underexplored topics such as race, gender, ethnicity, and climate change.", "generated_text": "This study examines the persistence of historical legacies in the realm of political economy, exploring their causal influence on contemporary economic outcomes. Drawing on formal theory and causal inference methods, we analyze the enduring impact of past economic policies, institutions, and social structures on present-day economic conditions. By tracing the evolution of historical political economy, we identify key factors that have contributed to the persistence of these legacies, including the role of power dynamics, social norms, and institutional inertia. Our findings suggest that historical legacies continue to shape economic outcomes, often in subtle yet profound ways, and that formal theory can provide valuable insights into the causal mechanisms underlying these relationships. The study's results have implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between history, politics, and economics, and highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to economic analysis that takes into account the enduring legacies of the past.", "label": 0}
