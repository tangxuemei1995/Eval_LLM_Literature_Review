{"grounding": "What do we know about women's negotiation of power in the Global South? The prevailing view tells us that women's power in the Global North is greater than in the South. Yet across analytic levels, the developing world provides striking models of the assertion of women's power that challenge established concepts of political and economic development. At the macro level of state development, research identifies how the subordination of women has been central to the creation and modern infrastructure of liberal democratic states or political orders. Data analysis here provides complementary evidence that the most effective alternatives to patriarchal political orders are originating in the developing world. At the meso level of policy-making processes, developing-world states are more likely than developed-world states to recognize and co-opt women's power. Finally, at the micro level, intrafamily negotiations of patriarchal power are most dynamic in the developing world, with the greatest promise to improve our understanding of the broader systems of power that drive states, policies, and welfare.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationships between women's participation in politics and state formation in the developing world. Through a comparative analysis of countries with varying levels of gender equality, we investigate the impact of women's representation in politics on state institutions and policies. Our research highlights the significance of electoral quotas as a key mechanism for increasing women's representation in politics. We also explore the role of intrafamily bargaining in shaping women's political engagement and empowerment. By analyzing case studies from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, we demonstrate that women's participation in politics is closely tied to the development of gender-sensitive state institutions and policies. Our findings suggest that promoting women's representation in politics is crucial for achieving gender equality and sustainable development in the developing world. The study contributes to the existing literature on comparative political development and state formation, highlighting the importance of gender perspectives in understanding the complex dynamics of state-building in the developing world.", "label": 1}
