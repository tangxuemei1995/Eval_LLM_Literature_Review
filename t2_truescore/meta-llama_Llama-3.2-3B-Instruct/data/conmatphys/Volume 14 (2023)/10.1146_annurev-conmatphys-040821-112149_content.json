{"grounding": "We review the literature on swimming in complex fluids. A classification is proposed by comparing the length- and timescales of a swimmer with those of nearby obstacles, interpreted broadly, extending from rigid or soft confining boundaries to molecules that confer the bulk fluid with complex stresses. A third dimension in the classification is the concentration of swimmers, which incorporates fluids whose complexity arises purely by the collective motion of swimming organisms. For each of the eight system types that we identify, we provide a background and describe modern research findings. Although some types have seen a great deal of attention for decades, others remain uncharted waters still open and awaiting exploration.", "generated_text": "The study of swimming in complex fluids has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its relevance to various biological and engineering applications. This review focuses on the locomotion of active particles and cells in soft matter systems, including active suspensions and biological fluids. The interplay between particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions is crucial in determining the collective behavior of these systems. We discuss the theoretical frameworks and numerical simulations that have been employed to model the swimming dynamics of active particles and cells in complex fluids. The findings of these studies have important implications for our understanding of biological systems and the development of novel soft matter technologies.", "label": 0}
