{"grounding": "In Floquet engineering, periodic driving is used to realize novel phases of matter that are inaccessible in thermal equilibrium. For this purpose, the Floquet theory provides us a recipe for obtaining a static effective Hamiltonian. Although many existing works have treated closed systems, it is important to consider the effect of dissipation, which is ubiquitous in nature. Understanding the interplay of periodic driving and dissipation is a fundamental problem of nonequilibrium statistical physics that is receiving growing interest because of the fact that experimental advances have allowed us to engineer dissipation in a controllable manner. In this review, we give a detailed exposition on the formalism of quantum master equations for open Floquet systems and highlight recent work investigating whether equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to Floquet states.", "generated_text": "Floquet states in open quantum systems exhibit non-equilibrium behavior, where the periodic driving of a quantum system leads to the emergence of novel states of matter. In the context of nonequilibrium statistical physics, Floquet systems have been shown to display rich phase transitions and critical phenomena. This review article provides an overview of the current understanding of Floquet states in open quantum systems, with a focus on nonequilibrium statistical physics. We discuss the theoretical frameworks that describe Floquet systems, including the Floquet-Bloch theorem and the Floquet-Bogoliubov approximation. We also review recent experimental and numerical studies that have investigated the properties of Floquet states in various systems, including superconductors, superfluids, and ultracold atomic gases. Our analysis highlights the potential of Floquet states to exhibit novel nonequilibrium behavior, with implications for our understanding of quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena.", "label": 1}
