{"grounding": "Active colloids are self-propelled particles moving in viscous fluids by consuming fuel from their surroundings. Here, we review the numerical and theoretical modeling of active colloids propelled by self-generated near-surface flows. We start with the generic model of an active Brownian particle taking into account potential forces and effective pairwise interaction, which include hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. Also, the squirmer as a model microswimmer is introduced. We then discuss the explicit modeling of self-generated fluid flow and the full hydrodynamic-chemical coupling. Finally, we discuss recent advances in selected topics in which modeling of active colloids is used to study motion in crowded and complex environments, microrheology in active baths, active colloidal engines, adaptive responses of active colloids with the help of machine learning techniques, as well as effects of colloid and fluid inertia.", "generated_text": "This study presents a comprehensive review of numerical modeling approaches for active colloids, encompassing active Brownian particles, hydrodynamic, and chemical fields. We examine the interplay between microswimmers and their complex environments, including hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering active baths and active engines in modeling the behavior of active colloids. We discuss various numerical methods, including particle-based simulations and continuum models, and their applications in simulating active colloids in different scenarios. The results demonstrate the potential of numerical modeling to predict the behavior of active colloids in complex environments, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms and providing insights for future experimental and theoretical investigations. The findings have implications for the design and optimization of microswimmer-based systems and the understanding of complex phenomena in soft matter and biological systems.", "label": 0}
