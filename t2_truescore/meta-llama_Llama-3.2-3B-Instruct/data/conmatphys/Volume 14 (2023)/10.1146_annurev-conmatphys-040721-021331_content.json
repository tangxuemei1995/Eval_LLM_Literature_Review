{"grounding": "The modern scope of fermiology encompasses not just the classical geometry of Fermi surfaces but also the geometry of quantum wave functions over the Fermi surface. This enlarged scope is motivated by the advent of topological metals\u2014metals whose Fermi surfaces are characterized by a robustly nontrivial Berry phase. We review the extent to which topological metals can be diagnosed from magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations of transport and thermodynamic quantities. A holistic analysis of the oscillatory wave form is proposed, in which different characteristics of the wave form (e.g., phase offset, high-harmonic amplitudes, temperature-dependent frequency) encode different aspects of a topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. Which characteristic to focus on depends on (a) the orientation of the magnetic field relative to certain crystallographic axes, (b) the symmetry class of the topological metal, and (c) the separation of Fermi-surface pockets in quasimomentum \n\n space. Closely proximate pockets arise when (1) spin\u2013split pockets are nearly overlapping due to a weak spin\u2013orbit force or when (2) two pockets touch at an isolated \n\n point, which can be a topological band-touching point or a saddlepoint in the energy-momentum dispersion. The emergence of a pseudospin degree of freedom (in case 1) and the implications of magnetic breakdown (in case 2) are reviewed, with emphasis on new aspects originating from the (nonabelian) Berry connection of the Fermi surface. Future extensions of topofermiology are suggested in the directions of interaction-induced Fermi-liquid instabilities and two-dimensional electron liquids.", "generated_text": "Topological metals have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique combination of topological and metallic properties. These materials exhibit a Fermi surface that is topologically non-trivial, resulting in the presence of a Berry phase that is not quantized in the conventional sense. Instead, the Berry phase is a continuous function of the geometry and topology of the material. This leads to the emergence of quantum oscillations that are distinct from those observed in conventional metals. The magnetic breakdown phenomenon, where the Fermi surface is disrupted by the presence of a magnetic field, is also a characteristic feature of topological metals. In Dirac-Weyl semimetals, the interplay between the Dirac and Weyl points gives rise to a complex interplay between the Fermi surface and the topological properties. The geometry and topology of these materials play a crucial role in determining their electronic properties, and a deeper understanding of these relationships is essential for the development of new materials with unique properties. This review provides an overview of the current state of research in the field of fermiology of topological metals, with a focus on the interplay between the Fermi surface, Berry phase, and geometry and topology. The review highlights the key features and characteristics of these materials, and discusses the potential applications and implications of this research.", "label": 1}
