{"grounding": "Learning is traditionally studied in biological or computational systems. The power of learning frameworks in solving hard inverse problems provides an appealing case for the development of physical learning in which physical systems adopt desirable properties on their own without computational design. It was recently realized that large classes of physical systems can physically learn through local learning rules, autonomously adapting their parameters in response to observed examples of use. We review recent work in the emerging field of physical learning, describing theoretical and experimental advances in areas ranging from molecular self-assembly to flow networks and mechanical materials. Physical learning machines provide multiple practical advantages over computer designed ones, in particular by not requiring an accurate model of the system, and their ability to autonomously adapt to changing needs over time. As theoretical constructs, physical learning machines afford a novel perspective on how physical constraints modify abstract learning theory.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of learning without neurons in physical systems, leveraging advances in metamaterials and molecular computing to create novel, self-assembly-based learning architectures. By designing inverse-structured physical systems, we demonstrate the ability of physical components to adapt and learn from environmental stimuli, mimicking the principles of machine learning. Our approach utilizes self-assembly mechanisms to reconfigure physical structures in response to input signals, effectively encoding and processing information. Theoretical models and simulations reveal the potential for physical systems to learn and improve their performance over time, without the need for traditional neural networks. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields such as robotics, materials science, and artificial intelligence. By bridging the gap between physical and computational learning, we open a new frontier in the study of learning theory and its application in physical systems.", "label": 0}
