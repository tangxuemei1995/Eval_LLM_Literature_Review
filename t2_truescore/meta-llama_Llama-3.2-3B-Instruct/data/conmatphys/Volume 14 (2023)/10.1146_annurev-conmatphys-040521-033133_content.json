{"grounding": "The past decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in topological materials, and a lot of mathematical concepts have been introduced in condensed matter physics. Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central topic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on boundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex. Besides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon called the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition. In this article, we review developments in non-Hermitian topological physics by focusing mainly on the boundary problem. As well as the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena, we discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself.", "generated_text": "Non-Hermitian topological phenomena have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize our understanding of topological phases and their interplay with non-Hermitian physics. This review provides an in-depth examination of the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting the emergence of topological phases and their characteristic properties. We discuss the role of spectral theory in understanding the non-Hermitian nature of these systems, including the concept of non-Hermitian symmetry and its implications for topological invariants. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between non-Hermitian topological phenomena and other areas of physics, such as quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. By synthesizing existing knowledge, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of non-Hermitian topological phenomena and their far-reaching implications for our understanding of the underlying physics.", "label": 0}
