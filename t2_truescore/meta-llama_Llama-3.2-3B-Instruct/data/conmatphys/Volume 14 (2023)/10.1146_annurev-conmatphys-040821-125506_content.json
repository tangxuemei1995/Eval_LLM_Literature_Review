{"grounding": "Elasticity typically refers to a material's ability to store energy, whereas viscosity refers to a material's tendency to dissipate it. In this review, we discuss fluids and solids for which this is not the case. These materials display additional linear response coefficients known as odd viscosity and odd elasticity. We first introduce odd viscosity and odd elasticity from a continuum perspective, with an emphasis on their rich phenomenology, including transverse responses, modified dislocation dynamics, and topological waves. We then provide an overview of systems that display odd viscosity and odd elasticity. These systems range from quantum fluids and astrophysical gases to active and driven matter. Finally, we comment on microscopic mechanisms by which odd viscosity and odd elasticity arise.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of odd viscosity and odd elasticity in the context of nonequilibrium fluid dynamics. By leveraging the principles of continuum mechanics and active matter theory, we investigate the emergence of non-trivial rheological behavior in systems exhibiting odd symmetry. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between odd viscosity and odd elasticity gives rise to novel hydrodynamic phenomena, including the formation of topological defects and the generation of non-zero net fluxes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of complex fluid behavior and the development of novel materials with tailored rheological properties. The results of this study contribute to the growing field of nonequilibrium hydrodynamics and its applications in active matter systems.", "label": 0}
