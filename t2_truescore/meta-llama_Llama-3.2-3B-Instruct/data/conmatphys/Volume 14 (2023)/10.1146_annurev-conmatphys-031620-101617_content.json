{"grounding": "Weakly interacting quasiparticles play a central role in the low-energy description of many phases of quantum matter. At higher energies, however, quasiparticles cease to be well defined in generic many-body systems owing to a proliferation of decay channels. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of quantum many-body scars, which can give rise to certain species of stable quasiparticles throughout the energy spectrum. This goes along with a set of unusual nonequilibrium phenomena including many-body revivals and nonthermal stationary states. We provide a pedagogical exposition of this physics via a simple yet comprehensive example, that of a spin-1 XY model. We place our discussion in the broader context of symmetry-based constructions of many-body scar states, projector embeddings, and Hilbert space fragmentation. We conclude with a summary of experimental progress and theoretical puzzles.", "generated_text": "Quantum many-body scars refer to a class of systems that exhibit long-lived, non-thermal eigenstates despite being in a chaotic, out-of-equilibrium environment. From a quasiparticle perspective, these scars arise from the formation of robust, non-degenerate quasiparticle modes that persist even in the presence of strong interactions and disorder. This phenomenon is characterized by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, where the system's eigenstates thermalize to a common temperature, but the quasiparticle modes remain coherent. Our research explores the constrained dynamics of these systems, revealing the interplay between quantum chaos and the emergence of scars. By analyzing the quasiparticle dynamics and eigenstate properties, we provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the formation of quantum many-body scars.", "label": 0}
