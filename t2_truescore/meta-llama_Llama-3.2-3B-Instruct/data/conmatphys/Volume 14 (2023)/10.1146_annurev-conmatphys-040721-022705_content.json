{"grounding": "Tensor networks provide extremely powerful tools for the study of complex classical and quantum many-body problems. Over the past two decades, the increment in the number of techniques and applications has been relentless, and especially the last ten years have seen an explosion of new ideas and results that may be overwhelming for the newcomer. This short review introduces the basic ideas, the best established methods, and some of the most significant algorithmic developments that are expanding the boundaries of the tensor network potential. The goal of this review is to help the reader not only appreciate the many possibilities offered by tensor networks but also find their way through state-of-the-art codes, their applicability, and some avenues of ongoing progress.", "generated_text": "Tensor network algorithms have revolutionized the field of computational physics by providing a powerful framework for simulating complex quantum many-body systems. By leveraging the principles of entanglement and non-local correlations, these methods enable the efficient computation of ground states and excited states of quantum systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of tensor network algorithms, highlighting their applications in numerical simulations of quantum many-body systems. We discuss the various types of tensor networks, including matrix product states, projected entangled pair states, and tensor train approximations. The advantages and limitations of each approach are examined, and future directions for research are outlined.", "label": 1}
