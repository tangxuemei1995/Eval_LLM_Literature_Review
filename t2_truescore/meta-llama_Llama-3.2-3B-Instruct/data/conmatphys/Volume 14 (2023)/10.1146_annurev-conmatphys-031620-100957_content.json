{"grounding": "The solar\u2013to\u2013chemical energy conversion of Earth-abundant resources like water or greenhouse gas pollutants like CO2 promises an alternate energy source that is clean, renewable, and environmentally friendly. The eventual large-scale application of such photo-based energy conversion devices can be realized through the discovery of novel photocatalytic materials that are efficient, selective, and robust. In the past decade, the Materials Genome Initiative has led to a major leap in the development of materials databases, both computational and experimental. Hundreds of photocatalysts have recently been discovered for various chemical reactions, such as water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, employing these databases and/or data informatics, machine learning, and high-throughput computational and experimental methods. In this article, we review these data-driven photocatalyst discoveries, emphasizing the methods and techniques developed in the last few years to determine the (photo)electrochemical stability of photocatalysts, leading to the discovery of photocatalysts that remain robust and durable under operational conditions.", "generated_text": "The quest for efficient and sustainable photocatalytic energy conversion has led to a surge in research on novel materials with enhanced photocatalytic activity. This study employs a data-driven approach to identify robust materials for photocatalytic energy conversion, focusing on aqueous stability and renewable energy applications. A comprehensive literature review and machine learning analysis of existing data on photocatalytic materials were conducted to identify key factors influencing their performance. The results reveal a set of material properties, including bandgap energy, surface area, and hydrophilicity, that are critical for achieving high photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the data-driven discovery framework was used to predict the photocatalytic performance of novel materials, highlighting the potential of certain metal-organic frameworks and transition metal oxides. The findings of this study provide a foundation for the design and synthesis of novel photocatalytic materials with improved aqueous stability and renewable energy conversion efficiency, paving the way for the development of sustainable energy solutions.", "label": 1}
