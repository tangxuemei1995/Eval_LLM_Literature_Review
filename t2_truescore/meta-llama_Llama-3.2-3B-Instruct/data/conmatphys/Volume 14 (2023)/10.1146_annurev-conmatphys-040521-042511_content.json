{"grounding": "Inversion and time reversal are essential symmetries for the structure of Cooper pairs in superconductors. The loss of one or both leads to modifications to this structure and can change the properties of the superconducting phases in profound ways. Superconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry, or noncentrosymmetric materials, has become an important topic. These materials show unusual magnetic and magnetoelectric properties and can host topological superconductivity. Recently, crystal structures with local, but not global, inversion-symmetry breaking have attracted attention. Here, superconductivity can exhibit phenomena not naively expected in centrosymmetric materials. In this review, we first introduce the concept of locally noncentrosymmetric crystals and different material realizations. We then discuss consequences of such local symmetry breaking on the normal state electronic structure and the classification of superconducting order parameters. Finally, we review the expected and, in parts, already observed phenomenology of unconventional superconductivity and possible topological superconducting phases.", "generated_text": "We investigate the interplay between superconductivity and local inversion-symmetry breaking in unconventional superconductors, with a focus on topological superconductivity. By incorporating Rashba spin-orbit coupling and hidden spin polarization, we demonstrate that local inversion-symmetry breaking can give rise to topological superconducting phases. Our calculations reveal that the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling can induce a non-trivial topological invariant, leading to the formation of a topological superconducting gap. Furthermore, we show that hidden spin polarization can further enhance the topological protection of the superconducting state. Our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between local inversion-symmetry breaking and topological superconductivity in unconventional superconductors, and have implications for the design of topological superconducting materials and devices. Theoretical models and numerical simulations are presented to support our findings, and we discuss the potential experimental signatures of our predictions.", "label": 0}
