{"grounding": "Quantum circuits\u2014built from local unitary gates and local measurements\u2014are a new playground for quantum many-body physics and a tractable setting to explore universal collective phenomena far from equilibrium. These models have shed light on longstanding questions about thermalization and chaos, and on the underlying universal dynamics of quantum information and entanglement. In addition, such models generate new sets of questions and give rise to phenomena with no traditional analog, such as dynamical phase transitions in quantum systems that are monitored by an external observer. Quantum circuit dynamics is also topical in view of experimental progress in building digital quantum simulators that allow control of precisely these ingredients. Randomness in the circuit elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice models or dynamical processes. Many of the universal phenomena that can be identified in this tractable setting apply to much wider classes of more structured many-body dynamics.", "generated_text": "Random quantum circuits have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to exhibit nonequilibrium dynamics and quantum chaos. By introducing randomness into quantum circuits, researchers can study the emergence of entanglement and its behavior under nonequilibrium conditions. This abstract reviews the current state of research on random quantum circuits, focusing on their ability to simulate complex quantum systems and the role of quantum measurements in inducing nonequilibrium dynamics. Theoretical models and numerical simulations have shown that random quantum circuits can exhibit chaotic behavior, including the presence of entanglement and quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, the study of random quantum circuits has implications for the development of quantum simulators, which can be used to study the behavior of complex quantum systems in a controlled and efficient manner. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research on random quantum circuits and their potential applications in quantum information science.", "label": 1}
