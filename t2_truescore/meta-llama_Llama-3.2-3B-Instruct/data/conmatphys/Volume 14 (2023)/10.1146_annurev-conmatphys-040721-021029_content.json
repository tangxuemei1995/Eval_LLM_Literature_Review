{"grounding": "Recent advances in our understanding of symmetry in quantum many-body systems offer the possibility of a generalized Landau paradigm that encompasses all equilibrium phases of matter. This is a brief and elementary review of some of these developments.", "generated_text": "Generalized symmetries in condensed matter systems are explored through the lens of low-energy effective field theory, revealing novel quantum phases of matter and spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanisms, with implications for understanding exotic materials.", "label": 0}
