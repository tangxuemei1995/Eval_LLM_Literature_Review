{"grounding": "The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) refers to the generation of a spin current as a result of a temperature gradient in a magnetic material, which can be detected electrically via the inverse spin Hall effect in a metallic contact. Since the discovery of the SSE in 2008, intensive studies on the SSE have been conducted to elucidate its origin. SSEs appear in a wide range of magnetic materials including ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnets and also paramagnets with classical or quantum spin fluctuation. SSE voltage reflects fundamental properties of a magnet, such as elementary excitation, static magnetic order, spin correlation, and spin transport. In this article, we review recent progress on the SSE in various systems, with particular emphasis on its emerging role as a probe of these magnetic properties in solids. We also briefly discuss the recently discovered nuclear SSE.", "generated_text": "The spin Seebeck effect is a thermoelectric phenomenon that enables the conversion of spin currents into electric signals, offering a sensitive probe for investigating elementary excitations, spin correlations, and transport properties in solids. By exploiting the inverse spin Hall effect, this effect can be harnessed to detect antiferromagnetic spintronics and magnon-mediated phenomena. The spin Seebeck effect also provides a unique platform for probing nuclear spin dynamics and quantum spin liquids. Recent advances in spintronics have led to the development of spin-caloritronic devices, which can be used to investigate magnetic order and domain structures in solids. This review provides an overview of the spin Seebeck effect, its underlying mechanisms, and its applications in spintronics, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for studying the intricate relationships between spin, magnetism, and transport in solids.", "label": 1}
