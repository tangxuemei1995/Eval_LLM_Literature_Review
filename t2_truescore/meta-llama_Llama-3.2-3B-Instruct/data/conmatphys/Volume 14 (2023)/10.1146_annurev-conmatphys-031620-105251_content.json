{"grounding": "Life is a nonequilibrium phenomenon: Metabolism provides a continuous supply of energy that drives nearly all cellular processes. However, very little is known about how much energy different cellular processes use, i.e., their energetic costs. The most direct experimental measurements of these costs involve modulating the activity of cellular processes and determining the resulting changes in energetic fluxes. In this review, we present a flux balance framework to aid in the design and interpretation of such experiments and discuss the challenges associated with measuring the relevant metabolic fluxes. We then describe selected techniques that enable measurement of these fluxes. Finally, we review prior experimental and theoretical work that has employed techniques from biochemistry and nonequilibrium physics to determine the energetic costs of cellular processes.", "generated_text": "The measurement of energetic costs in cell biology is crucial for understanding the intricate dynamics of metabolic pathways. This review focuses on dissecting flux balances to quantify the energetic costs associated with various cellular processes. We discuss the theoretical frameworks and experimental techniques employed to measure metabolic fluxes, including isotopic labeling, flux analysis, and computational modeling. However, we also highlight the challenges and limitations of these approaches, such as the accuracy of flux measurements, the influence of experimental conditions, and the complexity of metabolic networks. By addressing these challenges, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the energetic costs of cellular processes and their implications for cellular function and disease.", "label": 1}
