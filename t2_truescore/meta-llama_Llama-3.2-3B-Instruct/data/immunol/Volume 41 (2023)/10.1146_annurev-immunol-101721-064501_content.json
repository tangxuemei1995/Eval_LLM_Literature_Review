{"grounding": "There is a dramatic remodeling of the T cell compartment during aging. The most notorious changes are the reduction of the naive T cell pool and the accumulation of memory-like T cells. Memory-like T cells in older people acquire a phenotype of terminally differentiated cells, lose the expression of costimulatory molecules, and acquire properties of senescent cells. In this review, we focus on the different subsets of age-associated T cells that accumulate during aging. These subsets include extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer properties, exhausted T cells with altered cytokine production, and regulatory T cells that gain proinflammatory features. Importantly, all of these subsets lose their lymph node homing capacity and migrate preferentially to nonlymphoid tissues, where they contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging.", "generated_text": "Aging is characterized by the progressive deterioration of tissues, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of the immune system, known as immunosenescence. This process involves the decline of lymphocyte function and the expansion of senescent T cell subsets. In this context, extremely differentiated T cell subsets, such as terminally differentiated effector T cells and senescent memory T cells, contribute to tissue deterioration. Thymus involution, a hallmark of aging, further exacerbates this process by reducing the production of new T cells. Chronic inflammation, resulting from the imbalance between effector and regulatory T cells, also plays a critical role in promoting tissue damage. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the contribution of extremely differentiated T cell subsets to immunosenescence and tissue deterioration is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate the effects of aging.", "label": 0}
