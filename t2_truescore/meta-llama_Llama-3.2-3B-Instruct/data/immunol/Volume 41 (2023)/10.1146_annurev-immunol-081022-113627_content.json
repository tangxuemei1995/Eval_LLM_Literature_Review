{"grounding": "Myeloid cells are a significant proportion of leukocytes within tissues, comprising granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. With the identification of various myeloid cells that perform separate but complementary functions during homeostasis and disease, our understanding of tissue myeloid cells has evolved significantly. Exciting findings from transcriptomics profiling and fate-mapping mouse models have facilitated the identification of their developmental origins, maturation, and tissue-specific specializations. This review highlights the current understanding of tissue myeloid cells and the contributing factors of functional heterogeneity to better comprehend the complex and dynamic immune interactions within the healthy or inflamed tissue. Specifically, we discuss the new understanding of the contributions of granulocyte-monocyte progenitor\u2013derived phagocytes to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity as well as the impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function. Lastly, we explore the developing paradigm of myeloid cell heterogeneity during inflammation and disease.", "generated_text": "The origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, including granulocytes and monocytes, have been a subject of intense investigation in recent years. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) in the development and maintenance of tissue myeloid cells. GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics, suggesting a complex hierarchy of cell fate decisions. Fate-mapping studies have revealed that GMPs can give rise to both macrophages and neutrophils, highlighting the importance of niche-dependent reprogramming in tissue myeloid cell development. Furthermore, tissue reprogramming of GMPs has been shown to be a key mechanism underlying the generation of tissue-resident myeloid cells. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, with a focus on their origin, heterogeneity, and role in tissue myeloid cell development and maintenance.", "label": 1}
