{"grounding": "The evolution of IgE in mammals added an extra layer of immune protection at body surfaces to provide a rapid and local response against antigens from the environment. The IgE immune response employs potent expulsive and inflammatory forces against local antigen provocation, at the risk of damaging host tissues and causing allergic disease. Two well-known IgE receptors, the high-affinity Fc\u03b5RI and low-affinity CD23, mediate the activities of IgE. Unlike other known antibody receptors, CD23 also regulates IgE expression, maintaining IgE homeostasis. This mechanism evolved by adapting the function of the complement receptor CD21. Recent insights into the dynamic character of IgE structure, its resultant capacity for allosteric modulation, and the potential for ligand-induced dissociation have revealed previously unappreciated mechanisms for regulation of IgE and IgE complexes. We describe recent research, highlighting structural studies of the IgE network of proteins to analyze the uniquely versatile activities of IgE and anti-IgE biologics.", "generated_text": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in mediating allergic reactions, and its receptors, particularly Fc\u03b5RI, are crucial for this process. The protein structure of IgE and its receptors has been extensively studied, revealing intricate mechanisms of action. The Fc\u03b5RI receptor, composed of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits, undergoes conformational changes upon IgE binding, triggering the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The CD23 molecule, a disulfide-linked dimer of the low-affinity IgE receptor, modulates IgE binding and receptor activation. Anti-IgE biologics, such as omalizumab, have been developed to target and neutralize IgE, thereby reducing allergic responses. Structural insights into the binding of anti-IgE biologics to IgE and Fc\u03b5RI have provided valuable information on their mechanisms of action. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of IgE, IgE receptors, and anti-IgE biologics, highlighting the importance of protein structure and allosteric regulation in modulating allergic responses.", "label": 1}
