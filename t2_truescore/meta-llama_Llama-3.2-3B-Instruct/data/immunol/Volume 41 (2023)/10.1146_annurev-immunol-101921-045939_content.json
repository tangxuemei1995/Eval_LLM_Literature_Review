{"grounding": "Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a key cytokine regulating the development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death of T cells. In CD4+ T cells, TGF-\u03b2 maintains the quiescence and controls the activation of naive T cells. While inhibiting the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells. TGF-\u03b2 is required for the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells and the development of regulatory T cells. TGF-\u03b2 is crucial in the differentiation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells and their retention in the tissue, whereas it suppresses effector T cell function. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 also regulates the generation or function of natural killer T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes. Here I highlight the major findings and recent advances in our understanding of TGF-\u03b2 regulation of T cells and provide a personal perspective of the field.", "generated_text": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) plays a pivotal role in regulating the function and fate of T cells, a crucial component of the adaptive immune system. This review focuses on the complex interactions between TGF-\u03b2 and various subsets of T cells, including CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T cells. TGF-\u03b2 has been shown to modulate T cell quiescence and activation, influencing the balance between effector and regulatory T cell responses. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b2 has been implicated in the development and function of innate lymphoid cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-\u03b2's effects on T cells involve the regulation of key transcription factors and signaling pathways, including the Smad pathway and the NF-\u03baB pathway. Understanding the intricate relationships between TGF-\u03b2 and T cells is essential for elucidating the mechanisms of immune tolerance and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related disorders.", "label": 1}
