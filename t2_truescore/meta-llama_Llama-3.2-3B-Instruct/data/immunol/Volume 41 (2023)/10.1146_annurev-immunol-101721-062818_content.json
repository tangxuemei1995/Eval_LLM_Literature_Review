{"grounding": "The epithelial tissues that line our body, such as the skin and gut, have remarkable regenerative prowess and continually renew throughout our lifetimes. Owing to their barrier function, these tissues have also evolved sophisticated repair mechanisms to swiftly heal and limit the penetration of harmful agents following injury. Researchers now appreciate that epithelial regeneration and repair are not autonomous processes but rely on a dynamic cross talk with immunity. A wealth of clinical and experimental data point to the functional coupling of reparative and inflammatory responses as two sides of the same coin. Here we bring to the fore the immunological signals that underlie homeostatic epithelial regeneration and restitution following damage. We review our current understanding of how immune cells contribute to distinct phases of repair. When unchecked, immune-mediated repair programs are co-opted to fuel epithelial pathologies such as cancer, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, understanding the reparative functions of immunity may advance therapeutic innovation in regenerative medicine and epithelial inflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between the immune system and epithelial tissues plays a crucial role in regeneration and repair processes. Recent studies have highlighted the complex cross-talk between immune cells and epithelial cells, which modulates the inflammatory response and promotes tissue repair. In the context of inflammatory diseases, dysregulation of this cross-talk can lead to impaired wound healing and tissue damage. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of immune-epithelial cross-talk in regeneration and repair, with a focus on the role of immune cells, cytokines, and stem cells in modulating epithelial function. We discuss the mechanisms by which epithelial cells interact with immune cells, including the production of chemokines and cytokines, and the impact of this cross-talk on tissue repair and regeneration. Furthermore, we explore the potential therapeutic strategies that target this cross-talk to promote wound healing and tissue repair in inflammatory diseases. Understanding the complex interplay between the immune system and epithelial tissues is essential for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to promote regeneration and repair in various diseases.", "label": 1}
