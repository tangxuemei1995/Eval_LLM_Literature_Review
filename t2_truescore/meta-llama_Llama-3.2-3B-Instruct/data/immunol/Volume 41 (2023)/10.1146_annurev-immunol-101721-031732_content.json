{"grounding": "The innate immune system detects pathogens via germline-encoded receptors that bind to conserved pathogen ligands called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Here we consider an additional strategy of pathogen sensing called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI involves detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors, also called effectors. Pathogens produce effectors to manipulate hosts to create a replicative niche and/or block host immunity. Unlike PAMPs, effectors are often diverse and rapidly evolving and can thus be unsuitable targets for direct detection by germline-encoded receptors. Effectors are instead often sensed indirectly via detection of their virulence activities. ETI is a viable strategy for pathogen sensing and is used across diverse phyla, including plants, but the molecular mechanisms of ETI are complex compared to simple receptor/ligand-based PAMP detection. Here we survey the mechanisms and functions of ETI, with a particular focus on emerging insights from animal studies. We suggest that many examples of ETI may remain to be discovered, hiding in plain sight throughout immunology.", "generated_text": "Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is a crucial component of innate immunity that plays a pivotal role in the recognition and elimination of pathogens. ETI is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface of immune cells. Upon activation, ETI induces the production of guard immunity, a state of heightened immune activation that prepares the host for a more effective adaptive immune response. The effector molecules produced during ETI, such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, possess potent antimicrobial properties that directly inhibit the growth and replication of pathogens. Furthermore, ETI also regulates the expression of virulence factors in pathogens, thereby modulating their ability to cause disease. This review aims to provide an in-depth examination of ETI, its mechanisms, and its significance in the context of innate immunity and pathogen defense.", "label": 0}
