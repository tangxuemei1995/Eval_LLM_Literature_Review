{"grounding": "Autoreactive B cells and interferons are central players in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. The partial success of drugs targeting these pathways, however, supports heterogeneity in upstream mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent insights from genetic and immune monitoring studies of patients that are refining our understanding of these basic mechanisms. Among them, novel mutations in genes affecting intrinsic B cell activation or clearance of interferogenic nucleic acids have been described. Mitochondria have emerged as relevant inducers and/or amplifiers of SLE pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms that include disruption of organelle integrity or compartmentalization, defective metabolism, and failure of quality control measures. These result in extra- or intracellular release of interferogenic nucleic acids as well as in innate and/or adaptive immune cell activation. A variety of classic and novel SLE autoantibody specificities have been found to recapitulate genetic alterations associated with monogenic lupus or to trigger interferogenic amplification loops. Finally, atypical B cells and novel extrafollicular T helper cell subsets have been proposed to contribute to the generation of SLE autoantibodies. Overall, these novel insights provide opportunities to deepen the immunophenotypic surveillance of patients and open the door to patient stratification and personalized, rational approaches to therapy.", "generated_text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies, inflammation, and tissue damage. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of interferons in the pathogenesis of SLE, with elevated levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) observed in patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the production and function of these cytokines in SLE remain poorly understood. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of SLE pathogenesis, with a focus on the role of interferons and other immune mediators. The involvement of mitochondria in the regulation of cell death and survival pathways has also been implicated in SLE, with mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to the development of autoantibodies and tissue damage. Furthermore, the extrafollicular compartment, which includes dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells, plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of the autoimmune response in SLE. This review will discuss the current evidence for the involvement of these mechanisms in SLE pathogenesis, and highlight the need for further research into the underlying biology of this complex disease. By elucidating the complex interactions between interferons, mitochondria, and the immune system, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of SLE pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this debilitating disease.", "label": 1}
