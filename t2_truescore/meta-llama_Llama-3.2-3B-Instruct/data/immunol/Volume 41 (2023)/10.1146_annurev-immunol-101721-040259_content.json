{"grounding": "Modulation of the immune system is an important therapeutic strategy in a wide range of diseases, and is fundamental to the development of vaccines. However, optimally safe and effective immunotherapy requires precision in the delivery of stimulatory cues to the right cells at the right place and time, to avoid toxic overstimulation in healthy tissues or incorrect programming of the immune response. To this end, biomaterials are being developed to control the location, dose, and timing of vaccines and immunotherapies. Here we discuss fundamental concepts of how biomaterials are used to enhance immune modulation, and evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of how biomaterials-mediated immune engineering can impact the development of new therapeutics. We focus on immunological mechanisms of action and in vivo modulation of the immune system, and we also discuss challenges to be overcome to speed translation of these technologies to the clinic.", "generated_text": "The development of novel immunotherapies has been a significant focus in recent years, with biomaterials emerging as a promising tool for the engineering of the immune system. This field has led to the creation of vaccine adjuvants that enhance the efficacy of immunizations, with nanoparticles playing a crucial role in their design and functionality. Biomaterials-mediated immunotherapy has shown great potential in modulating immune responses, with applications in cancer immunotherapy, infectious disease treatment, and autoimmune disorders. The use of nanoparticles as carriers for immunomodulatory molecules has enabled the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to specific immune cells, thereby enhancing their efficacy and reducing side effects. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of biomaterials-mediated immunotherapy, with a focus on the design and functionality of nanoparticle-based vaccine adjuvants and their applications in immunomodulation.", "label": 1}
