{"grounding": "Our defenses against infection rely on the ability of the immune system to distinguish invading pathogens from self. This task is exceptionally challenging, if not seemingly impossible, in the case of retroviruses that have integrated almost seamlessly into the host. This review examines the limits of innate and adaptive immune responses elicited by endogenous retroviruses and other retroelements, the targets of immune recognition, and the consequences for host health and disease. Contrary to theoretical expectation, endogenous retroelements retain substantial immunogenicity, which manifests most profoundly when their epigenetic repression is compromised, contributing to autoinflammatory and autoimmune disease and age-related inflammation. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that regulated immune reactivity to endogenous retroelements is integral to immune system development and function, underpinning cancer immunosurveillance, resistance to infection, and responses to the microbiota. Elucidation of the interaction points with endogenous retroelements will therefore deepen our understanding of immune system function and contribution to disease.", "generated_text": "Endogenous retroelements (EREs), including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), have been integrated into the human genome for millions of years, posing a significant challenge to our understanding of the immunological landscape. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between EREs and the adaptive immune system, with ERVs capable of modulating interferon (IFN) responses and influencing the development of autoimmune diseases. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the immunological conundrum of EREs, focusing on the mechanisms by which ERVs interact with the adaptive immune system and the resulting consequences for human health. We will discuss the role of ERVs in shaping the IFN response, the impact on immune cell function, and the potential links to autoimmune diseases. Our analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this field, highlighting the need for further investigation into the immunological implications of EREs.", "label": 0}
