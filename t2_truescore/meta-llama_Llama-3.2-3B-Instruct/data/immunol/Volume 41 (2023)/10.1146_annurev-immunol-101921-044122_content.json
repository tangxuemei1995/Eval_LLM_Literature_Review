{"grounding": "T cells and natural killer (NK) cells have complementary roles in tumor immunity, and dual T cell and NK cell attack thus offers opportunities to deepen the impact of immunotherapy. Recent work has also shown that NK cells play an important role in recruiting dendritic cells to tumors and thus enhance induction of CD8 T cell responses, while IL-2 secreted by T cells activates NK cells. Targeting of immune evasion mechanisms from the activating NKG2D receptor and its MICA and MICB ligands on tumor cells offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, T cells and NK cells share several important inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance T cell\u2013 and NK cell\u2013mediated immunity. These inhibitory receptor-ligand systems include CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E. We also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies based on inhibitory and activating cytokines that profoundly impact the function of both lymphocyte populations within tumors.", "generated_text": "Cancer immunotherapies have shown significant promise in treating various types of cancer by harnessing the power of the immune system. Recent studies have focused on designing therapies that can effectively engage both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, two crucial components of the innate and adaptive immune responses. This review aims to summarize the current state of research in cancer immunotherapy, with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms and strategies employed to enhance T cell and NK cell activation. The literature highlights the importance of co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines, and checkpoint inhibitors in modulating the immune response. Additionally, the role of tumor-associated antigens and cancer-testis antigens in targeting NK cells is discussed. By understanding the complex interactions between T cells, NK cells, and cancer cells, researchers can design more effective immunotherapies that combine the strengths of both cell types, leading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced cancer treatment.", "label": 1}
