{"grounding": "As an important sensor in the innate immune system, NLRP3 detects exogenous pathogenic invasions and endogenous cellular damage and responds by forming the NLRP3 inflammasome, a supramolecular complex that activates caspase-1. The three major components of the NLRP3 inflammasome are NLRP3, which captures the danger signals and recruits downstream molecules; caspase-1, which elicits maturation of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and processing of gasdermin D to mediate cytokine release and pyroptosis; and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), which functions as a bridge connecting NLRP3 and caspase-1. In this article, we review the structural information that has been obtained on the NLRP3 inflammasome and its components or subcomplexes, with special focus on the inactive NLRP3 cage, the active NLRP3-NEK7 (NIMA-related kinase 7)-ASC inflammasome disk, and the PYD-PYD and CARD-CARD homotypic filamentous scaffolds of the inflammasome. We further implicate structure-derived mechanisms for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "generated_text": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response to various pathogens and danger signals. The assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome involve a series of complex structural rearrangements. This review focuses on the structural mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. The NLRP3 protein forms a hexameric structure, which is essential for its function. The assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome requires the recruitment of ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a CARD) and caspase-1. The interaction between NLRP3 and ASC leads to the formation of a filaments network, which is stabilized by the oligomerization of NLRP3. The activation of caspase-1 is crucial for the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. The structural rearrangements of NLRP3 inflammasome are essential for its activation, and understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies against inflammatory diseases.", "label": 0}
