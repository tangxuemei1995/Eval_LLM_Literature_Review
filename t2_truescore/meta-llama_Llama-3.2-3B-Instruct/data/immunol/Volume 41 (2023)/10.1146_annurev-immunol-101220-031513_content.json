{"grounding": "Over the last decade, immunometabolism has emerged as a novel interdisciplinary field of research and yielded significant fundamental insights into the regulation of immune responses. Multiple classical approaches to interrogate immunometabolism, including bulk metabolic profiling and analysis of metabolic regulator expression, paved the way to appreciating the physiological complexity of immunometabolic regulation in vivo. Studying immunometabolism at the systems level raised the need to transition towards the next-generation technology for metabolic profiling and analysis. Spatially resolved metabolic imaging and computational algorithms for multi-modal data integration are new approaches to connecting metabolism and immunity. In this review, we discuss recent studies that highlight the complex physiological interplay between immune responses and metabolism and give an overview of technological developments that bear the promise of capturing this complexity most directly and comprehensively.", "generated_text": "Systems immunology approaches have emerged as a crucial framework for understanding the intricate relationships between the immune system and metabolism. By integrating transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metabolic imaging, researchers can elucidate the complex interactions between immune cells and metabolic pathways. This interdisciplinary field has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Computational modeling and machine learning algorithms can be employed to analyze large-scale datasets and identify key regulatory nodes that govern immunometabolic networks. The integration of systems immunology with metabolic imaging techniques can provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between the immune system and metabolism, ultimately leading to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.", "label": 1}
