{"grounding": "Type 2 immunity mediates protective responses to helminths and pathological responses to allergens, but it also has broad roles in the maintenance of tissue integrity, including wound repair. Type 2 cytokines are known to promote fibrosis, an overzealous repair response, but their contribution to healthy wound repair is less well understood. This review discusses the evidence that the canonical type 2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, are integral to the tissue repair process through two main pathways. First, essential for the progression of effective tissue repair, IL-4 and IL-13 suppress the initial inflammatory response to injury. Second, these cytokines regulate how the extracellular matrix is modified, broken down, and rebuilt for effective repair. IL-4 and/or IL-13 amplifies multiple aspects of the tissue repair response, but many of these pathways are highly redundant and can be induced by other signals. Therefore, the exact contribution of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling remains difficult to unravel.", "generated_text": "IL-4 and IL-13 play pivotal roles in regulating and modulating the wound repair process, a complex and multifaceted response to tissue injury. These cytokines, key effector molecules of type 2 immunity, orchestrate the coordinated action of various immune cells and extracellular matrix components to facilitate healing. Upon wound induction, IL-4 and IL-13 are rapidly produced, promoting the activation of macrophages and the secretion of growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These growth factors, in turn, stimulate angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling, ultimately contributing to the restoration of tissue integrity. Furthermore, IL-4 and IL-13 have been shown to modulate the immune response to helminthic infections, which can also impact wound healing. Understanding the mechanisms by which IL-4 and IL-13 regulate wound repair may provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for promoting tissue recovery and regeneration.", "label": 1}
