{"grounding": "Characterization of RNA modifications has identified their distribution features and molecular functions. Dynamic changes in RNA modification on various forms of RNA are essential for the development and function of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the value of innovative RNA modification profiling technologies to uncover the function of these diverse, dynamic RNA modifications in various immune cells within healthy and diseased contexts. Further, we explore our current understanding of the mechanisms whereby aberrant RNA modifications modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment and point out outstanding research questions.", "generated_text": "RNA modification plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, particularly in antiviral and antitumor immunity. The epitranscriptome, comprising RNA modifications such as N6-methyladenosine, modulates gene expression and influences the tumor microenvironment. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of RNA modification in modulating antiviral and antitumor immunity, with implications for cancer therapy and vaccine development. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of RNA modification in the immune system, with a focus on its role in antiviral and antitumor immunity and its potential applications in immunotherapy.", "label": 1}
