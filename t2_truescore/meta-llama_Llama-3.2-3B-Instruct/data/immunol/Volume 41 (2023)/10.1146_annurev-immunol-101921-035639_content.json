{"grounding": "The complement system is an ancient collection of proteolytic cascades with well-described roles in regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. With the convergence of a revolution in complement-directed clinical therapeutics, the discovery of specific complement-associated targetable pathways in the central nervous system, and the development of integrated multi-omic technologies that have all emerged over the last 15 years, precision therapeutic targeting in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases and processes appears to be within reach. As a sensor of tissue distress, the complement system protects the brain from microbial challenge as well as the accumulation of dead and/or damaged molecules and cells. Additional more recently discovered diverse functions of complement make it of paramount importance to design complement-directed neurotherapeutics such that the beneficial roles in neurodevelopment, adult neural plasticity, and neuroprotective functions of the complement system are retained.", "generated_text": "The complement system, a key component of the innate immune response, plays a complex role in the brain, contributing to both neuroprotection and neuroinflammation. C1q, a crucial component of the classical pathway, has been implicated in the clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. However, excessive activation of the complement system can lead to neuroinflammation, exacerbating disease progression. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, are activated in response to complement activation, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote synaptic pruning and neuronal loss. Conversely, the complement system can also promote neuroprotection by clearing apoptotic neurons and regulating the activity of microglia. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the complement system's contributions to neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation in the context of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the complex interplay between these processes and the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the complement system.", "label": 1}
