{"grounding": "As with past pandemics of influenza, COVID-19 tore through US prisons and jails; however, the COVID-19 pandemic, uniquely, has led to more health research on carceral systems than has been seen to date. Herein, we review the data on its impact on incarcerated people, correctional officers, health systems, and surrounding communities. We searched medical, sociological, and criminology databases from March 2020 through February 2022 for studies examining the intersection of COVID-19, prisons and jails, and health outcomes, including COVID-19 incidence, prevalence, hospitalizations, and vaccination. Our scoping review identified 77 studies\u2014the bulk of which focus on disease epidemiology in carceral systems, with a small minority that focuses on the efficacy or effectiveness of prevention and mitigation efforts, including testing, vaccination, and efforts to depopulate correctional facilities. We highlight areas for future research, including the experiences of incarcerated people and correctional staff, unanticipated health effects of prolonged quarantine, excess deaths due to delays in healthcare, and experimental studies on vaccine uptake and testing in correctional staff. These studies will enable a fuller understanding of COVID-19 and help stem future pandemics.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on carceral systems worldwide, resulting in unprecedented challenges for correctional facilities and law enforcement agencies. This review aims to provide an overview of the incidence of COVID-19 in prisons and jails, highlighting the key factors that contribute to the spread of the virus. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, incorporating studies published between January 2020 and December 2022. The results indicate that the incidence of COVID-19 in carceral systems has been alarmingly high, with reported cases and deaths exceeding those in the general population. Effective mitigation strategies, including vaccination, social distancing, and enhanced hygiene practices, have been implemented in various jurisdictions. However, the challenges of maintaining these measures in confined environments remain significant. This review highlights the need for continued research and collaboration between policymakers, healthcare professionals, and correctional administrators to develop evidence-based guidelines for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in carceral systems. By doing so, we can reduce the risk of infection and minimize the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable populations.", "label": 0}
