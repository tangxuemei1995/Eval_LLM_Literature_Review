{"grounding": "As tens of thousands swarmed the US Capitol Grounds on January 6th, 2021, to oppose the election of Joe Biden as President, thousands among them assaulted officers and breached the building to stop the certification of the election results, leading to nine deaths and hundreds of injuries. Despite being an act of terrorism and evidence that far-right extremists planned to take over the government, some dismiss January 6th as legitimate political discourse. This divisive response starkly contrasts with the unifying response to the jihadi attacks on September 11th two decades earlier, raising the question as to why the country has not also united against far-right extremism. This review argues that the Bush administration misused deterrence in response to the September 11th attacks. While unifying the country, it also disproportionately punished innocent Muslims and legitimized anti-Muslim ideals, giving rise to anti-Muslim hate crimes and backlash by jihadi extremists and emboldening violence from far-right extremists. This review combines research on deterrence, counterterrorism, anti-Muslim ideals, and far-right organizations with data on terrorism and hate crimes within the United States to delineate this argument and assess its alignment with the empirical progression of violence between September 11th and January 6th.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of far-right and jihadi terrorism within the United States, spanning from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks to the January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol. A comprehensive review of existing literature and primary sources reveals a complex and multifaceted landscape of extremist ideologies. Far-right and jihadi groups have increasingly intersected, with some individuals and organizations adopting hybrid ideologies that combine elements of white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and Islamist extremism. The study highlights the growing threat of far-right and jihadi terrorism, including hate crimes and violent attacks on minority communities, law enforcement, and critical infrastructure. The January 6th insurrection serves as a pivotal moment, illustrating the potential for extremist ideologies to mobilize and manifest in violent action. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics between far-right and jihadi extremism, emphasizing the need for coordinated counter-terrorism strategies and inclusive counter-narratives to address the root causes of radicalization. By examining the intersections and synergies between these two forms of extremism, this study aims to inform policy and practice, ultimately mitigating the threat of terrorism and promoting public safety in the United States.", "label": 0}
