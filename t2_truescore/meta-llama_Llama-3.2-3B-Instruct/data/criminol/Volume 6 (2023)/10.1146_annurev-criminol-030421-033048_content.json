{"grounding": "Ethnographic studies of immigration and crime were prominent in the early decades of the twentieth century, yet contemporary scholarship has been dominated by quantitative approaches. In this review, we heed the call of those who have lamented the \u201ccollective amnesia\u201d and \u201cnewness fetish\u201d that characterize much of contemporary criminology and revisit classic ethnographies of immigration and crime, with an emphasis on the unique methodological contributions of this early work. Next, we synthesize the small but growing body of contemporary ethnographic research on immigration and crime, which includes the policing of immigrant communities in the age of \u201ccrimmigration;\u201d the lived experiences inside contemporary deportation/detention regimes; the integration experiences of Muslims, a highly marginalized but understudied population; and immigrants\u2019 unique vulnerabilities to and experiences of victimization, to illustrate the value of qualitative approaches for capturing the nuances of immigrants\u2019 experiences in the new age of immigration.", "generated_text": "This study revitalizes ethnographic research on the intersection of immigration and crime, drawing on qualitative methods and the Chicago School's foundational framework. Through in-depth interviews and observations, we examine the experiences of new immigrants in Chicago, exploring how their social and economic contexts shape their involvement in crime. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between structural factors, such as poverty and lack of access to resources, and individual agency, as new immigrants navigate the challenges of settlement and integration. By centering the voices and perspectives of new immigrants, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which immigration shapes crime patterns and vice versa. The study's ethnographic approach offers a critical counterpoint to more quantitative and policy-focused research on immigration and crime, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of these issues.", "label": 0}
