{"grounding": "Recent years have seen increasing interest in, and scholarly discussion of, historical criminology. Yet there remains at present no clear, settled view as to what historical criminology entails, how it is best pursued, and what its future might hold. This article explores the several conceptions of historical criminology found in the present literature, which associate it variously with archival research, practical inquiry, a concern with temporality, and a certain approach to interdisciplinary scholarship. Adopting the view that historical criminology entails a special regard for historical time, the review goes on to assess its significance to the wider field, examining its connection with some of the core impulses of criminology at large. Finally, it suggests some major opportunities for historical criminology to contribute to the future development of criminology, including through an inclusive global criminology, a criminology of events, and research on crime and justice futures.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the scope and significance of historical criminology, a field that has been marginalized in recent years. By examining the evolution of criminal justice systems across different historical periods, this research highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between social, economic, and political factors that shape crime and punishment. Through an interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from sociology, history, and criminology, this study demonstrates the value of historical criminology in providing a nuanced understanding of the historical context of crime and justice. The findings of this research underscore the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the historical development of criminal justice systems, and highlight the potential for historical criminology to inform contemporary debates in the field. Future directions for the field are also discussed, including the potential for increased interdisciplinarity and a more critical examination of the historical roots of contemporary crime and justice policies.", "label": 0}
