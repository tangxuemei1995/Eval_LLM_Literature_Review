{"grounding": "An important body of work documents how race matters for the patterning of crime and criminal legal system involvement largely by focusing on comparisons between Blacks and Whites. We build on this vital scholarship by spotlighting Latino/a/xs, a fast-growing group that is the United States\u2019 largest racial minority, to broaden the field's understanding of race and crime. In this review, we follow race scholars who see Latino/a/xs as a racial category because dominant actors racialize them as an innate, distinct, inferior, and criminogenic category, leading to their marginalized experiences across many domains. Moreover, Latino/a/xs increasingly view themselves as not White. Studying Latino/a/xs offers an opportunity to integrate key tenets of Latina and Latino Critical Legal Theory (LatCrit), which provide a scaffolding to center race and racism. LatCrit highlights the ways racism metes out discrimination, cultural and linguistic devaluation, criminalization, and racial profiling that in turn shape and are shaped by levels of Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement. This article provides a description of what it means to center race with an emphasis on LatCrit,an empirical assessment of Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement, and an integration of core criminological theory with LatCrit. By doing so, we advance the field to more directly and robustly engage with the idea that racial disparities in crime and legal system involvement are products of racialization as well as attendant policies, institutions, and practices that historically and contemporaneously subjugate and marginalize the Latino/a/x population. We seek to push the boundaries of criminology theory and thereby invigorate and equip them for the twenty-first century and its racial landscape, which is increasingly Latino/a/x.", "generated_text": "This study seeks to contribute to the burgeoning field of criminology by integrating critical race theory (LatCrit) with existing criminological frameworks to provide a nuanced understanding of Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement. Drawing on the principles of LatCrit, this research examines the intersections of racism, ethnicity, and power in shaping the experiences of Latino/a/x individuals within the criminal justice system. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and empirical data, this study identifies the ways in which systemic racism and bias perpetuate disparities in arrest rates, sentencing, and incarceration rates among Latino/a/x populations. The findings of this research highlight the need for a more inclusive and equitable approach to criminological theory, one that acknowledges the complex and multifaceted nature of Latino/a/x identity and experiences. By centering the voices and perspectives of Latino/a/x individuals and communities, this study aims to challenge dominant narratives and power structures that have historically marginalized and excluded them from mainstream criminological discourse. Ultimately, this research seeks to contribute to a more just and equitable criminal justice system by promoting a deeper understanding of the ways in which race, ethnicity, and power intersect to shape the experiences of Latino/a/x individuals within the criminal justice system. The implications of this research have significant theoretical and practical applications for criminologists, policymakers, and community-based practitioners working to address the complex issues surrounding Latino/a/x crime and criminal justice system involvement.", "label": 1}
