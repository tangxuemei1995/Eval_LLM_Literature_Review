{"grounding": "This review focuses on government use of technology to observe, collect, or record potential criminal activity in real-time, as contrasted with \u201ctransaction surveillance\u201d that involves government efforts to access already-existing records and exploit Big Data, topics that have been the focus of previous reviews (Brayne 2018, Ridgeway 2018). Even so limited, surveillance technologies come in many guises, including closed-circuit television, automated license plate and facial readers, aerial cameras, and GPS tracking. Also classifiable as surveillance technology are devices such as thermal and electromagnetic imagers that can \u201csee\u201d through walls and clothing. Finally, surveillance includes wiretapping and other forms of communication interception. The following discussion briefly examines the limited evidence we have about the prevalence and effectiveness of these technologies and then describes the law governing surveillance, focusing principally on constitutional doctrine, and how it might\u2014and might not\u2014limit use of these technologies in the future.", "generated_text": "The proliferation of surveillance technologies has raised significant concerns regarding their impact on constitutional law, particularly with regards to the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. This study examines the intersection of surveillance technologies and constitutional law, with a focus on the implications of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biometrics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) on individual rights. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case law, this research identifies key areas of tension between the need for law enforcement to utilize surveillance technologies to prevent and investigate crime, and the need to protect individual privacy and constitutional rights. The findings of this study highlight the need for a nuanced and context-specific approach to regulating surveillance technologies, one that balances competing interests and ensures that constitutional rights are protected in an evolving technological landscape.", "label": 0}
