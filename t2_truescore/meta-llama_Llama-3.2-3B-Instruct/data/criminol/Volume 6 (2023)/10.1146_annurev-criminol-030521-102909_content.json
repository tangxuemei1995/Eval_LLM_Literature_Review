{"grounding": "The number of cross-national homicide studies is increasing rapidly. Many scholars, however, do not consider the details of how individual nations and the four main centralized homicide data sources\u2014raw estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database, adjusted estimates from the WHO Global Health Observatory, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and World Bank World Development Indicators\u2014generate national homicide rates and the impact this may have on results and the scientific record. We tested whether homicide trends, levels, and structural covariates are dependent on data source. We used 1990\u20132018 data in 5-year groupings and pooled them over time and nation. We utilized exploratory data analysis techniques to look for differences in homicide rates and trends. Then we employed seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to determine whether associations with homicide of typical structural covariates were dependent on homicide data source. Finally, we examined Wald Tests to determine whether differences in the sizes of the SUR coefficients from each data source were significantly different from zero. We found differences in homicide trends and rates by data source and that associations with homicide rates of structural covariates varied in significance, magnitude, and even direction depending on homicide data source. Cross-national homicideresearch has a promising future for understanding short- and long-term global and regional trends and population-level covariates and constructing theoretical explanations for geographical and temporal variation. However, researchers must better understand how national homicide data are generated by nations and these four data sources. All four systems possess limitations, but homicide data from the WHO Mortality Database present the most attractive option.", "generated_text": "The measurement of homicide is a critical aspect of cross-national research, as it can significantly impact the validity and generalizability of findings. This review and analysis examine the various methods and approaches used to measure homicide across different countries and contexts. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies that employed different homicide measurement techniques, including standardized surveys, crime reporting systems, and administrative data. The results show that the choice of measurement method can lead to significant differences in homicide rates, with some methods overestimating or underestimating the true value. The analysis also highlights the limitations of existing methods, including the lack of standardization and the impact of cultural and contextual factors on reporting practices. Furthermore, the review identifies the need for more nuanced and context-specific approaches to measuring homicide, taking into account the unique characteristics of each country and population. The findings of this study have important implications for cross-national research, highlighting the need for researchers to carefully consider the measurement methods used to ensure the validity and reliability of their findings. Ultimately, this review aims to contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable measures of homicide, which can inform policy and practice in the field of criminology and beyond.", "label": 0}
