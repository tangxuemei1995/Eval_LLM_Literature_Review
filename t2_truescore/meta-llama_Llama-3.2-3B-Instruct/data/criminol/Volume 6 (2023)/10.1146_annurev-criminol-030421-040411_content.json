{"grounding": "The allegation that criminal justice systems (and that of the United States in particular) have become guilty of overcriminalization is widely accepted by academics and practitioners on nearly all points along the political spectrum (Dillon 2012). Many commentators respond by recommending that states decriminalize given kinds of conduct that supposedly exemplify the problem. I urge those who are theoretically minded to proceed cautiously and address several preliminary matters that must be resolved before genuine progress is possible. In the absence of a position on several controversial normative and conceptual issues, discussions of overcriminalization and decriminalization are bound to be oversimplified and superficial. My review is organized around six of these issues. I invite commentators to examine (a) what the criminal law is; (b) what overcriminalization means; (c) why overcriminalization is thought to be pernicious; (d) whether overcriminalization is a de jure or de facto phenomenon, i.e., whether it is a function of the law on the books or the law in action; (e) what normative criteria might be invoked to alleviate the predicament; and (f) whether and to what extent overcriminalization is a serious concern in our penal system. Even though these six issues are analytically distinct, positions about one invariably blur into commitments about the others. Although theorists rarely dissent from the claim that states are guilty of something called overcriminalization, uncertainties about the foregoing topics mar their treatments. I conclude that a deep understanding of the problem of overcriminalization depends on how these six issues are resolved.", "generated_text": "Overcriminalization refers to the proliferation of laws that exceed the intended purpose of criminalizing a behavior, often resulting in the criminalization of previously acceptable actions. This phenomenon has sparked intense debate among scholars, policymakers, and practitioners, with concerns that it undermines the rule of law, erodes civil liberties, and perpetuates mass incarceration. This abstract provides an overview of six key questions surrounding overcriminalization, a complex and multifaceted issue that warrants further exploration. Firstly, what are the primary drivers of overcriminalization, and how do they intersect with other factors such as discretion, enforcement, and punishment? Secondly, how do the harms caused by overcriminalization manifest, and what are the most effective defenses against its negative consequences? Thirdly, what role do offense categories play in the perpetuation of overcriminalization, and how can they be reformed to promote more targeted and effective regulation. Fourthly, how do the relationships between criminalization, discretion, and enforcement contribute to overcriminalization, and what strategies can be employed to mitigate these effects. Fifthly, what are the implications of overcriminalization for punishment, and how can it be reformed to prioritize rehabilitation and restorative justice. Finally, what policy and legislative reforms can be implemented to address overcriminalization, and how can they be evaluated for their effectiveness in promoting more just and equitable outcomes. By examining these six questions, this abstract aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of overcriminalization and its far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and society as a whole.", "label": 0}
