{"grounding": "Understanding how biases originate in medical technologies and developing safeguards to identify, mitigate, and remove their harms are essential to ensuring equal performance in all individuals. Drawing upon examples from pulmonary medicine, this article describes how bias can be introduced in the physical aspects of the technology design, via unrepresentative data, or by conflation of biological with social determinants of health. It then can be perpetuated by inadequate evaluation and regulatory standards. Research demonstrates that pulse oximeters perform differently depending on patient race and ethnicity. Pulmonary function testing and algorithms used to predict healthcare needs are two additional examples of medical technologies with racial and ethnic biases that may perpetuate health disparities.", "generated_text": "This study examines the origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies, specifically pulse oximetry and pulmonary function testing. Structural racism and algorithmic bias in medical devices have been identified as key contributors to disparities in healthcare outcomes. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that the development and validation of pulmonary technologies have been influenced by societal and cultural norms, perpetuating existing health inequities. The use of biased algorithms and data-driven decision-making processes exacerbates these disparities, highlighting the need for diverse and inclusive approaches to the development and implementation of pulmonary technologies. Understanding the roots of bias is crucial for mitigating health disparities in pulmonary care.", "label": 1}
