{"grounding": "Chronic respiratory failure is a common, important complication of many types of neuromuscular and chest wall disorders. While the pathophysiology of each disease may be different, these disorders can variably affect all muscles involved in breathing, including inspiratory, expiratory, and bulbar muscles, ultimately leading to chronic respiratory failure and hypoventilation. The use of home assisted ventilation through noninvasive interfaces aims to improve the symptoms of hypoventilation, improve sleep quality, and, when possible, improve mortality. An increasing variety of interfaces has allowed for improved comfort and compliance. In a minority of scenarios, noninvasive ventilation is either not appropriate or no longer effective due to disease progression, and a transition to tracheal ventilation should be considered.", "generated_text": "Chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure is a debilitating condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness, leading to inadequate respiratory function. Home-assisted ventilation (HAV) has emerged as a viable treatment option, providing patients with the autonomy to manage their condition in a familiar environment. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) devices, such as bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), have been shown to improve respiratory outcomes and reduce hospitalization rates. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the effectiveness of HAV and NIV in managing chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure, highlighting the benefits and limitations of these interventions and their potential impact on quality of life.", "label": 1}
