{"grounding": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is an important subtype of myocardial infarction (MI) that occurs in approximately 6\u20138% of patients with spontaneous MI who are referred for coronary angiography. MINOCA disproportionately affects women, but men are also affected. Pathogenesis is more variable than in MI with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD). Dominant mechanisms include atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and coronary artery spasm. Management of MINOCA varies based on the underlying mechanism of infarction. Therefore, systematic approaches to diagnosis are recommended. The combination of invasive coronary angiography, multivessel intracoronary imaging, provocative testing for coronary spasm, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides the greatest diagnostic yield. Current clinical practice guidelines for the secondary prevention of MI are based largely on data from patients with MI-CAD. Thus, optimal medications after MINOCA are uncertain. Clinical trials focused on the treatment of patients with MINOCA are urgently needed to define optimal care.", "generated_text": "Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) is a clinical entity characterized by acute myocardial injury without evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Despite the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis, patients with MINOCA often present with symptoms of myocardial infarction, including chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The etiology of MINOCA remains unclear, but several mechanisms have been proposed, including coronary spasm, takotsubo syndrome, and microvascular dysfunction. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of MINOCA, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation. We also discuss the diagnostic challenges and the role of imaging modalities in identifying the underlying causes of MINOCA. Understanding the complexities of MINOCA is essential for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to identify novel therapeutic targets for this enigmatic condition.", "label": 1}
