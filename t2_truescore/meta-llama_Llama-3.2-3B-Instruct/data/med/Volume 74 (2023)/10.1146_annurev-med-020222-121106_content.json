{"grounding": "Transgender people often face barriers in health care due to lack of access to care, lack of knowledgeable healthcare professionals, discrimination, and gaps in medical and mental health research. Existing research on transgender health has focused heavily on mental health, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases/infections, and substance abuse. Gender-affirming hormone therapy and/or surgery allows for some alignment of biology and gender identity. Gender-affirming care may offer quality-of-life benefits, which may outweigh modest concerns related to exogenous hormone therapy. The Endocrine Society treatment guidelines were revised in 2017, and this article reviews recent data that might inform a future guideline revision. Future longitudinal research is needed to close the gap in knowledge in the field of transgender medicine.", "generated_text": "The 2017 Endocrine Society treatment guidelines for adult transgender individuals have significantly impacted the field of transgender medicine.

Emerging evidence suggests that hormone therapy can improve mental health outcomes, reduce symptoms of dysphoria, and enhance quality of life for transgender adults. This review highlights key updates to the 2017 guidelines and discusses the implications for clinical practice and future research in transgender medicine.", "label": 0}
