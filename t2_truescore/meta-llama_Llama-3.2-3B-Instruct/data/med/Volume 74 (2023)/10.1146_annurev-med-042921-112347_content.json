{"grounding": "Aging is associated with increased mutational burden in every tissue studied. Occasionally, fitness-increasing mutations will arise, leading to stem cell clonal expansion. This process occurs in several tissues but has been best studied in blood. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, which result if additional cooperating mutations occur. Surprisingly, it is also associated with an increased risk of nonmalignant diseases, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This may be due to enhanced inflammation in mutated innate immune cells, which could be targeted clinically with anti-inflammatory drugs. Recent studies have uncovered other factors that predict poor outcomes in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, such as size of the mutant clone, mutated driver genes, and epigenetic aging. Though clonality is inevitable and largely a function of time, recent work has shown that inherited genetic variation can also influence this process. Clonal hematopoiesis provides a paradigm for understanding how age-related changes in tissue stem cell composition and function influence human health.", "generated_text": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a condition characterized by the expansion of a small subset of hematopoietic stem cells, which can lead to various health consequences. Recent studies have highlighted the association between CHIP and an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as the potential for CHIP to contribute to the development of malignancy. The underlying mechanisms of CHIP involve epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, which can influence the clonal trajectories of hematopoietic stem cells. As individuals age, the frequency and impact of CHIP are expected to increase, further exacerbating the risk of age-related diseases. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of CHIP, its relationship with CAD and malignancy, and the role of DNA methylation in shaping clonal hematopoiesis. By elucidating the complex interactions between CHIP, epigenetics, and disease, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for future research into the impact of CHIP on human health.", "label": 1}
