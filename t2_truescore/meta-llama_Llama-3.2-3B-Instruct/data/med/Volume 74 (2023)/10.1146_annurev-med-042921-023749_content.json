{"grounding": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described in 1906 as a dementing disease marked by the presence of two types of fibrillar aggregates in the brain: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. The process of aggregation and formation of the aggregates has been a major focus of investigation ever since the discoveries that the tau protein is the predominant protein in tangles and amyloid \u03b2 is the predominant protein in plaques. The idea that smaller, oligomeric species of amyloid may also be bioactive has now been clearly established. This review examines the possibility that soluble, nonfibrillar, bioactive forms of tau\u2014the \u201ctau we cannot see\u201d\u2014comprise a dominant driver of neurodegeneration in AD.", "generated_text": "The accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of tau protein is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, yet the development of effective therapeutics remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of tau as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and progression monitoring. However, the complex interactions between tau and other disease-related proteins hinder the identification of a single, reliable biomarker. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of tau's role in Alzheimer's disease, its potential as a biomarker, and the ongoing efforts to develop tau-targeting therapeutics, with a focus on the latest advances in tau biology and disease modeling.", "label": 1}
