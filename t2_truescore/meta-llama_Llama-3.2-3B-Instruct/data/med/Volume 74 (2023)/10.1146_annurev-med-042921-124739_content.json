{"grounding": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral pathogen in the transplant population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CMV prevention is paramount; however, selecting the best preventive strategy depends on many factors including donor\u2013recipient CMV serostatus, transplant-specific risks, antiviral toxicities and cost. Novel CMV therapeutics such as letermovir (LTV) are desperately needed to optimize CMV management. Uniquely among CMV antiviral therapies, LTV inhibits the viral terminase complex in the CMV DNA synthesis pathway and disrupts viral genome packaging. Further, it lacks side effects frequently associated with other CMV antiviral therapies and evades common mechanisms of resistance. LTV is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CMV prevention in adult CMV-seropositive hematopoietic cell transplant recipients but is increasingly applied off-label for prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes important concepts of CMV management in transplantation, with a specific focus on LTV pharmacology and clinical experience to date alongside future prospects for its application.", "generated_text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains a significant threat to the health of transplant recipients, particularly those undergoing solid organ transplants and hematopoietic cell transplants. Letermovir, a potent antiviral agent, has emerged as a valuable tool in CMV prophylaxis and treatment. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the role of letermovir in preventing CMV disease in transplant recipients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, incorporating studies on the efficacy and safety of letermovir in solid organ transplant and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. The results indicate that letermovir is effective in reducing CMV disease incidence and severity, with a favorable safety profile. The use of letermovir as a prophylactic measure in high-risk transplant patients has been shown to be particularly beneficial. Overall, letermovir represents a valuable addition to the antiviral arsenal in the management of CMV infection in transplant recipients, offering a promising approach to preventing and treating this devastating disease.", "label": 1}
