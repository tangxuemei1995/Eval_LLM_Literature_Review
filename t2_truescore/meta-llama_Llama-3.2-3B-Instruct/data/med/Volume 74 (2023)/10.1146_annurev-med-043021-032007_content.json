{"grounding": "Increasing numbers of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth, from early puberty through late adolescence, are seeking medical services to bring their physical sex characteristics into alignment with their gender identity\u2014their inner sense of self as male or female or elsewhere on the gender spectrum. Numerous studies, primarily of short- and medium-term duration (up to 6 years), demonstrate the clearly beneficial\u2014even lifesaving\u2014mental health impact of gender-affirming medical care in TGD youth. However, there are significant gaps in knowledge and challenges to such care. Long-term safety and efficacy studies are needed to optimize medical care for TGD youth.", "generated_text": "Gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth has evolved to address the complex physical, emotional, and social needs of this population. Pubertal blockers, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, have been shown to effectively delay puberty, allowing for more informed decision-making regarding hormone treatment and surgical interventions. Gender-affirming hormone treatment, including estrogen and testosterone, has been demonstrated to improve mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. A comprehensive approach to care is essential, incorporating multidisciplinary teams and individualized treatment plans to optimize health and well-being for this vulnerable population.", "label": 0}
