{"grounding": "Maternal mortality is unusually high in the United States compared to other wealthy nations and is characterized by major disparities in race/ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic factors. Similar to other developed nations, the United States has seen a shift in the underlying causes of pregnancy-related death, with a relative increase in mortality resulting from diseases of the cardiovascular system and preexisting medical conditions. Improved continuity of care aimed at identifying reproductive-age women with preexisting conditions that may heighten the risk of maternal death, preconception management of risk factors for major adverse pregnancy outcomes, and primary care visits within the first year after delivery may offer opportunities to address gaps in medical care contributing to the unacceptable rates of maternal mortality in the United States.", "generated_text": "This study examines the trends and opportunities for prevention of maternal mortality in the United States. Analyzing data from 2015 to 2020, we found a significant increase in maternal mortality rates, with disparities persisting across racial and socioeconomic groups. Preconception health and counseling emerged as critical factors in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our findings suggest that targeted interventions, including preconception counseling and access to reproductive healthcare, can mitigate maternal mortality. Furthermore, addressing social determinants of health, such as poverty and lack of access to healthcare, is essential for reducing maternal mortality disparities. By understanding the trends and opportunities for prevention, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop effective strategies to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health outcomes in the US.", "label": 0}
