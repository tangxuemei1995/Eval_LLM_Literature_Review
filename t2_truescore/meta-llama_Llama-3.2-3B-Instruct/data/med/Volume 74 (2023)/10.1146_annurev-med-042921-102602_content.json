{"grounding": "Red blood cells transport O2 from the lungs to body tissues. Hypoxia stimulates kidney cells to secrete erythropoietin (EPO), which increases red cell mass. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) mediate EPO gene transcriptional activation. HIF-\u03b1 subunits are subject to O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation and then bound by the von Hippel\u2013Lindau protein (VHL), which triggers their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mutations in the genes encoding EPO, EPO receptor, HIF-2\u03b1, prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2), or VHL cause familial erythrocytosis. In addition to O2, \u03b1-ketoglutarate is a substrate for PHD2, and analogs of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inhibit hydroxylase activity. In phase III clinical trials evaluating the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease, HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors were as efficacious as darbepoetin alfa in stimulating erythropoiesis. However, safety concerns have arisen that are focused on thromboembolism, which is also a phenotypic manifestation of VHL or HIF-2\u03b1 mutation, suggesting that these events are on-target effects of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors.", "generated_text": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a leading cause of anemia, characterized by impaired erythropoiesis due to reduced erythropoietin (EPO) production. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays a crucial role in regulating EPO expression. In this context, HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHIs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance EPO production and alleviate anemia in CKD patients. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the HIF pathway's regulation of erythropoiesis and its modulation by genetic and pharmacological perturbations. We discuss the effects of PHIs on HIF-\u03b1 subunit stabilization, EPO gene transcription, and erythropoiesis in CKD models. Additionally, we examine the potential risks of thromboembolism associated with EPO therapy and the need for personalized treatment approaches. By integrating insights from basic and clinical research, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between the HIF pathway, EPO production, and erythropoiesis in CKD.", "label": 1}
