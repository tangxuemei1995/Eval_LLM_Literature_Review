{"grounding": "Billions of individuals worldwide have benefited from the unprecedented large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Given the sheer number of people that have received these vaccines, it is not surprising that rare side effects are reported that were not previously detected in the phase III vaccine trials. This review addresses one rare complication called SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It occurs in approximately 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 recipients of the adenovirus vector\u2013based COVID-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca-Oxford or Johnson & Johnson. Information on VITT syndrome was disseminated quickly via social media and publications after it was first discovered. Initial observations associating VITT with specific patient populations, thrombus locations, and outcomes associated with heparin therapy have since been refined with additional clinical experience. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of VITT.", "generated_text": "SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but serious immunologic complication associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Characterized by the presence of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, VITT has been reported in various studies, primarily in individuals who received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The pathogenesis of VITT is multifactorial, involving immune-mediated mechanisms and the presence of prothrombotic factors. This complication has been linked to the formation of antibodies against platelet surface antigens, leading to platelet activation and aggregation. Prompt recognition and management of VITT are crucial to prevent severe outcomes, including mortality. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of VITT and to develop effective strategies for prevention and treatment of this condition.", "label": 1}
