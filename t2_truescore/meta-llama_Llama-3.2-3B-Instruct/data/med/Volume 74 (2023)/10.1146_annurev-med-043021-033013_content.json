{"grounding": "In vivo gene therapy is rapidly emerging as a new therapeutic paradigm for monogenic disorders. For almost three decades, hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) have served as model disorders for the development of gene therapy. This effort is soon to bear fruit with completed pivotal adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene addition trials reporting encouraging results and regulatory approval widely anticipated in the near future for the current generation of HA and HB AAV vectors. Here we review the clinical development of AAV gene therapy for HA and HB and examine outstanding questions that have recently emerged from AAV clinical trials for hemophilia and other monogenic disorders.", "generated_text": "Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) gene therapy has emerged as a promising approach for treating hemophilia A and B, two inherited bleeding disorders caused by deficient factor VIII and IX proteins. By utilizing AAV vectors to deliver the genes encoding these clotting factors, researchers aim to restore normal hemostasis in affected individuals. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of AAV-mediated gene therapy in animal models of hemophilia, with significant improvements in bleeding symptoms and clotting factor production. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the translational potential of AAV gene therapy for hemophilia A and B, offering new hope for patients with this debilitating disease.", "label": 1}
