{"grounding": "Hepcidin, the iron-regulatory hormone, determines plasma iron concentrations and total body iron content. Hepcidin, secreted by hepatocytes, functions by controlling the activity of the cellular iron exporter ferroportin, which delivers iron to plasma from intestinal iron absorption and from iron stores. Hepcidin concentration in plasma is increased by iron loading and inflammation and is suppressed by erythropoietic stimulation and during pregnancy. Hepcidin deficiency causes iron overload in hemochromatosis and anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis. Hepcidin excess causes iron-restrictive anemias including anemia of inflammation. The development of hepcidin diagnostics and therapeutic agonists and antagonists should improve the treatment of iron disorders.", "generated_text": "Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis in the body. Dysregulation of hepcidin has been implicated in various health and disease states, including anemia and iron overload. This review highlights the complex interplay between hepcidin and iron, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced hepcidin expression. We discuss the clinical implications of hepcidin dysregulation, including its role in anemia of chronic disease and iron overload disorders, and explore potential therapeutic strategies for modulating hepcidin activity.", "label": 1}
