{"grounding": "Nearly half of Americans are projected to have obesity by 2030, underscoring the pressing need for effective treatments. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) represent the first agents in a rapidly evolving, highly promising landscape of nascent hormone-based obesity therapeutics. With the understanding of the neurobiology of obesity rapidly expanding, these emerging entero-endocrine and endo-pancreatic agents combined or coformulated with GLP-1 RAs herald a new era of targeted, mechanism-based treatment of obesity. This article reviews GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of obesity and previews the imminent future of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based anti-obesity therapeutics.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in the field of obesity treatment have led to the development of novel GLP-1 receptor agonists, dual receptor agonists, and triple receptor agonists, offering improved efficacy and reduced side effects compared to traditional antiobesity medications. Nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies (NuSH-based therapies) have also emerged as a promising approach, leveraging the body's natural response to nutrient intake to regulate appetite and metabolism. This review aims to summarize the current state of GLP-1 and NuSH-based therapies, highlighting their mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and future directions for obesity treatment.", "label": 1}
