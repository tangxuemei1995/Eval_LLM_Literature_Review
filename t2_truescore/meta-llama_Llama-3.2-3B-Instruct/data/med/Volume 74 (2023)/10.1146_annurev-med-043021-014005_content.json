{"grounding": "Heterogeneity in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is increasingly being recognized as one of the principal barriers to finding efficacious targeted therapies. The advent of multiple high-throughput biological data (\u201comics\u201d), coupled with the widespread access to increased computational power, has led to the emergence of phenotyping in critical care. Phenotyping aims to use a multitude of data to identify homogenous subgroups within an otherwise heterogenous population. Increasingly, phenotyping schemas are being applied to sepsis and ARDS to increase understanding of these clinical conditions and identify potential therapies. Here we present a selective review of the biological phenotyping schemas applied to sepsis and ARDS. Further, we outline some of the challenges involved in translating these conceptual findings to bedside clinical decision-making tools.", "generated_text": "Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are complex, heterogeneous conditions characterized by profound alterations in physiological and molecular phenotypes. Recent advances in critical care medicine have underscored the need for precision medicine approaches to tailor treatment strategies to individual patient subphenotypes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biological phenotyping of sepsis and ARDS, highlighting the importance of identifying distinct subphenotypes and their underlying molecular mechanisms. We discuss the role of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, in elucidating the phenotypic heterogeneity of these conditions. By integrating phenotypic data with clinical and outcome information, researchers and clinicians can develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for sepsis and ARDS, ultimately improving patient outcomes in critical care settings.", "label": 1}
