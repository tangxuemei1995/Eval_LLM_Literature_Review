{"grounding": "Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) have radically transformed the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed rare/ultrarare Mendelian diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), the technology integral for ES, GS, and most large (100+) gene panels, has enabled previously unimaginable diagnoses, changes in medical management, new treatments, and accurate reproductive risk assessments for patients, as well as new disease gene discoveries. Yet, challenges remain, as most individuals remain undiagnosed with current NGS. Improved NGS technology has resulted in long-read sequencing, which may resolve diagnoses in some patients who do not obtain a diagnosis with current short-read ES and GS, but its effectiveness is unclear, and it is expensive. Other challenges that persist include the resolution of variants of uncertain significance, the urgent need for patients with ultrarare disorders to have access to therapeutics, the need for equity in patient access to NGS-based testing, and the study of ethical concerns. However, the outlook for undiagnosed disease resolution is bright, due to continual advancements in the field.", "generated_text": "Undiagnosed syndromes pose a significant challenge in clinical practice, with many cases remaining unexplained despite extensive diagnostic evaluations. Exome and genome sequencing have emerged as powerful tools for identifying the underlying genetic causes of these enigmatic conditions. Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the rapid and cost-effective analysis of exomes and genomes, facilitating the detection of rare and ultrarare genetic variants. In this context, exome sequencing has been shown to be particularly effective in identifying Mendelian disease-causing mutations, which account for a significant proportion of undiagnosed cases. By leveraging these advanced sequencing technologies, clinicians can now rapidly and accurately diagnose a wide range of undiagnosed syndromes, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of exome and genome sequencing in the diagnosis of undiagnosed syndromes, highlighting its potential and limitations.", "label": 1}
