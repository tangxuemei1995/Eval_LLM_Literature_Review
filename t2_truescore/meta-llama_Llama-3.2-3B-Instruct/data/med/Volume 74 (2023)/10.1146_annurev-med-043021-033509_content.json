{"grounding": "The multifaceted interaction between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the endocrine system has been a major area of scientific research over the past two years. While common endocrine/metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes have been recognized among significant risk factors for COVID-19 severity, several endocrine organs were identified to be targeted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). New-onset endocrine disorders related to COVID-19 were reported while long-term effects, if any, are yet to be determined. Meanwhile, the \u201cstay home\u201d measures during the pandemic caused interruption in the care of patients with pre-existing endocrine disorders and may have impeded the diagnosis and treatment of new ones. This review aims to outline this complex interaction between COVID-19 and endocrine disorders by synthesizing the current scientific knowledge obtained from clinical and pathophysiological studies, and to emphasize considerations for future research.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in endocrine disorders, with SARS-CoV-2 infection affecting various endocrine glands, including the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary. Obesity, a significant risk factor for endocrine diseases, has been exacerbated by the pandemic-induced lifestyle changes and socioeconomic factors. Studies have reported an increase in thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, in COVID-19 patients. The adrenal gland's response to stress, as triggered by the pandemic, has also been implicated in the development of Cushing's syndrome. Furthermore, reproductive endocrine disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), have been observed in women affected by COVID-19. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine disorders, highlighting the need for further research into the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human health.", "label": 1}
