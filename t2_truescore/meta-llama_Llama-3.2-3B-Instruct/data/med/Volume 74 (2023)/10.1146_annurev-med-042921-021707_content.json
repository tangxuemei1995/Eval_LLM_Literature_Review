{"grounding": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different approaches with lentiviral vector\u2013mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation. Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality.", "generated_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin production, leading to debilitating anemia, organ damage, and increased mortality. Gene therapy offers a promising approach to treating SCD by correcting the underlying genetic defect. This review synthesizes diverse approaches to gene therapy of SCD, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant, gene editing, and lentiviral vector-based delivery systems. CRISPR-Cas9, a powerful gene editing tool, has been explored for precise modification of the HBB gene. Lentiviral vectors, capable of long-term gene expression, have been used to deliver therapeutic genes to hematopoietic stem cells. The efficacy and safety of these approaches are discussed, highlighting the potential for gene therapy to revolutionize the treatment of SCD, offering new hope for patients worldwide.", "label": 1}
