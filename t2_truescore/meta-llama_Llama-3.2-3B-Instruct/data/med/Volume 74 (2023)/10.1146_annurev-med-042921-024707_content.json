{"grounding": "Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is the second most common primary liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma and accounts for 2% of cancer-related deaths. BTCs are classified according to their anatomical origin into intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar, or distal cholangiocarcinoma, as well as gall bladder carcinoma. While the mutational profiles in these anatomical BTC subtypes overlap to a large extent, iCCA is notable for the high frequency of IDH1/2 mutations (10\u201322%) and the nearly exclusive occurrence of FGFR2 fusions in 10\u201315% of patients. In recent years, FGFR2 fusions have become one of the most promising targets for precision oncology targeting BTC, with FGFR inhibitors already approved in Europe and the United States for patients with advanced, pretreated iCCA. While the therapeutic potential of nonfusion alterations is still under debate, it is expected that the field of FGFR2-directed therapies will be subject to rapid further evolution and optimization. The scope of this review is to provide an overview of oncogenic FGFR signaling in iCCA cells and highlight the pathophysiology, diagnostic testing strategies, and therapeutic promises and challenges associated with FGFR2-altered iCCA.", "generated_text": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignant tumor of the bile duct, is characterized by its aggressive nature and limited treatment options. Recent studies have identified FGFR2 as a potential therapeutic target in this disease. FGFR2 mutations, fusions, and amplifications have been found in a subset of cholangiocarcinoma patients, suggesting a role for this receptor in tumor development and progression. In-frame deletions of the FGFR2 gene have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma. The RAS/MEK/EGFR signaling pathway is often dysregulated in cholangiocarcinoma, contributing to resistance to FGFR2 inhibition. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of FGFR2 in cholangiocarcinoma, including its molecular mechanisms, clinical significance, and potential therapeutic strategies. The development of targeted therapies, such as FGFR2 inhibitors, holds promise for improving treatment outcomes in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. However, the presence of resistance mechanisms, including RAS/MEK/EGFR signaling, must be addressed to maximize the efficacy of these therapies. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between FGFR2 and other signaling pathways in cholangiocarcinoma.", "label": 1}
