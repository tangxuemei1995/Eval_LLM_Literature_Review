{"grounding": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) were originally developed as antidiabetic agents, with cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials demonstrating improved CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Secondary analyses of CV outcome trials and later dedicated kidney outcome trials consistently reported improved kidney-related outcomes independent of T2D status and across a range of kidney function and albuminuria. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trials and real-world analyses demonstrating a decrease in the risk of acute kidney injury. The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors generally extend across different members of the class, possibly on the basis of hemodynamic, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in diverse patient populations.", "generated_text": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a groundbreaking therapeutic class for the management of kidney diseases, including diabetic and nondiabetic kidney disease. By inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose excretion, thereby decreasing the metabolic burden on the kidneys. This leads to a significant reduction in albuminuria, a key biomarker of kidney damage, and a slowing of the progression of kidney disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in improving kidney outcomes, including reduced risk of acute kidney injury and cardiovascular events. The mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors also suggests potential benefits in patients with nondiabetic kidney disease, making them a promising therapeutic option for a broader range of patients with kidney disease.", "label": 1}
