{"grounding": "In 2020, the nephrology community formally interrogated long-standing race-based clinical algorithms used in the field, including the kidney function estimation equations. A comprehensive understanding of the history of kidney function estimation and racial essentialism is necessary to understand underpinnings of the incorporation of a Black race coefficient into prior equations. We provide a review of this history, as well as the considerations used to develop race-free equations that are a guidepost for a more equity-oriented, scientifically rigorous future for kidney function estimation and other clinical algorithms and processes in which race may be embedded as a variable.", "generated_text": "This study examines the role of race in kidney function estimation, highlighting lessons learned and pathways toward health justice. Clinical algorithms often rely on race-based data, which can perpetuate health disparities. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms can inaccurately estimate kidney function in diverse populations. To address this issue, we propose a revised approach incorporating patient-specific factors and culturally sensitive data. By acknowledging the limitations of current methods, we aim to develop more equitable kidney function estimation tools, ultimately promoting health justice and improving outcomes for marginalized communities.", "label": 0}
