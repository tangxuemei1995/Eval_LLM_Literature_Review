{"grounding": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited multisystemic disease that can cause progressive bronchiectasis, pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, liver dysfunction, and other disorders. Traditional therapies focused on the treatment or prevention of damage to each organ system with incremental modalities such as nebulized medications for the lungs, insulin for diabetes, and supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. However, the advent of highly effective modulator therapies that target specific cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein malformations resulting from individual genetic mutations has transformed the lives and prognosis for persons with CF.", "generated_text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by defective CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) function, leading to respiratory and digestive complications. CF modulator therapies aim to correct CFTR function by targeting specific molecular mechanisms. Recent studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of CF modulator therapies, including ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and trikaftor, in combination with ivacaftor. These therapies have shown significant benefits in improving lung function and reducing CFTR-dependent chloride transport in patients with CF, offering new treatment options for this debilitating disease.", "label": 1}
