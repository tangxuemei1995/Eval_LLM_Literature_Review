{"grounding": "Shortly after the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019, clinicians rapidly recognized an apparent association between the disease and both arterial and venous thrombotic complications, which was confirmed in epidemiologic studies. Based on these data, hospitals empirically developed and implemented protocols with different strategies for anticoagulation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Subsequent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) clarified the role of anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and recently discharged from the hospital. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, observational comparative effectiveness analyses that provided hints of a benefit from anticoagulation, and finally the RCTs that established which patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation. These RCTs have demonstrated that hospitalized, noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation, but patients who are hospitalized and critically ill, discharged from the hospital, or not hospitalized do not benefit.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant risk of thrombotic complications, including venous and arterial thrombosis, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. These complications have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the need for effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and manage thrombotic events. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of COVID-19 thrombotic complications, including the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these events and the role of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in prevention and treatment. We discuss the evidence supporting the use of anticoagulants, such as low molecular weight heparin and direct oral anticoagulants, and platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, in patients with COVID-19. Our analysis highlights the importance of personalized treatment approaches, taking into account individual patient risk factors and clinical characteristics. By examining the current evidence and therapeutic strategies, this review aims to inform clinical practice and guide the development of novel treatments for COVID-19-related thrombotic complications.", "label": 1}
