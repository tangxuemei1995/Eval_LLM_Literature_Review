{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell therapy has transformed the management of relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. Despite high overall response rates, relapse post CAR T treatment remains a clinical challenge. Loss of target antigen, specifically CD19, is one well-defined mechanism of disease relapse. The mechanism of CD19 loss and which patients are at higher risk of CD19 loss remain poorly understood. To overcome CD19 loss, CARs targeting multiple antigens are being tested in clinical trials. CD19/20 and CD19/22 bispecific CARs demonstrate cytotoxicity against CD19-negative cells in preclinical studies. These CARs have also shown efficacy, safety, and a relatively low rate of CD19-negative relapse in phase I trials. These small studies suggest that multispecific CAR T cells can deprive lymphomas of escape via antigen loss. However, the selection of an ideal target, the right CAR construct, and whether these multispecific CARs can induce long-term remissions are still under investigation.", "generated_text": "Multispecific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for lymphoma treatment. By incorporating multiple binding sites, these cells can simultaneously target and eliminate multiple tumor antigens, thereby preventing escape via antigen loss. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of trispecific CAR T cells in depleting lymphoma cells of their antigenic repertoire. Our results demonstrate that trispecific CAR T cells effectively recognize and eliminate lymphoma cells expressing multiple tumor antigens, including CD19, CD20, and BCMA. Notably, the use of multispecific CAR T cells resulted in a significant reduction in antigen loss, as measured by flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing. These findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cells may offer a novel strategy for overcoming antigen loss and achieving long-term remission in lymphoma patients. The results of this study have important implications for the development of next-generation CAR T cell therapies.", "label": 1}
