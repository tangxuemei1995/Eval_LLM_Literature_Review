{"grounding": "Hundreds of different genetic causes of chronic kidney disease are now recognized, and while individually rare, taken together they are significant contributors to both adult and pediatric diseases. Traditional genetics approaches relied heavily on the identification of large families with multiple affected members and have been fundamental to the identification of genetic kidney diseases. With the increased utilization of massively parallel sequencing and improvements to genotype imputation, we can analyze rare variants in large cohorts of unrelated individuals, leading to personalized care for patients and significant research advancements. This review evaluates the contribution of rare disorders to patient care and the study of genetic kidney diseases and highlights key advancements that utilize new techniques to improve our ability to identify new gene\u2013disease associations.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in massively parallel sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of novel genetic variants associated with kidney disease. A collapsing analysis of genomic data from patients with chronic kidney disease revealed a previously unrecognized role for rare disorders in modulating disease progression. This study highlights the importance of integrating genomic information into precision medicine approaches for kidney disease. By examining the genetic underpinnings of collapsing disorders, researchers can identify novel therapeutic targets and develop more effective treatment strategies. The findings of this study have significant implications for the diagnosis and management of genetic kidney disease, and underscore the need for further investigation into the complex interplay between genetics and kidney function.", "label": 1}
