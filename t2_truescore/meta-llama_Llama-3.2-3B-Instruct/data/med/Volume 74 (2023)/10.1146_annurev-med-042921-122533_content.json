{"grounding": "This review discusses recent advancements in the field of valvular heart disease. Topics covered include recognition of the impact of atrial fibrillation on development and assessment of valvular disease, strategies for global prevention of rheumatic heart disease, understanding and management of secondary mitral regurgitation, the updated classification of bicuspid aortic valve disease, recognition of heightened cardiovascular risk associated with moderate aortic stenosis, and a growing armamentarium of transcatheter therapies.", "generated_text": "Valvular heart disease encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart valves, leading to impaired cardiac function and increased morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shed new light on the pathophysiology of valvular heart disease, highlighting the complex interplay between valve structure, function, and surrounding tissue. Novel therapeutic approaches, including minimally invasive interventions and targeted pharmacotherapies, are being explored to improve outcomes for patients with valvular heart disease.", "label": 0}
