{"grounding": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension but is frequently underrecognized and undertreated. Patients with PA are at a markedly increased risk for target organ damage to the heart and kidneys. While patients with unilateral PA can be treated surgically, many patients with PA are not eligible or willing to undergo surgery. Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are highly effective for treating PA and reducing the risk of target organ damage. However, steroidal MRAs are often underprescribed and can be poorly tolerated by some patients due to side effects. Nonsteroidal MRAs reduce adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetic kidney disease and are bettertolerated than steroidal MRAs. While their blood pressure\u2013lowering effects remain unclear, these agents may have a potential role in reducing target organ damage in patients with PA.", "generated_text": "Primary aldosteronism is a common endocrine disorder characterized by excessive production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid hormone that regulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure. This condition often leads to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have emerged as a therapeutic option for managing primary aldosteronism, as they effectively block the effects of aldosterone on the kidneys and heart. Studies have demonstrated that MRAs can reduce blood pressure, decrease left ventricular mass, and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with primary aldosteronism. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the role of MRAs in the management of primary aldosteronism, highlighting their potential benefits and limitations for patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease.", "label": 1}
