{"grounding": "Thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures are important in many fields of science and engineering. However, experimental data are scarce in this field, so prediction methods are vital. Different types of physical prediction methods are available, ranging from molecular models over equations of state to models of excess properties. These well-established methods are currently being complemented by new methods from the field of machine learning (ML). This review focuses on the rapidly developing interface between these two approaches and gives a structured overview of how physical modeling and ML can be combined to yield hybrid models. We illustrate the different options with examples from recent research and give an outlook on future developments.", "generated_text": "This study presents a novel approach to thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures by integrating machine learning algorithms with physical knowledge. A hybrid model is developed, combining the strengths of both machine learning and physical models to predict the thermodynamic properties of fluid mixtures. The model is trained on a large dataset of experimental data and physical parameters, allowing it to learn the underlying relationships between the variables. The results show that the hybrid model outperforms traditional physical models in predicting the thermodynamic properties of fluid mixtures, demonstrating the potential of combining machine learning with physical knowledge in thermodynamic modeling.", "label": 0}
