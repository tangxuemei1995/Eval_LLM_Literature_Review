{"grounding": "From the first clinical trial by Dr. W.F. Anderson to the most recent US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics, 2017) and Zolgensma (Novartis, 2019), gene therapy has revamped thinking and practice around cancer treatment and improved survival rates for adult and pediatric patients with genetic diseases. A major challenge to advancing gene therapies for a broader array of applications lies in safely delivering nucleic acids to their intended sites of action. Peptides offer unique potential to improve nucleic acid delivery based on their versatile and tunable interactions with biomolecules and cells. Cell-penetrating peptides and intracellular targeting peptides have received particular focus due to their promise for improving the delivery of gene therapies into cells. We highlight key examples of peptide-assisted, targeted gene delivery to cancer-specific signatures involved in tumor growth and subcellular organelle\u2013targeting peptides, as well as emerging strategies to enhance peptide stability and bioavailability that will support long-term implementation.", "generated_text": "Peptide-based vectors have emerged as a promising biomolecular engineering strategy for efficient gene delivery, particularly for intracellular targeting and silencing of specific genes. By leveraging the inherent properties of intracellular targeting peptides, these vectors can evade endosomal escape and deliver oligonucleotides, including siRNA and mRNA, directly to the target site within cells. This approach has shown significant potential in preclinical studies, demonstrating improved gene silencing efficacy and reduced off-target effects compared to traditional delivery methods. Furthermore, the use of peptide-based vectors has been explored in clinical trials, where they have shown promise in treating various diseases, including genetic disorders and cancer. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing the design and functionality of these vectors, with the ultimate goal of developing safe and effective peptide-based gene delivery systems for therapeutic applications. The integration of peptide-based vectors with other gene delivery technologies holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
