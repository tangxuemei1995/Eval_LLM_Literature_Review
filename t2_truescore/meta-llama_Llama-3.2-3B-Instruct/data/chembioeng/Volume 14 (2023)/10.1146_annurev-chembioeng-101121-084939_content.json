{"grounding": "Active colloids use energy input at the particle level to propel persistent motion and direct dynamic assemblies. We consider three types of colloids animated by chemical reactions, time-varying magnetic fields, and electric currents. For each type, we review the basic propulsion mechanisms at the particle level and discuss their consequences for collective behaviors in particle ensembles. These microscopic systems provide useful experimental models of nonequilibrium many-body physics in which dissipative currents break time-reversal symmetry. Freed from the constraints of thermodynamic equilibrium, active colloids assemble to form materials that move, reconfigure, heal, and adapt. Colloidal machines based on engineered particles and their assemblies provide a basis for mobile robots with increasing levels of autonomy. This review provides a conceptual framework for understanding and applying active colloids to create material systems that mimic the functions of living matter. We highlight opportunities for chemical engineers to contribute to this growing field.", "generated_text": "Active colloids, comprising self-propelled particles suspended in a fluid, have emerged as versatile models, materials, and machines exhibiting unique properties. These non-equilibrium systems, often driven by external stimuli or internal biochemical reactions, can exhibit complex behaviors such as collective motion, phase separation, and pattern formation. By studying active colloids, researchers have gained insights into the fundamental principles governing non-equilibrium thermodynamics, soft matter physics, and biological systems. The design and engineering of active colloids have also led to the development of novel materials with tunable properties, such as self-healing materials and adaptive coatings. Furthermore, active colloids have been explored as potential machines for tasks such as locomotion, sensing, and manipulation, offering a promising approach to the development of autonomous systems. This review provides an overview of the current state of active colloids, highlighting their potential applications and future research directions.", "label": 1}
