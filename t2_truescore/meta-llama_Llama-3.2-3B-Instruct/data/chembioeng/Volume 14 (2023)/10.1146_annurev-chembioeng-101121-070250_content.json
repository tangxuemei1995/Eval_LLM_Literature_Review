{"grounding": "Oxidative stress is an important and pervasive physical stress encountered by all kingdoms of life, including bacteria. In this review, we briefly describe the nature of oxidative stress, highlight well-characterized protein-based sensors (transcription factors) of reactive oxygen species that serve as standards for molecular sensors in oxidative stress, and describe molecular studies that have explored the potential of direct RNA sensitivity to oxidative stress. Finally, we describe the gaps in knowledge of RNA sensors\u2014particularly regarding the chemical modification of RNA nucleobases. RNA sensors are poised to emerge as an essential layer of understanding and regulating dynamic biological pathways in oxidative stress responses in bacteria and, thus, also represent an important frontier of synthetic biology.", "generated_text": "Oxidative stress is a critical challenge for bacterial survival, and RNA molecules have emerged as key sensors of this stress. Recent studies have highlighted the role of RNA oxidation in detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggering a stress response in bacteria. This review focuses on the emerging field of RNA sensors of oxidative stress, highlighting the mechanisms of ROS-mediated RNA oxidation and the downstream signaling pathways that regulate bacterial stress response. We discuss the potential applications of RNA sensors in synthetic biology, including the design of novel biosensors and therapeutic strategies for bacterial diseases. Understanding the intricate relationships between RNA, ROS, and stress response has far-reaching implications for the development of novel antibacterial therapies and the design of more resilient bacterial systems.", "label": 1}
