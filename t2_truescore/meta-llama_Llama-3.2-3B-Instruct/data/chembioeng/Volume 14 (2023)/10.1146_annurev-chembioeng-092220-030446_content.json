{"grounding": "Scientific and engineering capabilities in hydrocarbon supply chains developed over decades in international oil and gas companies (IOCs) uniquely position these companies to drive rapid scale-up and transition to a net-zero emission economy. Flexible large-scale production of energy carriers such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and other synthetic fuels produced with low- or zero-emission renewable power, nuclear energy, or hydrogen derived from natural gas with carbon capture and storage will enable long-distance transport and permanent storage options for clean energy. Use of energy carriers can overcome the inherent constraints of a fully electrified energy system by providing the energy and power densities, as well as transport and storage capacity, required to achieve energy supply and security in a net-zero emission economy, and over time allow optimization to the lowest cost for a consumer anywhere on the globe.", "generated_text": "The rapid transition to a net-zero emission energy system poses significant challenges for the global energy sector. International oil companies (IOCs) have a critical role to play in this transition, as they possess extensive expertise in energy production, transport, and storage. This study examines the potential contributions of IOCs to the net-zero emission energy transition, with a focus on their existing energy carrier assets, energy transport networks, and emerging energy storage technologies. Our analysis reveals that IOCs can leverage their existing infrastructure to support the transition to low-carbon energy sources, while also developing new business models and technologies to drive innovation and growth. By integrating their expertise with emerging low-carbon technologies, IOCs can play a vital role in achieving a net-zero emission energy system.", "label": 1}
