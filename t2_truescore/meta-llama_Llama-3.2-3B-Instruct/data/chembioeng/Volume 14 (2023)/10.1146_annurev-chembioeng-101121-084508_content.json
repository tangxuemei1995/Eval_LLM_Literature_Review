{"grounding": "There is growing interest in identifying antibodies that protect against infectious diseases, especially for high-risk individuals and pathogens for which no vaccine is yet available. However, pathogens that manifest as opportunistic or latent infections express complex arrays of virulence-associated proteins and are adept at avoiding immune responses. Some pathogens have developed strategies to selectively destroy antibodies, whereas others create decoy epitopes that trick the host immune system into generating antibodies that are at best nonprotective and at worst enhance pathogenesis. Antibody engineering strategies can thwart these efforts by accessing conserved neutralizing epitopes, generating Fc domains that resist capture or degradation and even accessing pathogens hidden inside cells. Design of pathogen-resistant antibodies can enhance protection and guide development of vaccine immunogens against these complex pathogens. Here, we discuss general strategies for design of antibodies resistant to specific pathogen defense mechanisms.", "generated_text": "The relentless pursuit of effective pathogen control has led to the development of innovative antibody engineering strategies. By leveraging Fc engineering techniques, researchers have successfully created bispecific antibodies that can simultaneously target and neutralize multiple pathogens, thereby enhancing passive immunization efficacy. Furthermore, the integration of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has opened new avenues for treating infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This review aims to provide an in-depth examination of the latest advancements in antibody engineering for pathogen control, with a focus on Fc engineering, bispecific antibodies, and ADCs. By exploring the underlying mechanisms and applications of these technologies, this review seeks to elucidate the potential of antibody engineering in outsmarting pathogens and revolutionizing the field of immunotherapy.", "label": 0}
