{"grounding": "In the past two decades, we have witnessed a rapid emergence of new and powerful photochemical and photocatalytic synthetic methods. Although these methods have been used mostly on a small scale, there is a growing need for efficient scale-up of photochemistry in the chemical industry. This review summarizes and contextualizes the advancements made in the past decade regarding the scale-up of photo-mediated synthetic transformations. Simple scale-up concepts and important fundamental photochemical laws have been provided along with a discussion concerning suitable reactor designs that should facilitate scale-up of this challenging class of organic reactions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the challenges and strategies for scaling up photochemical reactions from laboratory to industrial production. A comprehensive review of existing literature on photochemistry and photocatalysis reveals the importance of optimizing reaction conditions, catalyst design, and reactor design for efficient and cost-effective production. Flow chemistry techniques are also discussed as a promising approach for scaling up photochemical reactions. The findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the technical and economic barriers associated with scaling up photochemical reactions, enabling the transition to large-scale industrial production.", "label": 1}
