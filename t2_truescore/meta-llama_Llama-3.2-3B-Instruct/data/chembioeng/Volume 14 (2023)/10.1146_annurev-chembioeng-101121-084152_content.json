{"grounding": "Alternative polymer feedstocks are highly desirable to address environmental, social, and security concerns associated with petrochemical-based materials. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has emerged as one critical feedstock in this regard because it is an abundant and ubiquitous renewable resource. LCB can be deconstructed to generate valuable fuels, chemicals, and small molecules/oligomers that are amenable to modification and polymerization. However, the diversity of LCB complicates the evaluation of biorefinery concepts in areas including process scale-up, production outputs, plant economics, and life-cycle management. We discuss aspects of current LCB biorefinery research with a focus on the major process stages, including feedstock selection, fractionation/deconstruction, and characterization, along with product purification, functionalization, and polymerization to manufacture valuable macromolecular materials. We highlight opportunities to valorize underutilized and complex feedstocks, leverage advanced characterization techniques to predict and manage biorefinery outputs, and increase the fraction of biomass converted into valuable products.", "generated_text": "Lignocellulosic biomass has emerged as a promising feedstock for biorefineries, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil-based materials. The valorization of lignocellulosic biomass through biorefineries can produce a range of biobased polymers, including polyhydroxyalkanoates, polyesters, and polyamides. However, the engineering of these biorefineries poses significant challenges, including the optimization of biomass conversion pathways, the development of efficient enzymes, and the integration of downstream processing technologies. This review highlights the opportunities and challenges associated with the production of biobased polymers from lignocellulosic biomass, with a focus on life-cycle management and sustainability. The potential of biorefineries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve non-renewable resources, and promote circular economy principles is discussed, along with the need for further research and development to overcome the technical and economic barriers to large-scale deployment. By leveraging biobased polymer production, lignocellulosic biorefineries can play a critical role in shaping a more sustainable future.", "label": 1}
