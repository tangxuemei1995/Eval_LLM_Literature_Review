{"grounding": "Electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable chemicals and fuels driven by renewable energy plays a crucial role in achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Understanding the structure\u2013activity relationship and the reaction mechanism is significant for tuning electrocatalyst selectivity. Therefore, characterizing catalyst dynamic evolution and reaction intermediates under reaction conditions is necessary but still challenging. We first summarize the most recent progress in mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous CO2/CO reduction using in situ/operando techniques, including surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies, X-ray- and electron-based techniques, and mass spectroscopy, along with discussing remaining limitations. We then offer insights and perspectives to accelerate the future development of in situ/operando techniques.", "generated_text": "In situ/operando characterization techniques play a crucial role in elucidating the mechanistic insights of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Advanced characterization methods, such as in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and operando Raman spectroscopy, enable the direct observation of reaction intermediates and catalyst-electrolyte interactions. These techniques provide valuable information on the reduction mechanisms, reaction pathways, and the impact of catalyst and electrolyte properties on CO2 reduction efficiency. By combining these characterization methods, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the electrochemical CO2 reduction process, ultimately informing the development of more efficient and sustainable CO2 reduction catalysts and electrolytes.", "label": 1}
