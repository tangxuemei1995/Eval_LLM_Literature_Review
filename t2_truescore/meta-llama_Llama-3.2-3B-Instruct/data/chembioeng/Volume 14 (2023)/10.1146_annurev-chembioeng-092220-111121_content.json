{"grounding": "The storage of electric energy in a safe and environmentally friendly way is of ever-growing importance for a modern, technology-based society. With future pressures predicted for batteries that contain strategic metals, there is increasing interest in metal-free electrode materials. Among candidate materials, nonconjugated redox-active polymers (NC-RAPs) have advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, good processability, unique electrochemical properties, and precise tuning for different battery chemistries. Here, we review the current state of the art regarding the mechanisms of redox kinetics, molecular design, synthesis, and application of NC-RAPs in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Different redox chemistries are compared, including polyquinones, polyimides, polyketones, sulfur-containing polymers, radical-containing polymers, polyphenylamines, polyphenazines, polyphenothiazines, polyphenoxazines, and polyviologens. We close with cell design principles considering electrolyte optimization and cell configuration. Finally, we point to fundamental and applied areas of future promise for designer NC-RAPs.", "generated_text": "Nonconjugated redox-active polymers have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in energy storage and conversion.
