{"grounding": "One of the greatest concerns in the subzero storage of cells, tissues, and organs is the ability to control the nucleation or recrystallization of ice. In nature, evidence of these processes, which aid in sustaining internal temperatures below the physiologic freezing point for extended periods of time, is apparent in freeze-avoidant and freeze-tolerant organisms. After decades of studying these proteins, we now have easily accessible compounds and materials capable of recapitulating the mechanisms seen in nature for biopreser-vation applications. The output from this burgeoning area of research can interact synergistically with other novel developments in the field of cryobiology, making it an opportune time for a review on this topic.", "generated_text": "Engineered compounds have been designed to control ice nucleation and recrystallization, two critical processes in frozen food preservation and cryopreservation. By incorporating glyco-proteins, such as antifreeze proteins, into food matrices, researchers have successfully reduced ice nucleation rates and enhanced thermal hysteresis. These engineered compounds exhibit unique properties, including the ability to inhibit ice recrystallization, thereby maintaining a more uniform microstructure and texture. The application of these engineered compounds has significant implications for the development of novel food preservation strategies and cryoprotective agents, with potential benefits for industries such as food processing and pharmaceuticals.", "label": 0}
