{"grounding": "The central dogma of gene expression involves DNA transcription to RNA and RNA translation into protein. As key intermediaries and modifiers, RNAs undergo various forms of modifications such as methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation. These modifications, termed epitranscriptional regulations, lead to functional changes in RNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated crucial roles for RNA modifications in gene translation, DNA damage response, and cell fate regulation. Epitranscriptional modifications play an essential role in development, mechanosensing, atherogenesis, and regeneration in the cardiovascular (CV) system, and their elucidation is critically important to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CV physiology and pathophysiology. This review aims at providing biomedical engineers with an overview of the epitranscriptome landscape, related key concepts, recent findings in epitranscriptional regulations, and tools for epitranscriptome analysis. The potential applications of this important field in biomedical engineering research are discussed.", "generated_text": "Epitranscriptional regulation, a layer of gene expression beyond transcriptional control, plays a crucial role in cardiovascular health and disease. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of epitranscriptomic modifications, such as RNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, in regulating gene expression in cardiovascular tissues. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of epitranscriptional regulation in the cardiovascular system, with a focus on its implications for cardiovascular bioengineering. We discuss the mechanisms by which epitranscriptomic modifications influence cardiovascular gene regulation, including their impact on cardiac development, function, and disease. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of epitranscriptional regulation in cardiovascular bioengineering, including the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between epitranscriptional regulation and cardiovascular health, and underscore the need for further research in this area.", "label": 1}
