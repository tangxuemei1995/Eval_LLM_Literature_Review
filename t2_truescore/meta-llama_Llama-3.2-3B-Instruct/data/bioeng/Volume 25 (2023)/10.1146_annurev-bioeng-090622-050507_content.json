{"grounding": "Penetrating neural electrodes provide a powerful approach to decipher brain circuitry by allowing for time-resolved electrical detections of individual action potentials. This unique capability has contributed tremendously to basic and translational neuroscience, enabling both fundamental understandings of brain functions and applications of human prosthetic devices that restore crucial sensations and movements. However, conventional approaches are limited by the scarce number of available sensing channels and compromised efficacy over long-term implantations. Recording longevity and scalability have become the most sought-after improvements in emerging technologies. In this review, we discuss the technological advances in the past 5\u201310 years that have enabled larger-scale, more detailed, and longer-lasting recordings of neural circuits at work than ever before. We present snapshots of the latest advances in penetration electrode technology, showcase their applications in animal models and humans, and outline the underlying design principles and considerations to fuel future technological development.", "generated_text": "The development of penetrating neural electrodes has revolutionized the field of electrophysiology, enabling the recording of neural activity from deep brain regions with unprecedented spatial resolution. Recent advancements in materials science and fabrication techniques have led to the creation of electrodes that can penetrate large distances into the brain, paving the way for the study of complex neural circuits and the treatment of neurological disorders. However, the long-term viability and scalability of these electrodes remain significant challenges. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of penetrating neural electrodes, highlighting their applications in electrophysiology and the challenges associated with their large-scale deployment and chronic use. We discuss the latest developments in electrode design, fabrication, and implantation techniques, as well as the potential risks and benefits of these technologies.", "label": 1}
