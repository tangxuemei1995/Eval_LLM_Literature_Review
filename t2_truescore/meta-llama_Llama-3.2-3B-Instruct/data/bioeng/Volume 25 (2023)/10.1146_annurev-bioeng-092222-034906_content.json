{"grounding": "Accompanying the increasing translational impact of immunotherapeutic strategies to treat and prevent disease has been a broadening interest across both bioscience and bioengineering in the lymphatic system. Herein, the lymphatic system physiology, ranging from its tissue structures to immune functions and effects, is described. Design principles and engineering approaches to analyze and manipulate this tissue system in nanoparticle-based drug delivery applications are also elaborated.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of nanotechnologies in developing physiology-informed drug delivery systems targeting the lymphatic system. Engineered nanoparticles were designed to interact with lymph nodes, facilitating targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Bioengineered biomaterials were used to create a lymphatic conduit, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Results demonstrate improved therapeutic outcomes and reduced side effects, paving the way for innovative cancer treatments and immunomodulatory therapies.", "label": 0}
