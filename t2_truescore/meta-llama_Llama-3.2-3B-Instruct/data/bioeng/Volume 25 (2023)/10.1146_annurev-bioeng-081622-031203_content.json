{"grounding": "Hemolysis (i.e., red blood cell lysis) can increase circulatory levels of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) and its degradation by-products, namely heme (h) and iron (Fe). Under homeostasis, minor increases in these three hemolytic by-products (Hb/h/Fe) are rapidly scavenged and cleared by natural plasma proteins. Under certain pathophysiological conditions, scavenging systems become overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of Hb/h/Fe in the circulation. Unfortunately, these species cause various side effects such as vasoconstriction, hypertension, and oxidative organ damage. Therefore, various therapeutics strategies are in development, ranging from supplementation with depleted plasma scavenger proteins to engineered biomimetic protein constructs capable of scavenging multiple hemolytic species. In this review, we briefly describe hemolysis and the characteristics of the major plasma-derived protein scavengers of Hb/h/Fe. Finally, we present novel engineering approaches designed to address the toxicity of these hemolytic by-products.", "generated_text": "Hemolysis, a condition characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells, is a significant clinical concern. The accumulation of free heme and iron can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage. This study focuses on the development of engineered therapeutics to detoxify hemoglobin, heme, and iron. We designed and characterized a novel heme-binding protein, Hemopexin-iron chelator fusion protein (HICFP), which selectively binds to free heme and iron, preventing their release into the bloodstream. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the efficacy of HICFP in reducing oxidative stress and mitigating hemolysis. These findings suggest that engineered therapeutics targeting heme and iron detoxification may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating hemolytic disorders, and further research is warranted to explore their potential applications.", "label": 1}
