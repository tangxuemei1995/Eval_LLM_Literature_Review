{"grounding": "Over the past decade, the increased adoption of electroporation-based technologies has led to an expansion of clinical research initiatives. Electroporation has been utilized in molecular biology for mammalian and bacterial transfection; for food sanitation; and in therapeutic settings to increase drug uptake, for gene therapy, and to eliminate cancerous tissues. We begin this article by discussing the biophysics required for understanding the concepts behind the cell permeation phenomenon that is electroporation. We then review nano- and microscale single-cell electroporation technologies before scaling up to emerging in vivo applications.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in electroporation technologies have significantly expanded their applications from bench to clinic. Pulsed field ablation and electrochemotherapy have shown promise in treating various cancers, while microfluidics has improved transfection efficiency. Gene therapy has also benefited from electroporation, enabling targeted delivery of therapeutic genes. These innovations have paved the way for more effective and minimally invasive treatments, offering new hope for patients with previously untreatable diseases. Ongoing research continues to refine electroporation technologies for clinical applications.", "label": 0}
