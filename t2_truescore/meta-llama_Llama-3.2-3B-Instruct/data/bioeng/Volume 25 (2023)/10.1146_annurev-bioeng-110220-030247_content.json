{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are currently widely employed in medicine and healthcare. A PubMed search returns more than 100,000 articles on these topics published between 2018 and 2022 alone. Notwithstanding several recent reviews in various subfields of AI and ML in medicine, we have yet to see a comprehensive review around the methods\u2019 use in longitudinal analysis and prediction of an individual patient's health status within a personalized disease pathway. This review seeks to fill that gap. After an overview of the AI and ML methods employed in this field and of specific medical applications of models of this type, the review discusses the strengths and limitations of current studies and looks ahead to future strands of research in this field. We aim to enable interested readers to gain a detailed impression of the research currently available and accordingly plan future work around predictive models for deterioration in health status.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the application of predictive models in understanding disease pathways and trajectories, with a focus on personalized medicine. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and time series analysis, we aim to identify key factors contributing to health deterioration and develop tailored interventions. Our analysis reveals that digital health pathways play a crucial role in predicting disease progression, and that incorporating artificial intelligence can enhance the accuracy of disease trajectory forecasting. The findings of this research have significant implications for the development of personalized medicine approaches, enabling healthcare providers to make data-driven decisions and provide targeted interventions. By integrating machine learning and time series analysis, we can improve patient outcomes and enhance the overall effectiveness of healthcare systems.", "label": 0}
