{"grounding": "Photoacoustic techniques have shown promise in identifying molecular changes in bone tissue and visualizing tissue microstructure. This capability represents significant advantages over gold standards (i.e., dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) for bone evaluation without requiring ionizing radiation. Instead, photoacoustic imaging uses light to penetrate through bone, followed by acoustic pressure generation, resulting in highly sensitive optical absorption contrast in deep biological tissues. This review covers multiple bone-related photoacoustic imaging contributions to clinical applications, spanning bone cancer, joint pathologies, spinal disorders, osteoporosis, bone-related surgical guidance, consolidation monitoring, and transsphenoidal and transcranial imaging. We also present a summary of photoacoustic-based techniques for characterizing biomechanical properties of bone, including temperature, guided waves, spectral parameters, and spectroscopy. We conclude with a future outlook based on the current state of technological developments, recent achievements, and possible new directions.", "generated_text": "Photoacoustic imaging and characterization of bone in medicine has emerged as a promising non-invasive technique for assessing bone health and detecting various bone-related disorders. This review provides an overview of the principles, applications, and current state of photoacoustic imaging in bone characterization. Quantitative ultrasound is highlighted as a key technology for photoacoustic imaging, enabling accurate bone density and composition measurements. Spectral unmixing is also discussed as a crucial post-processing technique for separating overlapping spectral signals and improving image quality. The applications of photoacoustic imaging in bone characterization are diverse, including osteoporosis diagnosis, bone tumor detection, and monitoring of bone healing. The outlook for this technology is promising, with ongoing research focused on improving image resolution, reducing acquisition times, and expanding its clinical utility.", "label": 1}
