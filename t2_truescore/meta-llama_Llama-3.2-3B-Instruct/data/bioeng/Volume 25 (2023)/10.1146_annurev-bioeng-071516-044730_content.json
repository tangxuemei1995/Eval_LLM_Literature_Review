{"grounding": "Over the last half century, the autofluorescence of the metabolic cofactors NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) has been quantified in a variety of cell types and disease states. With the spread of nonlinear optical microscopy techniques in biomedical research, NADH and FAD imaging has offered an attractive solution to noninvasively monitor cell and tissue status and elucidate dynamic changes in cell or tissue metabolism. Various tools and methods to measure the temporal, spectral, and spatial properties of NADH and FAD autofluorescence have been developed. Specifically, an optical redox ratio of cofactor fluorescence intensities and NADH fluorescence lifetime parameters have been used in numerous applications, but significant work remains to mature this technology for understanding dynamic changes in metabolism. This article describes the current understanding of our optical sensitivity to different metabolic pathways and highlights current challenges in the field. Recent progress in addressing these challenges and acquiring more quantitative information in faster and more metabolically relevant formats is also discussed.", "generated_text": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging enables the non-invasive monitoring of cellular and tissue-level metabolic processes, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of energy metabolism. This approach leverages the inherent autofluorescence and fluorescence lifetime properties of biomolecules, such as NADH and FAD, to detect changes in redox state and metabolic flux. Multiphoton microscopy and two-photon excited fluorescence techniques have been employed to visualize metabolic processes in cells and tissues with high spatial and temporal resolution. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of label-free optical metabolic imaging in monitoring glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in real-time, allowing for the elucidation of metabolic network dynamics and the identification of key regulatory nodes. The application of this approach has far-reaching implications for the study of metabolic disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, enabling the development of novel therapeutic strategies and diagnostic tools. By elucidating the intricate relationships between metabolic processes and tissue function, label-free optical metabolic imaging holds promise for advancing our understanding of the complex interplay between metabolism and disease.", "label": 0}
