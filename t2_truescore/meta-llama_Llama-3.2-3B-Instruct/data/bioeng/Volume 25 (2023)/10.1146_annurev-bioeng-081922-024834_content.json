{"grounding": "A shift in the traditional technocentric view of medical device design to a human-centered one is needed to bridge existing translational gaps and improve health equity. To ensure the successful and equitable adoption of health technology innovations, engineers must think beyond the device and the direct end user and must seek a more holistic understanding of broader stakeholder needs and the intended context of use early in a design process. The objectives of this review article are (a) to provide rationale for the need to incorporate meaningful stakeholder analysis and contextual investigation in health technology development and biomedical engineering pedagogy, (b) to review existing frameworks and human- and equity-centered approaches to stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation for improved adoption of innovative technologies, and (c) to present case studyexamples of medical device design that apply these approaches to bridge the gaps between biomedical engineers and the contexts for which they are designing.", "generated_text": "The proliferation of health technologies has transformed the way healthcare is delivered, but their impact on diverse populations remains a pressing concern. This overview synthesizes human- and equity-centered approaches for health technology design, highlighting the importance of contextual investigation and community engagement. By prioritizing stakeholder involvement, researchers and designers can develop technologies that address the unique needs of marginalized communities. A review of existing literature reveals that equity-centered engineering can foster more inclusive and effective health technologies. Contextual investigation and community engagement are critical components of this approach, enabling designers to understand the social, cultural, and environmental contexts in which technologies will be used. By adopting a human- and equity-centered design paradigm, health technologies can be created that promote health equity, improve health outcomes, and address the social determinants of health.", "label": 0}
