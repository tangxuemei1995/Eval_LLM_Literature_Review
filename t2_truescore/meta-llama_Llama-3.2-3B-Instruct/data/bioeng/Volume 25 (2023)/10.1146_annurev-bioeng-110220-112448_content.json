{"grounding": "Energy-efficient sensing with physically secure communication for biosensors on, around, and within the human body is a major area of research for the development of low-cost health care devices, enabling continuous monitoring and/or secure perpetual operation. When used as a network of nodes, these devices form the Internet of Bodies, which poses challenges including stringent resource constraints, simultaneous sensing and communication, and security vulnerabilities. Another major challenge is to find an efficient on-body energy-harvesting method to support the sensing, communication, and security submodules. Due to limitations in the amount of energy harvested, we require a reduction in energy consumed per unit information, making the use of in-sensor analytics and processing imperative. In this article, we review the challenges and opportunities of low-power sensing, processing, and communication with possible powering modalities for future biosensor nodes. Specifically, we analyze, compare, and contrast (a) different sensing mechanisms such as voltage/current domain versus time domain, (b) low-power, secure communication modalities including wireless techniques and human body communication, and (c) different powering techniques for wearable devices and implants.", "generated_text": "The Internet of Bodies (IoB) is a rapidly emerging paradigm that integrates wearable and implantable devices to monitor and manage human health. Bioelectronic sensor nodes play a crucial role in this ecosystem, enabling real-time sensing, in-sensor analytics, and computation. These nodes integrate advanced biosensing technologies with miniaturized computing and communication capabilities, facilitating the exchange of vast amounts of data between devices and the cloud. However, the security and powering of these nodes pose significant challenges. This review provides an overview of the current state of bioelectronic sensor nodes for the IoB, highlighting recent advances in sensing technologies, in-sensor analytics, and power management. We discuss the implications of these advancements for IoB applications, including health monitoring, disease diagnosis, and personalized medicine. The review also explores the security challenges associated with IoB devices and proposes potential solutions for secure communication and data protection. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and challenges presented by bioelectronic sensor nodes in the IoB.", "label": 1}
