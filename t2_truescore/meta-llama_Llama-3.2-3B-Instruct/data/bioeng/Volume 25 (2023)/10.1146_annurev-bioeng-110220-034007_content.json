{"grounding": "Lipids are essential cellular components forming membranes, serving as energy reserves, and acting as chemical messengers. Dysfunction in lipid metabolism and signaling is associated with a wide range of diseases including cancer and autoimmunity. Heterogeneity in cell behavior including lipid signaling is increasingly recognized as a driver of disease and drug resistance. This diversity in cellular responses as well as the roles of lipids in health and disease drive the need to quantify lipids within single cells. Single-cell lipid assays are challenging due to the small size of cells (\u223c1 pL) and the large numbers of lipid species present at concentrations spanning orders of magnitude. A growing number of methodologies enable assay of large numbers of lipid analytes, perform high-resolution spatial measurements, or permit highly sensitive lipid assays in single cells. Covered in this review are mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, and fluorescence-based assays including microscopy and microseparations.", "generated_text": "Single-cell biochemical assays of lipids are crucial for understanding lipid metabolism and function at the cellular level. This review highlights recent advances in analytical techniques for lipid analysis in single cells. Mass spectrometry-based methods, including tandem mass spectrometry and single-cell mass spectrometry, enable the identification and quantification of lipids in individual cells. Raman imaging and spectroscopy provide spatially resolved information on lipid distribution and composition. Capillary electrophoresis and thin layer chromatography are used for the separation and detection of lipids in single cells. These techniques have been applied to various biological systems, including cancer cells, stem cells, and immune cells. The combination of these techniques offers a powerful tool for understanding lipid biology at the single-cell level, enabling the discovery of novel lipid biomarkers and the development of new therapeutic strategies. This review provides an overview of the current state of the art in single-cell lipid analysis and highlights future directions for research.", "label": 1}
