{"grounding": "Brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to treat sensorimotor neurological disorders by creating artificial motor and/or sensory pathways. Introducing artificial pathways creates new relationships between sensory input and motor output, which the brain must learn to gain dexterous control. This review highlights the role of learning in BMIs to restore movement and sensation, and discusses how BMI design may influence neural plasticity and performance. The close integration of plasticity in sensory and motor function influences the design of both artificial pathways and will be an essential consideration for bidirectional devices that restore both sensory and motor function.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the neural plasticity underlying sensorimotor brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs), with a focus on sensory and motor learning. By analyzing neural activity in individuals with BMIs, we demonstrate significant reorganization of neural circuits in response to repeated training sessions. Our findings suggest that neural plasticity plays a crucial role in improving BMI performance, particularly in sensory processing. These results have implications for the development of more effective BMIs and highlight the potential for neural plasticity to be harnessed for neuroprosthetic applications.", "label": 0}
