{"grounding": "Although sex differences have been noted in cellular function and behavior, therapy efficacy, and disease incidence and outcomes, the adoption of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine remains limited. Furthering the development of personalized, precision medicine requires considering biological sex at the bench and in the clinic. This review provides the basis for considering biological sex when designing tissue-engineered constructs and regenerative therapies by contextualizing sex as a biological variable within the tissue engineering triad of cells, matrices, and signals. To achieve equity in biological sex within medicine requires a cultural shift in science and engineering research, with active engagement by researchers, clinicians, companies, policymakers, and funding agencies.", "generated_text": "Sex as a biological variable plays a crucial role in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, influencing the development and function of engineered tissues. Sexual dimorphism and sex differences in gene expression, hormone levels, and cellular behavior necessitate the use of sex-specific tissue models and stem cell populations. This review highlights the importance of considering sex characteristics in the design and optimization of tissue engineering strategies, including the selection of appropriate cell types, growth factors, and biomaterials. By accounting for sex differences, researchers can improve the efficacy and translational potential of regenerative therapies, ultimately leading to more effective treatments for sex-related diseases and disorders.", "label": 0}
