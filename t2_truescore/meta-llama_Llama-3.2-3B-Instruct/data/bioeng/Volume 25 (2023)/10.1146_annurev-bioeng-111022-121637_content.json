{"grounding": "Neurotechnologies for treating pain rely on electrical stimulation of the central or peripheral nervous system to disrupt or block pain signaling and have been commercialized to treat a variety of pain conditions. While their adoption is accelerating, neurotechnologies are still frequently viewed as a last resort, after many other treatment options have been explored. We review the pain conditions commonly treated with electrical stimulation, as well as the specific neurotechnologies used for treating those conditions. We identify barriers to adoption, including a limited understanding of mechanisms of action, inconsistent efficacy across patients, and challenges related to selectivity of stimulation and off-target side effects. We describe design improvements that have recently been implemented, as well as some cutting-edge technologies that may address the limitations of existing neurotechnologies. Addressing these challenges will accelerate adoption and change neurotechnologies from last-line to first-line treatments for people living with chronic pain.", "generated_text": "Chronic pain is a debilitating condition affecting millions worldwide, with current treatments often yielding limited success. Recent advancements in neurotechnology have provided novel approaches to pain management, targeting both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promise in reducing chronic pain by modulating brain activity, while spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) offer peripheral-based interventions. These technologies have been shown to improve pain outcomes in various patient populations. However, the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their efficacy. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of neurotechnology for pain management, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of these interventions. By examining the existing literature, we hope to inform the development of personalized treatment plans for patients with chronic pain.", "label": 1}
