{"grounding": "The immune system of multicellular organisms protects them from harmful microbes. To establish an infection in the face of host immune responses, pathogens must evolve specific strategies to target immune defense mechanisms. One such defense is the formation of intracellular protein complexes, termed inflammasomes, that are triggered by the detection of microbial components and the disruption of homeostatic processes that occur during bacterial infection. Formation of active inflammasomes initiates programmed cell death pathways via activation of inflammatory caspases and cleavage of target proteins. Inflammasome-activated cell death pathways such as pyroptosis lead to proinflammatory responses that protect the host. Bacterial infection has the capacity to influence inflammasomes in two distinct ways: activation and perturbation. In this review, we discuss how bacterial activities influence inflammasomes, and we discuss the consequences of inflammasome activation or evasion for both the host and pathogen.", "generated_text": "The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in the activation of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of bacterial components in modulating inflammasome signaling, with certain bacterial influencers capable of either promoting or inhibiting inflammasome activation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of bacterial influencers of inflammasome signaling, focusing on the key players such as gasdermin, NLR proteins, and caspases 1 and 8. The mechanisms by which these bacterial components interact with the inflammasome and modulate its activity are discussed, highlighting the complex interplay between host and pathogen in the regulation of pyroptosis. The implications of these findings for our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies are also explored.", "label": 1}
