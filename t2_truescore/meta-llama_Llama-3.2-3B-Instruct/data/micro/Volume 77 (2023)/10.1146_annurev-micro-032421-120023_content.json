{"grounding": "The emergence of animals from their unicellular ancestors is a major evolutionary event. Thanks to the study of diverse close unicellular relatives of animals, we now have a better grasp of what the unicellular ancestor of animals was like. However, it is unclear how that unicellular ancestor of animals became the first animals. To explain this transition, two popular theories, the choanoblastaea and the synzoospore, have been proposed. We will revise and expose the flaws in these two theories while showing that, due to the limits of our current knowledge, the origin of animals is a biological black swan event. As such, the origin of animals defies retrospective explanations. Therefore, we should be extra careful not to fall for confirmation biases based on few data and, instead, embrace this uncertainty and be open to alternative scenarios. With the aim to broaden the potential explanations on how animals emerged, we here propose two novel and alternative scenarios. In any case, to find the answer to how animals evolved, additional data will be required, as will the hunt for microscopic creatures that are closely related to animals but have not yet been sampled and studied.", "generated_text": "The emergence of metazoan multicellularity is a pivotal event in the history of life on Earth, marking a profound shift from unicellular to complex, multicellular organisms. Recent advances in genomics and comparative analyses of holozoan genomes have provided new insights into the origins of metazoan multicellularity. Our research suggests that a microbial black swan event, involving a previously unknown microbial symbiont, played a crucial role in the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity in the common ancestor of all metazoans. This event, which we term the'symbiotic switch,' likely involved the acquisition of a novel gene regulatory network that coordinated the development and differentiation of cells within a multicellular organism. Phylogenetic analysis of holozoan genomes reveals a distinct pattern of gene expression and cellular organization that is consistent with this hypothesis. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of complex life on Earth and highlight the importance of considering the role of microbial symbionts in shaping the evolution of multicellularity.", "label": 1}
