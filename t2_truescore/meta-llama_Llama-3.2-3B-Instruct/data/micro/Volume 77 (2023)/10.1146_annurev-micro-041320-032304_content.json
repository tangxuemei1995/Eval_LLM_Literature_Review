{"grounding": "Related groups of microbes are widely distributed across Earth's habitats, implying numerous dispersal and adaptation events over evolutionary time. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics and mechanisms of these habitat transitions, particularly for populations that reside in animal microbiomes. Here, we review the literature concerning habitat transitions among a variety of bacterial and archaeal lineages, considering the frequency of migration events, potential environmental barriers, and mechanisms of adaptation to new physicochemical conditions, including the modification of protein inventories and other genomic characteristics. Cells dependent on microbial hosts, particularly bacteria from the Candidate Phyla Radiation, have undergone repeated habitat transitions from environmental sources into animal microbiomes. We compare their trajectories to those of both free-living cells\u2014including the Melainabacteria, Elusimicrobia, and methanogenic archaea\u2014and cellular endosymbionts and bacteriophages, which have made similar transitions. We conclude by highlighting major related topics that may be worthy of future study.", "generated_text": "The evolution of bacteria and archaea has been shaped by their ability to adapt to changing environments and transition between different habitats. The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) event, a period of rapid diversification of microbial life, is thought to have occurred in response to habitat transition and dispersal. This transition has been driven by environmental factors such as climate change, geological events, and the formation of new ecosystems. The human microbiome, in particular, has undergone significant changes in response to habitat transition, with shifts in the composition of microbial communities in response to diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. This review aims to explore the relationship between habitat transition and microbial evolution, with a focus on the CPR event and its impact on the human microbiome. By examining the mechanisms of dispersal and adaptation, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and their environments.", "label": 1}
