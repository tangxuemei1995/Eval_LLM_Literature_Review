{"grounding": "For thousands of years, humans have enjoyed the novel flavors, increased shelf-life, and nutritional benefits that microbes provide in fermented foods and beverages. Recent sequencing surveys of ferments have mapped patterns of microbial diversity across space, time, and production practices. But a mechanistic understanding of how fermented food microbiomes assemble has only recently begun to emerge. Using three foods as case studies (surface-ripened cheese, sourdough starters, and fermented vegetables), we use an ecological and evolutionary framework to identify how microbial communities assemble in ferments. By combining in situ sequencing surveys with in vitro models, we are beginning to understand how dispersal, selection, diversification, and drift generate the diversity of fermented food communities. Most food producers are unaware of the ecological processes occurring in their production environments, but the theory and models of ecology and evolution can provide new approaches for managing fermented food microbiomes, from farm to ferment.", "generated_text": "The assembly of microbial communities in fermented foods is a complex process influenced by various factors, including food composition, processing conditions, and environmental interactions. This review focuses on the microbiome assembly in fermented foods, with a particular emphasis on cheese and sourdough. The microbial communities in these fermented products are shaped by the interactions between microorganisms, including lactic acid bacteria, yeast, and other microorganisms. The assembly of these communities is influenced by factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of community assembly in determining the flavor, texture, and nutritional properties of fermented foods. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of microbiome assembly in fermented foods, with a focus on cheese and sourdough, and to discuss the implications for the production of high-quality fermented products. The review also explores the potential applications of microbiome assembly in the development of new fermented foods and the improvement of existing ones.", "label": 1}
