{"grounding": "Among endosymbiotic bacteria living within eukaryotic cells, Wolbachia is exceptionally widespread, particularly in arthropods. Inherited through the female germline, it has evolved ways to increase the fraction of bacterially infected offspring by inducing parthenogenesis, feminization, male killing, or, most commonly, cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In CI, Wolbachia infection of males causes embryonic lethality unless they mate with similarly infected females, creating a relative reproductive advantage for infected females. A set of related Wolbachia bicistronic operons encodes the CI-inducing factors. The downstream gene encodes a deubiquitylase or nuclease and is responsible for CI induction by males, while the upstream product when expressed in females binds its sperm-introduced cognate partner and rescues viability. Both toxin-antidote and host-modification mechanisms have been proposed to explain CI. Interestingly, male killing by either Spiroplasma or Wolbachia endosymbionts involves deubiquitylases as well. Interference with the host ubiquitin system may therefore be a common theme among endosymbiont-mediated reproductive alterations.", "generated_text": "Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is a reproductive barrier that arises when a female insect harbors a male-specific Wolbachia endosymbiont, leading to reduced fertility or sterility in infected males. This phenomenon is mediated by Wolbachia's toxin, which disrupts male germ cell development and function. The nuclease activity of Wolbachia is also implicated in CI, as it degrades male-specific RNA molecules, further inhibiting male fertility. Deubiquitylases, enzymes that remove ubiquitin tags, have been shown to play a role in regulating Wolbachia's toxin activity. The male-killing toxin of Wolbachia is a key factor in CI, as it induces apoptosis in infected male germ cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CI is crucial for elucidating the evolutionary pressures driving the co-evolution of Wolbachia and its insect hosts. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular biology of CI, highlighting the complex interplay between Wolbachia's toxin, nuclease, and deubiquitylase activities in mediating this reproductive barrier.", "label": 1}
