{"grounding": "Amino acids are indispensable substrates for protein synthesis in all organisms and incorporated into diverse aspects of metabolic physiology and signaling. However, animals lack the ability to synthesize several of them and must acquire these essential amino acids from their diet or perhaps their associated microbial communities. The essential amino acids therefore occupy a unique position in the health of animals and their relationships with microbes. Here we review recent work connecting microbial production and metabolism of essential amino acids to host biology, and the reciprocal impacts of host metabolism of essential amino acids on their associated microbes. We focus on the roles of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) and tryptophan on host-microbe communication in the intestine of humans and other vertebrates. We then conclude by highlighting research questions surrounding the less-understood aspects of microbial essential amino acid synthesis in animal hosts.", "generated_text": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in modulating host physiology through the production of metabolites from essential amino acids. Valine, isoleucine, leucine, and tryptophan are essential amino acids that are metabolized by gut microbiota to produce various metabolites, including branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolites and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). These metabolites have been shown to influence host immune responses, neurotransmitter production, and energy metabolism. Specifically, leucine and isoleucine metabolites have been implicated in regulating host immune function, while valine metabolites have been linked to the production of serotonin, a key neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation. The gut microbiome's ability to metabolize tryptophan to serotonin highlights the complex interplay between host-microbe interactions and the production of neurotransmitters. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which these metabolites influence host physiology and to explore their potential as therapeutic targets for modulating the gut microbiome.", "label": 0}
