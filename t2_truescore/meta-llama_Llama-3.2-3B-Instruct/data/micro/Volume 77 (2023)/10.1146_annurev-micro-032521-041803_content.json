{"grounding": "Secretory antibodies are the only component of our adaptive immune system capable of attacking mucosal pathogens topologically outside of our bodies. All secretory antibody classes are (a) relatively resistant to harsh proteolytic environments and (b) polymeric. Recent elucidation of the structure of secretory IgA (SIgA) has begun to shed light on SIgA functions at the nanoscale. We can now begin to unravel the structure\u2013function relationships of these molecules, for example, by understanding how the bent conformation of SIgA enables robust cross-linking between adjacent growing bacteria. Many mysteries remain, such as the structural basis of protease resistance and the role of noncanonical bacteria\u2013IgA interactions. In this review, we explore the structure\u2013function relationships of IgA from the nano- to the metascale, with a strong focus on how the seemingly banal \u201clicense to clump\u201d can have potent effects on bacterial physiology and colonization.", "generated_text": "Secretory IgA (sIgA) is a crucial component of the mucosal immune system, providing protection against enteropathogens such as Salmonella. The structure-function relationships of sIgA have been extensively studied, revealing a complex interplay between its polymeric and monomeric forms. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of sIgA's polymeric structure and its role in binding enteropathogens, with a focus on the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and its impact on sIgA secretion. The relationships between sIgA's polymeric structure, its ability to bind Salmonella, and the immune response to enteric infections are discussed. Furthermore, the implications of sIgA's structure-function relationships for vaccine development and therapeutic strategies against enteric diseases are explored. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on sIgA's structure-function relationships across scales, from molecular to organismal levels.", "label": 1}
