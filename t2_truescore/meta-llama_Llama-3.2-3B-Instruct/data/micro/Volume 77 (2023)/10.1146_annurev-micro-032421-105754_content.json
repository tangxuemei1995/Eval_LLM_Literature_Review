{"grounding": "The gut microbiome is a dense and metabolically active consortium of microorganisms and viruses located in the lower gastrointestinal tract of the human body. Bacteria and their viruses (phages) are the most abundant members of the gut microbiome. Investigating their biology and the interplay between the two is important if we are to understand their roles in human health and disease. In this review, we summarize recent advances in resolving the taxonomic structure and ecological functions of the complex community of phages in the human gut\u2014the gut phageome. We discuss how age, diet, and geography can all have a significant impact on phageome composition. We note that alterations to the gut phageome have been observed in several diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer, and we evaluate whether these phageome changes can directly or indirectly contribute to disease etiology and pathogenesis. We also highlight how lack of standardization in studying the gut phageome has contributed to variation in reported results.", "generated_text": "The human gut phageome, comprising bacteriophages integrated into the gut microbiome, plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health and influencing disease susceptibility. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between phages, bacteria, and the host, leading to significant variation in the phageome across individuals. This study investigates the factors affecting the variation of the human gut phageome, with a focus on the interplay between environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that diet, stress levels, and genetic predisposition significantly impact phage abundance and diversity in the gut. Furthermore, the study suggests that the gut virome, comprising both bacteria and phages, exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity, with distinct phage communities associated with different health outcomes. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the gut phageome's role in human health and disease, highlighting the need for further research into the complex relationships between phages, bacteria, and the host.", "label": 1}
