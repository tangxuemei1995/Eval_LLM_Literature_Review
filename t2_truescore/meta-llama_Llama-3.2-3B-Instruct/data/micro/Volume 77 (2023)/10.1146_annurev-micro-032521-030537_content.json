{"grounding": "\nRalstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) strains are devastating plant pathogens distributed worldwide. The primary cell density\u2013dependent gene expression system in RSSC strains is phc quorum sensing (QS). It regulates the expression of about 30% of all genes, including those related to cellular activity, primary and secondary metabolism, pathogenicity, and more. The phc regulatory elements encoded by the phcBSRQ operon and phcA gene play vital roles. RSSC strains use methyl 3-hydroxymyristate (3-OH MAME) or methyl 3-hydroxypalmitate (3-OH PAME) as the QS signal. Each type of RSSC strain has specificity in generating and receiving its QS signal, but their signaling pathways might not differ significantly. In this review, I describe the genetic and biochemical factors involved in QS signal input and the regulatory network and summarize control of the phc QS system, new cell\u2013cell communications, and QS-dependent interactions with soil fungi.", "generated_text": "The phc quorum-sensing system in Ralstonia solanacearum species complex plays a crucial role in regulating pathogenicity and virulence. This system, comprising PhcA, PhcB, and PhcC proteins, is involved in cell-cell communication and modulates the production of virulence factors. In Ralstonia solanacearum, the phc quorum-sensing system has been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in type III secretion system (T3SS) and exotoxin production. Similarly, in Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum, the phc system has been implicated in the regulation of T3SS and flagellar motility. The phc quorum-sensing system is also essential for the formation of biofilms and the development of plant disease symptoms. Understanding the mechanisms of the phc quorum-sensing system in Ralstonia solanacearum species complex is crucial for the development of effective strategies for disease control and management.", "label": 0}
