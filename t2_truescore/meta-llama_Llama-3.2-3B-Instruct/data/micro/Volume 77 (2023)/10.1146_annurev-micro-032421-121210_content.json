{"grounding": "Infections caused by malaria parasites place an enormous burden on the world's poorest communities. Breakthrough drugs with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. As an organism that undergoes rapid growth and division, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is highly reliant on protein synthesis, which in turn requires aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) to charge tRNAs with their corresponding amino acid. Protein translation is required at all stages of the parasite life cycle; thus, aaRS inhibitors have the potential for whole-of-life-cycle antimalarial activity. This review focuses on efforts to identify potent plasmodium-specific aaRS inhibitors using phenotypic screening, target validation, and structure-guided drug design. Recent work reveals that aaRSs are susceptible targets for a class of AMP-mimicking nucleoside sulfamates that target the enzymes via a novel reaction hijacking mechanism. This finding opens up the possibility of generating bespoke inhibitors of different aaRSs, providing new drug leads.", "generated_text": "Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play a crucial role in the charging of amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, a process essential for protein synthesis in all living organisms. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting aaRSs for antimalarial drug development, as these enzymes are also involved in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, which are essential for the growth and replication of Plasmodium parasites. By exploiting the unique reaction hijacking capabilities of certain aaRSs, researchers have identified novel antimalarial compounds that selectively inhibit the charging of amino acids to tRNA, thereby disrupting parasite protein synthesis. This abstract reviews the current state of research on targeting aaRSs for antimalarial drug development, highlighting the potential of reaction hijacking as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of malaria.", "label": 1}
