{"grounding": "Two of the most fascinating bacterial nanomachines\u2014the broadly disseminated rotary flagellum at the heart of cellular motility and the eukaryotic cell\u2013puncturing injectisome essential to specific pathogenic species\u2014utilize at their core a conserved export machinery called the type III secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS not only secretes the components that self-assemble into their extracellular appendages but also, in the case of the injectisome, subsequently directly translocates modulating effector proteins from the bacterial cell into the infected host. The injectisome is thought to have evolved from the flagellum as a minimal secretory system lacking motility, with the subsequent acquisition of additional components tailored to its specialized role in manipulating eukaryotic hosts for pathogenic advantage. Both nanomachines have long been the focus of intense interest, but advances in structural and functional understanding have taken a significant step forward since 2015, facilitated by the revolutionary advances in cryo-electron microscopy technologies. With several seminal structures of each nanomachine now captured, we review here the molecular similarities and differences that underlie their diverse functions.", "generated_text": "The bacterial flagellum is a complex molecular machine that propels bacteria through their environment, while the type III secretion system (T3SS) is a versatile virulence apparatus that delivers effector proteins into host cells. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have enabled the structural characterization of the T3SS and its interactions with the flagellum. This study provides structural insights into the T3SS of the bacterial flagellum, revealing the assembly and function of the injectisome, a key component of the T3SS. Cryo-EM structures of the T3SS reveal the conformational changes that occur during the injection of effector proteins, while cryo-ET studies provide a detailed view of the T3SS in its native environment. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the T3SS and its interactions with the flagellum, with implications for our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The structural data presented here will serve as a foundation for future studies into the biology of the T3SS and its role in bacterial infection.", "label": 1}
