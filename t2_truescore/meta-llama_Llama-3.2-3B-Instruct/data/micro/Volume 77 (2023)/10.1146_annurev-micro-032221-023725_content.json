{"grounding": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is the physiological process that enables the reduction or oxidation of molecules and minerals beyond the surface of a microbial cell. The first bacteria characterized with this capability were Shewanella and Geobacter, both reported to couple their growth to the reduction of iron or manganese oxide minerals located extracellularly. A key difference between EET and nearly every other respiratory activity on Earth is the need to transfer electrons beyond the cell membrane. The past decade has resolved how well-conserved strategies conduct electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface. However, recent data suggest a much wider and less well understood collection of mechanisms enabling electron transfer to distant acceptors. This review reflects the current state of knowledge from Shewanella and Geobacter, specifically focusing on transfer across the outer membrane and beyond\u2014an activity that enables reduction of highly variable minerals, electrodes, and even other organisms.", "generated_text": "Electron transfer beyond the outer membrane is a crucial process in the survival and adaptation of certain microorganisms, such as Shewanella and Geobacter, in environments with limited energy availability. These bacteria have evolved unique mechanisms to harness electrons from their surroundings, facilitating the transfer of electrons to external acceptors. The cytochrome-based electron shuttle system plays a pivotal role in this process, enabling the efficient transfer of electrons across the outer membrane. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying extracellular electron transfer, revealing the importance of electron shuttles and cytochromes in mediating this process. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of electron transfer beyond the outer membrane in Shewanella and Geobacter, highlighting the key players and mechanisms involved in this complex process. By elucidating the intricacies of extracellular electron transfer, this review seeks to contribute to our understanding of the ecological and biotechnological implications of this phenomenon.", "label": 0}
