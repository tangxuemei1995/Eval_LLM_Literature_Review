{"grounding": "Fungal-mediated disease progression and antifungal drug efficacy are significantly impacted by the dynamic infection microenvironment. At the site of infection, oxygen often becomes limiting and induces a hypoxia response in both the fungal pathogen and host cells. The fungal hypoxia response impacts several important aspects of fungal biology that contribute to pathogenesis, virulence, antifungal drug susceptibility, and ultimately infection outcomes. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the hypoxia response in the most common human fungal pathogens, discuss potential therapeutic opportunities, and highlight important areas for future research.", "generated_text": "This review highlights recent advances in understanding the human fungal pathogen's hypoxia response, a critical mechanism driving disease progression. Hypoxia-induced signaling pathways modulate fungal virulence, enabling pathogens to adapt to low-oxygen environments. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia response in fungi, revealing key transcription factors and signaling pathways. These findings have significant implications for the development of antifungal drugs targeting hypoxia-related pathways, offering new therapeutic strategies for treating fungal infections. Understanding hypoxia response in fungi is essential for improving treatment outcomes and combating fungal diseases.", "label": 1}
