{"grounding": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are present in all gram-negative bacteria and mediate energy-dependent uptake of molecules that are too scarce or large to be taken up efficiently by outer membrane (OM) diffusion channels. This process requires energy that is derived from the proton motive force and delivered to TBDTs by the TonB-ExbBD motor complex in the inner membrane. Together with the need to preserve the OM permeability barrier, this has led to an extremely complex and fascinating transport mechanism for which the fundamentals, despite decades of research, are still unclear. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the transport mechanism of TBDTs, their potential role in the delivery of novel antibiotics, and the important contributions made by TBDT-associated (lipo)proteins.", "generated_text": "TonB-dependent transport is a critical mechanism facilitating the uptake of essential nutrients and antibiotics across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, including members of the Bacteroidetes phylum. This process involves the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex, which mediates the energy-dependent transport of substrates through the \u03b2-barrel porin OmpF. The discovery of Trojan horse antibiotics, such as gentamicin, has highlighted the importance of TonB-dependent transport in bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying TonB-dependent transport, revealing a complex interplay between the TonB complex, \u03b2-barrel porins, and membrane lipids. Understanding the TonB-dependent transport system is essential for the development of novel antibacterial strategies and the design of effective antibiotics targeting this critical bacterial pathway.", "label": 1}
