{"grounding": "Fungal species have dynamic genomes and often exhibit genomic plasticity in response to stress. This genome plasticity often comes with phenotypic consequences that affect fitness and resistance to stress. Fungal pathogens exhibit genome plasticity in both clinical and agricultural settings and often during adaptation to antifungal drugs, posing significant challenges to human health. Therefore, it is important to understand the rates, mechanisms, and impact of large genomic changes. This review addresses the prevalence of polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation across diverse fungal species, with special attention to prominent fungal pathogens and model species. We also explore the relationship between environmental stress and rates of genomic changes and highlight the mechanisms underlying genotypic and phenotypic changes. A comprehensive understanding of these dynamic fungal genomes is needed to identify novel solutions for the increase in antifungal drug resistance.", "generated_text": "Fungal genomes exhibit remarkable plasticity in response to environmental stress, characterized by polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation. These genomic alterations enable fungi to adapt to changing conditions, such as nutrient scarcity and temperature fluctuations. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying fungal genome plasticity, with a focus on polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation. We discuss the evolutionary pressures driving these genomic changes and their impact on fungal physiology and ecology. Furthermore, we highlight the potential applications of fungal genome plasticity in biotechnology, including stress tolerance and bioremediation. By elucidating the complex relationships between fungal genomes and their environment, this review aims to contribute to our understanding of the dynamic nature of fungal genomes and their role in shaping fungal evolution and ecology.", "label": 1}
