{"grounding": "Genetic manipulation is necessary to interrogate the functions of microbes in their environments, such as the human gut microbiome. Yet, the vast majority of human gut microbiome species are not genetically tractable. Here, we review the hurdles to seizing genetic control of more species. We address the barriers preventing the application of genetic techniques to gut microbes and report on genetic systems currently under development. While methods aimed at genetically transforming many species simultaneously in situ show promise, they are unable to overcome many of the same challenges that exist for individual microbes. Unless a major conceptual breakthrough emerges, the genetic tractability of the microbiome will remain an arduous task. Increasing the list of genetically tractable organisms from the human gut remains one of the highest priorities for microbiome research and will provide the foundation for microbiome engineering.", "generated_text": "The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem comprising trillions of microorganisms that play a crucial role in maintaining host health. Recent advances in genetic engineering have enabled the manipulation of the gut microbiome, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention and prevention of diseases. This review highlights the recent progress in microbiome engineering, focusing on the expansion of genetically tractable members of the human gut microbiome. We discuss the development of novel tools and strategies for microbiome editing, including CRISPR-Cas systems and base editing. The potential applications of microbiome engineering in treating gastrointestinal disorders, modulating the immune system, and preventing antibiotic-resistant infections are also explored. By expanding the repertoire of genetically tractable members of the human gut microbiome, microbiome engineering holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic approaches and the prevention of human diseases.", "label": 1}
