{"grounding": "Understanding the coevolutionary history of plants, pathogens, and disease resistance is vital for plant pathology. Here, I review Francis O. Holmes's work with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) framed by the foundational work of Nikolai Vavilov on the geographic centers of origin of plants and crop wild relatives (CWRs) and T. Harper Goodspeed's taxonomy of the genus Nicotiana. Holmes developed a hypothesis that the origin of host resistance to viruses was due to coevolution of both at a geographic center. In the 1950s, Holmes proved that genetic resistance to TMV, especially dominant R-genes, was centered in South America for Nicotiana and other solanaceous plants, including Capsicum, potato, and tomato. One seeming exception was eggplant (Solanum melongena). Not until the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s and recent advances in evolutionary taxonomy did it become evident that northeast Africa was the home of eggplant CWRs, far from Holmes's geographic center for TMV\u2013R-gene coevolution. Unbeknownst to most plant pathologists, Holmes's ideas predated those of H.H. Flor, including experimental proof of the gene-for-gene interaction, identification of R-genes, and deployment of dominant host genes to protect crop plants from virus-associated yield losses.", "generated_text": "The Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is a significant threat to global tomato production, with its emergence linked to the coevolution of viruses and host resistance within geographic centers of plant diversity. This study investigates the historical dynamics of ToBRFV and its host, Solanum lycopersicum, focusing on the Mediterranean region as a key center of plant diversity. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that ToBRFV has coevolved with its host over thousands of years, with evidence of selective pressure favoring the evolution of resistance genes. The study also explores the impact of plate tectonics on the distribution of ToBRFV and its host, highlighting the role of geographical barriers in shaping the coevolutionary process. The findings suggest that the coevolution of ToBRFV and its host is a complex, long-term process influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and geographical factors. Understanding this coevolutionary history is crucial for developing effective strategies to manage ToBRFV and other plant viruses, and for conserving crop diversity in the face of emerging threats.", "label": 0}
