{"grounding": "The group of strains constituting the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) is a prominent model for the study of plant-pathogenic bacteria because of its impact on agriculture, owing to its wide host range, worldwide distribution, and long persistence in the environment. RSSC strains have led to numerous studies aimed at deciphering the molecular bases of virulence, and many biological functions and mechanisms have been described to contribute to host infection and pathogenesis. In this review, we put into perspective recent advances in our understanding of virulence in RSSC strains, both in terms of the inventory of functions that participate in this process and their evolutionary dynamics. We also present the different strategies that have been developed to combat these pathogenic strains through biological control, antimicrobial agents, plant genetics, or microbiota engineering.", "generated_text": "Ralstonia solanacearum is a highly pathogenic bacterium causing bacterial wilt disease in solanaceous crops worldwide. This plant pathogen employs a complex arsenal of virulence strategies, including type III secretion system, flagellar motility, and quorum sensing, to establish infection and colonize plant tissues. The evolution of R. solanacearum is closely linked to environmental factors, such as temperature and moisture, which influence its pathogenicity and transmission dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of biological control methods, including the use of beneficial microorganisms and plant-based biofertilizers, to manage R. solanacearum populations. However, the development of effective resistance strategies remains a pressing concern, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the bacterium's biology and ecology. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on R. solanacearum virulence and resistance, and discuss prospects for future research and management strategies.", "label": 1}
