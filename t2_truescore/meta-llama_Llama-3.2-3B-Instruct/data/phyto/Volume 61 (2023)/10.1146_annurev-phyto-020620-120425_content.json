{"grounding": "Viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic symbionts interact with algae in a variety of ways to cause disease complexes, often shaping marine and freshwater ecosystems. The advent of phyconomy (a.k.a. seaweed agronomy) represents a need for a greater understanding of algal disease interactions, where underestimated cryptic diversity and lack of phycopathological basis are prospective constraints for algal domestication. Here, we highlight the limited yet increasing knowledge of algal pathogen biodiversity and the ecological interaction with their algal hosts. Finally, we discuss how ecology and cultivation experience contribute to and reinforce aquaculture practice, with the potential to reshape biosecurity policies of seaweed cultivation worldwide.", "generated_text": "Phycopathology, the study of algal diseases, has experienced a resurgence in recent years due to the growing importance of algal aquaculture and the increasing awareness of algal ecology and biosecurity concerns. This field of research has expanded to encompass the complex interactions between algal pathogens, their hosts, and the environment. Recent studies have highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and managing algal diseases, incorporating insights from ecology, parasitology, and biosecurity. As the global demand for algal-based food and feed products continues to rise, the reemergence of phycopathology has significant implications for the sustainability and safety of algal aquaculture.", "label": 0}
