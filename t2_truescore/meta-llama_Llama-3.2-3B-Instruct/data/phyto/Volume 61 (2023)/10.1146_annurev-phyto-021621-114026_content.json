{"grounding": "Plant bacterial pathogens rely on host-derived signals to coordinate the deployment of virulence factors required for infection. In this review, I describe how diverse plant-pathogenic bacteria detect and respond to plant-derived metabolic signals for the purpose of virulence gene regulation. I highlight examples of how pathogens perceive host metabolites through membrane-localized receptors as well as intracellular response mechanisms. Furthermore, I describe how individual strains may coordinate their virulence using multiple distinct host metabolic signals, and how plant signals may positively or negatively regulate virulence responses. I also describe how plant defenses may interfere with the perception of host metabolites as a means to dampen pathogen virulence. The emerging picture is that recognition of host metabolic signals for the purpose of virulence gene regulation represents an important primary layer of interaction between pathogenic bacteria and host plants that shapes infection outcomes.", "generated_text": "Plant-pathogenic bacteria employ complex strategies to modulate host plant responses and establish a favorable environment for colonization and pathogenesis. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of host metabolites as key signals in regulating bacterial virulence. This inter-kingdom signaling pathway involves the detection and utilization of host metabolites by bacterial effectors, which in turn modulate host immune responses and facilitate bacterial survival. Type III secretion systems play a pivotal role in delivering these effectors into host cells, where they interact with host metabolites to regulate virulence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this metabolic signaling network is essential for the development of novel strategies to control plant-pathogenic bacterial infections, and has significant implications for the design of targeted antimicrobial therapies and plant defense mechanisms.", "label": 1}
