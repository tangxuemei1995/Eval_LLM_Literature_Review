{"grounding": "Plant-parasitic nematodes are one of the most insidious pests limiting agricultural production, parasitizing mostly belowground and occasionally aboveground plant parts. They are an important and underestimated component of the estimated 30% yield loss inflicted on crops globally by biotic constraints. Nematode damage is intensified by interactions with biotic and abiotic factors constraints: soilborne pathogens, soil fertility degradation, reduced soil biodiversity, climate variability, and policies influencing the development of improved management options. This review focuses on the following topics: (a) biotic and abiotic constraints, (b) modification of production systems, (c) agricultural policies, (d) the microbiome, (e) genetic solutions, and (f) remote sensing. Improving integrated nematode management (INM) across all scales of agricultural production and along the Global North\u2013Global South divide, where inequalities influence access to technology, is discussed. The importance of the integration of technological development in INM is critical to improving food security and human well-being in the future.", "generated_text": "Integrated nematode management is crucial for maintaining global food security in a world facing climate change, soil degradation, and increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices. This review synthesizes existing knowledge on the constraints, policy, processes, and technologies required for effective integrated nematode management. We highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between nematodes, plants, and the microbiome in soil ecosystems. Genome editing and genetic approaches hold promise for developing nematode-resistant crop varieties, while remote sensing and precision agriculture can enhance monitoring and management of nematode populations. Root health and microbiome manipulation are also critical for promoting soil resilience and nematode control. Effective policy frameworks and processes are necessary to integrate these approaches and ensure their scalability and sustainability. By addressing these challenges, we can develop a more resilient and sustainable food system for the future, mitigating the impacts of nematodes and other soil pests on global food security.", "label": 1}
