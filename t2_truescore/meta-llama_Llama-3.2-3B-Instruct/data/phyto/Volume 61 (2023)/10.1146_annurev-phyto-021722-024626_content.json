{"grounding": "Society is confronted by interconnected threats to ecological sustainability. Among these is the devastation of forests by destructive non-native pathogens and insects introduced through global trade, leading to the loss of critical ecosystem services and a global forest health crisis. We argue that the forest health crisis is a public-good social dilemma and propose a response framework that incorporates principles of collective action. This framework enables scientists to better engage policymakers and empowers the public to advocate for proactive biosecurity and forest health management. Collective action in forest health features broadly inclusive stakeholder engagement to build trust and set goals; accountability for destructive pest introductions; pooled support for weakest-link partners; and inclusion of intrinsic and nonmarket values of forest ecosystems in risk assessment. We provide short-term and longer-term measures that incorporate the above principles to shift the societal and ecological forest health paradigm to a more resilient state.", "generated_text": "The global forest health crisis is a pressing public-good dilemma that necessitates international collective action to address the escalating threats to forest ecosystems. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, driven by climate change, have created a perfect storm of factors exacerbating forest degradation and loss. Biological invasions, fueled by human activities, further complicate the issue by introducing non-native species that outcompete native vegetation for resources. The consequences of inaction will be severe, including loss of biodiversity, decreased ecosystem resilience, and diminished provision of essential ecosystem services. Effective natural resource policy and conservation of biodiversity are critical to mitigating these impacts. This crisis demands a coordinated international response, involving governments, civil society, and the private sector, to develop and implement effective strategies for forest conservation and restoration. By working together, we can prevent the irreversible damage to our planet's most valuable ecosystems.", "label": 1}
