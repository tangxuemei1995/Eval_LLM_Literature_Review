{"grounding": "Membrane trafficking pathways play a prominent role in plant immunity. The endomembrane transport system coordinates membrane-bound cellular organelles to ensure that immunological components are utilized effectively during pathogen resistance. Adapted pathogens and pests have evolved to interfere with aspects of membrane transport systems to subvert plant immunity. To do this, they secrete virulence factors known as effectors, many of which converge on host membrane trafficking routes. The emerging paradigm is that effectors redundantly target every step of membrane trafficking from vesicle budding to trafficking and membrane fusion. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms adopted by plant pathogens to reprogram host plant vesicle trafficking, providing examples of effector-targeted transport pathways and highlighting key questions for the field to answer moving forward.", "generated_text": "Plant pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to subvert plant membrane trafficking, compromising plant immunity and facilitating pathogen survival. Haustoria, specialized structures formed by pathogens during infection, serve as hubs for endomembrane trafficking, allowing for the secretion of effector proteins that manipulate plant cellular processes. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of autophagy in regulating endomembrane trafficking and protein secretion in response to pathogen infection. This subversion of plant membrane trafficking enables pathogens to evade plant immune responses and establish a stable infection site. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this subversion is essential for the development of effective plant defense strategies and the discovery of novel targets for disease control.", "label": 1}
