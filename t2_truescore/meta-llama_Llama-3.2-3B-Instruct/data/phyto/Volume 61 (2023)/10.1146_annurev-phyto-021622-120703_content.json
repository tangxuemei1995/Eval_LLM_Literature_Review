{"grounding": "Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is an emerging tobamovirus. It was first reported in 2015 in Jordan in greenhouse tomatoes and now threatens tomato and pepper crops around the world. ToBRFV is a stable and highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted by mechanical means and via seeds, which enables it to spread locally and over long distances. The ability of ToBRFV to infect tomato plants harboring the commonly deployed Tm resistance genes, as well as pepper plants harboring the L resistance alleles under certain conditions, limits the ability to prevent damage from the virus. The fruit production and quality of ToBRFV-infected tomato and pepper plants can be drastically affected, thus significantly impacting their market value. Herein, we review the current information and discuss the latest areas of research on this virus, which include its discovery and distribution, epidemiology, detection, and prevention and control measures, that could help mitigate the ToBRFV disease pandemic.", "generated_text": "A recent pandemic of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV) has been reported globally, affecting major tomato and pepper crops worldwide. The virus, a member of the Tobamovirus family, is transmitted through seed and has been linked to significant yield losses and economic impacts on the agricultural industry. A thorough review of existing literature reveals that poor seed hygiene practices and inadequate crop rotation strategies have contributed to the rapid spread of ToBRFV. Furthermore, the virus has shown resistance to conventional control measures, including chemical treatments and biological control methods. To combat this pandemic, it is essential to adopt integrated pest management strategies that prioritize seed hygiene, crop rotation, and the development of resistant cultivars. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of ToBRFV research and identify key areas for future investigation to mitigate the impact of this devastating virus on global food security.", "label": 1}
