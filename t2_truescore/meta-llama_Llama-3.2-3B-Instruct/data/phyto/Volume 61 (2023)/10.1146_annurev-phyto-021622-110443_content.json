{"grounding": "The plant immune system perceives pathogens to trigger defense responses. In turn, pathogens secrete effector molecules to subvert these defense responses. The initiation and maintenance of defense responses involve not only de novo synthesis of regulatory proteins and enzymes but also their regulated degradation. The latter is achieved through protein degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS). The UPS regulates all stages of immunity, from the perception of the pathogen to the execution of the response, and, therefore, constitutes an ideal candidate for microbial manipulation of the host. Pathogen effector molecules interfere with the plant UPS through several mechanisms. This includes hijacking general UPS functions or perturbing its ability to degrade specific targets. In this review, we describe how the UPS regulates different immunity-related processes and how pathogens subvert this to promote disease.", "generated_text": "The plant ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in regulating plant immunity against pathogens by controlling the turnover of effectors secreted by microbial pathogens. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ubiquitination in modulating proteostasis within plant cells, thereby influencing the efficacy of plant defense responses. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the UPS in plant immunity, with a focus on its interaction with microbial effectors and the mechanisms underlying ubiquitination-mediated regulation of proteostasis. The potential of targeting the UPS for microbial manipulation is also discussed, with implications for the development of novel strategies for plant disease control and the exploration of new avenues for plant-microbe interactions.", "label": 1}
