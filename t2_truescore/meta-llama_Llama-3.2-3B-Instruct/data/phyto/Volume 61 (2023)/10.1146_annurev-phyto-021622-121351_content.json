{"grounding": "\nKitaviridae is a family of plant-infecting viruses that have multiple positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic segments. Kitaviruses are assigned into the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, mainly on the basis of the diversity of their genomic organization. Cell-to-cell movement of most kitaviruses is provided by the 30K family of proteins or the binary movement block, considered an alternative movement module among plant viruses. Kitaviruses stand out for producing conspicuously unusual locally restricted infections and showing deficient or nonsystemic movement likely resulting from incompatible or suboptimal interactions with their hosts. Transmission of kitaviruses is mediated by mites of many species of the genus Brevipalpus and at least one species of eriophyids. Kitavirus genomes encode numerous orphan open reading frames but RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the transmembrane helix-containing protein, generically called SP24, typify a close phylogenetic link with arthropod viruses. Kitaviruses infect a large range of host plants and cause diseases of economic concern in crops such as citrus, tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry.", "generated_text": "Kitaviruses, a family of small, single-stranded RNA viruses, have been identified as causative agents of atypical plant diseases, including nonsystemic disorders. These viruses, such as cilevirus, higrevirus, and blunervirus, have been associated with citrus leprosy, a disease characterized by the formation of lesions on citrus plants. The transmission of kitaviruses by Brevipalpus mites, a common vector of plant viruses, has been well-documented. Recent studies have also implicated negevirus, a kitavirus, in the etiology of citrus leprosy. The discovery of kitaviruses has expanded our understanding of the complex interactions between plant viruses, vectors, and hosts, and has highlighted the need for further research into the mechanisms of transmission and disease development. This knowledge has significant implications for the management and control of nonsystemic plant diseases, and for the development of novel strategies for virus transmission and disease prevention.", "label": 1}
