{"grounding": "\nPhytophthora capsici is a destructive oomycete pathogen of vegetable, ornamental, and tropical crops. First described by L.H. Leonian in 1922 as a pathogen of pepper in New Mexico, USA, P. capsici is now widespread in temperate and tropical countries alike. Phytophthora capsici is notorious for its capability to evade disease management strategies. High genetic diversity allows P. capsici populations to overcome fungicides and host resistance, the formation of oospores results in long-term persistence in soils, zoospore differentiation in the presence of water increases epidemic potential, and a broad host range maximizes economic losses and limits the effectiveness of crop rotation. The severity of disease caused by P. capsici and management challenges have led to numerous research efforts in the past 100 years. Here, we discuss recent findings regarding the biology, genetic diversity, disease management, fungicide resistance, host resistance, genomics, and effector biology of P. capsici.", "generated_text": "Phytophthora capsici, a highly pathogenic oomycete, has been a significant threat to vegetable crops worldwide for over a century. Despite its long history, recent advances in fundamental biology and disease management have significantly expanded our understanding of this plant pathogen. Phytophthora capsici is a complex organism with a unique life cycle, involving both aquatic and terrestrial phases, and its pathogenicity is mediated by a range of effector proteins. The development of fungicides has been a cornerstone of disease management, but the increasing prevalence of fungicide resistance has necessitated the exploration of alternative strategies. This review highlights the recent progress in our understanding of Phytophthora capsici's biology, including its genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and discusses the current challenges and future directions in disease management, including the development of resistant cultivars and novel fungicides. By synthesizing the latest research findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on Phytophthora capsici and its implications for vegetable production.", "label": 1}
