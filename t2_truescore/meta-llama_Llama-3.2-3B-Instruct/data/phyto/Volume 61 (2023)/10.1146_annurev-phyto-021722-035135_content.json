{"grounding": "Harvested fruit and vegetables are perishable, subject to desiccation, show increased respiration during ripening, and are colonized by postharvest fungal pathogens. Induced resistance is a strategy to control diseases by eliciting biochemical processes in fruits and vegetables. This is accomplished by modulating the progress of ripening and senescence, which maintains the produce in a state of heightened resistance to decay-causing fungi. Utilization of induced resistance to protect produce has been improved by scientific tools that better characterize physiological changes in plants. Induced resistance slows the decline of innate immunity after harvest and increases the production of defensive responses that directly inhibit plant pathogens. This increase in defense response in fruits and vegetables contributes to higher amounts of phenols and antioxidant compounds, improving both the quality and appearance of the produce. This review summarizes mechanisms and treatments that induce resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables to suppress fungal colonization. Moreover, it highlights the importance of host maturity and stage of ripening as limiting conditions for the improved expression of induced-resistance processes.", "generated_text": "Induced resistance in fruit and vegetables is a complex host physiological response that limits postharvest disease development. This response is triggered by various factors, including ethylene, abscisic acid, and salicylic acid, which interact with plant defense mechanisms to confer protection against pathogens. Research has shown that induced resistance can be achieved through physiological factors such as maturation delay, which can be induced by manipulating ethylene production or sensitivity. This delay in ripening can extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables, thereby reducing the risk of postharvest disease. Furthermore, induced resistance can also be achieved through the use of plant growth regulators, such as salicylic acid, which can stimulate the production of defense-related genes. Understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying induced resistance is crucial for the development of effective postharvest management strategies, and has significant implications for the food industry and global food security. By elucidating the complex interactions between host physiology and pathogens, researchers can identify new targets for disease control and develop innovative approaches to improve postharvest quality and safety.", "label": 0}
