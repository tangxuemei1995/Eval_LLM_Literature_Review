{"grounding": "The microbiota populating the plant\u2013soil continuum defines an untapped resource for sustainable crop production. The host plant is a driver for the taxonomic composition and function of these microbial communities. In this review, we illustrate how the host genetic determinants of the microbiota have been shaped by plant domestication and crop diversification. We discuss how the heritable component of microbiota recruitment may represent, at least partially, a selection for microbial functions underpinning the growth, development, and health of their host plants and how the magnitude of this heritability is influenced by the environment. We illustrate how host\u2013microbiota interactions can be treated as an external quantitative trait and review recent studies associating crop genetics with microbiota-based quantitative traits. We also explore the results of reductionist approaches, including synthetic microbial communities, to establish causal relationships between microbiota and plant phenotypes. Lastly, we propose strategies to integrate microbiota manipulation into crop selection programs. Although a detailed understanding of when and how heritability for microbiota composition can be deployed for breeding purposes is still lacking, we argue that advances in crop genomics are likely to accelerate wider applications of plant\u2013microbiota interactions in agriculture.", "generated_text": "The complex interactions between crops and their associated microbiota play a crucial role in plant health, productivity, and adaptation to environmental stresses. Recent advances in plant breeding and genomics have enabled the identification of host genetic factors that influence the composition and function of the crop microbiota. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the relationships between crop genetics, microbiota composition, and rhizosphere ecology. We discuss the key mechanisms by which host genetics shape the microbiota, including the regulation of nutrient uptake, defense signaling, and symbiotic interactions. The impact of crop domestication on the microbiota is also examined, highlighting the trade-offs between improved yield and reduced microbial diversity. Furthermore, we explore the potential of precision breeding approaches to engineer desirable traits in crop microbiota, such as enhanced nutrient acquisition and disease resistance. By elucidating the intricate relationships between crop genetics, microbiota, and rhizosphere ecology, this review provides a foundation for the development of novel breeding strategies that optimize crop-microbiota interactions and promote sustainable agriculture practices.", "label": 0}
