{"grounding": "Plant disease control requires novel approaches to mitigate the spread of and losses caused by current, emerging, and re-emerging diseases and to adapt plant protection to global climate change and the restrictions on the use of conventional pesticides. Currently, disease management relies mainly on biopesticides, which are required for the sustainable use of plant-protection products. Functional peptides are candidate biopesticides because they originate from living organisms or are synthetic analogs and provide novel mechanisms of action against plant pathogens. Hundreds of compounds exist that cover an extensive range of activities against viruses, bacteria and phytoplasmas, fungi and oomycetes, and nematodes. Natural sources, chemical synthesis, and biotechnological platforms may provide peptides at large scale for the industry and growers. The main challenges for their use in plant disease protection are (a) the requirement of stability in the plant environment and counteracting resistance in pathogen populations, (b) the need to develop suitable formulations to increase their shelf life and methods of application, (c) the selection of compounds with acceptable toxicological profiles, and (d) the high cost of production for agricultural purposes. In the near future, it is expected that several functional peptides will be commercially available for plant disease control, but more effort is needed to validate their efficacy at the field level and fulfill the requirements of the regulatory framework.", "generated_text": "Functional peptides have emerged as a promising approach for plant disease control, offering a novel and sustainable alternative to traditional chemical pesticides. These short-chain peptides, derived from various natural sources, have been shown to exhibit potent antimicrobial and antifungal activities against a wide range of plant pathogens. The mechanisms of action of functional peptides involve disruption of microbial cell membranes, inhibition of essential enzymes, and modulation of plant defense responses. Recent studies have focused on the production of functional peptides through fermentation and genetic engineering, enabling large-scale production and optimization of their efficacy. Novel biopesticides based on functional peptides have been developed, demonstrating superior performance and environmental sustainability compared to conventional pesticides. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of functional peptides for plant disease control, highlighting their mechanisms of action, natural sources, production methods, and potential applications as novel biopesticides. The findings of this review have significant implications for the development of sustainable and effective strategies for plant disease management, and may pave the way for the commercialization of functional peptides as a new generation of plant protection products.", "label": 1}
