{"grounding": "Oomycetes that cause downy mildew diseases are highly specialized, obligately biotrophic phytopathogens that can have major impacts on agriculture and natural ecosystems. Deciphering the genome sequence of these organisms provides foundational tools to study and deploy control strategies against downy mildew pathogens (DMPs). The recent telomere-to-telomere genome assembly of the DMP Peronospora effusa revealed high levels of synteny with distantly related DMPs, higher than expected repeat content, and previously undescribed architectures. This provides a road map for generating similar high-quality genome assemblies for other oomycetes. This review discusses biological insights made using this and other assemblies, including ancestral chromosome architecture, modes of sexual and asexual variation, the occurrence of heterokaryosis, candidate gene identification, functional validation, and population dynamics. We also discuss future avenues of research likely to be fruitful in studies of DMPs and highlight resources necessary for advancing our understanding and ability to forecast and control disease outbreaks.", "generated_text": "Downy mildew, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, is a devastating plant pathogen that has evolved complex strategies to infect and colonize hosts. Recent advances in genome-enabled technologies have provided unprecedented insights into the biology and evolution of P. infestans. Telomere-to-telomere assembly of the P. infestans genome has revealed a highly dynamic and heterogeneous genome, with evidence of heterokaryosis and somatic adaptation. This has significant implications for our understanding of the pathogen's ability to adapt to changing environments and evade host immune responses. Effector proteins, which play a critical role in the pathogen's infection process, have also been shown to undergo rapid evolution and selection. Furthermore, the development of biosurveillance tools based on genomic data has the potential to revolutionize the detection and management of downy mildew. This review synthesizes the latest genome-enabled research on P. infestans, highlighting the key findings and their implications for our understanding of this important plant pathogen.", "label": 0}
