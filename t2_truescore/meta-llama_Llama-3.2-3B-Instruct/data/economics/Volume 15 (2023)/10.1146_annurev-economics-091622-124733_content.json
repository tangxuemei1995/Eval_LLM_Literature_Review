{"grounding": "In recent years, experiments have documented a new mechanism that leads to failures of profit maximization: the failure of contingent thinking (FCT). This article summarizes key experimental findings, clarifies what constitutes an FCT, and outlines how FCTs can be tested in other environments. Subsequently, we relate FCTs to recent theoretical work on cognitive limitations in behavioral economics. Finally, we connect FCTs to suboptimal behavior documented in applied environments.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the cognitive limitations of contingent thinking, a fundamental concept in behavioral theory, through a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that individuals consistently exhibit the sure-thing principle, a cognitive bias that leads to suboptimal decision-making. Our findings have significant implications for cognitive economics and highlight the need for more nuanced understanding of human decision-making processes, particularly in situations involving uncertainty and risk.", "label": 0}
