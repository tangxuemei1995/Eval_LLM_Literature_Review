{"grounding": "In this article we survey recent advances in the economic theory of cultural transmission. We highlight three main themes on which the literature has made great progress in the last 10 years: the domain of traits subject to cultural transmission; the microfoundations for the technology of transmission; and feedback effects between culture, institutions, and various socioeconomic environments. We conclude by suggesting interesting areas for future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of cultural transmission and institutional evolution, exploring the economic mechanisms underlying the spread of cultural practices and the formation of social norms. By integrating insights from evolutionary game theory and institutional economics, we analyze the dynamics of cultural transmission and its impact on institutional development, shedding light on the complex relationships between culture, institutions, and economic outcomes.", "label": 0}
