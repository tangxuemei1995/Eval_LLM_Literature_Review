{"grounding": "Over the last two decades, the unprecedented increase in non-bank financial intermediation, particularly the rise of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, accounts for nearly half of the external financing flows to emerging markets, exceeding cross-border lending by global banks. Evidence suggests that investment fund flows enhance risk sharing across borders and provide emerging markets access to more diverse forms of financing. However, a growing body of evidence also indicates that investment funds are inherently more vulnerable to liquidity and redemption risks during periods of global financial market stress, increasing the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. Benchmark-driven investments, namely passive funds, appear particularly sensitive to global risk shocks, such as tightening US dollar funding conditions, compared to their active fund counterparts. The procyclicality of investment fund flows to emerging markets during times of global stress poses financial stability concerns, with implications for the role of macroprudential policy.", "generated_text": "This study examines the relationship between non-bank financial intermediation, investment funds, and emerging market vulnerabilities in the context of global risk and international capital flows. Non-bank financial intermediation, particularly through investment funds, plays a crucial role in facilitating international capital flows to emerging markets. However, this increased exposure to global risk shocks can also amplify tail risk, leading to potential vulnerabilities in these economies. The study analyzes the impact of non-bank financial intermediation on emerging market vulnerabilities, with a focus on benchmark investing strategies. Using a panel data set of emerging markets, we find that increased non-bank financial intermediation is associated with higher levels of vulnerability to global risk shocks. Our results suggest that benchmark investing strategies can help mitigate tail risk, but the effectiveness of these strategies depends on the specific characteristics of the investment funds and the emerging markets they serve. The findings have implications for policymakers and investors seeking to manage emerging market risks in a globalized economy.", "label": 0}
