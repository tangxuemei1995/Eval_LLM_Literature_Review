{"grounding": "Climate change poses an existential threat. Theoretical and empirical research suggest that carbon pricing and green R&D support are the right tools, but their implementation can be improved. Other policies, such as standards, bans, and targeted subsidies, also all have a role to play, but they have often been incoherent, and their implementation is delicate.", "generated_text": "This study examines the portfolio of economic policies required to combat climate change, including carbon pricing, green research and development, and carbon border adjustment. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that a multi-faceted approach is necessary to address the scale and complexity of climate change mitigation. Effective climate finance mechanisms are also crucial.", "label": 0}
