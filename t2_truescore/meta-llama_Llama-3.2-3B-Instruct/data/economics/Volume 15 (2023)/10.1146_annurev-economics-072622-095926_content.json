{"grounding": "China's financial system has been integral to its spectacular economic growth over the past 40 years. We review the recent literature on China's financial system and its connections to the Chinese economy based on the categories of Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (AFRE), a broad measure of the nation's yearly flow of liquidity accounting for unique features of China's financial system. While early work on China's financial system emphasizes the state-owned enterprise reform, the recent literature explores other more market-based financing channels\u2014including shadow banking\u2014that grew rapidly after 2010 and have become important components of AFRE. These new financing channels not only are intertwined with each other, but also, and more importantly, are often ultimately tied back to the dominant banking sector in China. Understanding the mechanisms behind these channels and their intrinsic connections is crucial to alleviate capital allocation distortion and mitigate potential systemic financial risk in China.", "generated_text": "This review examines the evolution of China's financial system and economy, with a focus on the country's economic reform and development trajectory. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has undergone significant transformations, driven by the government's implicit guarantee of financial stability and the integration of financial markets. The review highlights the key milestones in China's economic development, including the establishment of state-owned enterprises, the emergence of private sector companies, and the growth of financial markets. The role of fintech in facilitating financial inclusion and deepening financial markets is also discussed. The review concludes by analyzing the implications of China's financial system and economy on its development trajectory, including the potential risks and opportunities arising from the increasing integration of financial markets and the growing influence of fintech. The findings of this review provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners seeking to understand China's unique economic development model.", "label": 0}
