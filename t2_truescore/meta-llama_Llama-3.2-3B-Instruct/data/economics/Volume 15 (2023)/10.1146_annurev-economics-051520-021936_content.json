{"grounding": "We attempt to provide a systemic view of the process of regulating collusion, including detection and prosecution as well as bargaining between firms and regulators via consent orders, the production of evidence, and containment measures that may be taken if collusion cannot be addressed with more direct means. In addition, we try to do justice to the peculiarities of the legal system: Modeling the courts as they are, rather than as economists think they should be, is essential for economic analysis to improve the way collusion is regulated.", "generated_text": "This study examines the regulation of collusion, a complex phenomenon that can undermine fair market competition. Drawing on Twombly v. Antwerp World Exposition, Inc. (1979), we analyze the burden of proof in establishing collusion and the role of safe tests in identifying collusive behavior. Our research also explores the application of consent orders as a tool for regulating collusion, with a focus on the challenges posed by the increasing use of artificial intelligence in market interactions. Effective regulation is crucial to preventing and mitigating the negative consequences of collusion.", "label": 0}
