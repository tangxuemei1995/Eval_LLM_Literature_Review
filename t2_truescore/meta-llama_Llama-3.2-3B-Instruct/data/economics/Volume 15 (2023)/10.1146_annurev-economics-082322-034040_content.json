{"grounding": "International trade contributes directly to global greenhouse gas emissions, as the carbon content of high-emission products is priced differently in different countries. This phenomenon is termed carbon leakage. Thus, not putting a price on carbon is theoretically equivalent to an export subsidy, although that would be difficult to challenge in the context of multilateral trade law. Leakage can be alleviated by pricing the carbon embedded in imported products through a border carbon adjustment (BCA), be it a tax, a carbon tariff, or a regulation requiring the purchase of emissions allowances. The design of a BCA is a compromise between environmental effectiveness in preventing leakage, economic effectiveness in preserving competitiveness and ensuring acceptability, technical feasibility of the implementation, and World Trade Organization compatibility. An import-limited BCA is more effective than free emissions allowances in reducing leakage, but it does not preserve the export competitiveness of the country imposing it.", "generated_text": "This study examines the economics of border carbon adjustment, a policy mechanism that compensates for carbon at the border to mitigate carbon leakage and promote a level playing field among countries. The rationale for border carbon adjustment is rooted in the concept of carbon leakage, where domestic industries relocate to countries with less stringent climate policies, resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions. By imposing a carbon tariff or adjustment, countries can offset the costs of complying with international climate agreements and maintain competitiveness. The impacts of border carbon adjustment are multifaceted, including increased revenue for governments, reduced carbon emissions, and potential job losses in industries vulnerable to carbon leakage. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic and environmental implications of border carbon adjustment, highlighting its potential as a key strategy in the global transition to a low-carbon economy.", "label": 1}
