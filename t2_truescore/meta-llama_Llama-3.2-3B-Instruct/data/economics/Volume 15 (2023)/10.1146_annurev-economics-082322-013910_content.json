{"grounding": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator and its demand system are ubiquitous in business cycles theory, macroeconomic growth and development, international trade and other general equilibrium fields; this is because the CES aggregator has many knife-edge properties that help to keep the analysis tractable in the presence of many goods and factors. However, this also makes it hard to tell which properties of CES are responsible for certain results. Furthermore, it is necessary to relax some of those properties for certain applications. In this article, I review several classes of non-CES aggregators, each of which removes some properties of CES and keeps the rest to introduce some flexibility while retaining the tractability of CES as much as possible. These classes are named after the properties of CES they keep. I explain how these classes are related to each other and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses to indicate which classes are suited for which applications.", "generated_text": "This paper provides an in-depth exploration of non-CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) aggregators, a class of economic models that depart from the traditional CES production function. We examine the implications of non-homothetic preferences on aggregator behavior, highlighting the distinction between essentials and inessentials. Our analysis reveals that non-CES aggregators can capture the nuances of implicit additivity and gross substitutes/gross complements, allowing for a more accurate representation of real-world production processes. By shedding light on the properties of non-CES aggregators, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationships between production, preferences, and aggregation. The findings have significant implications for macroeconomic modeling, trade theory, and empirical analysis, providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding the behavior of economic agents and systems.", "label": 0}
