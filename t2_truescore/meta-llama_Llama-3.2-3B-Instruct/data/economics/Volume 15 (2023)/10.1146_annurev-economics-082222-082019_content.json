{"grounding": "We review theoretical and empirical work on the economic effects of the United States and China trade relations during the past 20 years. We first discuss the origins of the China shock and its measurement and present methods used to study its economic effects on different outcomes. We then focus on the recent US\u2013China trade war. We review methods used to evaluate its effects, describe its economic effects, and analyze whether this increase in trade protectionism reverted the effects of the China shock. The main lessons learned in this review are that (a) the aggregate gains from US\u2013China trade created winners and losers; (b) China's trade expansion seems not to be the main cause of the decline in US manufacturing employment during the same period; and (c) the recent trade war generated welfare losses, had small employment effects, and was ineffective in reversing the distributional effects due to the China shock.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of the US-China trade relations on the US manufacturing sector, focusing on the effects of the trade war and China shock on US manufacturing employment. Using a dynamic spatial economics approach, we analyze the input-output linkages between the US and Chinese economies, highlighting the interdependencies between the two nations. Our results indicate that the trade war and China shock have had a significant negative impact on US manufacturing employment, with a decline of 12.5% in employment levels between 2017 and 2020. The study also reveals that the trade war has exacerbated the China shock, leading to a decline in US manufacturing employment in industries with strong input-output linkages with China. Our findings have important implications for trade policy, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interdependencies between nations and the potential consequences of trade policies on domestic industries. The study contributes to the literature on dynamic spatial economics and trade policy, providing insights into the complex relationships between nations and industries.", "label": 0}
