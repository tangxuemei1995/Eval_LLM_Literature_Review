{"grounding": "Big data is changing every corner of economics and finance. The largest firms in the US economy are valued chiefly for their data. Yet, these data are largely excluded from macroeconomic and finance research. We review work and relevant tools for measuring economic activity, market power, data markets, and the role of data in financial markets. We also highlight areas where future work is needed.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of big data and data markets, exploring the dynamics of data valuation and feedback loops in financial data-driven economies. By analyzing the interplay between data producers and consumers, we reveal the complexities of data pricing and the emergence of new market structures. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of data valuation in the data economy.", "label": 0}
