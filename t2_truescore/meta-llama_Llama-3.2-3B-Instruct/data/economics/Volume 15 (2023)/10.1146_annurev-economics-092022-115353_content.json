{"grounding": "Gender differences in negotiation are seen as contributing to the persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes. We review the literature on interventions aiming to mute differences in negotiation and assess their effectiveness in reducing the gender pay gap. We present research on initiatives that aspire to increase how often and how women negotiate, as well as institutional changes that ban negotiations, ban requests for employee salary history, and improve wage transparency. Along with reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of these initiatives, we point to unintended consequences that warrant caution at implementation. The review makes clear that initial efforts to push women to negotiate more like men have shifted to alter instead the conditions of the negotiation. This shift results not only from wanting to consider policies that \u201cfix the institutions\u201d rather than \u201cfixing the women,\u201d but also from evidence that these interventions are more successful in securing pay equity.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of negotiation training interventions on reducing the gender gap in bargaining outcomes. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 150 participants. The results show that women who received negotiation training exhibited significant improvements in their bargaining skills, particularly in terms of assertiveness and transparency. Notably, the use of salary history and transparent communication strategies were found to be effective in bridging the gap. In contrast, interventions that focused solely on 'leaning in' or adopting a more assertive tone were less effective. The findings suggest that a comprehensive approach to negotiation training, incorporating strategies that promote transparency and equal communication, is necessary to address the persistent gender gap in bargaining outcomes. The implications of these results have important implications for organizational interventions aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace.", "label": 0}
