{"grounding": "This article reviews economic research on business taxation, with a focus on corporate income taxation. We discuss what this research can contribute to current debates about corporate tax policy and where existing research is incomplete or inconclusive, so that clarification is needed. The issues we discuss include the incidence of the corporate income tax, its effect on investment and economic growth, the problem of international tax avoidance, and the role of corporate taxes in economic crises, including the current debate about taxes on windfall profits.\n", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of corporate taxation on multinational companies during economic crises. Analyzing tax incidence and its effects on corporate behavior, the research reveals that tax rates have a significant influence on the location of multinational companies. The findings suggest that during economic crises, tax policies can either exacerbate or mitigate the negative consequences of economic downturns on multinational companies. The study contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between corporate taxation, tax incidence, and economic crises, highlighting the need for policymakers to consider these factors when designing tax policies.", "label": 0}
