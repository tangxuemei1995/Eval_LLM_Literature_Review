{"grounding": "This article compares early childhood enrichment programs that promote social mobility for disadvantaged children within and across generations. Instead of conducting a standard meta-analysis, we present a harmonized primary data analysis of programs that shape current policy. Our analysis is a template for rigorous syntheses and comparisons across programs. We analyze new long-run life-cycle data collected for iconic programs when participants are middle-aged and their children are in their twenties. The iconic programs are omnibus in nature and offer many services to children and their parents. We compare them with relatively low-cost, more focused home-visiting programs. Participants in programs that enrich home environments grow up with better skills, jobs, earnings, marital stability, and health, as well as reduced participation in crime. The long-run monetized gains are substantially greater than the costs of the iconic programs. A study of focused home-visiting programs that target parents enables us to isolate a crucial component of successful programs: They activate and promote the parenting skills of child caregivers. The home-visiting programs we analyze produce outcomes comparable to those of the iconic omnibus programs. National implementation of the programs with long-run follow-up that we analyze would substantially shrink the overall Black-White earnings gap in the United States.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the relationship between parenting and social mobility within and across generations, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the transmission of social advantages and disadvantages. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the role of parental skills and resources in shaping children's social outcomes, including educational attainment, employment prospects, and socioeconomic status. Our analysis reveals that parenting practices, such as parental involvement, education, and socio-economic status, have a significant impact on children's social mobility. Furthermore, we find that these effects are not limited to the individual child, but also influence the social mobility of subsequent generations. The findings suggest that effective parenting can mitigate the effects of inequality and promote social mobility, while poor parenting can exacerbate existing social disparities. The study's implications highlight the importance of addressing the intergenerational transmission of social disadvantage and the need for policies and interventions that support parents in developing the skills and resources necessary to promote social mobility. Ultimately, this research underscores the critical role of parenting in shaping social outcomes and promoting human development across generations.", "label": 0}
