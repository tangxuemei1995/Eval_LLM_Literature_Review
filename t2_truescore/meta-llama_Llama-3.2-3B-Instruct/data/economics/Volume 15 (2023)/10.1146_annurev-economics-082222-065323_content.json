{"grounding": "This article surveys the development of nonparametric models and methods for estimation of choice models with nonlinear budget sets. The discussion focuses on the budget set regression, that is, the conditional expectation of a choice variable given the budget set. Utility maximization in a nonparametric model with general heterogeneity reduces the curse of dimensionality in this regression. Empirical results using this regression are different from maximum likelihood and give informative inference. The article also considers the information provided by kink probabilities for nonparametric utility with general heterogeneity. Instrumental variable estimation and the evidence it provides of heterogeneity in preferences are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets using a random utility model framework. We employ budget set regression to estimate the relationship between individual characteristics and budget constraints, accounting for bunching effects and endogeneity. Instrumental variables are used to address the endogeneity of budget constraints, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the budget set. Our results show that the estimated budget set exhibits nonlinear relationships with individual characteristics, highlighting the importance of considering nonlinearity in budget set analysis. The findings have implications for understanding consumer behavior and policy interventions aimed at improving financial well-being.", "label": 0}
