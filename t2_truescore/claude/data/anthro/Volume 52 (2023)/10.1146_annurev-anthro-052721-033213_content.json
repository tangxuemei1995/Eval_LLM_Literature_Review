{"grounding": "This article reviews key theoretical and methodological contributions that anthropologists have made to the study of what we call security regimes. While anthropologists have been instrumental in denaturalizing discourses of security, much of the existing literature on who security actors are or where their work and force are to be found remains focused on the masculinist frontlines and visibly spectacular instances of security state power. We adopt a transnational feminist lens to rethink what we understand security regimes to be and where they are to be found by drawing attention to the multiscalar sites (e.g., home, family, kinship, intimacy) and technologies of rule (e.g., affect, aesthetics, discourse) through which security regimes are constituted, expanded, and challenged. The final section of the review examines methodological and ethical challenges, which are made more complex by the changing profile of the multiply racialized, gendered, nationalized, and classed researchers of security regimes.", "generated_text": "This article examines the intersections of security regimes, empire, and transnational power dynamics through the lenses of race and gender. Drawing on political anthropology and transnational feminist perspectives, we analyze how imperial legacies shape contemporary security practices and discourses. The study explores how racialized and gendered narratives inform security policies, surveillance mechanisms, and border control strategies across different geopolitical contexts. By investigating the transnational and imperial entanglements of security regimes, we reveal the complex power relations that underpin global security frameworks. Our findings highlight the ways in which security apparatuses perpetuate historical inequalities and reinforce existing hierarchies of race and gender. This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of security regimes, emphasizing the need for critical approaches that address the intersectional nature of security challenges in a post-colonial world.", "label": 0}
