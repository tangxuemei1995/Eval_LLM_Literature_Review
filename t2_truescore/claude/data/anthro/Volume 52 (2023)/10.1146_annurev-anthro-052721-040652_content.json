{"grounding": "This review examines the discourses and practices that have produced a lively literature on museum decolonization created by scholars of museum practices and curators. We consider the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, focusing especially on the care of Native North American heritage, with comparison to similar trajectories internationally. We begin with a discussion of decolonizing moments in theory and practice, with particular attention to 1990s critique of ethnographic museums and developments after the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Following this discussion is a review of works on concerns regarding Native American representation and public displays, involvement in collections care, and the varied collaborations that are changing museum practices. The final section foregrounds the fluorescence of tribal museums and their contributions to the decolonization and indigenization of museums, as well as emerging paradigm shifts in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the ongoing process of decolonizing museums, focusing on the paradigm shift necessary to address historical injustices and promote indigenous representation. Drawing on Native American scholarship and contemporary museum practices, the study explores strategies for indigenization and the reimagining of cultural institutions. The research highlights the importance of collaborative approaches, shared authority, and the integration of indigenous knowledge systems in curatorial practices. By analyzing case studies of successful decolonization efforts, the paper identifies key challenges and opportunities in transforming museum spaces. The findings suggest that meaningful decolonization requires a fundamental reevaluation of institutional power structures, collection policies, and interpretive frameworks. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on museum decolonization and offers practical recommendations for institutions seeking to engage in more equitable and inclusive practices.", "label": 1}
