{"grounding": "This review sketches a linguistic anthropology of images. While linguistic anthropology has not historically focalized images as a central theoretical object of concern, linguistic anthropologists\u2019 research has increasingly concerned images of various sorts. Furthermore, in its critique of structuralist reductions of language, the field has advanced an analytic vocabulary for thinking about the image in discourse. In this article, I review scholarship in linguistic anthropology on prototypic images to show how these advances (e.g., entextualization, performativity, perspective, and enregisterment) can be leveraged to theorize images more generally. In doing so, I argue against any hard distinction between language and image. I conclude by expanding out from a linguistic anthropology of images to what I call \u201ca linguistic anthropology of\u2026,\u201d a field characterized by an open-ended horizon of objects and modes of inquiry, all linked together as linguistic anthropology.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of linguistic anthropology and visual culture, examining how images function as semiotic resources within social and cultural contexts. Drawing on theories of entextualization, performativity, and enregisterment, we analyze the ways in which images are imbued with meaning, circulated, and interpreted across diverse communicative settings. Through ethnographic fieldwork and multimodal discourse analysis, we investigate how visual elements interact with linguistic practices to construct and negotiate social identities, ideologies, and power relations. Our findings reveal the complex processes through which images become entextualized, performatively enacted, and enregistered within specific cultural frameworks. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of visual communication in shaping social realities and offers new insights into the application of linguistic anthropological concepts to the study of images.", "label": 1}
