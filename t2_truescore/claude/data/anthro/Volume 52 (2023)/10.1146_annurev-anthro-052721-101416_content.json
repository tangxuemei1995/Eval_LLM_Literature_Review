{"grounding": "This article reviews the anthropological scholarship that engages with religious conversion as a political phenomenon, broadly defined. It develops the idea of making a difference as an overarching framework with a double meaning. First, this idiom captures how, by framing religious conversion in political terms, anthropologists have claimed to have substantially intervened\u2014have made a difference, so to speak\u2014in the discussion of conversion. Second, the article sets aside the prevalent problematization of conversion as a category of change, showing instead how anthropologists have sought to establish how religious change makes a difference\u2014in the interweaved realities of individuals, collectives, and polities. I scrutinize and contextualize the belated consolidation of this area of inquiry, map its major strands, and identify the interrelated theoretical developments within anthropology. Seeing these strands as a generative domain of inquiry, I conclude with a number of suggestions for future research, such as paying closer attention to political conversions and to the links between religious conversion and political crises.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between religious conversion and political change, examining how shifts in religious affiliation can impact political landscapes and social dynamics. Drawing on a diverse range of case studies and theoretical frameworks, the research investigates the ways in which religious conversion acts as a catalyst for political difference and transformation. The analysis delves into the complex interplay between individual spiritual journeys and broader societal shifts, highlighting the role of religious conversion in shaping political identities, allegiances, and power structures. By examining the politics of religion through the lens of conversion, this study sheds light on the multifaceted nature of religious difference and its implications for political systems. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness between religious and political spheres, offering valuable insights for policymakers, religious leaders, and scholars interested in the evolving dynamics of faith and governance in contemporary societies.", "label": 0}
