{"grounding": "Anthropological expeditions seeking out algorithms frequently return empty-handed. They are confronted with the challenge of the object: what to study when studying algorithms? In this article, I draw together a number of literatures to outline one possible answer to the question of how to study algorithms in social science. I argue that what we should study are algorithmic ecologies. I sketch five modalities of algorithmic ecologies and review concomitant literatures: (a) imaginaries, (b) infrastructures, (c) interfaces, (d) identities, and (e) investments and interests. The speculative propositions offered here are that algorithms are immanent to ecologies and that they are enacted across all the modalities of algorithmic ecologies.", "generated_text": "This paper proposes an ecological approach to understanding algorithms and their role in contemporary society. Drawing on insights from ecology, infrastructure studies, and social imaginaries, we explore how algorithms function as part of complex socio-technical systems. We argue that algorithms should be conceptualized not as isolated entities, but as interconnected components within broader digital ecosystems. By examining the interfaces between algorithms, smart technologies, and human users, we reveal the intricate relationships that shape algorithmic processes and their societal impacts. This ecological perspective offers new insights into the ways algorithms influence and are influenced by their environments, providing a framework for more nuanced analyses of algorithmic power, agency, and accountability in an increasingly digitized world.", "label": 1}
