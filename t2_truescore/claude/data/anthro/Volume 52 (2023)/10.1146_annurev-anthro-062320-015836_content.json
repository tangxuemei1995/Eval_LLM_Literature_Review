{"grounding": "In this Perspective article, I am able to draw the various strands of my intellectual thinking and practice in archaeology and European prehistory into a complex narrative of changing themes. In this narrative, I draw attention to the inspirational triggers of these transformations to be found in works and words of colleagues and events within and outside my immediate discipline. A group of events between 1988 and 1993 disrupted (in a good way) the trajectory of my professional life and provided a convenient anchor around which my themes pivoted and regrouped with very different standpoints. But some trends in my way of working remained constant and contributed, I hope, to a career of cumulative knowledge. Along the way, I show the significance, in terms of my personal intellectual context as well as archaeological practice in general, of my published works as well as more obscure and some unpublished works that are cited here for the first time.", "generated_text": "This paper presents an autobiographical reflection on a career spanning decades in European Neolithic archaeology, digital archaeology, and the history of archaeology. The author examines the evolution of their research interests and methodological approaches, highlighting the significant influences and inspirations that shaped their academic journey. The narrative explores the author's engagement with feminist practices in archaeology, the development of digital tools and techniques, and the application of middle-range research strategies in prehistoric studies. By tracing the shifts and pivots in their standpoints over time, the author demonstrates how personal experiences, intellectual encounters, and changing theoretical paradigms have contributed to their understanding and construction of the past. This introspective account not only provides insights into the author's professional growth but also offers a unique perspective on the broader transformations within archaeological practice and theory over the past several decades, particularly in the context of European prehistory and the emerging field of digital archaeology.", "label": 1}
