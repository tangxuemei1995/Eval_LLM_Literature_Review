{"grounding": "Human habitation and adaptation to extreme environments have a deep history in anthropological research. Anthropologists\u2019 understanding of these ecological pressures and how humans respond to them has grown substantially over the last 100+ years. This review covers long-standing knowledge on adaptation to classic extreme conditions of heat, cold, and high altitude, while also updating the areas in which recent research has broadened our understanding of human adaptation, acclimatization, and resilience. Unfortunately, the intersecting stresses of structural inequality and climate change have made these extremes more extreme, with drastic negative impacts on health and well-being. Future research will need to explore how extreme environments, structural inequality, and climate change are embodied as well as mitigated so that humans are better prepared to face a rapidly changing world.", "generated_text": "This study examines human physiological and metabolic adaptations to extreme environments, focusing on thermoregulation in response to climate change. We analyze data from diverse populations exposed to extreme heat, cold, and altitude, investigating the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Our findings reveal significant variations in metabolic efficiency and thermoregulatory mechanisms across different groups, highlighting the human body's remarkable adaptability. However, we also uncover concerning disparities in adaptation capabilities linked to structural inequalities, such as access to resources and healthcare. These results underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions and policy measures to address the disproportionate impact of extreme environments on vulnerable populations. This research contributes to our understanding of human resilience and informs strategies for mitigating the health effects of climate change.", "label": 0}
