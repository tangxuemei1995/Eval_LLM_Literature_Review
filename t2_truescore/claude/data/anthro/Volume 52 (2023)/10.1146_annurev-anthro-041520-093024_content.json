{"grounding": "\u201cIntervention\u201d is central to global health, but the significance and effects of how intervention is practiced are often taken for granted. This review takes interventions into health and medicine as subjects for ethnographic inquiry. We highlight three lines of anthropological contributions: studies of global health interventions that serve imperial and military objectives, studies of \u201cmagic bullet\u201d interventions arising from laboratory science, and studies of interventions based on deterministic modeling techniques. We then outline examples of \u201cintervention otherwise,\u201d in which people build relations of solidarity and care through global health programming, design interventions to be interactive and adaptable, and use data and modeling to support health justice. Whereas many global health interventions reproduce Western power hierarchies, intervention otherwise draws attention to alternative forms of knowledge, action, and expertise. Our analysis of lively and multivalent practices of intervention has implications for debates about the im/possibility of decolonizing global health.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines dominant approaches to global health interventions, focusing on the military, 'magic bullet', and deterministic models. Drawing on anthropological perspectives and postcolonial theory, it analyzes the historical roots and contemporary manifestations of these intervention paradigms in global public health and medicine. The study argues that these approaches often perpetuate colonial power dynamics and oversimplify complex health challenges in diverse cultural contexts. By exploring case studies of health care aid initiatives, the research highlights the limitations of narrowly focused, top-down interventions. The paper proposes alternative frameworks that emphasize local knowledge, cultural sensitivity, and holistic understandings of health determinants. It concludes by advocating for more nuanced, context-specific approaches to global health interventions that address the broader socioeconomic and political factors influencing health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.", "label": 1}
