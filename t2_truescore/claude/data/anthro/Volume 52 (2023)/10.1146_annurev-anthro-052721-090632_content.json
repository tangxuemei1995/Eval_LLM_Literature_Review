{"grounding": "Contesting ideas about what is \u201cnormal\u201d human behavior or biology is a core contribution of anthropology. In efforts to provide more inclusive views of what it means to be human, anthropologists challenge judgments about diverse ways of being, which include assumptions about what it means to be normal. Meanings of the term normal encompass the descriptive (statistical) and the evaluative (normative), i.e., judgments about a given characteristic. In biomedicine, \u201chealthy\u201d is often the value ascribed to normal, but embedded in healthy are biases that derive from particular cultural and historical contexts. Here I review how the term normal is understood and used in anthropological and related studies of human biology and biological variation. I propose the biological normalcy framework for understanding how the statistical and normative meanings of normal mutually inform each other and their consequences for human population biology. Several examples provide illustrations of the framework.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the concept of biological normalcy in human populations, examining the intersection of biological variation, cultural norms, and statistical measures. We investigate how normative views of human biology are shaped by societal expectations and scientific understanding. The study analyzes diverse data sets to quantify the range of biological variation across different populations and traits. We critically evaluate the use of statistical measures, such as means and standard deviations, in defining biological normalcy. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between perceived norms and actual biological diversity, highlighting the influence of cultural factors on interpretations of human biology. We argue for a more nuanced approach to defining biological normalcy that acknowledges both statistical trends and the inherent variability of human traits. This research contributes to ongoing discussions about diversity, inclusion, and the social construction of biological norms.", "label": 1}
