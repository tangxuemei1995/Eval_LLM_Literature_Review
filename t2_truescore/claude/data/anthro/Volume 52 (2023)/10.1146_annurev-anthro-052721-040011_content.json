{"grounding": "In this article, we explore critical university studies (CUS), an interdisciplinary body of scholarship that interrogates structures of higher education and their entanglements with national and global institutions and political movements. Favoring an expansive definition of CUS, we draw from scholars who trace the origins of the American university to the slave trade, racial science, and Native American ethnic cleansing projects, as well as scholars who bring abolitionist and decolonial stances to highlight how the university continues to perpetuate state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness. We then bring the lens of CUS to bear on critical work by anthropologists on higher education and on the discipline more broadly. We explore the challenges of advocating for antiracist and anti-imperial anthropology without attending to the structures of Western/white superiority that have enabled its institutionalization. We conclude by considering interventions by the emerging field of abolitionist anthropology.", "generated_text": "This article examines the emerging field of Critical University Studies (CUS) and its intersections with higher education, decolonization, abolition, and Black studies. CUS challenges traditional approaches to understanding universities by critically analyzing power structures, institutional practices, and historical legacies that shape contemporary higher education. The study explores how CUS engages with decolonial perspectives to interrogate the Eurocentric foundations of academia and advocates for the inclusion of marginalized knowledge systems. Additionally, it investigates the role of abolitionist frameworks in reimagining university structures and practices. The article highlights the significant contributions of Black studies to CUS, emphasizing the importance of centering Black experiences and knowledge in critiquing and transforming higher education. By synthesizing these interconnected themes, this research contributes to ongoing discussions about the future of universities and their potential for fostering social justice and equity.", "label": 1}
