{"grounding": "Water links the environment, culture, and biology. An integrative approach is needed to attain a complete picture of how water affects human biology due to its inherent interdisciplinary nature. First, this review describes advances in human water needs, thirst, and hydration strategies from a biocultural perspective. Second, it provides a critical appraisal of the literatures on water insecurity (WI) experiences and coping strategies used to mitigate WI to illustrate how they intersect to affect human biology through the embodiment framework. Deviations from water needs and heightened WI can alter hydration and coping strategies, which have implications for a suite of psychological and physiological outcomes. These disruptions are embodied in cellular damage, dehydration, nutrition, stress, mental health, cognitive impairment, aging-related effects, cardiometabolic health, and kidney function. Disrupting forces such as lifestyle changes and climate change have important implications for water needs, WI, coping and hydration strategies, and the embodiment of each.", "generated_text": "Water insecurity, a growing global concern exacerbated by climate change, has profound implications for human biology. This review explores the intricate relationship between water needs, water insecurity, and physiological responses in human populations. We examine the biological mechanisms of hydration and thirst, and how these are affected by chronic water scarcity. The paper investigates various coping strategies employed by water-insecure communities and their impact on health outcomes. Furthermore, we analyze the concept of embodiment in relation to water insecurity, considering how sociocultural and environmental factors shape biological responses to water stress. The review also addresses the long-term consequences of water insecurity on human growth, development, and overall well-being. By synthesizing current research, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological dimensions of water insecurity and highlight areas for future interdisciplinary research to inform policy and intervention strategies.", "label": 1}
