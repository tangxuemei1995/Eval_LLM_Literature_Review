{"grounding": "In this review, we call for heightened attention to the labor of interpreters to think more reflexively about our own professional ethics and the paradoxes of global capitalism within which both interpreters and anthropologists work. Like other forms of communicative labor, interpretation is often devalued, unrecognized, and uncompensated\u2014a form of invisible labor. Professional language ideologies, some paradoxically perpetuated by the profession itself, contribute to interpreters\u2019 invisibility in their workplaces. Global and multilingual organizations depend on ideologies of transparency and the assumption that language transmission is easy; examining interpreters\u2019 labor ethnographically troubles these assumptions. Interpreters also confront an ethical tension in their position that mirrors a tension in anthropology: namely, between ideals of professional neutrality and analytic distance versus intentional advocacy. The study of interpreters offers ways to critically assess anthropologists\u2019 own professional practices and dig deeply into the contradictions of global capitalism.", "generated_text": "This study examines the invisible labor and ethical considerations of interpreters within the context of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews with professional interpreters, we explore the complex role of these linguistic mediators in facilitating cross-cultural communication. Our findings reveal that interpreters often engage in unrecognized emotional and cognitive labor, navigating cultural nuances and power dynamics while striving to maintain neutrality. We argue that the invisibility of interpreters' work in global capitalist systems and humanitarian contexts raises significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding voice, agency, and representation. The study highlights the need for greater recognition of interpreters' contributions and the development of ethical frameworks that address the unique challenges they face. By shedding light on these hidden aspects of interpretation, we contribute to ongoing discussions about language, power, and ethics in an increasingly interconnected world.", "label": 1}
