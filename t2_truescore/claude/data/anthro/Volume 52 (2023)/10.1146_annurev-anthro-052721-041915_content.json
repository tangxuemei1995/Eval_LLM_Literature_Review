{"grounding": "This review surveys studies of men and masculinities in anthropology and ethnography from other disciplines, as well as theoretical frameworks and debates among anthropologists and other relevant scholars in the field. It also aims to assess developments in these studies since an earlier Annual Review of Anthropology article was published on this subject. By considering the ethnographic boom in men and masculinities studies across the globe since 2000, increasingly authored by anthropologists from the Global South, this review considers anthropology's singular contributions topically and conceptually\u2014for example, masculinity and militarism, men and public health, gender inequalities, and trans* social movements\u2014including through innovative research in biological and linguistic anthropology and archaeology. Throughout, this article reflects on the extent to which anthropologists have moved (and if they should have moved) beyond the study of women or men to instead explore gender, sex, and sexuality of humans and nonhuman animals in less binary frameworks.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the anthropological understanding of masculinity, addressing the often overlooked aspects of men's experiences in gender studies. By examining masculinity through an intersectional lens, we explore how various cultural, social, and economic factors shape male identities and behaviors across diverse societies. The research draws on ethnographic data from multiple cultural contexts to analyze how masculinity intersects with sexuality, power dynamics, and social inequalities. We argue that contemporary masculinities are undergoing significant transformations in response to global shifts in gender norms and socioeconomic conditions. The findings reveal the complex and sometimes contradictory ways in which men negotiate their identities, challenging essentialist notions of masculinity. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on men and masculinities, offering new insights into the processes of gender construction and the potential for positive change in gender relations.", "label": 0}
