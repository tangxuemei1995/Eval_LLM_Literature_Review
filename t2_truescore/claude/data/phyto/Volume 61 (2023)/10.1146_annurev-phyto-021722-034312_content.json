{"grounding": "Plant disease control requires novel approaches to mitigate the spread of and losses caused by current, emerging, and re-emerging diseases and to adapt plant protection to global climate change and the restrictions on the use of conventional pesticides. Currently, disease management relies mainly on biopesticides, which are required for the sustainable use of plant-protection products. Functional peptides are candidate biopesticides because they originate from living organisms or are synthetic analogs and provide novel mechanisms of action against plant pathogens. Hundreds of compounds exist that cover an extensive range of activities against viruses, bacteria and phytoplasmas, fungi and oomycetes, and nematodes. Natural sources, chemical synthesis, and biotechnological platforms may provide peptides at large scale for the industry and growers. The main challenges for their use in plant disease protection are (a) the requirement of stability in the plant environment and counteracting resistance in pathogen populations, (b) the need to develop suitable formulations to increase their shelf life and methods of application, (c) the selection of compounds with acceptable toxicological profiles, and (d) the high cost of production for agricultural purposes. In the near future, it is expected that several functional peptides will be commercially available for plant disease control, but more effort is needed to validate their efficacy at the field level and fulfill the requirements of the regulatory framework.", "generated_text": "Plant diseases pose significant threats to global food security and agricultural sustainability. The development of novel, environmentally friendly strategies for plant disease control is crucial. This review explores the potential of functional peptides as innovative biopesticides for managing plant pathogens. We examine the diverse mechanisms of action employed by these peptides, including membrane disruption, enzyme inhibition, and modulation of host defense responses. The natural sources of functional peptides are discussed, ranging from plants and microorganisms to insects and marine organisms. We analyze various production methods, including extraction from natural sources, chemical synthesis, and recombinant expression systems, highlighting their advantages and limitations. The review also addresses the challenges and opportunities in developing functional peptides as commercial biopesticides, such as stability, formulation, and regulatory considerations. Furthermore, we present case studies of successful applications of peptide-based products in controlling economically important plant diseases. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the current state of functional peptides in plant disease control and their potential to revolutionize sustainable agriculture practices.", "label": 1}
