{"grounding": "The plant immune system perceives pathogens to trigger defense responses. In turn, pathogens secrete effector molecules to subvert these defense responses. The initiation and maintenance of defense responses involve not only de novo synthesis of regulatory proteins and enzymes but also their regulated degradation. The latter is achieved through protein degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS). The UPS regulates all stages of immunity, from the perception of the pathogen to the execution of the response, and, therefore, constitutes an ideal candidate for microbial manipulation of the host. Pathogen effector molecules interfere with the plant UPS through several mechanisms. This includes hijacking general UPS functions or perturbing its ability to degrade specific targets. In this review, we describe how the UPS regulates different immunity-related processes and how pathogens subvert this to promote disease.", "generated_text": "The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in plant immunity and cellular homeostasis. This review explores how plant pathogens manipulate the UPS to promote infection and suppress host defenses. We examine the diverse strategies employed by microbial effectors to interfere with ubiquitination processes, proteasome function, and overall proteostasis. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogen-mediated UPS manipulation are discussed, highlighting the intricate interplay between plant immunity and microbial virulence factors. The review also addresses the potential of targeting the UPS for developing novel plant protection strategies. By elucidating the complex relationship between the UPS and plant-pathogen interactions, this work provides valuable insights into the evolution of microbial virulence mechanisms and opens new avenues for enhancing crop resistance to diseases.", "label": 0}
