{"grounding": "Plant-parasitic nematodes are one of the most insidious pests limiting agricultural production, parasitizing mostly belowground and occasionally aboveground plant parts. They are an important and underestimated component of the estimated 30% yield loss inflicted on crops globally by biotic constraints. Nematode damage is intensified by interactions with biotic and abiotic factors constraints: soilborne pathogens, soil fertility degradation, reduced soil biodiversity, climate variability, and policies influencing the development of improved management options. This review focuses on the following topics: (a) biotic and abiotic constraints, (b) modification of production systems, (c) agricultural policies, (d) the microbiome, (e) genetic solutions, and (f) remote sensing. Improving integrated nematode management (INM) across all scales of agricultural production and along the Global North\u2013Global South divide, where inequalities influence access to technology, is discussed. The importance of the integration of technological development in INM is critical to improving food security and human well-being in the future.", "generated_text": "Integrated nematode management (INM) faces significant challenges in a rapidly changing world. This review explores the constraints, policies, processes, and emerging technologies that will shape the future of INM. We examine the complex interactions between nematodes, plant microbiomes, and soil ecosystems, highlighting the need for holistic approaches to management. The paper discusses the role of policy in promoting sustainable INM practices and the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with cutting-edge scientific advancements. We analyze the potential of genome editing and genetics in developing nematode-resistant crop varieties, as well as the application of remote sensing technologies for early detection and monitoring of nematode infestations. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical importance of maintaining root health in INM strategies. By addressing these interconnected aspects, this review provides a comprehensive outlook on the future of INM and its potential to enhance global food security and agricultural sustainability.", "label": 1}
