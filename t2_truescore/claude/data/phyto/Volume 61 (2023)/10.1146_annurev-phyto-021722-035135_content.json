{"grounding": "Harvested fruit and vegetables are perishable, subject to desiccation, show increased respiration during ripening, and are colonized by postharvest fungal pathogens. Induced resistance is a strategy to control diseases by eliciting biochemical processes in fruits and vegetables. This is accomplished by modulating the progress of ripening and senescence, which maintains the produce in a state of heightened resistance to decay-causing fungi. Utilization of induced resistance to protect produce has been improved by scientific tools that better characterize physiological changes in plants. Induced resistance slows the decline of innate immunity after harvest and increases the production of defensive responses that directly inhibit plant pathogens. This increase in defense response in fruits and vegetables contributes to higher amounts of phenols and antioxidant compounds, improving both the quality and appearance of the produce. This review summarizes mechanisms and treatments that induce resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables to suppress fungal colonization. Moreover, it highlights the importance of host maturity and stage of ripening as limiting conditions for the improved expression of induced-resistance processes.", "generated_text": "Induced resistance in fruits and vegetables has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate postharvest disease development. This review explores the physiological mechanisms underlying induced resistance and its impact on fruit and vegetable quality during storage. We examine how various elicitors trigger defense responses, activating signaling pathways and enhancing the production of secondary metabolites. The interplay between induced resistance and ripening processes is discussed, highlighting the potential for maturation delay as a beneficial side effect. We analyze the influence of pre- and postharvest factors on the efficacy of induced resistance, including cultivar selection, environmental conditions, and application methods. The review also addresses challenges in implementing induced resistance strategies, such as maintaining product quality and optimizing treatment protocols. By integrating current knowledge on host physiological responses, this work provides insights into the development of sustainable approaches for reducing postharvest losses and preserving the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables.", "label": 1}
