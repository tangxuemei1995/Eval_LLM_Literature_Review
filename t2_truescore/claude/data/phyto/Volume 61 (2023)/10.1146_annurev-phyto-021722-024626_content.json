{"grounding": "Society is confronted by interconnected threats to ecological sustainability. Among these is the devastation of forests by destructive non-native pathogens and insects introduced through global trade, leading to the loss of critical ecosystem services and a global forest health crisis. We argue that the forest health crisis is a public-good social dilemma and propose a response framework that incorporates principles of collective action. This framework enables scientists to better engage policymakers and empowers the public to advocate for proactive biosecurity and forest health management. Collective action in forest health features broadly inclusive stakeholder engagement to build trust and set goals; accountability for destructive pest introductions; pooled support for weakest-link partners; and inclusion of intrinsic and nonmarket values of forest ecosystems in risk assessment. We provide short-term and longer-term measures that incorporate the above principles to shift the societal and ecological forest health paradigm to a more resilient state.", "generated_text": "The global forest health crisis, exacerbated by biological invasions, climate change, and human activities, presents a critical public-good social dilemma requiring urgent international collective action. This paper examines the complex interplay between natural resource policy, global change, and conservation of biodiversity in addressing the deteriorating state of the world's forests. We analyze the challenges of coordinating efforts across national boundaries to combat invasive species, mitigate climate impacts, and preserve forest ecosystems. The study highlights the inadequacy of current policy frameworks and proposes innovative approaches to foster global cooperation. By framing forest health as a shared responsibility, we argue for the development of comprehensive, transnational strategies that balance economic interests with ecological imperatives. Our findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift in forest management, emphasizing the importance of collaborative research, knowledge sharing, and coordinated policy implementation to safeguard this vital global resource.", "label": 1}
