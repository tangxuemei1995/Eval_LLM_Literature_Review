{"grounding": "Membrane trafficking pathways play a prominent role in plant immunity. The endomembrane transport system coordinates membrane-bound cellular organelles to ensure that immunological components are utilized effectively during pathogen resistance. Adapted pathogens and pests have evolved to interfere with aspects of membrane transport systems to subvert plant immunity. To do this, they secrete virulence factors known as effectors, many of which converge on host membrane trafficking routes. The emerging paradigm is that effectors redundantly target every step of membrane trafficking from vesicle budding to trafficking and membrane fusion. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms adopted by plant pathogens to reprogram host plant vesicle trafficking, providing examples of effector-targeted transport pathways and highlighting key questions for the field to answer moving forward.", "generated_text": "Plant pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate host cellular processes, particularly membrane trafficking, to promote infection. This review explores how diverse pathogens subvert plant endomembrane systems, focusing on the interplay between effector proteins and key components of vesicle transport, protein secretion, and autophagy pathways. We discuss the mechanisms by which pathogens hijack these processes to suppress plant immunity, facilitate nutrient acquisition, and establish specialized infection structures such as haustoria. Recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of effector-mediated trafficking perturbations are highlighted, revealing common themes and unique adaptations across different pathosystems. This knowledge not only enhances our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions but also provides potential targets for developing novel disease resistance strategies in crops.", "label": 1}
