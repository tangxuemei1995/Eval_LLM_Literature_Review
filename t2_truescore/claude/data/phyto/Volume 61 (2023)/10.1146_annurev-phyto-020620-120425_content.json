{"grounding": "Viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic symbionts interact with algae in a variety of ways to cause disease complexes, often shaping marine and freshwater ecosystems. The advent of phyconomy (a.k.a. seaweed agronomy) represents a need for a greater understanding of algal disease interactions, where underestimated cryptic diversity and lack of phycopathological basis are prospective constraints for algal domestication. Here, we highlight the limited yet increasing knowledge of algal pathogen biodiversity and the ecological interaction with their algal hosts. Finally, we discuss how ecology and cultivation experience contribute to and reinforce aquaculture practice, with the potential to reshape biosecurity policies of seaweed cultivation worldwide.", "generated_text": "The field of phycopathology, the study of algal diseases, is experiencing a renaissance driven by the increasing importance of algal aquaculture and ecological concerns. This review explores the resurgence of interest in algal pathogens and their impacts on both cultivated and natural algal populations. We examine recent advances in understanding algal disease dynamics, host-pathogen interactions, and the ecological consequences of infections. The paper also discusses the implications for biosecurity in algal aquaculture and the potential threats to marine ecosystems. By integrating insights from algal biology, ecology, and parasitology, this review highlights the critical role of phycopathology in addressing current challenges in algal research and management.", "label": 1}
