{"grounding": "Understanding the coevolutionary history of plants, pathogens, and disease resistance is vital for plant pathology. Here, I review Francis O. Holmes's work with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) framed by the foundational work of Nikolai Vavilov on the geographic centers of origin of plants and crop wild relatives (CWRs) and T. Harper Goodspeed's taxonomy of the genus Nicotiana. Holmes developed a hypothesis that the origin of host resistance to viruses was due to coevolution of both at a geographic center. In the 1950s, Holmes proved that genetic resistance to TMV, especially dominant R-genes, was centered in South America for Nicotiana and other solanaceous plants, including Capsicum, potato, and tomato. One seeming exception was eggplant (Solanum melongena). Not until the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s and recent advances in evolutionary taxonomy did it become evident that northeast Africa was the home of eggplant CWRs, far from Holmes's geographic center for TMV\u2013R-gene coevolution. Unbeknownst to most plant pathologists, Holmes's ideas predated those of H.H. Flor, including experimental proof of the gene-for-gene interaction, identification of R-genes, and deployment of dominant host genes to protect crop plants from virus-associated yield losses.", "generated_text": "The coevolution of viruses and their plant hosts is a dynamic process shaped by complex interactions over millions of years. This review explores the intricate relationship between plant viruses and host resistance within geographic centers of plant diversity, focusing on the impact of plate tectonics and long-term evolutionary processes. We examine how the movement of continents has influenced the distribution and diversification of both plants and their associated pathogens, leading to unique coevolutionary trajectories in different regions. The study highlights the importance of crop centers of diversity as hotspots for virus-host interactions, using the recent emergence of Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) as a case study. By analyzing the genetic diversity and resistance mechanisms in wild relatives of cultivated crops, we gain insights into the evolutionary arms race between viruses and their hosts. This research underscores the significance of preserving genetic diversity in crop wild relatives and the potential for harnessing ancient resistance genes to develop more resilient cultivars in the face of emerging viral threats.", "label": 1}
