{"grounding": "\nKitaviridae is a family of plant-infecting viruses that have multiple positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic segments. Kitaviruses are assigned into the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, mainly on the basis of the diversity of their genomic organization. Cell-to-cell movement of most kitaviruses is provided by the 30K family of proteins or the binary movement block, considered an alternative movement module among plant viruses. Kitaviruses stand out for producing conspicuously unusual locally restricted infections and showing deficient or nonsystemic movement likely resulting from incompatible or suboptimal interactions with their hosts. Transmission of kitaviruses is mediated by mites of many species of the genus Brevipalpus and at least one species of eriophyids. Kitavirus genomes encode numerous orphan open reading frames but RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the transmembrane helix-containing protein, generically called SP24, typify a close phylogenetic link with arthropod viruses. Kitaviruses infect a large range of host plants and cause diseases of economic concern in crops such as citrus, tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry.", "generated_text": "Kitaviruses represent a unique group of atypical plant viruses that cause nonsystemic diseases, primarily affecting citrus and other economically important crops. This review explores the characteristics and significance of three genera within the Kitaviridae family: Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus. These viruses are primarily transmitted by Brevipalpus mites and are associated with localized symptoms, most notably citrus leprosis. The article examines the genomic organization, replication strategies, and host-pathogen interactions of kitaviruses, highlighting their distinctive features compared to systemic plant viruses. Additionally, the review discusses the evolutionary relationships between kitaviruses and negeviruses, shedding light on their potential common ancestry. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of kitaviruses is crucial for developing effective management strategies to mitigate their economic impact on agriculture. This comprehensive overview provides valuable insights into the current state of knowledge on kitaviruses and identifies areas for future research in this emerging field of plant virology.", "label": 1}
