{"grounding": "The group of strains constituting the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) is a prominent model for the study of plant-pathogenic bacteria because of its impact on agriculture, owing to its wide host range, worldwide distribution, and long persistence in the environment. RSSC strains have led to numerous studies aimed at deciphering the molecular bases of virulence, and many biological functions and mechanisms have been described to contribute to host infection and pathogenesis. In this review, we put into perspective recent advances in our understanding of virulence in RSSC strains, both in terms of the inventory of functions that participate in this process and their evolutionary dynamics. We also present the different strategies that have been developed to combat these pathogenic strains through biological control, antimicrobial agents, plant genetics, or microbiota engineering.", "generated_text": "Ralstonia solanacearum, a devastating plant pathogen, causes bacterial wilt disease in numerous economically important crops worldwide. This review explores the complex arsenal of virulence strategies employed by R. solanacearum, including its ability to adapt to diverse environments and evade host defense mechanisms. We examine the evolutionary processes that have shaped the pathogen's genetic diversity and host range expansion. Additionally, we discuss current and emerging approaches for disease management, focusing on biological control methods and the manipulation of plant microbiota. The potential for developing durable resistance in host plants is evaluated, considering recent advances in genomics and molecular breeding techniques. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the intricate interactions between R. solanacearum and its hosts, offering valuable perspectives for future research and the development of sustainable control strategies.", "label": 1}
