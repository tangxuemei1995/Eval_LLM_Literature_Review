{"grounding": "\nPhytophthora capsici is a destructive oomycete pathogen of vegetable, ornamental, and tropical crops. First described by L.H. Leonian in 1922 as a pathogen of pepper in New Mexico, USA, P. capsici is now widespread in temperate and tropical countries alike. Phytophthora capsici is notorious for its capability to evade disease management strategies. High genetic diversity allows P. capsici populations to overcome fungicides and host resistance, the formation of oospores results in long-term persistence in soils, zoospore differentiation in the presence of water increases epidemic potential, and a broad host range maximizes economic losses and limits the effectiveness of crop rotation. The severity of disease caused by P. capsici and management challenges have led to numerous research efforts in the past 100 years. Here, we discuss recent findings regarding the biology, genetic diversity, disease management, fungicide resistance, host resistance, genomics, and effector biology of P. capsici.", "generated_text": "Phytophthora capsici, a devastating oomycete plant pathogen, has been a significant threat to vegetable crops worldwide since its description a century ago. This review examines the recent advancements in understanding the fundamental biology of P. capsici and the progress made in disease management strategies. We explore the pathogen's complex life cycle, host range expansion, and genetic diversity, which contribute to its adaptability and persistence. The review also discusses the emergence of fungicide resistance and its impact on conventional control methods. Furthermore, we highlight innovative approaches in disease management, including the development of resistant cultivars through molecular breeding techniques, biological control agents, and integrated pest management strategies. Despite considerable progress, challenges remain in effectively controlling P. capsici, emphasizing the need for continued research and collaborative efforts to safeguard global food security.", "label": 1}
