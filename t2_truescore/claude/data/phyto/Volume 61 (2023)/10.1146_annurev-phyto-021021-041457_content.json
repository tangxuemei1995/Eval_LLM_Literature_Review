{"grounding": "Plant and soil microbiomes are integral to the health and productivity of plants and ecosystems, yet researchers struggle to identify microbiome characteristics important for providing beneficial outcomes. Network analysis offers a shift in analytical framework beyond \u201cwho is present\u201d to the organization or patterns of coexistence between microbes within the microbiome. Because microbial phenotypes are often significantly impacted by coexisting populations, patterns of coexistence within microbiomes are likely to be especially important in predicting functional outcomes. Here, we provide an overview of the how and why of network analysis in microbiome research, highlighting the ways in which network analyses have provided novel insights into microbiome organization and functional capacities, the diverse network roles of different microbial populations, and the eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant and soil microbiomes.", "generated_text": "Microbiome research has traditionally focused on taxonomic composition, but network analyses offer a powerful approach to uncover the complex interactions within microbial communities. This review explores the application of network-based methods in microbial ecology, with a particular emphasis on plant and soil microbiomes. We discuss how coassociation and co-occurrence networks can reveal functional modules and keystone species, providing insights into community organization and ecosystem processes. The review highlights the potential of network analyses to bridge the gap between microbial community structure and function, offering a more holistic understanding of microbiome dynamics. By synthesizing recent advances in network-based approaches, we demonstrate their utility in deciphering the intricate relationships that shape microbial ecosystems and their impact on host health and environmental processes.", "label": 1}
