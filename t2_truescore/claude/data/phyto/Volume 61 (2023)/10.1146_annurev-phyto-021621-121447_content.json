{"grounding": "The microbiota populating the plant\u2013soil continuum defines an untapped resource for sustainable crop production. The host plant is a driver for the taxonomic composition and function of these microbial communities. In this review, we illustrate how the host genetic determinants of the microbiota have been shaped by plant domestication and crop diversification. We discuss how the heritable component of microbiota recruitment may represent, at least partially, a selection for microbial functions underpinning the growth, development, and health of their host plants and how the magnitude of this heritability is influenced by the environment. We illustrate how host\u2013microbiota interactions can be treated as an external quantitative trait and review recent studies associating crop genetics with microbiota-based quantitative traits. We also explore the results of reductionist approaches, including synthetic microbial communities, to establish causal relationships between microbiota and plant phenotypes. Lastly, we propose strategies to integrate microbiota manipulation into crop selection programs. Although a detailed understanding of when and how heritability for microbiota composition can be deployed for breeding purposes is still lacking, we argue that advances in crop genomics are likely to accelerate wider applications of plant\u2013microbiota interactions in agriculture.", "generated_text": "The plant microbiota plays a crucial role in crop health, productivity, and resilience. Recent advances in microbiome research have revealed the intricate relationships between plants and their associated microbial communities. This review explores the potential of engineering crop microbiota through host genetics, focusing on the impact of plant domestication and breeding on microbial assemblages in the rhizosphere and root systems. We examine how selective breeding has inadvertently altered microbial communities and discuss strategies to harness host genetic variation to shape beneficial microbiomes. The review highlights key plant traits influencing microbial recruitment and colonization, including root exudate composition, immune responses, and root architecture. Furthermore, we assess the challenges and opportunities in integrating microbiome-aware approaches into crop improvement programs. By leveraging host genetics to optimize plant-microbe interactions, we can potentially enhance crop performance, reduce chemical inputs, and improve agricultural sustainability. This emerging field holds promise for developing resilient cropping systems capable of adapting to changing environmental conditions and meeting global food security challenges.", "label": 1}
