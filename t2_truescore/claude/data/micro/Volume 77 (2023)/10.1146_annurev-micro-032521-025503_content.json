{"grounding": "Two of the most fascinating bacterial nanomachines\u2014the broadly disseminated rotary flagellum at the heart of cellular motility and the eukaryotic cell\u2013puncturing injectisome essential to specific pathogenic species\u2014utilize at their core a conserved export machinery called the type III secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS not only secretes the components that self-assemble into their extracellular appendages but also, in the case of the injectisome, subsequently directly translocates modulating effector proteins from the bacterial cell into the infected host. The injectisome is thought to have evolved from the flagellum as a minimal secretory system lacking motility, with the subsequent acquisition of additional components tailored to its specialized role in manipulating eukaryotic hosts for pathogenic advantage. Both nanomachines have long been the focus of intense interest, but advances in structural and functional understanding have taken a significant step forward since 2015, facilitated by the revolutionary advances in cryo-electron microscopy technologies. With several seminal structures of each nanomachine now captured, we review here the molecular similarities and differences that underlie their diverse functions.", "generated_text": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are essential virulence factors in many pathogenic bacteria, playing crucial roles in both the bacterial flagellum and the injectisome. This review synthesizes recent structural insights into these complex nanomachines, focusing on advances made possible by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques. We compare and contrast the structural features of the flagellar and injectisome T3SS, highlighting their shared evolutionary origins and functional similarities. The review examines the architecture of key components, including the basal body, export apparatus, and cytoplasmic components, revealing intricate mechanisms of assembly and regulation. Furthermore, we discuss how these structural findings inform our understanding of T3SS function, substrate specificity, and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. This comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for future research aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of T3SS and developing novel strategies to combat bacterial infections.", "label": 1}
