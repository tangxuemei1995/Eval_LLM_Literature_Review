{"grounding": "Related groups of microbes are widely distributed across Earth's habitats, implying numerous dispersal and adaptation events over evolutionary time. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics and mechanisms of these habitat transitions, particularly for populations that reside in animal microbiomes. Here, we review the literature concerning habitat transitions among a variety of bacterial and archaeal lineages, considering the frequency of migration events, potential environmental barriers, and mechanisms of adaptation to new physicochemical conditions, including the modification of protein inventories and other genomic characteristics. Cells dependent on microbial hosts, particularly bacteria from the Candidate Phyla Radiation, have undergone repeated habitat transitions from environmental sources into animal microbiomes. We compare their trajectories to those of both free-living cells\u2014including the Melainabacteria, Elusimicrobia, and methanogenic archaea\u2014and cellular endosymbionts and bacteriophages, which have made similar transitions. We conclude by highlighting major related topics that may be worthy of future study.", "generated_text": "This review explores the evolutionary processes driving habitat transitions in bacteria and archaea, focusing on the interplay between dispersal and adaptation. We examine the mechanisms enabling microbial colonization of diverse environments, from extreme habitats to the human microbiome. Special attention is given to the Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria, which have undergone remarkable habitat transitions throughout their evolutionary history. The study synthesizes recent findings in environmental microbiology and human microbiome research to elucidate the factors influencing successful habitat shifts. We discuss the role of horizontal gene transfer, metabolic flexibility, and niche adaptation in facilitating these transitions. Additionally, we consider the implications of habitat transitions for microbial community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the evolutionary strategies employed by microorganisms to colonize new habitats and highlights the importance of understanding these processes in the context of global environmental changes and human health.", "label": 1}
