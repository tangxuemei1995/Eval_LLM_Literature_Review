{"grounding": "Fungal species have dynamic genomes and often exhibit genomic plasticity in response to stress. This genome plasticity often comes with phenotypic consequences that affect fitness and resistance to stress. Fungal pathogens exhibit genome plasticity in both clinical and agricultural settings and often during adaptation to antifungal drugs, posing significant challenges to human health. Therefore, it is important to understand the rates, mechanisms, and impact of large genomic changes. This review addresses the prevalence of polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation across diverse fungal species, with special attention to prominent fungal pathogens and model species. We also explore the relationship between environmental stress and rates of genomic changes and highlight the mechanisms underlying genotypic and phenotypic changes. A comprehensive understanding of these dynamic fungal genomes is needed to identify novel solutions for the increase in antifungal drug resistance.", "generated_text": "Fungal genomes exhibit remarkable plasticity, enabling rapid adaptation to diverse environmental stresses. This review explores the dynamic nature of fungal genomes, focusing on polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation as key mechanisms for stress response. We examine how these genomic alterations contribute to phenotypic diversity and enhanced fitness under challenging conditions. Recent advances in genomic technologies have revealed the prevalence and significance of these phenomena across various fungal species. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these genomic changes, their impact on gene expression and cellular physiology, and their role in evolution and adaptation. Furthermore, we highlight the potential implications of fungal genome plasticity for biotechnology, medicine, and agriculture. Understanding these dynamic processes provides valuable insights into fungal biology and may inform strategies for controlling pathogenic fungi or harnessing beneficial species for industrial applications.", "label": 0}
