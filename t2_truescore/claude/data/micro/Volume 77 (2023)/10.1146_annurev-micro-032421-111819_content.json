{"grounding": "Amino acids are indispensable substrates for protein synthesis in all organisms and incorporated into diverse aspects of metabolic physiology and signaling. However, animals lack the ability to synthesize several of them and must acquire these essential amino acids from their diet or perhaps their associated microbial communities. The essential amino acids therefore occupy a unique position in the health of animals and their relationships with microbes. Here we review recent work connecting microbial production and metabolism of essential amino acids to host biology, and the reciprocal impacts of host metabolism of essential amino acids on their associated microbes. We focus on the roles of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) and tryptophan on host-microbe communication in the intestine of humans and other vertebrates. We then conclude by highlighting research questions surrounding the less-understood aspects of microbial essential amino acid synthesis in animal hosts.", "generated_text": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, influencing various physiological processes through complex host-microbe interactions. This review explores the emerging evidence on essential amino acid metabolites as key chemical mediators in these interactions, focusing on valine, isoleucine, leucine, and tryptophan. We discuss how microbial metabolism of these amino acids produces bioactive compounds that affect host metabolism, immune function, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Particular attention is given to tryptophan metabolism and its impact on serotonin production, highlighting the gut-brain axis. The review also examines the potential therapeutic implications of modulating these metabolic pathways in treating gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic diseases, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Understanding these intricate relationships between essential amino acid metabolites and the gut microbiome opens new avenues for developing targeted interventions to improve human health.", "label": 1}
