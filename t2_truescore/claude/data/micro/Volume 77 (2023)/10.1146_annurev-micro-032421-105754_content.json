{"grounding": "The gut microbiome is a dense and metabolically active consortium of microorganisms and viruses located in the lower gastrointestinal tract of the human body. Bacteria and their viruses (phages) are the most abundant members of the gut microbiome. Investigating their biology and the interplay between the two is important if we are to understand their roles in human health and disease. In this review, we summarize recent advances in resolving the taxonomic structure and ecological functions of the complex community of phages in the human gut\u2014the gut phageome. We discuss how age, diet, and geography can all have a significant impact on phageome composition. We note that alterations to the gut phageome have been observed in several diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer, and we evaluate whether these phageome changes can directly or indirectly contribute to disease etiology and pathogenesis. We also highlight how lack of standardization in studying the gut phageome has contributed to variation in reported results.", "generated_text": "The human gut phageome, comprising bacteriophages within the intestinal microbiome, plays a crucial role in shaping microbial communities and influencing host health. This review explores the factors contributing to variations in the gut phageome across individuals and populations. We examine the impact of diet, age, geography, and lifestyle on phage diversity and abundance. Additionally, we discuss the dynamic interactions between phages and their bacterial hosts, including lysogeny and lytic cycles, which significantly influence phageome composition. The review also addresses the potential role of the gut phageome in health and disease, highlighting its involvement in maintaining microbial balance, modulating immune responses, and its potential as a biomarker for various conditions. Furthermore, we explore emerging technologies for studying the phageome and discuss challenges in characterizing these complex viral communities. Understanding the factors affecting gut phageome variation is crucial for developing targeted interventions and harnessing the therapeutic potential of bacteriophages in human health.", "label": 1}
