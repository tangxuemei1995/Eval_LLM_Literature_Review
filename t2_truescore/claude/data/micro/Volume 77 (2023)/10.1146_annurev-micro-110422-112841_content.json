{"grounding": "My scientific career has resulted from key decisions and reorientations, sometimes taken rapidly but not always, guided by discussions or collaborations with amazing individuals from whom I learnt a lot scientifically and humanly. I had never anticipated that I would accomplish so much in what appeared as terra incognita when I started to interrogate the mechanisms underlying the virulence of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. All this has been possible thanks to a number of talented team members who ultimately became friends.", "generated_text": "This article explores the journey of Listeria monocytogenes from a little-known bacterium to a prominent model system in cellular microbiology and infection biology. It highlights key discoveries in DNA-protein interactions, RNA-mediated regulation, and postgenomic approaches that have contributed to our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis. The author provides an autobiographical perspective on the development of the 'Listeria paradigm,' emphasizing its impact on the field and its potential for future research in microbial pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions.", "label": 0}
