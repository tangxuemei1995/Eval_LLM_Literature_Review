{"grounding": "Fungal-mediated disease progression and antifungal drug efficacy are significantly impacted by the dynamic infection microenvironment. At the site of infection, oxygen often becomes limiting and induces a hypoxia response in both the fungal pathogen and host cells. The fungal hypoxia response impacts several important aspects of fungal biology that contribute to pathogenesis, virulence, antifungal drug susceptibility, and ultimately infection outcomes. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the hypoxia response in the most common human fungal pathogens, discuss potential therapeutic opportunities, and highlight important areas for future research.", "generated_text": "Recent research has shed light on the critical role of hypoxia in the pathogenesis of human fungal infections. This review explores the latest advances in understanding how fungal pathogens adapt to low-oxygen environments within the host, and how this adaptation contributes to disease progression. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced changes in fungal virulence factors, metabolic pathways, and stress responses. Additionally, we examine the implications of these findings for the development of novel antifungal therapies targeting hypoxia-related processes. This growing body of knowledge offers promising avenues for improving the diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.", "label": 1}
