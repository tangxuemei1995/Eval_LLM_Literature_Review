{"grounding": "Apicomplexan parasites constitute more than 6,000 species infecting a wide range of hosts. These include important pathogens such as those causing malaria and toxoplasmosis. Their evolutionary emergence coincided with the dawn of animals. Mitochondrial genomes of apicomplexan parasites have undergone dramatic reduction in their coding capacity, with genes for only three proteins and ribosomal RNA genes present in scrambled fragments originating from both strands. Different branches of the apicomplexans have undergone rearrangements of these genes, with Toxoplasma having massive variations in gene arrangements spread over multiple copies. The vast evolutionary distance between the parasite and the host mitochondria has been exploited for the development of antiparasitic drugs, especially those used to treat malaria, wherein inhibition of the parasite mitochondrial respiratory chain is selectively targeted with little toxicity to the host mitochondria. We describe additional unique characteristics of the parasite mitochondria that are being investigated and provide greater insights into these deep-branching eukaryotic pathogens.", "generated_text": "Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, possess unique mitochondrial features that distinguish them from other eukaryotes. This review explores the distinctive properties of apicomplexan mitochondria, focusing on their electron transport complexes and ATP synthase. These organelles exhibit streamlined metabolic pathways and unconventional structural adaptations, which contribute to their essential roles in parasite survival and replication. We discuss the recent advances in understanding the composition and function of apicomplexan respiratory chain components, highlighting their divergence from canonical mitochondrial systems. Additionally, we examine the potential of these unique mitochondrial features as targets for antiparasitic drug development. The atypical characteristics of apicomplexan mitochondria not only provide insights into the evolutionary history of the Myzozoa phylum but also offer promising avenues for therapeutic interventions against devastating parasitic diseases.", "label": 1}
