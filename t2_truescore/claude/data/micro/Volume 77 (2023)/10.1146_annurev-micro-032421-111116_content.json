{"grounding": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are present in all gram-negative bacteria and mediate energy-dependent uptake of molecules that are too scarce or large to be taken up efficiently by outer membrane (OM) diffusion channels. This process requires energy that is derived from the proton motive force and delivered to TBDTs by the TonB-ExbBD motor complex in the inner membrane. Together with the need to preserve the OM permeability barrier, this has led to an extremely complex and fascinating transport mechanism for which the fundamentals, despite decades of research, are still unclear. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the transport mechanism of TBDTs, their potential role in the delivery of novel antibiotics, and the important contributions made by TBDT-associated (lipo)proteins.", "generated_text": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are essential components of the bacterial outer membrane, facilitating active transport of vital nutrients across the cell envelope. This review explores the structure and function of TBDTs, focusing on their \u03b2-barrel architecture and the energy-coupling mechanism involving the TonB complex. We discuss the diversity of substrates transported by TBDTs, including iron siderophores, vitamin B12, and carbohydrates, with particular emphasis on their role in Bacteroidetes. The potential of TBDTs as targets for novel antimicrobial strategies, such as Trojan horse antibiotics, is examined. Recent advances in structural biology and biophysical techniques have provided new insights into the transport mechanism, paving the way for rational drug design and innovative approaches to combat antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.", "label": 1}
