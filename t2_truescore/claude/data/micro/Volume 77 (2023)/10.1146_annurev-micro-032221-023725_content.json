{"grounding": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is the physiological process that enables the reduction or oxidation of molecules and minerals beyond the surface of a microbial cell. The first bacteria characterized with this capability were Shewanella and Geobacter, both reported to couple their growth to the reduction of iron or manganese oxide minerals located extracellularly. A key difference between EET and nearly every other respiratory activity on Earth is the need to transfer electrons beyond the cell membrane. The past decade has resolved how well-conserved strategies conduct electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface. However, recent data suggest a much wider and less well understood collection of mechanisms enabling electron transfer to distant acceptors. This review reflects the current state of knowledge from Shewanella and Geobacter, specifically focusing on transfer across the outer membrane and beyond\u2014an activity that enables reduction of highly variable minerals, electrodes, and even other organisms.", "generated_text": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a crucial process in microbial metabolism, particularly in metal-reducing bacteria such as Shewanella and Geobacter species. This review explores the mechanisms by which these organisms transfer electrons beyond their outer membrane to external electron acceptors. We discuss the role of multiheme cytochromes in facilitating direct electron transfer and the importance of conductive pili in long-range electron transport. Additionally, we examine the use of electron shuttles, both endogenous and exogenous, in mediating indirect electron transfer. Recent advances in understanding the molecular structures and electron transfer kinetics of key proteins involved in EET are highlighted. The implications of these findings for biotechnological applications, including microbial fuel cells and bioremediation, are also addressed. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the diverse strategies employed by bacteria to 'put electrons to rest' beyond their cellular boundaries.", "label": 1}
