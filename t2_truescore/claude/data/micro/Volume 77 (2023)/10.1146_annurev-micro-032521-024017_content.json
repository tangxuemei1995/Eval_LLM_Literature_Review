{"grounding": "The immune system of multicellular organisms protects them from harmful microbes. To establish an infection in the face of host immune responses, pathogens must evolve specific strategies to target immune defense mechanisms. One such defense is the formation of intracellular protein complexes, termed inflammasomes, that are triggered by the detection of microbial components and the disruption of homeostatic processes that occur during bacterial infection. Formation of active inflammasomes initiates programmed cell death pathways via activation of inflammatory caspases and cleavage of target proteins. Inflammasome-activated cell death pathways such as pyroptosis lead to proinflammatory responses that protect the host. Bacterial infection has the capacity to influence inflammasomes in two distinct ways: activation and perturbation. In this review, we discuss how bacterial activities influence inflammasomes, and we discuss the consequences of inflammasome activation or evasion for both the host and pathogen.", "generated_text": "Inflammasomes are crucial components of the innate immune system, orchestrating inflammatory responses to microbial threats. This review explores the intricate interplay between bacterial pathogens and inflammasome signaling pathways. We examine how diverse bacterial species modulate the activation of key inflammasome components, including NLRs, caspase-1, and caspase-8. The role of gasdermin-mediated pyroptosis in bacterial infection is also discussed. We highlight recent discoveries revealing both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive strategies employed by bacteria to manipulate inflammasome signaling. Understanding these complex interactions is essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches to combat bacterial infections and associated inflammatory disorders. This review provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial influence on inflammasome activation and its implications for host-pathogen interactions and immune regulation.", "label": 0}
