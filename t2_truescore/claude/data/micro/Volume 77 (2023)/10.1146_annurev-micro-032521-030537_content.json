{"grounding": "\nRalstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) strains are devastating plant pathogens distributed worldwide. The primary cell density\u2013dependent gene expression system in RSSC strains is phc quorum sensing (QS). It regulates the expression of about 30% of all genes, including those related to cellular activity, primary and secondary metabolism, pathogenicity, and more. The phc regulatory elements encoded by the phcBSRQ operon and phcA gene play vital roles. RSSC strains use methyl 3-hydroxymyristate (3-OH MAME) or methyl 3-hydroxypalmitate (3-OH PAME) as the QS signal. Each type of RSSC strain has specificity in generating and receiving its QS signal, but their signaling pathways might not differ significantly. In this review, I describe the genetic and biochemical factors involved in QS signal input and the regulatory network and summarize control of the phc QS system, new cell\u2013cell communications, and QS-dependent interactions with soil fungi.", "generated_text": "The Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) comprises devastating plant pathogens that cause bacterial wilt in numerous crops worldwide. This study investigates the phc quorum-sensing system, a crucial regulatory mechanism in RSSC pathogenicity and virulence. We examine the molecular components and signaling pathways of the phc system across different RSSC species, including R. solanacearum and R. pseudosolanacearum. Our findings reveal that the phc system plays a pivotal role in cell-cell communication, coordinating gene expression and virulence factor production in response to bacterial population density. We demonstrate that mutations in key phc genes significantly impact pathogen fitness, host colonization, and disease progression. Furthermore, we identify species-specific variations in the phc system that may contribute to the diverse host ranges and geographical distributions observed within the RSSC. This research provides valuable insights into RSSC pathogenicity mechanisms and potential targets for developing novel control strategies against bacterial wilt.", "label": 1}
