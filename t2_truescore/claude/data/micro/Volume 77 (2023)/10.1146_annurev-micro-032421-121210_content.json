{"grounding": "Infections caused by malaria parasites place an enormous burden on the world's poorest communities. Breakthrough drugs with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. As an organism that undergoes rapid growth and division, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is highly reliant on protein synthesis, which in turn requires aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) to charge tRNAs with their corresponding amino acid. Protein translation is required at all stages of the parasite life cycle; thus, aaRS inhibitors have the potential for whole-of-life-cycle antimalarial activity. This review focuses on efforts to identify potent plasmodium-specific aaRS inhibitors using phenotypic screening, target validation, and structure-guided drug design. Recent work reveals that aaRSs are susceptible targets for a class of AMP-mimicking nucleoside sulfamates that target the enzymes via a novel reaction hijacking mechanism. This finding opens up the possibility of generating bespoke inhibitors of different aaRSs, providing new drug leads.", "generated_text": "Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. This study explores the potential of targeting aaRSs for antimalarial drug development through reaction hijacking. We investigated the structural and functional differences between Plasmodium falciparum and human aaRSs to identify selective inhibitors. Using in silico screening and biochemical assays, we identified several promising compounds that selectively inhibit P. falciparum aaRSs without affecting their human counterparts. These inhibitors demonstrated potent antimalarial activity in vitro and in vivo, with minimal toxicity to human cells. Our findings highlight the potential of aaRSs as novel drug targets for malaria treatment and provide a foundation for further development of selective inhibitors. This approach may lead to new antimalarial therapies with reduced side effects and decreased risk of resistance development.", "label": 1}
