{"grounding": "The emergence of animals from their unicellular ancestors is a major evolutionary event. Thanks to the study of diverse close unicellular relatives of animals, we now have a better grasp of what the unicellular ancestor of animals was like. However, it is unclear how that unicellular ancestor of animals became the first animals. To explain this transition, two popular theories, the choanoblastaea and the synzoospore, have been proposed. We will revise and expose the flaws in these two theories while showing that, due to the limits of our current knowledge, the origin of animals is a biological black swan event. As such, the origin of animals defies retrospective explanations. Therefore, we should be extra careful not to fall for confirmation biases based on few data and, instead, embrace this uncertainty and be open to alternative scenarios. With the aim to broaden the potential explanations on how animals emerged, we here propose two novel and alternative scenarios. In any case, to find the answer to how animals evolved, additional data will be required, as will the hunt for microscopic creatures that are closely related to animals but have not yet been sampled and studied.", "generated_text": "The emergence of metazoan multicellularity represents a pivotal moment in evolutionary history, yet its origins remain enigmatic. This review explores the potential for a microbial 'black swan' event as a catalyst for metazoan evolution. By synthesizing recent genomic and phylogenetic data from holozoans and their unicellular relatives, we propose a novel hypothesis for the transition to multicellularity. Our analysis suggests that a rare, transformative interaction between ancestral unicellular organisms and specific microbial communities may have triggered the genomic and cellular innovations necessary for metazoan development. We examine key genetic and molecular mechanisms that could have been influenced by this hypothetical event, including cell adhesion, signaling pathways, and developmental gene regulatory networks. Furthermore, we discuss how this scenario aligns with existing fossil evidence and molecular clock estimates. While speculative, this 'black swan' hypothesis offers a fresh perspective on metazoan origins and highlights the potential role of microbial interactions in major evolutionary transitions. Our findings underscore the need for further investigation into the complex interplay between unicellular ancestors, their microbial environments, and the emergence of animal multicellularity.", "label": 1}
