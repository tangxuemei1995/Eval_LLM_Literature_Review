{"grounding": "\nCandida auris is a multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen that presents a serious threat to global human health. Since the first reported case in 2009 in Japan, C. auris infections have been reported in more than 40 countries, with mortality rates between 30% and 60%. In addition, C. auris has the potential to cause outbreaks in health care settings, especially in nursing homes for elderly patients, owing to its efficient transmission via skin-to-skin contact. Most importantly, C. auris is the first fungal pathogen to show pronounced and sometimes untreatable clinical drug resistance to all known antifungal classes, including azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins. In this review, we explore the causes of the rapid spread of C. auris. We also highlight its genome organization and drug resistance mechanisms and propose future research directions that should be undertaken to curb the spread of this multidrug-resistant pathogen.", "generated_text": "Candida auris has emerged as a significant global health threat due to its multidrug-resistant nature and rapid spread. This review explores the genetic factors contributing to C. auris' emergence and antifungal resistance. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins, focusing on alterations in drug targets and efflux pumps. The unique cell wall composition of C. auris is discussed, highlighting its role in virulence and stress tolerance. Additionally, we investigate the MAP kinase signaling pathways involved in stress response and drug resistance. Understanding these genetic and molecular aspects is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat C. auris infections. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex interplay of factors driving the emergence and persistence of this formidable pathogen in healthcare settings worldwide.", "label": 1}
