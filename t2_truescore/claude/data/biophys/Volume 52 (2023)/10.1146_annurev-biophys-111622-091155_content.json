{"grounding": "Proteins guide the flows of information, energy, and matter that make life possible by accelerating transport and chemical reactions, by allosterically modulating these reactions, and by forming dynamic supramolecular assemblies. In these roles, conformational change underlies functional transitions. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction methods characterize these transitions either by directly triggering sequences of functionally important motions or, more broadly, by capturing the motions of which proteins are capable. To date, most successful have been experiments in which conformational change is triggered in light-dependent proteins. In this review, I emphasize emerging techniques that probe the dynamic basis of function in proteins lacking natively light-dependent transitions and speculate about extensions and further possibilities. In addition, I review how the weaker and more distributed signals in these data push the limits of the capabilities of analytical methods. Taken together, these new methods are beginning to establish a powerful paradigm for the study of the physics of protein function.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in time-resolved X-ray diffraction techniques have revolutionized our understanding of protein dynamics and mechanics. This review explores the cutting-edge approaches in serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography and time-resolved X-ray crystallography, highlighting their applications in studying protein excited states and conformational changes. We discuss the integration of electric field stimulation with these techniques, enabling the investigation of field-induced protein dynamics at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions. The synergy between these methods has provided invaluable insights into the structural basis of protein function, revealing transient intermediates and subtle conformational shifts previously inaccessible to traditional crystallographic approaches. Furthermore, we examine the challenges and future prospects of these emerging methodologies, including their potential to elucidate complex protein-ligand interactions and allosteric mechanisms. This review underscores the transformative impact of time-resolved X-ray diffraction on our comprehension of protein mechanics and its implications for drug discovery and protein engineering.", "label": 1}
