{"grounding": "Rhodopsin is the photoreceptor in human rod cells responsible for dim-light vision. The visual receptors are part of the large superfamily of G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate signal transduction in response to diverse diffusible ligands. The high level of sequence conservation within the transmembrane helices of the visual receptors and the family A GPCRs has long been considered evidence for a common pathway for signal transduction. I review recent studies that reveal a comprehensive mechanism for how light absorption by the retinylidene chromophore drives rhodopsin activation and highlight those features of the mechanism that are conserved across the ligand-activated GPCRs.", "generated_text": "Rhodopsin, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crucial for vision, undergoes a complex activation process upon light stimulation. This review explores the structural and mechanistic aspects of rhodopsin activation, integrating recent advances in crystallography, spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss the conformational changes triggered by photon absorption, including the isomerization of the retinal chromophore and subsequent rearrangements in the transmembrane helices. The role of conserved motifs and key residues in signal transduction is examined, along with the interactions between rhodopsin and its G protein partner, transducin. Understanding these molecular events provides insights into GPCR function and may guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches for visual disorders.", "label": 1}
