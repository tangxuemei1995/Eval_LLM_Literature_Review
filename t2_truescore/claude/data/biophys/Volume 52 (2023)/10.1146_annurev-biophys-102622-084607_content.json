{"grounding": "Advances in a scientific discipline are often measured by small, incremental steps. In this review, we report on two intertwined disciplines in the protein structure prediction field, modeling of single chains and modeling of complexes, that have over decades emulated this pattern, as monitored by the community-wide blind prediction experiments CASP and CAPRI. However, over the past few years, dramatic advances were observed for the accurate prediction of single protein chains, driven by a surge of deep learning methodologies entering the prediction field. We review the mainscientific developments that enabled these recent breakthroughs and feature the important role of blind prediction experiments in building up and nurturing the structure prediction field. We discuss how the new wave of artificial intelligence\u2013based methods is impacting the fields of computational and experimental structural biology and highlight areas in which deep learning methods are likely to lead to future developments, provided that major challenges are overcome.", "generated_text": "This review critically examines the current state of protein structure prediction methods, focusing on the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) competitions. We analyze recent advancements in artificial intelligence-driven approaches, particularly deep learning techniques, that have revolutionized the field. The paper evaluates the performance of various algorithms in predicting both individual protein structures and protein-protein interactions. We discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, highlighting areas where significant progress has been made and identifying persistent challenges. The impact of improved prediction accuracy on biological research and drug discovery is explored. Additionally, we consider the future directions of the field, including the integration of multiple data sources and the potential for real-time structure prediction. This comprehensive assessment provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in structural biology, bioinformatics, and related disciplines.", "label": 1}
