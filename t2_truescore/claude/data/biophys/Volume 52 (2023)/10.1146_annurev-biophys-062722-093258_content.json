{"grounding": "Efforts to combine theory and experiment to advance our knowledge of molecular processes relevant to biophysics have been considerably enhanced by the contribution of statistical-mechanics simulations. Key to the understanding of such molecular processes is the underlying free-energy change. Being able to accurately predict this change from first principles represents an appealing prospect. Over the past decades, the synergy between steadily growing computational resources and unrelenting methodological developments has brought free-energy calculations into the arsenal of tools commonly utilized to tackle important questions that experiment alone has left unresolved. The continued emergence of new options to determine free energies has also bred confusion amid the community of users, who may find it difficult to choose the best-suited algorithm to address the problem at hand. In an attempt to clarify the current landscape, this review recounts how the field has been shaped and how the broad gamut of methods available today is rooted in a few foundational principles laid down many years ago.Three examples of molecular processes central to biophysics illustrate where free-energy calculations stand and what are the conceptual and practical obstacles that we must overcome to increase their predictive power.", "generated_text": "Free energy calculations have become an indispensable tool in computational chemistry and molecular biology for understanding complex molecular processes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art free energy methods and their applications in describing various molecular phenomena. We discuss the fundamental principles of free energy calculations, including importance sampling techniques and enhanced sampling approaches, which have significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of these simulations. The review focuses on three key areas of application: molecular recognition and association, permeation processes, and conformational transitions. We examine how free energy methods have been successfully employed to elucidate binding affinities, characterize transport mechanisms across membranes, and explore protein folding landscapes. Additionally, we highlight recent methodological advancements and their impact on overcoming traditional limitations in free energy calculations. Finally, we address current challenges and future prospects in the field, emphasizing the potential for free energy methods to revolutionize drug discovery, materials design, and our understanding of biological processes at the molecular level.", "label": 1}
