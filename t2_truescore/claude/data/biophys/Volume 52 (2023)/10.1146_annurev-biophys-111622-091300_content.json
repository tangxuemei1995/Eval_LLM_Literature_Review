{"grounding": "Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has matured into a robust method for the determination of biological macromolecule structures in the past decade, complementing X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Constant methodological improvements in both cryo-EM hardware and image processing software continue to contribute to an exponential growth in the number of structures solved annually. In this review, we provide a historical view of the many steps that were required to make cryo-EM a successful method for the determination of high-resolution protein complex structures. We further discuss aspects of cryo-EM methodology that are the greatest pitfalls challenging successful structure determination to date. Lastly, we highlight and propose potential future developments that would improve the method even further in the near future.", "generated_text": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling the determination of 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes at near-atomic resolution. This review explores the recent advancements and current limitations of high-resolution single-particle cryo-EM. We discuss the technological improvements in electron detectors, sample preparation techniques, and image processing algorithms that have propelled cryo-EM to achieve atomic resolution. The potential of cryo-EM to elucidate the structures of challenging targets, such as membrane proteins and dynamic complexes, is highlighted. However, we also address the remaining challenges, including beam-induced damage, optical aberrations, and heterogeneity in sample populations. Finally, we consider future prospects for overcoming these limitations and further expanding the capabilities of cryo-EM in structural biology research.", "label": 1}
