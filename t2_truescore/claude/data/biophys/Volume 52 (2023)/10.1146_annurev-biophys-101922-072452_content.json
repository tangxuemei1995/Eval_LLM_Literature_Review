{"grounding": "Faithful translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein is essential to maintain protein homeostasis in the cell. Spontaneous translation errors are very rare due to stringent selection of cognate aminoacyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the tight control of the mRNA reading frame by the ribosome. Recoding events, such as stop codon readthrough, frameshifting, and translational bypassing, reprogram the ribosome to make intentional mistakes and produce alternative proteins from the same mRNA. The hallmark of recoding is the change of ribosome dynamics. The signals for recoding are built into the mRNA, but their reading depends on the genetic makeup of the cell, resulting in cell-specific changes in expression programs. In this review, I discuss the mechanisms of canonical decoding and tRNA\u2013mRNA translocation; describe alternative pathways leading to recoding; and identify the links among mRNA signals, ribosome dynamics, and recoding.", "generated_text": "The ribosome, a complex molecular machine, plays a crucial role in decoding and recoding mRNA sequences during protein synthesis. This review explores the intricate mechanisms of translation, focusing on the interplay between tRNA, EF-Tu, and EF-G in maintaining reading frame fidelity. We examine the kinetics of codon recognition and tRNA selection, highlighting the factors that contribute to translational accuracy. Additionally, we discuss programmed frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, two recoding events that allow for the production of alternative protein products. Recent advances in structural biology and single-molecule techniques have provided unprecedented insights into these processes, revealing the dynamic nature of ribosome-mRNA interactions. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for comprehending the regulation of gene expression and the evolution of protein diversity, with implications for both basic research and therapeutic applications.", "label": 1}
