{"grounding": "The advent of biotechnology has enabled metabolic engineers to assemble heterologous pathways in cells to produce a variety of products of industrial relevance, often in a sustainable way. However, many pathways face challenges of low product yield. These pathways often suffer from issues that are difficult to optimize, such as low pathway flux and off-target pathway consumption of intermediates. These issues are exacerbated by the need to balance pathway flux with the health of the cell, particularly when a toxic intermediate builds up. Nature faces similar challenges and has evolved spatial organization strategies to increase metabolic pathway flux and efficiency. Inspired by these strategies, bioengineers have developed clever strategies to mimic spatial organization in nature. This review explores the use of spatial organization strategies, including protein scaffolding and protein encapsulation inside of proteinaceous shells, toward overcoming bottlenecks in metabolic engineering efforts.", "generated_text": "Multienzyme organization and encapsulation have emerged as powerful strategies in metabolic engineering to enhance pathway efficiency and product yield. This review explores the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these approaches, focusing on protein scaffolds and bacterial microcompartments. We discuss how spatial organization of enzymes can overcome diffusion limitations, reduce intermediate loss, and improve flux through metabolic pathways. The design principles and recent advances in synthetic protein scaffolds are examined, highlighting their potential to create artificial metabolons. Additionally, we analyze the structure, function, and engineering of bacterial microcompartments as natural protein-based organelles for enzyme encapsulation. The challenges and opportunities in applying these strategies to various biotechnological processes are addressed, providing insights into the future directions of multienzyme engineering for improved cellular factories and biocatalysts.", "label": 1}
