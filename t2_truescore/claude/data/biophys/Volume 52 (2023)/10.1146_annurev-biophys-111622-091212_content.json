{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy allows the investigation of cellular structures at nanoscale resolution using light. Current developments in super-resolution microscopy have focused on reliable quantification of the underlying biological data. In this review, we first describe the basic principles of super-resolution microscopy techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), and then give a broad overview of methodological developments to quantify super-resolution data, particularly those geared toward SMLM data. We cover commonly used techniques such as spatial point pattern analysis, colocalization, and protein copy number quantification but also describe more advanced techniques such as structural modeling, single-particle tracking, and biosensing. Finally, we provide an outlook on exciting new research directions to which quantitative super-resolution microscopy might be applied.", "generated_text": "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized our ability to visualize cellular structures at the nanoscale. However, extracting quantitative information from SMLM data remains challenging. This review explores recent advancements in quantitative SMLM, focusing on methods for accurate molecule counting, protein stoichiometry determination, and spatial distribution analysis. We discuss innovative approaches for overcoming technical limitations, such as fluorophore blinking and labeling efficiency variations. Additionally, we examine the integration of machine learning algorithms to enhance data interpretation and automate complex analyses. The combination of SMLM with complementary techniques, including correlative light and electron microscopy, is also addressed. By highlighting these developments, we emphasize the growing potential of SMLM as a powerful tool for quantitative cell biology research.", "label": 1}
