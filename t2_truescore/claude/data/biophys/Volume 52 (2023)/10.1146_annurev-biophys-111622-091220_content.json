{"grounding": "Diffusion is a pervasive process present in a broad spectrum of cellular reactions. Its mathematical description has existed for nearly two centuries and permits the construction of simple rules for evaluating the characteristic timescales of diffusive processes and some of their determinants. Although the term diffusion originally referred to random motions in three-dimensional (3D) media, several biological diffusion processes in lower dimensions have been reported. One-dimensional (1D) diffusions have been reported, for example, for translocations of various proteins along DNA or protein (e.g., microtubule) lattices and translation of helical peptides along the coiled-coil interface. Two-dimensional (2D) diffusion has been shown for dynamics of proteins along membranes. The microscopic mechanisms of these 1\u20133D diffusions may vary significantly depending on the nature of the diffusing molecules, the substrate, and the interactions between them. In this review, we highlight some key examples of 1\u20133D biomolecular diffusion processes and illustrate the roles that electrostatic interactions and intrinsic disorder may play in modulating these processes.", "generated_text": "Protein diffusion along biopolymer lattices plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription regulation, and microtubule dynamics. This study investigates the impact of electrostatics and disordered regions on protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and experimental techniques, we examine the diffusion coefficients of proteins with varying charge distributions and intrinsically disordered regions. Our results reveal that electrostatic interactions significantly influence the sliding behavior of proteins along DNA, with positively charged residues facilitating faster diffusion. Additionally, we demonstrate that disordered regions in proteins contribute to enhanced diffusion along microtubules by reducing friction and increasing conformational flexibility. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying protein search processes on biopolymer lattices and have implications for understanding cellular functions and developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting protein-lattice interactions.", "label": 0}
