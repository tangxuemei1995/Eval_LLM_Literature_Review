{"grounding": "Mitochondria are involved in multiple cellular tasks, such as ATP synthesis, metabolism, metabolite and ion transport, regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, signaling, and inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. The majority of the correct functioning of mitochondria is based on the large electrochemical proton gradient, whose component, the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, is strictly controlled by ion transport through mitochondrial membranes. Consequently, mitochondrial function is critically dependent on ion homeostasis, the disturbance of which leads to abnormal cell functions. Therefore, the discovery of mitochondrial ion channels influencing ion permeability through the membrane has defined a new dimension of the function of ion channels in different cell types, mainly linked to the important tasks that mitochondrial ion channels perform in cell life and death. This review summarizes studies on animal mitochondrial ion channels with special focus on their biophysical properties, molecular identity, and regulation. Additionally, the potential of mitochondrial ion channels as therapeutic targets for several diseases is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial ion channels play a crucial role in cellular energy production and homeostasis. This review explores the diverse array of ion channels present in mitochondrial membranes, focusing on calcium channels, the mitochondrial megachannel, potassium channels, chloride channels, and porin. These channels regulate ion fluxes across mitochondrial membranes, influencing various cellular processes such as ATP synthesis, apoptosis, and calcium signaling. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter and the permeability transition pore are highlighted for their significance in calcium homeostasis and cell death pathways. Potassium channels, including ATP-sensitive and calcium-activated variants, are discussed in relation to their impact on mitochondrial function and cytoprotection. The role of chloride channels in volume regulation and the multifaceted functions of porin in metabolite transport are also examined. Understanding these ion channels provides valuable insights into mitochondrial physiology and potential therapeutic targets for mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases.", "label": 1}
