{"grounding": "Large biomolecular systems are at the heart of many essential cellular processes. The dynamics and energetics of an increasing number of these systems are being studied by computer simulations. Pushing the limits of length- and timescales that can be accessed by current hard- and software has expanded the ability to describe biomolecules at different levels of detail. We focus in this review on the ribosome, which exemplifies the close interplay between experiment and various simulation approaches, as a particularly challenging and prototypic nanomachine that is pivotal to cellular biology due to its central role in translation. We sketch widely used simulation methods and demonstrate how the combination of simulations and experiments advances our understanding of the function of the translation apparatus based on fundamental physics.", "generated_text": "This study explores the challenges and advancements in simulating complex biomolecular systems, focusing on the ribosome as a prime example. We review recent progress in computer simulations and molecular dynamics techniques applied to ribosomal structures, highlighting their integration with high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. The research examines how these computational approaches have enhanced our understanding of ribosomal function during translation and antibiotic interactions. We discuss the limitations of current simulation methods and propose strategies to overcome them, including improved force fields and enhanced sampling techniques. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining computational simulations with experimental data to unravel the intricate mechanisms of large biomolecular complexes, paving the way for more accurate predictions of drug-target interactions and the development of novel antibiotics.", "label": 0}
