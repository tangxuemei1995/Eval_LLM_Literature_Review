{"grounding": "Cooperativity (homotropic allostery) is the primary mechanism by which evolution steepens the binding curves of biomolecular receptors to produce more responsive input\u2013output behavior in biomolecular systems. Motivated by the ubiquity with which nature employs this effect, over the past 15 years we, together with other groups, have engineered this mechanism into several otherwise noncooperative receptors. These efforts largely aimed to improve the utility of such receptors in artificial biotechnologies, such as synthetic biology and biosensors, but they have also provided the first quantitative, experimental tests of longstanding ideas about the mechanisms underlying cooperativity. In this article, we review the literature on the design of this effect, paying particular attention to the design strategies involved, the extent to which each can be rationally applied to (and optimized for) new receptors, and what each teaches us about the origins and optimization of this important phenomenon.", "generated_text": "Cooperative receptors play a crucial role in biological systems, enabling sensitive and specific responses to environmental stimuli. This review explores the rational design of cooperative receptors, focusing on the principles of allosterism, aptamer technology, and binding-induced folding. We discuss how these concepts can be harnessed in bioengineering and synthetic biology to create novel biosensors with enhanced performance. The population shift model is examined as a framework for understanding receptor behavior and guiding design strategies. We highlight recent advances in the field, including the development of aptamer-based cooperative receptors and their applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. By integrating insights from molecular biology, biophysics, and engineering, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and future directions in the rational design of cooperative receptors, with implications for advancing biosensor technology and synthetic biology applications.", "label": 1}
