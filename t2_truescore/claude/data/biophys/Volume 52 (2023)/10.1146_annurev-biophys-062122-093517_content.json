{"grounding": "My accidental encounter with protein hydrogen exchange (HX) at its very beginning and its continued development through my scientific career have led us to a series of advances in HX measurement, interpretation, and cutting edge biophysical applications. After some thoughts about how life brought me there, I take the opportunity to reflect on our early studies of allosteric structure and energy change in hemoglobin, the still-current protein folding problem, and our most recent forward-looking studies on protein machines.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical account explores the author's journey in protein science, focusing on hydrogen exchange (HX) studies. The narrative covers groundbreaking research on hemoglobin allostery, protein folding mechanisms, and the function of AAA+ protein machines. The author reflects on how HX techniques have revolutionized our understanding of protein structure and dynamics, providing insights into complex biological processes. The paper highlights the importance of innovative methodologies in advancing protein science and offers a personal perspective on key discoveries in the field.", "label": 1}
