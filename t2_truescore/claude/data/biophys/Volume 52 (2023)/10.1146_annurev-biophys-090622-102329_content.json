{"grounding": "The mechanism and the evolution of DNA replication and transcription, the key elements of the central dogma of biology, are fundamentally well explained by the physicochemical complementarity between strands of nucleic acids. However, the determinants that have shaped the third part of the dogma\u2014the process of biological translation and the universal genetic code\u2014remain unclear. We review and seek parallels between different proposals that view the evolution of translation through the prism of weak, noncovalent interactions between biological macromolecules. In particular, we focus on a recent proposal that there exists a hitherto unrecognized complementarity at the heart of biology, that between messenger RNA coding regions and the proteins that they encode, especially if the two are unstructured. Reflecting the idea that the genetic code evolved from intrinsic binding propensities between nucleotides and amino acids, this proposal promises to forge a link between the distant past and the present of biological systems.", "generated_text": "The origin of the universal genetic code remains a fundamental question in molecular biology. This review explores the stereochemical hypothesis, which proposes that the code emerged from direct physicochemical interactions between amino acids and their cognate codons or anticodons. We examine recent experimental and computational evidence supporting this theory, focusing on noncovalent interactions between amino acids, tRNAs, and aminoacyl tRNA-synthetases. Additionally, we discuss the mRNA\u2013protein complementarity hypothesis, which suggests that coding sequences may have evolved to optimize interactions with their encoded proteins. By synthesizing findings from structural biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics, we evaluate the extent to which molecular recognition events in modern translation systems may reflect primordial coding mechanisms. This integrative approach provides new insights into the chemical logic underlying the genetic code and its potential evolutionary origins.", "label": 1}
