{"grounding": "Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have marked only the beginning of the potential of this technique. To bring structure into cell biology, the modality of cryo-electron tomography has fast developed into a bona fide in situ structural biology technique where structures are determined in their native environment, the cell. Nearly every step of the cryo-focused ion beam-assisted electron tomography (cryo-FIB-ET) workflow has been improved upon in the past decade, since the first windows were carved into cells, unveiling macromolecular networks in near-native conditions. By bridging structural and cell biology, cryo-FIB-ET is advancing our understanding of structure\u2013function relationships in their native environment and becoming a tool for discovering new biology.", "generated_text": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful tool for in situ structural biology, revolutionizing our understanding of cellular architecture at the molecular level. This review explores the recent advancements in cryo-ET techniques and their applications in quantitative cell biology. We discuss how cryo-ET enables the visualization of macromolecular complexes within their native cellular environment, providing unprecedented insights into cellular organization and function. The integration of cryo-ET data with biophysical modeling approaches is highlighted, showcasing its potential for elucidating dynamic cellular processes. Furthermore, we examine the challenges and future directions of cryo-ET in unraveling the intricate molecular landscapes of cells, paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of cellular biology.", "label": 1}
