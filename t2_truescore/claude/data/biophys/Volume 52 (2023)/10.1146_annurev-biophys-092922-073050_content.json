{"grounding": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are critical intracellular immune receptors in both animals and plants. Perception of pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals induces NLR oligomerization to form multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes in animals or resistosomes in plants to mediate host immune response. Significant progress has been made during the past few years in our understanding of NLR biology, particularly the structural perspective of these two types of NLR-containing complexes. In this article, we review the latest advances in our structural knowledge of how NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are activated and assembled and how the structural information provides insight into their distinct mechanisms of action. Commonalities and differences between NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are also discussed.", "generated_text": "Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins play crucial roles in innate immunity across various organisms. This review explores the assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes, focusing on their structural and functional aspects. We discuss the mechanisms of NLR autoinhibition, ligand recognition, and activation, highlighting the similarities and differences between plant resistosomes and animal inflammasomes. The formation of higher-order complexes, including the NADase holoenzyme and resistosome channel, is examined in detail. Recent structural studies have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular basis of NLR-mediated immune responses, revealing intricate conformational changes and oligomerization processes. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting NLR-related diseases and enhancing plant immunity against pathogens.", "label": 1}
