{"grounding": "Hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods have become indispensable tools for the study of biomolecules. In this article, we briefly review the basic methodological details of QM/MM approaches and discuss their applications to various energy transduction problems in biomolecular machines, such as long-range proton transports, fast electron transfers, and mechanochemical coupling. We highlight the particular importance for these applications of balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Using several recent examples, we illustrate the value and limitations of QM/MM methodologies for both ground and excited states, as well as strategies for calibrating them in specific applications. We conclude with brief comments on several areas that can benefit from further efforts to make QM/MM analyses more quantitative and applicable to increasingly complex biological problems.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods to investigate energy transduction mechanisms in biomolecular machines. We focus on key processes such as proton transfers, electron transfers, and nucleotide hydrolysis, which are fundamental to the function of these molecular systems. By combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical calculations for critical regions with the computational efficiency of molecular mechanics for the surrounding environment, our approach provides detailed insights into the complex interplay between electronic structure and conformational dynamics. Our results demonstrate the power of QM/MM techniques in elucidating the atomic-level mechanisms of energy conversion in various biomolecular machines, offering new perspectives on their function and potential applications in biotechnology and medicine.", "label": 1}
