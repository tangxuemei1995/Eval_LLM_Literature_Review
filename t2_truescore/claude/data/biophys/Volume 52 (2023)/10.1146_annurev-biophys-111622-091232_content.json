{"grounding": "ABC transporters are essential for cellular physiology. Humans have 48 ABC genes organized into seven distinct families. Of these genes, 44 (in five distinct families) encode for membrane transporters, of which several are involved in drug resistance and disease pathways resulting from transporter dysfunction. Over the last decade, advances in structural biology have vastly expanded our mechanistic understanding of human ABC transporter function, revealing details of their molecular arrangement, regulation, and interactions, facilitated in large part by advances in cryo-EM that have rendered hitherto inaccessible targets amenable to high-resolution structural analysis. As a result, experimentally determined structures of multiple members of each of the five families of ABC transporters in humans are now available. Here we review this recent progress, highlighting the physiological relevance of human ABC transporters and mechanistic insights gleaned from their direct structure determination. We also discuss the impact and limitations of model systems and structure prediction methods in understanding human ABC transporters and discuss current challenges and future research directions.", "generated_text": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are essential membrane proteins that play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including drug extrusion and lipid homeostasis. Dysfunction of these transporters is implicated in numerous human diseases, making them important targets for therapeutic interventions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure and mechanism of human ABC transporters, focusing on recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques. We discuss the conserved structural features of ABC transporters, including the transmembrane domains and nucleotide-binding domains, and their role in substrate translocation. The review also examines the conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis, which drive the transport cycle. Furthermore, we explore the substrate specificity and regulatory mechanisms of different ABC transporter subfamilies, highlighting their relevance in drug resistance and lipid trafficking. Understanding the structure-function relationships of human ABC transporters is crucial for developing targeted therapies and overcoming multidrug resistance in various diseases.", "label": 1}
