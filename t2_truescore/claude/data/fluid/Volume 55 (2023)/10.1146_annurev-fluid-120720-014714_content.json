{"grounding": "A common feature of many free surface flows\u2014drop/bubble breakup or coalescence and film/sheet rupture\u2014is the occurrence of hydrodynamic singularities. Accurately computing such flows with continuum mechanical, multidimensional free surface flow algorithms is a challenging task given these problems\u2019 multiscale nature, which necessitates capturing dynamics occurring over disparate length scales across 5\u20136 orders of magnitude. In drop breakup, the thinning of fluid threads that form and eventually pinch-off must be simulated until the thread's radius is about 10 nm. When two drops approach one another, the thickness of the fluid film separating them must fall below 10 nm before coalescence is said to have occurred. If the initial drop radii are 1 mm, simulations must remain faithful to the physics as thread radius or film thickness falls from 10\u22123 m to below 10\u22128 m. Here we review significant findings in interfacial flows with hydrodynamic singularities spearheaded by sharp interface algorithms. These multidimensional algorithms can achieve resolution that to date has only been possible with the use of simple 1D evolution equations.", "generated_text": "This study presents advanced sharp interface methods for simulating and analyzing free surface flows with singularities, focusing on breakup and coalescence phenomena. The research addresses critical challenges in modeling complex fluid dynamics encountered in applications such as ink jet printing, microfluidics, and spray systems. By employing finite element techniques, we develop a robust framework capable of accurately capturing the evolution of drops, jets, and filaments during pinch-off and merger events. The proposed methodology effectively handles topological changes and resolves the multi-scale nature of these processes, particularly near singularities. We demonstrate the method's efficacy through a series of numerical experiments, validating results against experimental data and theoretical predictions. Our approach provides new insights into the physics of free surface flows, enabling improved predictions of droplet formation, breakup dynamics, and coalescence behavior. The findings have significant implications for optimizing industrial processes and advancing fundamental understanding in fluid mechanics, particularly in the realm of interfacial phenomena and singularity-driven flows.", "label": 1}
