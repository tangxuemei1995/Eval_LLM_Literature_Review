{"grounding": "Gas-liquid foams are important in applications ranging from oil recovery and mineral flotation to food science and microfluidics. Beyond their practical use, they represent an intriguing prototype of a soft material with a complex, viscoelastic rheological response. Crucially, foams allow detailed access to fluid-dynamical processes on the mesoscale of bubbles underlying the large-scale material behavior. This review emphasizes the importance of the geometry and interaction of mesoscale structural elements for the description of the dynamics of entire foams. Using examples including bulk flow of foam under steady shear, interfacial instabilities, and foam fracture through bubble rupture, this article highlights the wide variety of available theoretical descriptions, ranging from network modeling approaches coupling structural element equations of motion to full continuum models with elastoviscoplastic constitutive relations. Foams offer the opportunity to develop rigorous links between such disparate descriptions, providing a blueprint for physical modeling of dynamical multiscale systems with complex structure.", "generated_text": "This review explores the multiscale nature of gas-liquid foam dynamics, bridging the gap between microscopic structural elements and macroscopic continuum descriptions. We examine the fundamental physics of foam interfaces, including surface tension, elasticity, and thin film stability. The rheological properties of foams are discussed, emphasizing their complex viscoelastic behavior and yield stress characteristics. We analyze the fluid mechanics of foam flow, considering both bulk and confined geometries. The interplay between foam structure and dynamics is investigated, highlighting the role of bubble size distribution, liquid fraction, and topological rearrangements. Recent advances in experimental techniques and theoretical models are presented, providing insights into foam behavior across different length and time scales. This comprehensive review aims to synthesize current understanding and identify future research directions in the field of gas-liquid foam dynamics, with implications for various industrial and technological applications.", "label": 1}
