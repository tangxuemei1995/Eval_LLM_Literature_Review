{"grounding": "Since the seminal studies by Osborne Reynolds in the nineteenth century, pipe flow has served as a primary prototype for investigating the transition to turbulence in wall-bounded flows. Despite the apparent simplicity of this flow, various facets of this problem have occupied researchers for more than a century. Here we review insights from three distinct perspectives: (a) stability and susceptibility of laminar flow, (b) phase transition and spatiotemporal dynamics, and (c) dynamical systems analysis of the Navier\u2014Stokes equations. We show how these perspectives have led to a profound understanding of the onset of turbulence in pipe flow. Outstanding open points, applications to flows of complex fluids, and similarities with other wall-bounded flows are discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the transition to turbulence in pipe flow, a classic problem in fluid dynamics. We examine the complex interplay between shear flow, transient growth, and the emergence of turbulent structures. Our research focuses on the formation and evolution of turbulent puffs and slugs, which are characteristic features of transitional pipe flow. We explore the role of intermittency and transient chaos in the transition process, revealing the underlying mechanisms that drive the flow from laminar to turbulent states. Using advanced numerical simulations and experimental techniques, we demonstrate that the transition exhibits properties consistent with directed percolation, a universality class in non-equilibrium statistical physics. These findings provide new insights into the nature of turbulence onset in shear flows and contribute to our understanding of fluid behavior in pipe systems.", "label": 0}
