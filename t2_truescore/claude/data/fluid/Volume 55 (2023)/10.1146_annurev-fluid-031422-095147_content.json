{"grounding": "Oceanic motions with spatial scales of 200 m\u201320 km, called submesoscales, are ubiquitous in the upper ocean and serve as a key intermediary between larger-scale balanced dynamics and unbalanced turbulence. Here, we introduce the fluid dynamics of submesoscales and contrast them with motions at larger and smaller scales. We summarize the various ways in which submesoscales develop due to instabilities that extract potential or kinetic energy from larger-scale balanced currents; some instabilities have counterparts at larger scales, while others are distinct to the submesoscale regime. Submesoscales modify the density stratification in the upper ocean and redistribute energy between scales. These energy transfers are complex, having both up-scale and down-scale components. Submesoscale eddies and fronts also contribute to a spatially heterogeneous distribution of shear and restratification that leave an imprint on upper ocean turbulence. The impact of submesoscales on the Earth's climate remains an exciting research frontier.", "generated_text": "Submesoscale dynamics play a crucial role in the upper ocean, influencing energy transfer, nutrient distribution, and climate processes. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding submesoscale phenomena, focusing on turbulence, eddies, and fronts. High-resolution observations and numerical simulations reveal the complex interactions between submesoscale features and larger-scale ocean circulation. We examine the mechanisms driving submesoscale instabilities, their impact on vertical mixing, and their contribution to restratification processes. The paper highlights the significance of submesoscale dynamics in modulating air-sea interactions, biogeochemical cycling, and heat transport. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges in parameterizing submesoscale processes in climate models and their potential implications for improving climate predictions. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of submesoscale dynamics in shaping the upper ocean's physical and biogeochemical properties, emphasizing the need for continued research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
