{"grounding": "The dissolution of minute concentration of polymers in wall-bounded flows is well-known for its unparalleled ability to reduce turbulent friction drag. Another phenomenon, elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT), has been far less studied even though elastic instabilities have already been observed in dilute polymer solutions before the discovery of polymer drag reduction. EIT is a chaotic state driven by polymer dynamics that is observed across many orders of magnitude in Reynolds number. It involves energy transfer from small elastic scales to large flow scales. The investigation of the mechanisms of EIT offers the possibility to better understand other complex phenomena such as elastic turbulence and maximum drag reduction. In this review, we survey recent research efforts that are advancing the understanding of the dynamics of EIT. We highlight the fundamental differences between EIT and Newtonian/inertial turbulence from the perspective of experiments, numerical simulations, instabilities, and coherent structures. Finally, we discuss the possible links between EIT and elastic turbulence and polymer drag reduction, as well as the remaining challenges in unraveling the self-sustaining mechanism of EIT.", "generated_text": "Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) is a unique flow regime observed in viscoelastic fluids, characterized by the complex interplay between elastic and inertial forces. This study investigates the fundamental mechanisms underlying EIT, focusing on its role in polymer drag reduction and the formation of coherent structures in transitional flows. Through advanced numerical simulations employing viscoelastic models, we explore the emergence of elastic instabilities and their contribution to the onset of turbulence. Our findings reveal that EIT exhibits distinct features from both Newtonian turbulence and purely elastic turbulence, with significant implications for flow control and energy efficiency in various industrial applications. We demonstrate that the interaction between polymer dynamics and flow structures leads to the formation of unique coherent patterns, which play a crucial role in the drag reduction phenomenon. This research provides new insights into the nature of EIT and its potential for optimizing fluid transport processes in diverse fields, from microfluidics to large-scale engineering systems.", "label": 1}
