{"grounding": "Advances in measuring and understanding separated, nominally two-dimensional (2D) shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions (STBLI) have triggered recent campaigns focused on three-dimensional (3D) STBLI, which display far greater configuration diversity. Nonetheless, unifying properties emerge for semi-infinite interactions, taking the form of conical asymptotic behavior where shock-generator specifics become insignificant. The contrast between 2D and 3D separation is substantial; the skewed vortical structure of 3D STBLI reflects the essentially 2D influence of the boundary layer on the 3D character of the swept shock. As with 2D STBLI, conical interactions engender prominent spectral content below that of the turbulent boundary layer. However, the uniform separation length scale, which is crucial to normalizing the lowest-frequency dynamics in 2D STBLI, is absent. Comparatively, the spectra of 3D STBLI are more representative of the mid-frequency, convective, shear-layer dynamics in 2D, while phenomena associated with 2D separation-shock breathing are muted. Asymptotic behavior breaks down in many regions important to 3D-STBLI dynamics, occurring in a configuration-dependent manner. Aspects of inceptive regions near shock generators and symmetry planes are reviewed. Focused efforts toward 3D modal and nonmodalanalyses, moving-shock/boundary-layer interactions, fluid/structure interactions, and flow control are suggested as directions for future work.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (SWBLI) in compressible flows. Using advanced numerical simulations and experimental techniques, we explore the intricate interplay between shock waves, turbulent boundary layers, and flow separation in three-dimensional configurations. The research focuses on characterizing the unsteady nature of these interactions, including the formation and evolution of shear layers, flow instabilities, and large-scale coherent structures. We examine the impact of various geometric and flow parameters on the SWBLI behavior, such as incoming boundary layer properties, shock strength, and surface curvature. Additionally, we analyze the fluid-structure interaction effects and evaluate potential flow control strategies to mitigate adverse consequences of SWBLI, such as increased drag and heat transfer. Our findings provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing three-dimensional SWBLI, contributing to improved predictive capabilities for high-speed vehicle design and performance optimization in aerospace applications.", "label": 1}
