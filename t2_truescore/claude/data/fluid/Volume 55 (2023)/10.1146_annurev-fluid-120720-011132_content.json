{"grounding": "Density stratification due to temperature or salinity variations greatly influences the flow around and the sedimentation of objects such as particles, drops, bubbles, and small organisms in the atmosphere, oceans, and lakes. Density stratification hampers the vertical flow and substantially affects the sedimentation of an isolated object, the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of objects, and the collective behavior of suspensions in various ways, depending on the relative magnitude of stratification, inertia (advection), and viscous (diffusion) effects. This review discusses these effects and their hydrodynamic mechanisms in some commonly observed fluid\u2013particle transport phenomena in oceans and the atmosphere. Physical understanding of these mechanisms can help us better model these phenomena and, hence, predict their geophysical, engineering, ecological, and environmental implications.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the dynamics of motion in stratified fluids, focusing on the behavior of particles, drops, bubbles, and microorganisms. We examine the complex interactions between these entities and the surrounding fluid layers, particularly in the presence of a pycnocline. Our research combines theoretical modeling, numerical simulations, and experimental observations to elucidate the mechanisms governing particle-laden flows in stratified environments. We analyze the effects of density gradients on the settling velocities, trajectories, and clustering patterns of various particles and organisms. The findings reveal significant differences in behavior compared to homogeneous fluids, with implications for sediment transport, marine ecology, and industrial applications. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of stratified flows and their impact on particulate matter distribution in natural and engineered systems.", "label": 1}
