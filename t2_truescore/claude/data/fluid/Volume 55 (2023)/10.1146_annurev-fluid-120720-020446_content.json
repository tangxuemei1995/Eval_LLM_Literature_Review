{"grounding": "Rotation with thermally induced buoyancy governs many astrophysical and geophysical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, sun, and Earth's liquid-metal outer core. Rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection (RRBC) is an experimental system that has features of rotation and buoyancy, where a container of height H and temperature difference \u0394 between its bottom and top is rotated about its vertical axis with angular velocity \u03a9. The strength of buoyancy is reflected in the Rayleigh number (\u223cH\n3\u0394) and that of the Coriolis force in the Ekman and Rossby numbers (\u223c\u03a9\u22121). Rotation suppresses the convective onset, introduces instabilities, changes the velocity boundary layers, modifies the shape of thermal structures from plumes to vortical columns, affects the large-scale circulation, and can decrease or enhance global heat transport depending on buoyant and Coriolis forcing. RRBC is an extremely rich system, with features directly comparable to geophysical and astrophysical phenomena. Here we review RRBC studies, suggest a unifying heat transport scaling approach for the transition between rotation-dominated and buoyancy-dominated regimes in RRBC, and discuss non-Oberbeck\u2013Boussinesq and centrifugal effects.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of turbulent rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection, a fundamental problem in fluid dynamics with significant implications for geophysical and astrophysical flows. We present a comprehensive analysis combining theoretical modeling, experimental measurements, and direct numerical simulations to elucidate the interplay between turbulence, buoyancy, and rotation in this canonical system. Our results reveal distinct regimes of heat transport and flow structures as a function of Rayleigh number, rotation rate, and Prandtl number. We observe a transition from rotation-dominated to buoyancy-dominated convection, characterized by changes in heat transfer efficiency and the formation of coherent structures such as thermal plumes and columnar vortices. The study provides new insights into the scaling laws governing heat transport and the mechanisms of angular momentum transfer in rotating convective systems. These findings contribute to our understanding of turbulent convection in rotating environments and have potential applications in climate modeling, oceanography, and planetary science.", "label": 0}
