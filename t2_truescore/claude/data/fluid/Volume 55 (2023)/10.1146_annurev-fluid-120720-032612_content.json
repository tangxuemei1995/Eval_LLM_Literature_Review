{"grounding": "A rotating detonation engine (RDE) is a realization of pressure-gain combustion, wherein a traveling detonation wave confined in a chamber provides shock-based compression along with chemical heat release. Due to the high wave speeds, such devices can process high mass flow rates in small volumes, leading to compact and unconventional designs. RDEs involve unsteady and multiscale physics, and their operational characteristics are determined by an equilibrium between large- and small-scale processes. While RDEs can provide a significant theoretical gain in efficiency, achieving this improvement requires an understanding of the multiscale coupling. Specifically, unavoidable nonidealities, such as unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and multiple competing waves associated with practical designs, need to be understood and managed. The secondary combustion processes arise from fuel/air injection and unsteady and incomplete mixing, and can create spurious losses. In addition, a combination of multiple detonation and secondary waves compete and define the dynamical behavior of mixing, heat release distribution, and the overall mode of operation of the device. This review discusses the current understanding of such nonidealities and describes the tools and techniques used to gain insight into the extreme unsteady environment in such combustors.", "generated_text": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) have garnered significant attention as a promising technology for pressure gain combustion. However, the practical implementation of RDEs faces numerous challenges due to nonidealities that deviate from theoretical models. This study investigates the key nonideal phenomena in RDEs, including unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, deflagration losses, and the presence of multiple competing waves. Through a combination of experimental observations and numerical simulations, we analyze the impact of these nonidealities on engine performance and stability. Results indicate that unsteady mixing significantly affects detonation wave propagation, while secondary combustion and deflagration losses contribute to reduced pressure gain. The occurrence of multiple competing waves and secondary waves further complicates the combustion dynamics, leading to potential instabilities and reduced efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing these nonidealities in RDE design and optimization, paving the way for more robust and efficient pressure gain combustion systems in future propulsion and power generation applications.", "label": 1}
