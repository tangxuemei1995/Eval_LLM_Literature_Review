{"grounding": "Particles floating at interfaces are commonly observed in nature, as well as in industrial processes. When the particles are non-Brownian particles, large deformations of the interface are created that induce long-ranged capillary interactions and lead to the formation of particle rafts with unique characteristics. In this review we discuss recent efforts in investigating particle raft formation and the role of the rafts\u2019 own weight during dynamic clustering. Under specific conditions, these rafts can ultimately collapse and sink. When subjected to external or internal forces, the raft undergoes large deformations that test the mechanical characteristics of this interfacial composite material. It can behave as a continuous elastic sheet under compression, although its discrete nature can also trigger its fragmentation via interparticle interactions. Finally, armored droplets, drops covered by a protective shell of particles, can lose their integrity when submitted to dynamic deformations, resulting in the ejection of particles or the fracturing of the armor. Open questions to understand the properties of this material are highlighted and future research to understand the fundamental physics of particle rafts, the customization of the cluster formation, or the disassembly of this collective material is suggested.", "generated_text": "This review explores the fascinating world of particle rafts and armored droplets, focusing on the self-assembly and unique properties of particle-laden interfaces. We examine the intricate interplay between buoyancy, capillarity, and interfacial rheology that governs the behavior of these systems. The study delves into the mechanisms driving particle self-assembly at fluid-fluid interfaces, highlighting the role of surface tension and particle interactions. We discuss the mechanical properties of particle rafts, including their elasticity and resistance to deformation, and how these characteristics can be tuned through particle size, shape, and surface chemistry. The review also covers the formation and stability of armored droplets, emphasizing their potential applications in diverse fields such as materials science, drug delivery, and oil recovery. Furthermore, we analyze recent advances in experimental techniques and theoretical models that have enhanced our understanding of these complex systems. This comprehensive overview provides valuable insights into the fundamental physics and practical applications of particle rafts and armored droplets, paving the way for future innovations in interfacial science and engineering.", "label": 1}
