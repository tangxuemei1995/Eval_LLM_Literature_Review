{"grounding": "Transitional\u2013turbulent spots bridge the deterministic laminar state with the stochastic turbulent state and affect the transition zone length in engineering flows. Turbulent spot research over the past four decades has expanded from incompressible flat-plate boundary layer and pipe flow to hypersonic boundary layer flow, turbomachinery flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, and a range of more complex flows. Progress has been made on the origination, composition, demarcation, growth, mutual interaction, reproduction, sustainability, and self-organization of turbulent spots. The hypothesis that transitional\u2013turbulent spots are a basic module of the fully turbulent boundary layer has been proven through the discovery of locally generated turbulent\u2013turbulent spots dominating the wall layer. Splitting of transitional\u2013turbulent spots in pipe flow has been linked to a life cycle localized in the spot frontal section. This review discusses these advances and outlines future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study presents novel findings on turbulent spots, localized regions of turbulence within transitional flows. We investigate their formation, growth, and interaction in various flow configurations, including boundary layers, pipe flows, channel flows, plane Couette flows, turbomachinery flows, and hypersonic flows. Advanced experimental techniques and high-fidelity numerical simulations are employed to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of turbulent spots. Our results reveal previously unknown mechanisms governing spot propagation and coalescence, shedding light on the complex dynamics of transition to turbulence. We identify key parameters influencing spot behavior across different flow regimes and propose a unified framework for predicting spot development. These insights enhance our understanding of transitional flows and have significant implications for flow control strategies in engineering applications, particularly in turbomachinery and hypersonic vehicle design.", "label": 1}
