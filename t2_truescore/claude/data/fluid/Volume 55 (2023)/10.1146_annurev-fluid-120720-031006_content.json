{"grounding": "Understanding inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid flows requires mathematical and computational tools that are tailored to such flows and distinct from methods used to understand the canonical problem of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. We review some recent developments in the theory of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, placing special emphasis on several kinds of quasi-linear approximations and their corresponding statistical formulations. Aspects of quasi-linear theory that have received insufficient attention in the literature are discussed, and open questions are framed.", "generated_text": "This review examines recent advancements in theories of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence. We discuss novel quasi-linear approaches and statistical methods that have improved our understanding of complex turbulent flows. The paper highlights key findings in modeling spatial variations and directional dependencies in turbulent systems, emphasizing their implications for practical applications. We also explore emerging computational techniques and experimental validations that have contributed to refining these theories, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field.", "label": 0}
