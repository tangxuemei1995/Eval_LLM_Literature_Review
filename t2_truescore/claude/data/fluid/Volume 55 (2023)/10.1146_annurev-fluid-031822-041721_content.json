{"grounding": "In the past few decades various particle image\u2013based volumetric flow measurement techniques have been developed that have demonstrated their potential in accessing unsteady flow properties quantitatively in various experimental applications in fluid mechanics. In this review, we focus on physical properties and circumstances of 3D particle\u2013based measurements and what knowledge can be used for advancing reconstruction accuracy and spatial and temporal resolution, as well as completeness. The natural candidate for our focus is 3D Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT), which allows for position, velocity, and acceleration to be determined alongside a large number of individual particle tracks in the investigated volume. The advent of the dense 3D LPT technique Shake-The-Box in the past decade has opened further possibilities for characterizing unsteady flows by delivering input data for powerful data assimilation techniques that use Navier\u2013Stokes constraints. As a result, high-resolution Lagrangian and Eulerian data can be obtained, including long particle trajectories embedded in time-resolved 3D velocity and pressure fields.", "generated_text": "This study presents advancements in 3D Lagrangian particle tracking techniques for fluid mechanics applications. We focus on the development and implementation of iterative particle reconstruction methods, with particular emphasis on the Shake-The-Box algorithm. The research explores the extraction of one- and multipoint statistics from particle trajectories, enabling the calculation of velocity gradient tensors and 3D pressure fields. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in capturing complex flow structures and turbulence characteristics. Additionally, we investigate the integration of particle tracking data with data assimilation methods to enhance the accuracy and resolution of flow field measurements. The proposed approach shows significant improvements in spatial and temporal resolution compared to traditional particle image velocimetry techniques. Our findings contribute to the understanding of fluid dynamics in various applications, including turbulence research, aerodynamics, and environmental flows, paving the way for more accurate and comprehensive flow field analysis.", "label": 1}
