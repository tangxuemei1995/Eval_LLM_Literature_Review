{"grounding": "Although face masks have been used for over a century to provide protection against airborne pathogens and pollutants, close scrutiny of their effectiveness has peaked in the past two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The simplicity of face masks belies the complexity of the physical phenomena that determine their effectiveness as a defense against airborne infections. This complexity is rooted in the fact that the effectiveness of face masks depends on the combined effects of respiratory aerodynamics, filtration flow physics, droplet dynamics and their interactions with porous materials, structural dynamics, physiology, and even human behavior. At its core, however, the face mask is a flow-handling device, and in the current review, we take a flow physics\u2013centric view of face masks and the key phenomena that underlie their function. We summarize the state of the art in experimental measurements, as well as the growing body of computational studies that have contributed to our understanding of the factors that determine the effectiveness of face masks. The review also lays out some of the important open questions and technical challenges associated with the effectiveness of face masks.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented attention to the use of face masks as a critical tool in preventing respiratory infections. This study examines the flow physics of face masks to better understand their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne pathogens. Using advanced computational fluid dynamics simulations and experimental techniques, we investigate the complex interactions between exhaled respiratory droplets, mask materials, and ambient air currents. Our findings reveal that mask efficacy is highly dependent on factors such as material porosity, fit, and wear time. We demonstrate that properly fitted masks can significantly reduce the dispersion of potentially infectious aerosols, thereby decreasing the risk of airborne transmission. Additionally, we explore the impact of various environmental conditions on mask performance, including humidity, temperature, and air flow patterns. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms by which face masks impede viral spread and offers evidence-based recommendations for optimizing mask design and usage in the context of respiratory infection control.", "label": 1}
