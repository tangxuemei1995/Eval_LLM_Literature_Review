{"grounding": "Lipids are essential cellular components forming membranes, serving as energy reserves, and acting as chemical messengers. Dysfunction in lipid metabolism and signaling is associated with a wide range of diseases including cancer and autoimmunity. Heterogeneity in cell behavior including lipid signaling is increasingly recognized as a driver of disease and drug resistance. This diversity in cellular responses as well as the roles of lipids in health and disease drive the need to quantify lipids within single cells. Single-cell lipid assays are challenging due to the small size of cells (\u223c1 pL) and the large numbers of lipid species present at concentrations spanning orders of magnitude. A growing number of methodologies enable assay of large numbers of lipid analytes, perform high-resolution spatial measurements, or permit highly sensitive lipid assays in single cells. Covered in this review are mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, and fluorescence-based assays including microscopy and microseparations.", "generated_text": "Single-cell biochemical assays of lipids have emerged as powerful tools for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. This review explores recent advancements in analytical techniques for lipid analysis at the single-cell level. We discuss the application of mass spectrometry, which offers high sensitivity and molecular specificity, enabling comprehensive lipid profiling. Raman imaging is highlighted for its ability to provide spatial information on lipid distribution within individual cells. The review also covers developments in capillary electrophoresis, which allows for rapid and efficient separation of lipid species. Additionally, we examine the use of thin-layer chromatography for its simplicity and versatility in lipid analysis. These techniques collectively contribute to our understanding of lipid metabolism, signaling, and cellular processes at unprecedented resolution, paving the way for new insights into cell biology and potential biomedical applications.", "label": 1}
