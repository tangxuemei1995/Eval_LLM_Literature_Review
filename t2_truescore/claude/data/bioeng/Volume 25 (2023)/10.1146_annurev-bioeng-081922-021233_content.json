{"grounding": "The central dogma of gene expression involves DNA transcription to RNA and RNA translation into protein. As key intermediaries and modifiers, RNAs undergo various forms of modifications such as methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation. These modifications, termed epitranscriptional regulations, lead to functional changes in RNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated crucial roles for RNA modifications in gene translation, DNA damage response, and cell fate regulation. Epitranscriptional modifications play an essential role in development, mechanosensing, atherogenesis, and regeneration in the cardiovascular (CV) system, and their elucidation is critically important to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CV physiology and pathophysiology. This review aims at providing biomedical engineers with an overview of the epitranscriptome landscape, related key concepts, recent findings in epitranscriptional regulations, and tools for epitranscriptome analysis. The potential applications of this important field in biomedical engineering research are discussed.", "generated_text": "Epitranscriptional regulation, encompassing RNA modifications and their impact on gene expression, has emerged as a crucial field in cardiovascular bioengineering. This review explores the intricate interplay between the epitranscriptome and cardiovascular function, highlighting the role of RNA modifications in heart development, disease progression, and potential therapeutic interventions. We discuss key epitranscriptomic marks, such as m6A, m5C, and pseudouridine, and their regulatory enzymes in the context of cardiac physiology. Furthermore, we examine how dysregulation of these modifications contributes to various cardiovascular disorders, including hypertrophy, fibrosis, and arrhythmias. The potential of targeting epitranscriptomic mechanisms for developing novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular medicine is also addressed, emphasizing the importance of this rapidly evolving field in advancing our understanding of heart health and disease.", "label": 1}
