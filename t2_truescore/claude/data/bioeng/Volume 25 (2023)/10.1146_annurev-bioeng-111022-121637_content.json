{"grounding": "Neurotechnologies for treating pain rely on electrical stimulation of the central or peripheral nervous system to disrupt or block pain signaling and have been commercialized to treat a variety of pain conditions. While their adoption is accelerating, neurotechnologies are still frequently viewed as a last resort, after many other treatment options have been explored. We review the pain conditions commonly treated with electrical stimulation, as well as the specific neurotechnologies used for treating those conditions. We identify barriers to adoption, including a limited understanding of mechanisms of action, inconsistent efficacy across patients, and challenges related to selectivity of stimulation and off-target side effects. We describe design improvements that have recently been implemented, as well as some cutting-edge technologies that may address the limitations of existing neurotechnologies. Addressing these challenges will accelerate adoption and change neurotechnologies from last-line to first-line treatments for people living with chronic pain.", "generated_text": "Chronic pain affects millions worldwide, prompting the development of innovative neurotechnological approaches for pain management. This review explores cutting-edge interventions targeting the peripheral and central nervous systems to alleviate persistent pain. We examine the efficacy of deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in modulating pain pathways. Recent advancements in these technologies have shown promising results in reducing pain intensity and improving quality of life for patients with various chronic pain conditions. The review also discusses the mechanisms of action, potential side effects, and future directions for research in neurotechnology-based pain management. As our understanding of pain neurobiology evolves, these interventions offer hope for more effective, personalized treatments that could revolutionize chronic pain management and reduce reliance on pharmacological approaches.", "label": 1}
