{"grounding": "Penetrating neural electrodes provide a powerful approach to decipher brain circuitry by allowing for time-resolved electrical detections of individual action potentials. This unique capability has contributed tremendously to basic and translational neuroscience, enabling both fundamental understandings of brain functions and applications of human prosthetic devices that restore crucial sensations and movements. However, conventional approaches are limited by the scarce number of available sensing channels and compromised efficacy over long-term implantations. Recording longevity and scalability have become the most sought-after improvements in emerging technologies. In this review, we discuss the technological advances in the past 5\u201310 years that have enabled larger-scale, more detailed, and longer-lasting recordings of neural circuits at work than ever before. We present snapshots of the latest advances in penetration electrode technology, showcase their applications in animal models and humans, and outline the underlying design principles and considerations to fuel future technological development.", "generated_text": "Penetrating neural electrodes have revolutionized our understanding of brain function and hold promise for advanced neuroprosthetics. However, current technologies face limitations in scale and long-term stability. This review examines emerging penetrating electrode designs that aim to overcome these challenges. We discuss novel materials and fabrication techniques that enable higher-density arrays and improved biocompatibility. Particular attention is given to flexible polymer-based electrodes and ultrasmall carbon fiber electrodes, which show potential for reduced tissue damage and enhanced longevity. Additionally, we explore innovative strategies for large-scale neural recording, including multiplexed electrode arrays and wireless transmission systems. The integration of these advancements may pave the way for chronic, high-resolution neural interfaces capable of recording from thousands of neurons simultaneously. Such technologies could significantly advance both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications in neural engineering.", "label": 1}
