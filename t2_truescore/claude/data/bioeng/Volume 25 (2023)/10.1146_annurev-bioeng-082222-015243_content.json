{"grounding": "One of the greatest concerns in the subzero storage of cells, tissues, and organs is the ability to control the nucleation or recrystallization of ice. In nature, evidence of these processes, which aid in sustaining internal temperatures below the physiologic freezing point for extended periods of time, is apparent in freeze-avoidant and freeze-tolerant organisms. After decades of studying these proteins, we now have easily accessible compounds and materials capable of recapitulating the mechanisms seen in nature for biopreser-vation applications. The output from this burgeoning area of research can interact synergistically with other novel developments in the field of cryobiology, making it an opportune time for a review on this topic.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development of engineered compounds to control ice nucleation and recrystallization processes. Inspired by antifreeze (glyco)proteins found in nature, we investigate novel synthetic molecules designed to mimic their ice-binding properties. Our research focuses on the mechanisms of ice nucleation inhibition and thermal hysteresis, as well as the suppression of ice recrystallization. We synthesize and characterize a series of compounds, evaluating their effectiveness in modulating ice formation and growth. The results demonstrate significant improvements in controlling ice behavior compared to existing methods. These engineered compounds show promise for applications in cryopreservation, food science, and materials engineering, offering new strategies to manage ice formation in various industrial and biological contexts.", "label": 0}
