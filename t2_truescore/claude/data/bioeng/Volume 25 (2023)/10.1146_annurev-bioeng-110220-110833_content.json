{"grounding": "Brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to treat sensorimotor neurological disorders by creating artificial motor and/or sensory pathways. Introducing artificial pathways creates new relationships between sensory input and motor output, which the brain must learn to gain dexterous control. This review highlights the role of learning in BMIs to restore movement and sensation, and discusses how BMI design may influence neural plasticity and performance. The close integration of plasticity in sensory and motor function influences the design of both artificial pathways and will be an essential consideration for bidirectional devices that restore both sensory and motor function.", "generated_text": "Brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs) have emerged as powerful tools for restoring sensorimotor function in individuals with neurological impairments. This review explores the neural plasticity underlying successful BMI operation, focusing on the integration of sensory feedback and motor control. We examine how the brain adapts to incorporate artificial sensory inputs and novel motor outputs, highlighting the role of learning and neural circuit reorganization. Recent advances in closed-loop systems that combine sensory and motor elements are discussed, along with their potential to enhance BMI performance and user experience. Understanding these adaptive processes is crucial for developing more intuitive and effective BMI technologies for clinical applications.", "label": 1}
