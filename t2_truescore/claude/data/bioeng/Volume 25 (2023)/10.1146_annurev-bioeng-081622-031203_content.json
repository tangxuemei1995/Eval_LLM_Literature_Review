{"grounding": "Hemolysis (i.e., red blood cell lysis) can increase circulatory levels of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) and its degradation by-products, namely heme (h) and iron (Fe). Under homeostasis, minor increases in these three hemolytic by-products (Hb/h/Fe) are rapidly scavenged and cleared by natural plasma proteins. Under certain pathophysiological conditions, scavenging systems become overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of Hb/h/Fe in the circulation. Unfortunately, these species cause various side effects such as vasoconstriction, hypertension, and oxidative organ damage. Therefore, various therapeutics strategies are in development, ranging from supplementation with depleted plasma scavenger proteins to engineered biomimetic protein constructs capable of scavenging multiple hemolytic species. In this review, we briefly describe hemolysis and the characteristics of the major plasma-derived protein scavengers of Hb/h/Fe. Finally, we present novel engineering approaches designed to address the toxicity of these hemolytic by-products.", "generated_text": "Hemolysis, the rupture of red blood cells, releases hemoglobin, heme, and iron into the circulation, leading to severe toxicity and organ damage. This review explores recent advancements in engineering therapeutics to detoxify these harmful molecules. We discuss the development of synthetic haptoglobin and hemopexin mimetics, which effectively scavenge free hemoglobin and heme, respectively. Additionally, we examine novel iron chelators designed to mitigate iron-induced oxidative stress. The potential of nanoparticle-based delivery systems to enhance the efficacy and targeted delivery of these therapeutics is also addressed. Furthermore, we highlight emerging gene therapy approaches aimed at upregulating endogenous protective mechanisms. These innovative strategies show promise in mitigating the detrimental effects of hemolysis and may lead to improved treatments for various hemolytic disorders and related complications.", "label": 1}
