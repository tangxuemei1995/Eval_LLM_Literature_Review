{"grounding": "Over the last half century, the autofluorescence of the metabolic cofactors NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) has been quantified in a variety of cell types and disease states. With the spread of nonlinear optical microscopy techniques in biomedical research, NADH and FAD imaging has offered an attractive solution to noninvasively monitor cell and tissue status and elucidate dynamic changes in cell or tissue metabolism. Various tools and methods to measure the temporal, spectral, and spatial properties of NADH and FAD autofluorescence have been developed. Specifically, an optical redox ratio of cofactor fluorescence intensities and NADH fluorescence lifetime parameters have been used in numerous applications, but significant work remains to mature this technology for understanding dynamic changes in metabolism. This article describes the current understanding of our optical sensitivity to different metabolic pathways and highlights current challenges in the field. Recent progress in addressing these challenges and acquiring more quantitative information in faster and more metabolically relevant formats is also discussed.", "generated_text": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for non-invasive assessment of cellular metabolism in living cells and tissues. This review explores recent advances in optical techniques that exploit the autofluorescence of endogenous metabolic coenzymes, primarily NADH and FAD, to probe metabolic states. We discuss the principles of fluorescence lifetime imaging and two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy, which enable high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of metabolic activity. The review highlights how these techniques can distinguish between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, providing insights into cellular energy production pathways. We examine applications in cancer research, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering, where metabolic imaging has revealed critical information about disease progression, cell differentiation, and tissue function. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in the field, including the development of novel image analysis algorithms and the integration of metabolic imaging with other optical modalities for comprehensive cellular analysis.", "label": 1}
