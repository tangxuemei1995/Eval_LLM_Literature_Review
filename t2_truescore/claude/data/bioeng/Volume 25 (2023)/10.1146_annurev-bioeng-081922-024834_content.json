{"grounding": "A shift in the traditional technocentric view of medical device design to a human-centered one is needed to bridge existing translational gaps and improve health equity. To ensure the successful and equitable adoption of health technology innovations, engineers must think beyond the device and the direct end user and must seek a more holistic understanding of broader stakeholder needs and the intended context of use early in a design process. The objectives of this review article are (a) to provide rationale for the need to incorporate meaningful stakeholder analysis and contextual investigation in health technology development and biomedical engineering pedagogy, (b) to review existing frameworks and human- and equity-centered approaches to stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation for improved adoption of innovative technologies, and (c) to present case studyexamples of medical device design that apply these approaches to bridge the gaps between biomedical engineers and the contexts for which they are designing.", "generated_text": "As health technologies continue to advance, there is a growing need to ensure their design and implementation are both human-centered and equity-focused. This paper provides an overview of approaches that prioritize these crucial aspects in health technology development. We explore the principles of human-centered design and equity-centered engineering, emphasizing their importance in creating inclusive and effective health solutions. The role of contextual investigation is examined, highlighting how understanding the socio-cultural environment can inform more appropriate and accessible technologies. We discuss the significance of community and stakeholder engagement throughout the design process, ensuring diverse perspectives are incorporated and potential barriers are addressed. By synthesizing current literature and best practices, this review aims to guide researchers, designers, and policymakers in developing health technologies that are not only innovative but also equitable and responsive to the needs of diverse populations.", "label": 1}
