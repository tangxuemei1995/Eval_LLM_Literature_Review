{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are currently widely employed in medicine and healthcare. A PubMed search returns more than 100,000 articles on these topics published between 2018 and 2022 alone. Notwithstanding several recent reviews in various subfields of AI and ML in medicine, we have yet to see a comprehensive review around the methods\u2019 use in longitudinal analysis and prediction of an individual patient's health status within a personalized disease pathway. This review seeks to fill that gap. After an overview of the AI and ML methods employed in this field and of specific medical applications of models of this type, the review discusses the strengths and limitations of current studies and looks ahead to future strands of research in this field. We aim to enable interested readers to gain a detailed impression of the research currently available and accordingly plan future work around predictive models for deterioration in health status.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development of predictive models for health deterioration using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. By analyzing time series data from digital health pathways, we aim to understand and predict disease trajectories for personalized medicine applications. Our approach integrates diverse data sources, including electronic health records, wearable device data, and genomic information, to create comprehensive patient profiles. We employ advanced machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in disease progression, enabling early detection of health deterioration and personalized intervention strategies. The results demonstrate the potential of these models to significantly improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely and targeted interventions. This research contributes to the growing field of precision medicine by providing a framework for tailoring healthcare decisions and practices to individual patients based on their predicted disease trajectories.", "label": 0}
