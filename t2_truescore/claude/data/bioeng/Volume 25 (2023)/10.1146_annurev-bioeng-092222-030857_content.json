{"grounding": "Although sex differences have been noted in cellular function and behavior, therapy efficacy, and disease incidence and outcomes, the adoption of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine remains limited. Furthering the development of personalized, precision medicine requires considering biological sex at the bench and in the clinic. This review provides the basis for considering biological sex when designing tissue-engineered constructs and regenerative therapies by contextualizing sex as a biological variable within the tissue engineering triad of cells, matrices, and signals. To achieve equity in biological sex within medicine requires a cultural shift in science and engineering research, with active engagement by researchers, clinicians, companies, policymakers, and funding agencies.", "generated_text": "The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has made significant strides in developing innovative therapies and tissue models. However, the impact of sex as a biological variable has been largely overlooked. This review highlights the importance of considering sexual dimorphism in tissue engineering research and applications. We examine sex differences in stem cell behavior, tissue-specific characteristics, and regenerative potential across various organ systems. The integration of sex-specific factors in tissue models and engineered constructs is crucial for advancing precision medicine and improving therapeutic outcomes. By addressing sex-based disparities, researchers can enhance the relevance and efficacy of tissue-engineered products, ultimately leading to more personalized and effective treatments for both male and female patients.", "label": 1}
