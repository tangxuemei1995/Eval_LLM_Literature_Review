{"grounding": "Over the past decade, the increased adoption of electroporation-based technologies has led to an expansion of clinical research initiatives. Electroporation has been utilized in molecular biology for mammalian and bacterial transfection; for food sanitation; and in therapeutic settings to increase drug uptake, for gene therapy, and to eliminate cancerous tissues. We begin this article by discussing the biophysics required for understanding the concepts behind the cell permeation phenomenon that is electroporation. We then review nano- and microscale single-cell electroporation technologies before scaling up to emerging in vivo applications.", "generated_text": "Electroporation, a technique utilizing electric pulses to increase cell membrane permeability, has seen significant advancements in recent years. This review explores the latest developments in electroporation technologies, focusing on applications ranging from laboratory research to clinical treatments. We discuss innovations in pulsed field ablation for cardiac arrhythmias, improved transfection methods for gene therapy, electrochemotherapy for cancer treatment, and microfluidic devices for precise cellular manipulation. The integration of these technologies into medical practice and their potential impact on various fields, including oncology, cardiology, and genetic engineering, are examined, highlighting the promising future of electroporation in both research and clinical settings.", "label": 1}
