{"grounding": "Photochemical upconversion is a process whereby two lower-energy photons are converted into a higher-energy photon by sensitized triplet\u2013triplet annihilation. While recent interest in this process has been motivated by improving the efficiencies of solar cells, many applications are being explored. In this review, we address the underlying physicochemical phenomena that are responsible for photochemical upconversion. We review their kinetics, and the requirements for annihilators and sensitizers to design efficient upconversion systems. We discuss the spin physics of the bi-excitonic interactions and how the spin character of the triplet pairs can fundamentally limit the upconversion efficiency and give rise to the magnetic field effect on delayed photoluminescence. Finally, we address light-matter coupling phenomena that could be employed to enhance photochemical upconversion.", "generated_text": "Photochemical upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in solar energy harvesting and bioimaging. This review explores recent advancements in TTA-based upconversion systems, focusing on the interplay between sensitizer-chromophore pairs, kinetics, and magnetic field effects. We discuss strategies to overcome the spin statistical limit and enhance upconversion quantum yields. The influence of molecular design on TTA efficiency is examined, highlighting the importance of optimizing energy transfer processes. Additionally, we analyze the impact of external magnetic fields on upconversion performance and investigate novel approaches to manipulate spin dynamics. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the fundamental principles governing TTA-based upconversion and identifies promising directions for future research and practical applications.", "label": 0}
