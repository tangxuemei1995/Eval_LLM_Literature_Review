{"grounding": "A significant advantage of organic semiconductors over many of their inorganic counterparts is solution processability. However, solution processing commonly yields heterogeneous films with properties that are highly sensitive to the conditions and parameters of casting and processing. Measuring the key properties of these materials in situ, during film production, can provide new insight into the mechanism of these processing steps and how they lead to the emergence of the final organic film properties. The excited-state dynamics is often of import in photovoltaic, electronic, and light-emitting devices. This review focuses on single-shot transient absorption, which measures a transient spectrum in a single shot, enabling the rapid measurement of unstable chemical systems such as organic films during their casting and processing. We review the principles of instrument design and provide examples of the utility of this spectroscopy for measuring organic films during their production.", "generated_text": "We present a novel in situ transient absorption spectroscopy technique for real-time monitoring of excited-state dynamics during organic thin film deposition and processing. This method employs a single-shot approach, enabling high-speed data acquisition with microsecond time resolution. We demonstrate the capabilities of this instrument by studying the evolution of excited-state dynamics during vacuum thermal evaporation of small molecule organic semiconductors and subsequent thermal annealing. The results reveal rapid changes in exciton dynamics as molecular aggregation occurs during film growth and morphological reorganization. This technique provides unprecedented insight into the formation of intermolecular interactions and their impact on photophysical properties. The ability to probe excited-state dynamics in situ during film fabrication and processing opens new avenues for understanding and optimizing organic semiconductor materials for optoelectronic applications.", "label": 0}
