{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques are powerful tools to investigate polymer systems. In this review, we address how these techniques have been applied to hydrogel nano- and microparticles, so-called nano- or microgels. We outline which research questions on microgels could be addressed and what new insights could be achieved. Studies of the morphology, shape, and deformation of microgels; their internal compartmentalization; the cross-linker distribution and polarity inside them; and their dynamics and diffusion are summarized. In particular, the abilities to super-resolve structures in three dimensions have boosted the research field and have also allowed researchers to obtain impressive 3D images of deformed microgels. Accessing information beyond 3D localization, such as spectral and lifetime properties and correlative imaging or the combination of data with other methods, shines new light onto polymer systems and helps us understand their complexity in detail. Such future trends and developments are also addressed.", "generated_text": "This study presents a novel approach to 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging of microgels, enabling unprecedented insights into their complex internal structures. By combining advanced nanoscopy techniques with innovative fluorescence labeling strategies, we achieve high-resolution 3D visualization of polymer networks within adaptive microgel materials. Our method allows for precise 3D tracking of structural changes in response to external stimuli, revealing intricate details of microgel behavior at the nanoscale. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique through correlative microscopy, integrating super-resolution data with other imaging modalities. This powerful imaging approach provides a comprehensive understanding of microgel architecture and dynamics, paving the way for rational design of smart materials with tailored properties. Our findings have significant implications for various applications, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and responsive coatings.", "label": 0}
