{"grounding": "Reactions at solid\u2013water interfaces play a foundational role in water treatment systems, catalysis, and chemical separations, and in predicting chemical fate and transport in the environment. Over the last century, experimental measurements and computational models have made tremendous progress in capturing reactions at solid surfaces. The interfacial reactivity of a solid surface, however, can change dramatically and unexpectedly when it is confined to the nanoscale. Nanoconfinement can arise in different geometries such as pores/cages (3D confinement), channels (2D confinement), and slits (1D confinement). Therefore, measurements on unconfined surfaces, and molecular models parameterized based on these measurements, fail to capture chemical behaviors under nanoconfinement. This review evaluates recent experimental and theoretical advances, with a focus on adsorption at solid\u2013water interfaces. We review how nanoconfinement alters the physico-chemical properties of water, and how the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water dictate energetics, pathways, and products of adsorption in nanopores. Finally, the implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the adsorption behavior of ions at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces within nanopores. We employ advanced surface complexation modeling techniques to elucidate the impact of nanoconfinement on ion speciation and adsorption mechanisms. Our results reveal significant deviations from bulk adsorption behavior in nanoporous environments, attributed to the enhanced surface-to-volume ratio and altered electrostatic interactions. We observe a pronounced effect of pore size on adsorption capacity and selectivity, with smaller pores exhibiting unique adsorption characteristics. The study also highlights the importance of considering nanoconfinement effects in predicting and interpreting adsorption phenomena in nanoporous materials. These findings have important implications for various applications, including water purification, energy storage, and environmental remediation. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of interfacial chemistry in nanoconfined spaces and provides valuable insights for the design and optimization of nanoporous adsorbents.", "label": 1}
