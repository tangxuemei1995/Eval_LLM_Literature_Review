{"grounding": "The magneto-optical signatures of colloidal noble metal nanostructures, spanning both discrete nanoclusters (<2 nm) and plasmonic nanoparticles (>2 nm), exhibit rich structure-property correlations, impacting applications including photonic integrated circuits, light modulation, applied spectroscopy, and more. For nanoclusters, electron doping and single-atom substitution modify both the intensity of the magneto-optical response and the degree of transient spin polarization. Nanoparticle size and morphology also modulate the magnitude and polarity of plasmon-mediated magneto-optical signals. This intimate interplay between nanostructure and magneto-optical properties becomes especially apparent in magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magnetic circular photoluminescence (MCPL) spectroscopic data. Whereas MCD spectroscopy informs on a metal nanostructure's steady-state extinction properties, its MCPL counterpart is sensitive to electronic spin and orbital angular momenta of transiently excited states. This review describes the size- and structure-dependent magneto-optical properties of nanoscale metals, emphasizing the increasingly important role of MCPL in understanding transient spin properties and dynamics.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the magneto-optical properties of noble metal nanostructures, focusing on their unique plasmonic and superatomic characteristics. We explore the interplay between localized surface plasmon resonances and spin-polarized emission in these nanostructures, revealing novel magneto-optical phenomena. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including magnetic circular photoluminescence and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, we demonstrate the plasmon-mediated enhancement of magneto-optical effects in noble metal nanoparticles and clusters. Our findings highlight the role of superatomic electronic structures in modulating the spin-dependent optical responses of these systems. The observed magneto-optical properties are analyzed in the context of potential applications in nanophotonics, spintronics, and quantum information processing. This work provides new insights into the fundamental physics of noble metal nanostructures and paves the way for the development of advanced magneto-plasmonic devices.", "label": 1}
