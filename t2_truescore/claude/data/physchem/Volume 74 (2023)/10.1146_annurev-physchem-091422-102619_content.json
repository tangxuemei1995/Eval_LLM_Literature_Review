{"grounding": "The photoacid dynamics of fluorescent proteins include both electronic excited- and ground-state mechanisms of proton transfer. The associated characteristic timescales of these reactions range over many orders of magnitude, and the tunneling, barrier crossing, and relevant thermodynamics have in certain cases been linked to coherent nuclear motion. We review the literature and summarize the experiments and theory that demonstrate proton tunneling in the electronic ground state of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). We also discuss the excited-state proton-transfer reaction of GFP that takes place on the picosecond timescale. Although this reaction has been investigated using several vibrational spectroscopic methods, the interpretation remains unsettled. We discuss recent advances as well as remaining questions, in particular those related to the vibrational mode couplings that involve low-frequency modulations of chromophore vibrations on the timescale of proton transfer.", "generated_text": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) has revolutionized biological imaging, yet its photoacid dynamics remain incompletely understood. This study employs ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, including stimulated Raman spectroscopy, to investigate the proton transfer mechanism in GFP. We observe coherent oscillations in the fluorescence signal, indicating quantum coherence effects in the proton transfer process. Our results suggest that proton tunneling plays a significant role in the excited-state dynamics of GFP. We propose a model incorporating both classical and quantum mechanical aspects of proton transfer, reconciling previous conflicting observations. These findings not only enhance our understanding of GFP's photophysics but also have implications for the design of novel fluorescent proteins and optogenetic tools. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the fundamental nature of proton transfer in biological systems.", "label": 0}
