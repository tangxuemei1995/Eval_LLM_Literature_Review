{"grounding": "Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metallic nanostructures result in subwavelength optical confinement that enhances light\u2013matter interactions, for example, aiding the sensitivity of surface spectroscopies. The dissipation of surface plasmons as electronic and vibrational excitations sets the limit for field confinement but also provides opportunities for photochemistry, photocatalysis, and photothermal heating. Optimization for either goal requires a deeper understanding of this photothermalization process. In this review, we focus on recent insights into the physics and dynamics governing photothermalization of LSPRs in metallic nanostructures, emphasizing comparisons between the steady-state behavior and ultrafast time-resolved studies. The differences between these regimes inform how to best optimize plasmonic systems for applications under relatively low-intensity, continuous illumination (e.g., sunlight).", "generated_text": "This study investigates the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, focusing on the steady-state behavior of metallic nanoparticles under illumination. We explore the interplay between nonthermal carriers, hot electrons, and thermal effects using advanced Raman thermometry techniques. Our findings reveal that the steady-state temperature distribution around plasmonic nanoparticles is governed by a complex balance of energy transfer processes. We demonstrate that hot electron generation and relaxation play a crucial role in determining the local temperature profile and overall photocatalytic activity. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes underlying plasmonic heating and offer new avenues for optimizing the design of nanostructures for applications in photocatalysis and photothermal therapy.", "label": 0}
