{"grounding": "High-resolution vibrational spectra of C\u2013H, O\u2013H, and N\u2013H stretches depend on both molecular conformation and environment as well as provide a window into the frequencies of many other vibrational degrees of freedom as a result of mode mixing. We review current theoretical strategies that are being deployed to both aid and guide the analysis of the data that are encoded in these spectra. The goal is to enhance the power of vibrational spectroscopy as a tool for probing conformational preferences, hydrogen bonding effects away from equilibrium, and energy flow pathways. Recent years have seen an explosion of new methods and strategies for solving the nuclear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Rather than attempt a comprehensive review, this work highlights specific molecular systems that we have chosen as representing bonding motifs that are important to chemistry and biology. We focus on the choices theoretical chemists make regarding the level of electronic structure theory, the representation of the potential energy surface, the selection of coordinates, preferences in basis sets, and methods of solution.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of anharmonic effects on the vibrational spectra of high-frequency modes in molecular systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that incorporates mode mixing, anharmonicities, and resonances to accurately model these complex vibrational phenomena. Our approach combines ab initio calculations with perturbation theory to account for the coupling between different vibrational modes and the anharmonic nature of potential energy surfaces. We demonstrate the significance of these effects in predicting spectral features, including frequency shifts, intensity changes, and the emergence of combination bands. The model is applied to a series of benchmark molecules, revealing substantial improvements in spectral predictions compared to traditional harmonic approximations. Our findings highlight the importance of considering anharmonic effects for a more accurate interpretation of high-resolution vibrational spectra, particularly in systems with strong inter-mode couplings or large-amplitude motions. This work provides valuable insights for spectroscopists and computational chemists seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations in vibrational spectroscopy.", "label": 0}
