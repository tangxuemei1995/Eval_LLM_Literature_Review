{"grounding": "The processes of genome expression, regulation, and repair require direct interactions between proteins and DNA at specific sites located at and near single-stranded\u2013double-stranded DNA (ssDNA\u2013dsDNA) junctions. Here, we review the application of recently developed spectroscopic methods and analyses that combine linear absorbance and circular dichroism spectroscopy with nonlinear 2D fluorescence spectroscopy to study the local conformations and conformational disorder of the sugar-phosphate backbones of ssDNA\u2013dsDNA fork constructs that have been internally labeled with exciton-coupled cyanine (iCy3)2 dimer probes. With the application of these methods, the (iCy3)2 dimer can serve as a reliable probe of the mean local conformations and conformational distributions of the sugar-phosphate backbones of dsDNA at various critical positions. The results of our studies suggest a possible structural framework for understanding the roles of DNA breathing in driving the processes of protein\u2013DNA complex assembly and function.", "generated_text": "This study introduces a novel approach to investigate local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder using site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy. By incorporating fluorescent dimer probes at specific locations along the DNA backbone, we employ 2D spectroscopy to analyze the exciton coupling between adjacent fluorophores. This method enables high-resolution mapping of DNA structural dynamics, including backbone flexibility and conformational changes associated with protein-DNA interactions and DNA replication. Our findings reveal previously unobserved local conformational fluctuations and provide insights into DNA breathing phenomena. The site-specific fluorescence labeling technique allows for precise examination of DNA structural variations in different sequence contexts and under various physiological conditions. This innovative approach offers a powerful tool for elucidating the intricate relationship between DNA structure, dynamics, and biological function, with potential applications in understanding DNA-protein recognition and replication mechanisms.", "label": 0}
