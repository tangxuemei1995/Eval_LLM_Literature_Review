{"grounding": "Interaction analysis techniques, including the many-body expansion (MBE), symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, and energy decomposition analysis, allow for an intuitive understanding of complex molecular interactions. We review these methods by first providing a historical context for the study of many-body interactions and discussing how nonadditivities emerge from Hamiltonians containing strictly pairwise-additive interactions. We then elaborate on the synergy between these interaction analysis techniques and the development of advanced force fields aimed at accurately reproducing the Born\u2013Oppenheimer potential energy surface. In particular, we focus on ab initio\u2013based force fields that aim to explicitly reproduce many-body terms and are fitted to high-level electronic structure results. These force fields generally incorporate many-body effects through (a) parameterization of distributed multipoles, (b) explicit fitting of the MBE, (c) inclusion of many-atom features in a neural network, and (d) coarse-graining of many-body terms into an effective two-body term. We also discuss the emerging use of the MBE to improve the accuracy and speed of ab initio molecular dynamics.", "generated_text": "Understanding many-body effects in aqueous systems is crucial for accurate molecular simulations and force field development. This study explores the synergies between advanced interaction analysis techniques and polarizable force field development for aqueous systems. We employ a combination of ab initio calculations, many-body expansion methods, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the complex interplay of intermolecular interactions in water clusters and bulk water. Our results reveal significant contributions from three-body and higher-order terms, highlighting the limitations of pairwise additive models. We demonstrate how incorporating these many-body effects into polarizable force fields leads to improved accuracy in predicting structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties of water. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach for systematically refining force field parameters based on the analysis of many-body interactions. This work provides valuable insights into the nature of aqueous interactions and offers a framework for developing more accurate and transferable force fields for molecular simulations of complex aqueous systems.", "label": 1}
