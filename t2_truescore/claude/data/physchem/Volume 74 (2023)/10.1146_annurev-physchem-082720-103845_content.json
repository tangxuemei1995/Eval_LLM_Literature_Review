{"grounding": "Gas-phase molecular spectroscopy is a natural playground for accurate quantum-chemical computations. However, the molecular bricks of life (e.g., DNA bases or amino acids) are challenging systems because of the unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with the molecular size (active electrons) and/or the presence of large-amplitude internal motions. From the theoretical point of view, both aspects prevent the brute-force use of very accurate but very expensive state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methodologies. From the experimental point of view, both features lead to congested gas-phase spectra, whose assignment and interpretation are not at all straightforward. Based on these premises, this review focuses on the current status and perspectives of the fully a priori prediction of the spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules (containing up to two dozen atoms) in the gas phase with special reference to rotational and vibrational spectroscopies of some representative molecular bricks of life.", "generated_text": "This review explores the challenges and advancements in gas-phase computational spectroscopy for studying the molecular bricks of life. We focus on the complexities of predicting rotational and vibrational spectra for these biologically relevant molecules, which often exhibit significant flexibility and anharmonicity. The paper discusses state-of-the-art computational methods and their limitations in accurately modeling the spectroscopic properties of amino acids, nucleobases, and other fundamental biomolecules. We highlight the importance of considering conformational landscapes and anharmonic effects to improve spectral predictions. Additionally, we examine recent progress in addressing these challenges, including the development of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approaches and machine learning techniques. The review concludes by identifying future research directions and emphasizing the critical role of computational spectroscopy in understanding the molecular basis of life.", "label": 0}
