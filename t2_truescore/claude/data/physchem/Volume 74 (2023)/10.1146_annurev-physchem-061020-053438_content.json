{"grounding": "Modern quantum chemistry algorithms are increasingly able to accurately predict molecular properties that are useful for chemists in research and education. Despite this progress, performing such calculations is currently unattainable to the wider chemistry community, as they often require domain expertise, computer programming skills, and powerful computer hardware. In this review, we outline methods to eliminate these barriers using cutting-edge technologies. We discuss the ingredients needed to create accessible platforms that can compute quantum chemistry properties in real time, including graphical processing units\u2013accelerated quantum chemistry in the cloud, artificial intelligence\u2013driven natural molecule input methods, and extended reality visualization. We end by highlighting a series of exciting applications that assemble these components to create uniquely interactive platforms for computing and visualizing spectra, 3D structures, molecular orbitals, and many other chemical properties.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the convergence of interactive quantum chemistry with cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning, graphical processing units (GPUs), and cloud computing. We present a novel framework that leverages natural user interfaces and chemical structure recognition to enable real-time manipulation and analysis of molecular structures. By harnessing the power of GPUs and cloud computing, our system achieves unprecedented speed and scalability in quantum chemical calculations. We demonstrate the integration of extended reality (XR) technologies to enhance visualization and interaction with complex molecular systems. Our approach significantly reduces the computational barriers traditionally associated with quantum chemistry, making it more accessible to researchers and educators. This work paves the way for new paradigms in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical education by providing an intuitive, responsive, and powerful platform for exploring quantum chemical phenomena.", "label": 0}
