{"grounding": "Surfaces mediate the formation of stable glasses (SGs) upon physical vapor deposition (PVD) for a wide range of glass formers. The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of SGs and their anisotropic packing structures are controlled through the deposition parameters (deposition temperature and rate) as well as the chemical structure and composition of the glass former. The resulting PVD glass properties can therefore be related to the structure and dynamics of the glass surface, which can have oriented packing, enhanced surface diffusion, and a lower glass transition temperature, and can facilitate an enhanced aging rate of the interfacial region. We review our current understanding of the details of this surface-mediated SG formation process and discuss key gaps in our knowledge of glass surface dynamics and their effect on this process.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the formation of stable glasses through surface-mediated equilibration during physical vapor deposition. We demonstrate that enhanced surface mobility facilitates the creation of glasses with exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability. By carefully controlling deposition parameters, we produce glasses with structural anisotropy and properties far surpassing those of conventional glasses formed by cooling liquids. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between deposition temperature and the resulting glass stability, with optimal conditions occurring at approximately 85% of the glass transition temperature. We observe significant reductions in enthalpy and improved resistance to crystallization in these vapor-deposited glasses. This research provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms of stable glass formation and opens new avenues for designing materials with tailored properties for various applications in optoelectronics, pharmaceuticals, and advanced materials science.", "label": 0}
