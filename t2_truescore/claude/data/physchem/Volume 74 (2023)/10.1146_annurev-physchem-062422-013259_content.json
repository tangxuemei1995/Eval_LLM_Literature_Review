{"grounding": "Ground-state Kohn-Sham density functional theory provides, in principle, the exact ground-state energy and electronic spin densities of real interacting electrons in a static external potential. In practice, the exact density functional for the exchange-correlation (xc) energy must be approximated in a computationally efficient way. About 20 mathematical properties of the exact xc functional are known. In this work, we review and discuss these known constraints on the xc energy and hole. By analyzing a sequence of increasingly sophisticated density functional approximations (DFAs), we argue that (a) the satisfaction of more exact constraints and appropriate norms makes a functional more predictive over the immense space of many-electron systems and (b) fitting to bonded systems yields an interpolative DFA that may not extrapolate well to systems unlike those in the fitting set. We discuss both how the class of well-described systems has grown along with constraint satisfaction and the possibilities for future functional development.", "generated_text": "Density functional theory (DFT) has become a cornerstone in electronic structure calculations, yet the quest for more accurate and efficient functionals continues. This study explores the synergistic effect of incorporating exact constraints and appropriate norms in the development of density functionals. We demonstrate that by carefully selecting and implementing exact constraints derived from known physical principles, combined with the use of appropriate norms for assessing functional performance, significant improvements in the predictive power of DFT can be achieved. Our results show enhanced accuracy in calculating exchange-correlation energies across a diverse set of molecular systems and solid-state materials. Furthermore, we propose a systematic approach for identifying and prioritizing constraints and norms that yield the most substantial improvements in functional performance. This work provides valuable insights into the fundamental nature of electron correlation and offers a promising direction for the next generation of density functionals with increased predictive capabilities.", "label": 1}
