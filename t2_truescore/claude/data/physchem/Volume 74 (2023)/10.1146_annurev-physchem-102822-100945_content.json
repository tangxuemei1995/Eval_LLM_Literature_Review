{"grounding": "Light-driven phenomena in organic molecular aggregates underpin several mechanisms relevant to optoelectronic applications. Modeling these processes is essential for aiding the design of new materials and optimizing optoelectronic devices. In this review, we cover the use of different atomistic models, excited-state dynamics, and transport approaches for understanding light-activated phenomena in molecular aggregates, including radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. We consider both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms and focus on the role of conical intersections as facilitators of internal conversion. We explore the use of the exciton models for Frenkel and charge transfer states and the electronic structure methods and algorithms commonly applied for excited-state dynamics. Throughout the review, we analyze the approximations employed for the simulation of internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and reverse intersystem crossing rates and analyze the molecular processes behind single fission, triplet-triplet annihilation, Dexter energy transfer, and F\u00f6rster energy transfer.", "generated_text": "This review explores the modeling of excited states in molecular organic aggregates, crucial for understanding optoelectronic phenomena. We discuss various theoretical approaches, including exciton models and ab initio methods, to describe excited-state dynamics in these systems. The interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom is examined, focusing on radiative and nonradiative decay processes. Special attention is given to conical intersections, which play a pivotal role in ultrafast relaxation mechanisms. We also address singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation, two important processes in organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. The review highlights recent advances in computational techniques and their applications to predict and interpret spectroscopic observables. Finally, we outline challenges and future directions in modeling excited states of molecular aggregates for improved optoelectronic device design.", "label": 1}
