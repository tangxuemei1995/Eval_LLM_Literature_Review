{"grounding": "Genetic data contain a record of our evolutionary history. The availability of large-scale datasets of human populations from various geographic areas and timescales, coupled with advances in the computational methods to analyze these data, has transformed our ability to use genetic data to learn about our evolutionary past. Here, we review some of the widely used statistical methods to explore and characterize population relationships and history using genomic data. We describe the intuition behind commonly used approaches, their interpretation, and important limitations. For illustration, we apply some of these techniques to genome-wide autosomal data from 929 individuals representing 53 worldwide populations that are part of the Human Genome Diversity Project. Finally, we discuss the new frontiers in genomic methods to learn about population history. In sum, this review highlights the power (and limitations) of DNA to infer features of human evolutionary history, complementing the knowledge gleaned from other disciplines, such as archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics.", "generated_text": "Genomic data has revolutionized our ability to investigate population relationships and demographic history. This review explores current methods for assessing these aspects using genomic information. We discuss techniques for inferring effective population size, detecting admixture events, and estimating ancestry proportions. The application of molecular clocks to genomic data for dating historical events is also examined. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of various approaches, including coalescent-based methods, principal component analysis, and machine learning algorithms. The integration of multiple lines of evidence, such as archaeological and linguistic data, with genomic analyses is highlighted as a powerful strategy for reconstructing population histories. Finally, we address challenges in interpreting results, including the impact of ascertainment bias and the importance of appropriate reference populations. This review provides a comprehensive overview of genomic methods for unraveling the complex relationships and histories of human populations.", "label": 1}
