{"grounding": "While the neural crest cell population gives rise to an extraordinary array of derivatives, including elements of the craniofacial skeleton, skin pigmentation, and peripheral nervous system, it is today increasingly recognized that Schwann cell precursors are also multipotent. Two mammalian paralogs of the SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) chromatin-remodeling complexes, BAF (Brg1-associated factors) and PBAF (polybromo-associated BAF), are critical for neural crest specification during normal mammalian development. There is increasing evidence that pathogenic variants in components of the BAF and PBAF complexes play central roles in the pathogenesis of neural crest\u2013derived tumors. Transgenic mouse models demonstrate a temporal window early in development where pathogenic variants in Smarcb1 result in the formation of aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors, such as rhabdoid tumors. By contrast, later in development, homozygous inactivation of Smarcb1 requires additional pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor genes to drive the development of differentiated adult neoplasms derived from the neural crest, which have a comparatively good prognosis in humans.\n", "generated_text": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a crucial role in neural crest cell development and is implicated in various neurocristopathies. This review explores the function of SWI/SNF in neural crest-derived tissues, focusing on its interaction with NF2 and the role of Smarcb1, a core subunit of the complex. We discuss how mutations in SWI/SNF components contribute to the development of rhabdoid tumors and schwannomas. The review also examines the involvement of SWI/SNF in Schwann cell precursor differentiation and maintenance. Recent findings suggest that disruption of SWI/SNF function in these cells may lead to tumor formation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SWI/SNF-mediated regulation of neural crest cell development and differentiation provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for related disorders. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of chromatin remodeling in neural crest biology and its implications for human disease.", "label": 1}
