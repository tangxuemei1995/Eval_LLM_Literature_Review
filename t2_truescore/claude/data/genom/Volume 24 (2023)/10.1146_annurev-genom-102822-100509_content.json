{"grounding": "DECIPHER (Database of Genomic Variation and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources) shares candidate diagnostic variants and phenotypic data from patients with genetic disorders to facilitate research and improve the diagnosis, management, and therapy of rare diseases. The platform sits at the boundary between genomic research and the clinical community. DECIPHER aims to ensure that the most up-to-date data are made rapidly available within its interpretation interfaces to improve clinical care. Newly integrated cardiac case\u2013control data that provide evidence of gene\u2013disease associations and inform variant interpretation exemplify this mission. New research resources are presented in a format optimized for use by a broad range of professionals supporting the delivery of genomic medicine. The interfaces within DECIPHER integrate and contextualize variant and phenotypic data, helping to determine a robust clinico-molecular diagnosis for rare-disease patients, which combines both variant classification and clinical fit. DECIPHER supports discovery research, connecting individuals within the rare-disease community to pursue hypothesis-driven research.", "generated_text": "DECIPHER is a pioneering platform designed to enhance genetic diagnosis by dynamically integrating genomic and clinical data for rare diseases and genetic disorders. This innovative tool facilitates improved genotype-phenotype correlation and variant interpretation, addressing the challenges faced in diagnosing complex genetic conditions. By aggregating and analyzing diverse datasets from global contributors, DECIPHER enables clinicians and researchers to identify novel disease-causing variants and refine diagnostic strategies. The platform's user-friendly interface allows for efficient data sharing, collaborative interpretation, and real-time updates, fostering a collective approach to genetic diagnosis. DECIPHER's advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities continuously improve variant classification accuracy, leading to more precise and timely diagnoses. This comprehensive approach not only accelerates the diagnostic process for individual patients but also contributes to the broader understanding of rare genetic disorders, ultimately advancing personalized medicine and targeted therapies.", "label": 1}
