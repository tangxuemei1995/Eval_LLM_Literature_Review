{"grounding": "The axial length of the eye is critical for normal visual function by enabling light to precisely focus on the retina. The mean axial length of the adult human eye is 23.5 mm, but the molecular mechanisms regulating ocular axial length remain poorly understood. Underdevelopment can lead to microphthalmia (defined as a small eye with an axial length of less than 19 mm at 1 year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood) within the first trimester of pregnancy. However, continued overgrowth can lead to axial high myopia (an enlarged eye with an axial length of 26.5 mm or more) at any age. Both conditions show high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity associated with significant visual morbidity worldwide. More than 90 genes can contribute to microphthalmia, and several hundred genes are associated with myopia, yet diagnostic yields are low. Crucially, the genetic pathways underpinning the specification of eye size are only now being discovered, with evidence suggesting that shared molecular pathways regulate under- or overgrowth of the eye. Improving our mechanistic understanding of axial length determination will help better inform us of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations in both microphthalmia and myopia, dissect gene\u2013environment interactions in myopia, and develop postnatal therapies that may influence overall eye growth.", "generated_text": "Axial length, a critical determinant of refractive error, plays a pivotal role in ocular development and visual acuity. This review explores the genetic factors influencing axial length across the spectrum from microphthalmia to high myopia in childhood. We examine recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions, focusing on key genes and signaling pathways involved in ocular growth regulation. Microphthalmia, characterized by abnormally small eyes, is associated with mutations in genes such as SOX2 and OTX2, which are crucial for early eye development. Conversely, high myopia, marked by excessive axial elongation, involves complex interactions between multiple genetic loci and environmental factors. We discuss the role of genes like MYOC, OPTC, and PAX6 in myopia progression, as well as genome-wide association studies that have identified novel susceptibility loci. Additionally, we explore the potential of gene therapy and targeted interventions in managing these conditions. This comprehensive review provides insights into the genetic architecture of axial length determination, offering valuable perspectives for future research and therapeutic strategies in pediatric ophthalmology.", "label": 1}
