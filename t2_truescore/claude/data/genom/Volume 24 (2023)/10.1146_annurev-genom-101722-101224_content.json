{"grounding": "The subcellular localization of a biopolymer often informs its function. RNA is traditionally confined to the cytosolic and nuclear spaces, where it plays critical and conserved roles across nearly all biochemical processes. Our recent observation of cell surface glycoRNAs may further explain the extracellular role of RNA. While cellular membranes are efficient gatekeepers of charged polymers such as RNAs, a large body of research has demonstrated the accumulation of specific RNA species outside of the cell, termed extracellular RNAs (exRNAs). Across various species and forms of life, protein pores have evolved to transport RNA across membranes, thus providing a mechanistic path for exRNAs to achieve their extracellular topology. Here, we review types of exRNAs and the pores capable of RNA transport to provide a logical and testable path toward understanding the biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs.", "generated_text": "The discovery of extracellular RNA (exRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs has revolutionized our understanding of RNA biology and intercellular communication. This review explores the systems and mechanisms involved in RNA crossing cellular membranes, focusing on the contextualization of exRNA and glycoRNAs. We examine the diverse RNA species found outside cells, their biogenesis, and the pathways facilitating their export and uptake. The role of extracellular vesicles, RNA-binding proteins, and lipoproteins in RNA trafficking is discussed, along with the emerging field of glycoRNAs and their potential functions in cell-cell interactions and signaling. We also highlight the implications of these findings for various biological processes, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic applications. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex landscape of RNA trafficking and its significance in cellular communication and physiology.", "label": 0}
