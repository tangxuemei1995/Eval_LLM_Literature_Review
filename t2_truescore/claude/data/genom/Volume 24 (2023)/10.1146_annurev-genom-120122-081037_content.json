{"grounding": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic blood disease caused by a point mutation in the gene coding for \u03b2-globin. The abnormal hemoglobin [sickle hemoglobin (HbS)] polymerizes under low-oxygen conditions and causes red blood cells to sickle. The clinical presentation varies from very severe (with acute pain, chronic pain, and early mortality) to normal (few complications and a normal life span). The variability of SCD might be due (in part) to various genetic modulators. First, we review the main genetic factors, polymorphisms, and modifier genes that influence the expression of globin or otherwise modulate the severity of SCD. Considering SCD as a complex, multifactorial disorder is important for the development of appropriate pharmacological and genetic treatments. Second, we review the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of the latest advances in gene therapy for SCD, from lentiviral-vector-based approaches to gene-editing strategies.", "generated_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, leading to severe complications. This review explores recent advances in understanding SCD genetics and developing curative approaches. We discuss the role of genetic modifiers in disease severity and progression, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic interventions. The paper examines ongoing gene therapy trials utilizing viral vectors to introduce functional hemoglobin genes, as well as emerging gene editing techniques aimed at correcting the underlying genetic mutation. We assess the efficacy and safety of these approaches, including concerns regarding genotoxicity associated with viral vector integration. Additionally, we evaluate the potential of novel gene editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, in developing more precise and efficient treatments for SCD. Finally, we consider the challenges and future directions in translating these promising curative approaches into clinical practice.", "label": 1}
