{"grounding": "DNA sequencing has revolutionized medicine over recent decades. However, analysis of large structural variation and repetitive DNA, a hallmark of human genomes, has been limited by short-read technology, with read lengths of 100\u2013300 bp. Long-read sequencing (LRS) permits routine sequencing of human DNA fragments tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in size, using both real-time sequencing by synthesis and nanopore-based direct electronic sequencing. LRS permits analysis of large structural variation and haplotypic phasing in human genomes and has enabled the discovery and characterization of rare pathogenic structural variants and repeat expansions. It has also recently enabled the assembly of a complete, gapless human genome that includes previously intractable regions, such as highly repetitive centromeres and homologous acrocentric short arms. With the addition of protocols for targeted enrichment, direct epigenetic DNA modification detection, and long-range chromatin profiling, LRS promises to launch a new era of understanding of genetic diversity and pathogenic mutations in human populations.", "generated_text": "Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics research by enabling the detection of complex structural variants and repetitive DNA regions that were previously inaccessible. This review examines recent advances in long-read sequencing platforms, highlighting their applications in identifying pathogenic mutations and characterizing epigenetic modifications. We discuss improvements in read length, accuracy, and throughput, which have expanded the utility of these technologies across various fields, including medical genetics and cancer research. Despite significant progress, challenges remain, such as high error rates, limited scalability, and data analysis complexities. We explore ongoing efforts to address these limitations through improved sequencing chemistries, novel computational algorithms, and integrated multi-omics approaches. As long-read sequencing continues to evolve, it promises to provide unprecedented insights into genome architecture and function, potentially transforming our understanding of human health and disease.", "label": 1}
