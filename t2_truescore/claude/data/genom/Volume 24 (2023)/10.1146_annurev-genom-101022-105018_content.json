{"grounding": "I was attracted to hematology because by combining clinical findings with the use of a microscope and simple laboratory tests, one could often make a diagnosis. I was attracted to genetics when I learned about inherited blood disorders, at a time when we had only hints that somatic mutations were also important. It seemed clear that if we understood not only what genetic changes caused what diseases but also the mechanisms through which those genetic changes contribute to cause disease, we could improve management. Thus, I investigated many aspects of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase system, including cloning of the gene, and in the study of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), I found that it is a clonal disorder; subsequently, we were able to explain how a nonmalignant clone can expand, and I was involved in the first trial of PNH treatment by complement inhibition. I was fortunate to do clinical and research hematology in five countries; in all of them, I learned from mentors, from colleagues, and from patients.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical account traces the author's scientific journey from studying blood cells to exploring human genetics and back. The narrative begins with investigations into hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency, highlighting the interplay between genetic variations and their phenotypic manifestations. The author then delves into the realm of somatic mutations, focusing on paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria as a model disease. This research path unveils the critical role of Darwinian selection in shaping genetic landscapes within individuals. The journey comes full circle as the author returns to blood cell studies, now armed with advanced genetic knowledge. This perspective allows for a deeper understanding of how genetic alterations influence cellular behavior and disease progression. The abstract emphasizes the interconnectedness of hematology and genetics, showcasing how advancements in one field can significantly impact the other. This scientific odyssey underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in unraveling complex biological phenomena.", "label": 1}
