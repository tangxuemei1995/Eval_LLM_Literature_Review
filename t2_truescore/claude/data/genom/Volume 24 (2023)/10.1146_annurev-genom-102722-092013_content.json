{"grounding": "Elucidating spatiotemporal changes in gene expression has been an essential goal in studies of health, development, and disease. In the emerging field of spatially resolved transcriptomics, gene expression profiles are acquired with the tissue architecture maintained, sometimes at cellular resolution. This has allowed for the development of spatial cell atlases, studies of cell\u2013cell interactions, and in situ cell typing. In this review, we focus on padlock probe\u2013based in situ sequencing, which is a targeted spatially resolved transcriptomic method. We summarize recent methodological and computational tool developments and discuss key applications. We also discuss compatibility with other methods and integration with multiomic platforms for future applications.", "generated_text": "Padlock probe-based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) is a powerful spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technique that enables the visualization and quantification of gene expression within intact tissue samples. This method combines the specificity of padlock probes with rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve single-molecule detection and spatial resolution. ISS has emerged as a valuable tool for creating spatial cell atlases and performing in situ cell typing. This review provides an overview of the methodological principles underlying padlock probe-based ISS, highlighting its advantages and limitations. We discuss recent applications in various fields, including developmental biology, neuroscience, and cancer research, and explore future directions for this rapidly evolving technology.", "label": 1}
