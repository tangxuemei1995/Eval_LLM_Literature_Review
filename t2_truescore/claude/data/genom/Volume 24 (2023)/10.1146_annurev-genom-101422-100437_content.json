{"grounding": "Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis across many individuals at single-cell resolution. Compared with bulk RNA sequencing, which averages gene expression across cell types and cell states, single-cell assays capture the transcriptional states of individual cells, including fine-grained, transient, and difficult-to-isolate populations at unprecedented scale and resolution. Single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) mapping can identify context-dependent eQTLs that vary with cell states, including some that colocalize with disease variants identified in genome-wide association studies. By uncovering the precise contexts in which these eQTLs act, single-cell approaches can unveil previously hidden regulatory effects and pinpoint important cell states underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. Here, we present an overview of recently deployed experimental designs in sc-eQTL studies. In the process, we consider the influence of study design choices such as cohort, cell states, and ex vivo perturbations. We then discuss current methodologies, modeling approaches, and technical challenges as well as future opportunities and applications.", "generated_text": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding gene regulation at unprecedented resolution. This review explores the latest methods and insights gained from sc-eQTL studies, highlighting their potential to unravel the complex relationships between genetic variation and gene expression across diverse cell states. We discuss how sc-eQTL analysis has advanced our understanding of cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms and the impact of noncoding variants on gene expression. The integration of sc-eQTL data with other single-cell sequencing modalities is examined, revealing novel insights into cellular heterogeneity and dynamic gene regulation. Furthermore, we address the computational challenges and statistical approaches developed to handle the unique aspects of single-cell data in eQTL mapping. Finally, we consider the future directions of sc-eQTL research and its potential applications in personalized medicine and functional genomics.", "label": 1}
