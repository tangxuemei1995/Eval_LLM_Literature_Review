{"grounding": "The transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play a pivotal role in bone development and skeletal health. More than 30 different types of skeletal dysplasia are now known to be caused by pathogenic variants in genes that belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and/or regulate TGF-\u03b2/BMP bioavailability. This review describes the latest advances in skeletal dysplasia that is due to impaired TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling and results in short stature (acromelic dysplasia and cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome) or tall stature (Marfan syndrome). We thoroughly describe the clinical features of the patients, the underlying genetic findings, and the pathomolecular mechanisms leading to disease, which have been investigated mainly using patient-derived skin fibroblasts and mouse models. Although no pharmacological treatment is yet available for skeletal dysplasia due to impaired TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling, in recent years advances in the use of drugs targeting TGF-\u03b2 have been made, and we also discuss these advances.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intricate roles of TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling pathways in skeletal dysplasias associated with short and tall stature. These pathways are crucial regulators of bone growth and development, and their dysregulation can lead to a spectrum of skeletal disorders. We examine recent advances in understanding how mutations in TGF-\u03b2 and BMP pathway components contribute to various forms of skeletal dysplasia, resulting in either stunted growth or excessive height. The review highlights key molecular mechanisms, including ligand-receptor interactions, intracellular signaling cascades, and transcriptional regulation, that underlie these growth abnormalities. Additionally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways for the treatment of skeletal dysplasias. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling in skeletal development and offers new perspectives for future research and clinical interventions.", "label": 1}
