{"grounding": "Genome sequencing is increasingly used in research and integrated into clinical care. In the research domain, large-scale analyses, including whole genome sequencing with variant interpretation and curation, virtually guarantee identification of variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic and actionable. Multiple guidelines recommend that findings associated with actionable conditions be offered to research participants in order to demonstrate respect for autonomy, reciprocity, and participant interests in health and privacy. Some recommendations go further and support offering a wider range of findings, including those that are not immediately actionable. In addition, entities covered by the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be required to provide a participant's raw genomic data on request. Despite these widely endorsed guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. This article analyzes the ethical and legal foundations for researcher duties to offer adult participants their interpreted results and raw data as the new normal in genomic research.", "generated_text": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing in genomic research has sparked a paradigm shift in the approach to returning results to study participants. This review explores the evolving landscape of result disclosure, addressing the ethical, legal, and practical challenges associated with communicating primary findings, secondary findings, and incidental discoveries. We examine current practices, guidelines, and policies surrounding the return of results, highlighting the tension between researchers' obligations and participants' rights to information. The paper discusses the complexities of interpreting and validating genomic data, the potential psychological impact on participants, and the resource implications for research institutions. Furthermore, we consider the emerging concept of a 'new normal' in genomic research, where comprehensive result disclosure becomes standard practice. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of informed consent processes, data management strategies, and the development of robust frameworks to support responsible and meaningful communication of genomic findings to research participants.", "label": 1}
