{"grounding": "Meats are rich in lipids and proteins, exposing them to rapid oxidative changes. Proteins are essential to the human diet, and changes in the structure and functional attributes can greatly influence the quality and nutritional value of meats. In this article, we review the molecular changes of proteins during processing, their impact on the nutritional value of fresh and processed meat, the digestibility and bioavailability of meat proteins, the risks associated with high meat intake, and the preventive strategies employed to mitigate these risks. This information provides new research directions to reduce or prevent oxidative processes that influence the quality and nutritional values of meat.", "generated_text": "This review examines the molecular changes occurring in meat proteins during various processing methods and their effects on quality and nutritional value. The study explores how thermal treatments, curing, fermentation, and other processing techniques alter protein structures and functionalities. These modifications can impact meat texture, flavor, and shelf-life, while also affecting digestibility and bioavailability of essential amino acids. The research highlights both positive and negative consequences of protein alterations, including potential health risks associated with certain processing methods. Understanding these molecular changes is crucial for optimizing meat processing techniques to enhance quality, maximize nutritional benefits, and minimize health concerns in processed meat products.", "label": 1}
