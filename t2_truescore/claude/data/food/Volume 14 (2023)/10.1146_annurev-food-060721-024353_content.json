{"grounding": "Lipids are a large group of essential nutrients in daily diets that provide energy and maintain various physiological functions. As the global population is rapidly expanding, there is an urgent need to enhance the production and quality of food lipids. The development of modern biotechnology allows the manipulation of oil production in plants and microorganisms and the improvement of the nutritional value of food lipids. Various metabolic engineering strategies have been exploited to increase oil production and produce value-added oils in traditional oil crops and other novel lipid sources (e.g., plant vegetative tissues, microalgae, and oleaginous microorganisms). Furthermore, natural lipid structures can be modified by lipases to prepare functional lipids, e.g., diacylglycerols, medium\u2013long\u2013medium-type structured triacylglycerols, human milk-fat substitutes, and structuralphospholipids, for specific nutritional demands. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in metabolic engineering of lipid production in plants and microorganisms, and the preparation of functional lipids via biocatalysis.", "generated_text": "The future of food lipids is poised for transformation through biotechnological advancements. This review explores the opportunities and challenges in utilizing microbial lipids and metabolic engineering to produce novel and sustainable lipid sources. We examine the potential of enzymatic modification techniques to create tailored structural lipids with enhanced nutritional and functional properties. The role of phospholipids in improving food quality and stability is also discussed. While these biotechnological approaches offer promising solutions to address global food security and nutrition challenges, several hurdles remain. These include scaling up production processes, ensuring cost-effectiveness, and addressing regulatory and consumer acceptance issues. Despite these challenges, the integration of biotechnology in food lipid production presents exciting possibilities for developing healthier, more sustainable, and functional food products. This review provides insights into the current state of research and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
