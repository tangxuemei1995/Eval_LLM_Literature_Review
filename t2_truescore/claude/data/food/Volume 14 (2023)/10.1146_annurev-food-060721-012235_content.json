{"grounding": "The in vitro digestion model developed by the INFOGEST international consortium is widely used to simulate the physicochemical processes occurring inside the human gastrointestinal tract (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) during the digestion of foods. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the INFOGEST method and the procedures used to measure the digestion of macronutrients (lipids, proteins, and starch), the bioaccessibility of bioactive agents (vitamins, minerals, and nutraceuticals), and the changes in the structure and physical properties of foods under gastrointestinal conditions (particle size, charge, and location). We then review the application of the INFOGEST method for monitoring the gastrointestinal fate of different kinds of foods and beverages, including dairy, egg, meat, seafood, fruit, vegetable, cereal, and emulsified products. We also discuss the application of this method for studying the digestibility of next-generation plant-based foods, such as meat, seafood, dairy, and egg analogs. Finally, the benefits and limitations of this standardized in vitro digestion model are assessed.", "generated_text": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has emerged as a valuable tool for simulating human gastrointestinal processes and evaluating food behavior during digestion. This review examines the applications of the INFOGEST model to various food systems, highlighting its utility in assessing nutrient bioavailability and bioaccessibility. We explore how the model has been employed to study the digestibility of macronutrients, release of bioactive compounds, and interactions between food components. The review also discusses the model's role in developing functional foods and nutraceuticals, as well as its potential for predicting the fate of food additives and contaminants. Furthermore, we address the limitations and challenges associated with the INFOGEST model, including the need for standardization and validation against in vivo data. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of the INFOGEST model in advancing our understanding of food digestion and its implications for human nutrition and health.", "label": 1}
