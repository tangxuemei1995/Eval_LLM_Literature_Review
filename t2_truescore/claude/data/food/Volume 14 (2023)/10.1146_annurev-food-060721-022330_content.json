{"grounding": "Mechano-bactericidal (MB) nanopatterns have the ability to inactivate bacterial cells by rupturing cellular envelopes. Such biocide-free, physicomechanical mechanisms may confer lasting biofilm mitigation capability to various materials encountered in food processing, packaging, and food preparation environments. In this review, we first discuss recent progress on elucidating MB mechanisms, unraveling property\u2013activity relationships, and developing cost-effective and scalable nanofabrication technologies. Next, we evaluate the potential challenges that MB surfaces may face in food-related applications and provide our perspective on the critical research needs and opportunities to facilitate their adoption in the food industry.", "generated_text": "Mechano-bactericidal surfaces have emerged as a promising solution for combating bacterial contamination in food processing and packaging. This review explores the mechanisms underlying the bactericidal properties of nanostructured surfaces and discusses various nanofabrication techniques used to create these surfaces. The potential applications of mechano-bactericidal surfaces in food-contact materials, processing equipment, and packaging are examined, highlighting their advantages over traditional antimicrobial approaches. Additionally, the challenges and future prospects for implementing these surfaces in the food industry are addressed, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize their performance and ensure their safety for food applications.", "label": 1}
