{"grounding": "Microbubbles are largely unused in the food industry yet have promising capabilities as environmentally friendly cleaning and supporting agents within products and production lines due to their unique physical behaviors. Their small diameters increase their dispersion throughout liquid materials, promote reactivity because of their high specific surface area, enhance dissolution of gases into the surrounding liquid phase, and promote the generation of reactive chemical species. This article reviews techniques to generate microbubbles, their modes of action to enhance cleaning and disinfection, their contributions to functional and mechanical properties of food materials, and their use in supporting the growth of living organisms in hydroponics or bioreactors. The utility and diverse applications of microbubbles, combined with their low intrinsic ingredient cost, strongly encourage their increased adoption within the food industry in coming years.", "generated_text": "Microbubbles are emerging as a promising technology in the food industry, offering innovative solutions to address sustainability, food safety, and food security challenges. This review explores the applications of microbubbles in various aspects of food technology, including processing, preservation, and packaging. The unique properties of microbubbles, such as their high surface area-to-volume ratio and ability to generate localized physical and chemical effects, make them valuable tools for enhancing food quality and extending shelf life. Furthermore, microbubbles show potential in developing novel foods with improved nutritional profiles and sensory attributes. This paper examines recent advancements in microbubble technology, its impact on food production efficiency, and its role in promoting sustainable practices within the food industry. The integration of microbubbles in food technology presents opportunities for addressing global food security concerns while ensuring product safety and quality.", "label": 1}
