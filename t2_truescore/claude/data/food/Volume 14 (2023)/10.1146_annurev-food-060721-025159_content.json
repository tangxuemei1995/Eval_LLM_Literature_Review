{"grounding": "Edible nanoparticles are being developed for the oral delivery of nutrients to improve human health and well-being. Because of the extremely demanding conditions foods experience within the gastrointestinal tract, fundamental knowledge about the biological fate of encapsulated nutrients must be constantly revised. In this review, we first provide an overview of the fundamental absorption pathways of ingested foods and then discuss the evaluation models available to test and predict the biological fate of nutrient-loaded nanoparticles. Then, owing to their importance for human health, the impacts of nanoparticles on the gut microbiota are evaluated. Lastly, the limitations of current evaluation methods are highlighted and future research directions on the study and application of edible nanoparticles for the oral delivery of bioactive food compounds are discussed.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive review explores the emerging field of nanoparticles for oral delivery in food, focusing on their biological fate, evaluation models, and interactions with gut microbiota. The study examines various types of nanoparticles used in food nanotechnology and their potential applications in enhancing nutrient delivery and bioavailability. It critically analyzes existing evaluation models for assessing the safety and efficacy of these nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the review investigates the complex interplay between nanoparticles and gut microbiota, highlighting potential impacts on microbial composition and function. By synthesizing current research and identifying knowledge gaps, this review provides valuable insights for future developments in food nanotechnology and its implications for human health and nutrition.", "label": 1}
