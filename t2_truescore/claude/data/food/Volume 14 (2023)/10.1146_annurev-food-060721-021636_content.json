{"grounding": "It is important to have larger proportions of health-beneficial polyunsaturated lipids in foods, but these nutrients are particularly sensitive to oxidation, and dedicated strategies must be developed to prevent this deleterious reaction. In food oil-in-water emulsions, the oil\u2013water interface is a crucial area when it comes to the initiation of lipid oxidation. Unfortunately, most available natural antioxidants, such as phenolic antioxidants, do not spontaneously position at this specific locus. Achieving such a strategic positioning has therefore been an active research area, and various routes have been proposed: lipophilizing phenolic acids to confer them with an amphiphilic character; functionalizing biopolymer emulsifiers through covalent or noncovalent interactions with phenolics; or loading Pickering particles with natural phenolic compounds to yield interfacial antioxidant reservoirs. We herein review the principles and efficiency of these approaches to counteract lipid oxidation in emulsions as well as their advantages and limitations.", "generated_text": "This review explores strategies for targeting the interfacial location of phenolic antioxidants in emulsions to enhance their effectiveness in preventing lipid oxidation. The oil-water interface is a critical site for oxidation reactions in emulsion systems, making it an ideal target for antioxidant placement. We discuss various approaches to achieve interfacial localization, including the use of phenolipids and the creation of antioxidant reservoirs. The benefits of these strategies are examined, highlighting improved oxidative stability and extended shelf life of emulsion-based products. Additionally, we analyze the impact of antioxidant structure, emulsion composition, and environmental factors on interfacial behavior. This review provides insights into the design of more efficient antioxidant systems for emulsions, with potential applications in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Future research directions and challenges in optimizing interfacial antioxidant performance are also addressed.", "label": 1}
