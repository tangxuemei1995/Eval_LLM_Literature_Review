{"grounding": "Food proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols are natural ingredients with different functional attributes. For instance, many proteins are good emulsifiers and gelling agents, many polysaccharides are good thickening and stabilizing agents, and many polyphenols are good antioxidants and antimicrobials. These three kinds of ingredients can be combined into protein, polysaccharide, and/or polyphenol conjugates or complexes using covalent or noncovalent interactions to create novel multifunctional colloidal ingredients with new or improved properties. In this review, the formation, functionality, and potential applications of protein conjugates and complexes are discussed. In particular, the utilization of these colloidal ingredients to stabilize emulsions, control lipid digestion, encapsulate bioactive ingredients, modify textures, and form films is highlighted. Finally, future research needs in this area are briefly proposed. The rational design of protein complexes and conjugates may lead to the development of new functional ingredients that can be used to create more nutritious, sustainable, and healthy foods.", "generated_text": "This review explores the emerging field of novel colloidal food ingredients, focusing on protein complexes and conjugates. The interactions between proteins and polysaccharides or polyphenols are examined, highlighting their potential to create innovative functional ingredients. These complexes and conjugates offer enhanced stability, improved emulsification properties, and increased bioavailability of bioactive compounds. The review discusses various methods of forming these colloidal structures, including electrostatic interactions, covalent bonding, and Maillard reactions. The impact of these novel ingredients on food texture, flavor, and nutritional value is evaluated. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities in scaling up production and incorporating these ingredients into food systems are addressed. This research provides valuable insights for food scientists and manufacturers seeking to develop healthier, more functional food products using advanced colloidal ingredients.", "label": 1}
