{"grounding": "Microgreens are edible young plants that have recently attracted interest because of their color and flavor diversity, phytonutrient abundance, short growth cycle, and minimal space and nutrient requirements. They can be cultivated in a variety of systems from simple home gardens to sophisticated vertical farms with automated irrigation, fertilizer delivery, and lighting controls. Microgreens have also attracted attention from space agencies hoping that their sensory qualities can contribute to the diet of astronauts in microgravity and their cultivation might help maintain crew physical and psychological health on long-duration spaceflight missions. However, many technical challenges and data gaps for growing microgreensboth on and off Earth remain unaddressed. This review summarizes recent studies on multiple aspects of microgreens, including nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, cultivation systems, operative conditions, innovative treatments, autonomous facilities, and potential space applications. It also provides the authors\u2019 perspectives on the challenges to stimulating more extensive interdisciplinary research.", "generated_text": "Microgreens have gained significant attention in recent years due to their high nutritional value and potential applications in various farming contexts. This comprehensive review explores the latest developments in microgreen cultivation for home, commercial, and space farming applications. We examine the nutritional profiles of different microgreen varieties and their potential contributions to food security. The paper also discusses advancements in microgreen production systems, including hydroponic and aeroponic techniques, as well as the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for optimized growth monitoring and management. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of microgreens in space farming, addressing challenges and opportunities for sustainable food production in extraterrestrial environments. This update provides valuable insights for researchers, farmers, and policymakers interested in leveraging microgreens to enhance nutrition, food security, and sustainable agriculture across diverse settings.", "label": 1}
