{"grounding": "Ferritins represent a class of iron storage proteins with detoxification functions. The importance of these proteins is reflected by their wide distribution throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. Ferritin has two forms: holo and apo. Holo ferritin can act as an efficient and safe factor for iron supplementation, whereas apo ferritin is able to serve as a promising delivery nanovehicle for nutrients and bioactive compounds. So far, the dual functions of ferritins from animal and plant sources have been extensively studied in several fields, such as food, nutrition, medicine, and materials. This review outlines the structure of animal and plant ferritin, the iron supplementation function of holo ferritin, and the delivery function of apo ferritin. Recent advances in iron supplementation and nutrient encapsulation and delivery are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future developments for multifunctional applications of ferritins are discussed.", "generated_text": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous protein found in both animals and plants, exhibits a remarkable dual functionality that has garnered significant attention in recent research. This study explores the distinct roles of ferritin's holo and apo forms, focusing on their potential applications in iron supplementation and drug delivery systems, respectively. The holo form of ferritin, with its iron-rich core, demonstrates promising capabilities as an efficient and bioavailable source of iron supplementation, addressing widespread iron deficiency issues. Conversely, the apo form of ferritin, devoid of iron, presents a unique opportunity for developing targeted drug delivery systems due to its hollow cage-like structure. This review synthesizes current findings on ferritin's dual nature, highlighting its potential to revolutionize both nutritional interventions and pharmaceutical delivery strategies, while also discussing challenges and future directions in harnessing these properties for practical applications.", "label": 1}
