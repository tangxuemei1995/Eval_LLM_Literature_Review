{"grounding": "Despite the almost universal acceptance of the phrase \u201cyou are what you eat,\u201d investment in understanding diet-based nutrition to address human health has been dwarfed compared to that for medicine-based interventions. Moreover, traditional breeding has focused on yield to the detriment of nutritional quality, meaning that although caloric content has remained high, the incidence of nutritional deficiencies and accompanying diseases (so-called hidden hunger) has risen dramatically. We review how genome sequencing coupled with metabolomics can facilitate the screening of genebank collections in the search for superior alleles related to the nutritional quality of crops. We argue that the first examples are very promising, suggesting that this approach could benefit broader ranges of crops and compounds with known relevance for human health. We argue that this represents anapproach complementary to metabolic engineering by transgenesis or gene editing that could be used to reverse some of the losses incurred through a recent focus on breeding for yield, although we caution that ensuring such approaches are not (re)introducing antinutrients is also necessary.", "generated_text": "Genebank collections represent a vast repository of plant genetic diversity, yet their potential as a source of health-promoting phytonutrients remains largely unexplored. This review examines the untapped potential of genebank collections in identifying metabolic signatures that could benefit human health. By leveraging natural variance within these collections and employing advanced plant metabolomics techniques, researchers can uncover novel phytonutrients and their associated health benefits. We discuss how integrating genomic, metabolomic, and nutritional data from diverse plant accessions can lead to the discovery of new bioactive compounds and inform crop improvement strategies. Furthermore, we explore the challenges and opportunities in translating these findings into practical applications for enhancing human nutrition and health. This approach not only maximizes the value of existing genebank resources but also opens new avenues for addressing global health challenges through targeted exploitation of plant metabolic diversity.", "label": 1}
