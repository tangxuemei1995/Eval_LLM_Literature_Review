{"grounding": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a bioactive phytochemical abundant in cruciferous vegetables. One of its main in vivo metabolites is 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM), formed by the condensation of two molecules of I3C. Both I3C and DIM alter multiple signaling pathways and related molecules controlling diverse cellular events, including oxidation, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity. There is a growing body of evidence from both in vitro and in vivo models that these compounds possess strong potential to prevent several forms of chronic disease such as inflammation, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, neurodegenerative diseases, and osteoporosis. This article reviews current knowledge of the occurrence of I3C in nature and foods, along with the beneficial effects of I3C and DIM concerning prevention and treatment of human chronic diseases, focusing on preclinical studies and their mechanisms of action at cellular and molecular levels.", "generated_text": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables, has garnered significant attention for its potential health benefits. This review explores the occurrence of I3C in various food sources and its conversion to the bioactive metabolite 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM). We examine the growing body of evidence supporting I3C's role in cancer prevention, immune modulation, and hormonal balance. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed, including I3C's ability to modulate key signaling pathways, influence gene expression, and regulate cell cycle progression. Additionally, we evaluate the bioavailability and safety of I3C supplementation, highlighting potential therapeutic applications. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the multifaceted health-promoting properties of I3C and its metabolites, emphasizing the importance of further research to fully elucidate its potential in disease prevention and treatment.", "label": 1}
