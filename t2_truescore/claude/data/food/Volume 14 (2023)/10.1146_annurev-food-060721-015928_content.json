{"grounding": "Bacteriophages (or phages) represent one of the most persistent threats to food fermentations, particularly large-scale commercial dairy fermentations. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are used as starter cultures in dairy fermentations are well studied, and in recent years there have been significant advances in defining the driving forces of LAB\u2013phage coevolution. The means by which different starter bacterial species defend themselves against phage predation and the chromosomal or plasmid location of the genes encoding these defense mechanisms have dictated the technological approaches for the development of robust starter cultures. In this review, we highlight recent advances in defining phage\u2013host interactions and how phage resistance occurs in different bacterial species. Furthermore, we discuss how these insights continue to transform the dairy fermentation industry and how they also are anticipated to guide food fermentations involving plant-based alternatives in the future.", "generated_text": "Bacteriophages have long been a significant challenge in the dairy industry, particularly in cheese and yogurt production. This review examines recent advances in understanding phage-host interactions and the development of phage resistance strategies in lactic acid bacteria used in food fermentations. We discuss the evolution of phage defense mechanisms, including CRISPR-Cas systems and cell surface modifications, and their impact on bacterial survival in dairy environments. The role of conjugation in horizontal gene transfer of phage resistance traits is explored, highlighting its potential for improving starter culture robustness. While considerable progress has been made in mitigating phage-related issues, we argue that complete eradication remains elusive. Instead, a holistic approach combining improved starter culture design, process optimization, and phage monitoring is proposed as the most effective strategy for managing bacteriophages in dairy fermentations.", "label": 1}
