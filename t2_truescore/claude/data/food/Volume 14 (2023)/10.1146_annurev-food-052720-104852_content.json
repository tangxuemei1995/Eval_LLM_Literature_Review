{"grounding": "In contrast to traditional breeding, which relies on the identification of mutants, metabolic engineering provides a new platform to modify the oil composition in oil crops for improved nutrition. By altering endogenous genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways, it is possible to modify edible plant oils to increase the content of desired components or reduce the content of undesirable components. However, introduction of novel nutritional components such as omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids needs transgenic expression of novel genes in crops. Despite formidable challenges, significant progress in engineering nutritionally improved edible plant oils has recently been achieved, with some commercial products now on the market.", "generated_text": "This review explores recent advancements in metabolic engineering of edible plant oils to enhance their nutritional value. We discuss strategies for developing high oleic acid content, increasing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), and enriching plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E in seed oils. The application of gene editing techniques, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has revolutionized the field, enabling precise modifications of key metabolic pathways. We highlight successful examples of engineered oilseed crops with improved nutritional profiles and address challenges in commercialization and consumer acceptance. The potential impact of these innovations on human health and sustainable agriculture is also examined, emphasizing the importance of continued research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 0}
