{"grounding": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides are of particular interest in recent years because of their unique prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. Among different types of strategies for the production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, enzymatic methods are preferred owing to the predictability and controllability of the structure and composition of the reaction products. Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have been proved to show excellent prebiotic effects as well as other benefits to intestinal health. They have exhibited great application potential as functional food ingredients for various food products with improved quality and physicochemical characteristics. This article reviews the research progress on the enzymatic production of several typical nondigestible functional oligosaccharides in the food industry, including galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, chito-oligosaccharides, and human milk oligosaccharides. Moreover, their physicochemical properties and prebiotic activities are discussed as well as their contributions to intestinal health and applications in foods.", "generated_text": "This review explores the enzymatic production and food applications of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides for promoting intestinal health. These prebiotic compounds, resistant to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, serve as selective substrates for beneficial gut microbiota. We discuss various enzymatic methods for synthesizing functional oligosaccharides, including transgalactosylation, transglycosylation, and hydrolysis reactions. The prebiotic effects of these compounds on gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acid production, and immune modulation are examined. Additionally, we highlight the incorporation of functional oligosaccharides in diverse food products, such as dairy, bakery, and beverages, to enhance their nutritional value and health benefits. The review also addresses challenges in large-scale production, stability during food processing, and regulatory considerations. Overall, this comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of functional oligosaccharides as valuable ingredients for improving intestinal health through dietary interventions.", "label": 1}
