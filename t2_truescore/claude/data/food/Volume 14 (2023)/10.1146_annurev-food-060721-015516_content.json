{"grounding": "Inadequate dietary fiber consumption has become common across industrialized nations, accompanied by changes in gut microbial composition and a dramatic increase in chronic metabolic diseases. The human gut microbiome harbors genes that are required for the digestion of fiber, resulting in the production of end products that mediate gastrointestinal and systemic benefits to the host. Thus, the use of fiber interventions has attracted increasing interest as a strategy to modulate the gut microbiome and improve human health. However, considerable interindividual differences in gut microbial composition have resulted in variable responses toward fiber interventions. This variability has led to observed nonresponder individuals and highlights the need for personalized approaches to effectively redirect the gut ecosystem. In this review, we summarize strategies used to address the responder and nonresponder phenomenon in dietary fiber interventions and propose a targeted approach to identify predictive features based on knowledge of fiber metabolism and machine learning approaches.", "generated_text": "Dietary fiber interventions have shown promise in modulating the gut microbiome and improving health outcomes. However, individual responses to these interventions vary significantly, highlighting the need for personalized approaches. This review explores the potential of predicting personalized responses to dietary fiber interventions by leveraging advanced technologies and understanding the complex interactions between diet, gut microbiome, and host metabolism. We discuss the role of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in fiber metabolism and their potential as biomarkers for personalized nutrition strategies. The review also examines the opportunities for precision nutrition in tailoring dietary fiber interventions to individual microbiome profiles and metabolic responses. By integrating multi-omics data, machine learning algorithms, and mechanistic insights into fiber-microbiome interactions, we propose a framework for developing personalized prebiotic interventions that optimize health outcomes and address the challenges of inter-individual variability in dietary responses.", "label": 1}
