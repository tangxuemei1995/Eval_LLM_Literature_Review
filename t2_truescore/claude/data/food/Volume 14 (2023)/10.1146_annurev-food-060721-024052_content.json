{"grounding": "With the rising problems of food shortages, energy costs, and raw materials, the food industry must reduce its environmental impact. We present an overview of more resource-efficient processes to produce food ingredients, describing their environmental impact and the functional properties obtained. Extensive wet processing yields high purities but also has the highest environmental impact, mainly due to heating for protein precipitation and dehydration. Milder wet alternatives exclude, for example, low pH\u2013driven separation and are based on salt precipitation or water only. Drying steps are omitted during dry fractionation using air classification or electrostatic separation. Benefits of milder methods are enhanced functional properties. Therefore, fractionation and formulation should be focused on the desired functionality instead of purity. Environmental impact is also strongly reduced by milder refining. Antinutritional factors and off-flavors remain challenges in more mildly produced ingredients. The benefits of less refining motivate the increasing trend toward mildly refined ingredients.", "generated_text": "This study explores the potential of mild fractionation techniques for producing sustainable food ingredients from plant sources. We investigate dry fractionation and mild wet separation methods to extract plant proteins while maintaining their functionality and minimizing resource use. The research compares these approaches to conventional protein isolation processes, focusing on their impact on protein yield, quality, and environmental footprint. Results demonstrate that mild fractionation techniques can effectively separate protein-rich fractions while preserving native protein structures and functional properties. Moreover, these methods significantly reduce water and energy consumption compared to traditional extraction processes. The study also examines the applicability of mildly fractionated ingredients in various food products, highlighting their potential to meet growing consumer demand for sustainable plant-based alternatives. Our findings suggest that mild fractionation offers a promising pathway for developing more environmentally friendly and functionally superior plant protein ingredients for the food industry.", "label": 0}
