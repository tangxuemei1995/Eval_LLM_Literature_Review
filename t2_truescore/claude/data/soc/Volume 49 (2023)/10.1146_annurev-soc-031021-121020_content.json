{"grounding": "Age as an individual characteristic is ubiquitous in social science research because it has important associations with numerous outcomes of interest. Yet age is rarely treated as a phenomenon that requires explanation or theoretical attention. To advance research in sociology and beyond, we bring together previously siloed literatures on the conceptualization and measurement of age. Our framework presents age as a system of inequality that can be understood through concepts and processes that operate at multiple levels of analysis. At the individual level, we argue age is best conceptualized and operationalized as multidimensional. We review a range of measures, from birth cohort to physical appearance, that can be fruitfully combined in empirical research to account for this complexity. The multidimensionality of age also highlights how it is \u201cdone\u201d in interactions, connecting the social construction of age to the intersectional production of inequality.", "generated_text": "This study examines the social construction of age and its implications for conceptualization and measurement in social research. Drawing on theories of aging, life course, and intersectionality, we explore how age is understood and operationalized across various disciplines. Our analysis reveals that age is not merely a chronological marker but a complex social construct influenced by cultural, historical, and individual factors. We argue that current methodological approaches often fail to capture the multidimensional nature of age, leading to potential biases in research outcomes. By integrating perspectives from stratification and demography, we propose a more nuanced framework for measuring age that accounts for its intersections with other social categories. This approach has significant implications for understanding age-related inequalities and developing more accurate research designs in fields such as sociology, psychology, and public health.", "label": 1}
