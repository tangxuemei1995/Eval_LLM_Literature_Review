{"grounding": "This article reviews recent advances in causal inference relevant to sociology. We focus on a selective subset of contributions aligning with four broad topics: causal effect identification and estimation in general, causal effect heterogeneity, causal effect mediation, and temporal and spatial interference. We describe how machine learning, as an estimation strategy, can be effectively combined with causal inference, which has been traditionally concerned with identification. The incorporation of machine learning in causal inference enables researchers to better address potential biases in estimating causal effects and uncover heterogeneous causal effects. Uncovering sources of effect heterogeneity is key for generalizing to populations beyond those under study. While sociology has long emphasized the importance of causal mechanisms, historical and life-cycle variation, and social contexts involving network interactions, recent conceptual and computational advances facilitate more principled estimation of causal effects under these settings. We encourage sociologists to incorporate these insights into their empirical research.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews recent advancements in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning. We explore how machine learning techniques are being leveraged to address key challenges in causal inference, including the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects, mediation analysis, and the extrapolation of causal effects across different populations. The integration of these fields has led to novel approaches for handling high-dimensional data, uncovering complex causal structures, and improving the external validity of causal estimates. We discuss the theoretical foundations of these methods, their practical implementations, and their applications in various domains such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. Additionally, we highlight ongoing challenges and future research directions, including the development of more robust methods for causal discovery in non-experimental settings and the incorporation of causal reasoning into artificial intelligence systems. This review aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the current state and potential future trajectories of this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
