{"grounding": "Robust literatures separately estimate school effects and neighborhood effects on children's educational, economic, health, and other outcomes that measure well-being. A growing body of research acknowledges that both contexts matter and considers neighborhoods and schools jointly. In this review, we synthesize the array of results that emerge from these studies and critique the tendency for researchers to evaluate which matters more, neighborhoods versus schools. We propose a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes. We argue that contextual effects research would be enriched by considering local neighborhood\u2013school structures: the ways that families choose neighborhoods and schools and that neighborhoods and schools mutually and cyclically constitute one another. We conclude with recommendations for bringing neighborhood\u2013school structures to bear on both outcomes-oriented studies of neighborhood and school effects as well as studies of contextual selection and segregation.", "generated_text": "This study introduces a novel approach to examining the interplay between neighborhood and school contexts in shaping social outcomes. By conceptualizing neighborhood-school structures as interconnected systems, we move beyond traditional methods that treat these contexts separately. Using data from a large urban area, we employ network analysis techniques to map the complex relationships between residential patterns and school attendance boundaries. Our findings reveal distinct neighborhood-school structures that vary in their levels of segregation, resource distribution, and social connectivity. These structures are associated with differential outcomes in academic achievement, social mobility, and community cohesion. The results highlight the importance of considering the joint effects of neighborhoods and schools in understanding social inequality and designing effective interventions. This approach offers new insights for policymakers and researchers seeking to address educational disparities and promote social equity in urban environments.", "label": 0}
