{"grounding": "I got hooked on sociology as a 20-year-old. Engaging with the world as a sociologist, together with colleagues, comrades, and students, has been immensely rewarding for six decades. My work has centered primarily on what were once called developing countries and now comprise the Global South. This article recounts my sociological adventures, from efforts to understand the world as I found it in the early 1960s to my responses to current reactionary trends. I start with my earlier work\u2014Dependent Development (1979) and Embedded Autonomy (1995)\u2014and then move to more recent efforts to construct paradigms of progressive twenty-first-century possibilities. I discuss, first, how a 21st century developmental state might incorporate deliberation and state-society synergies to expand human capabilities, and second, how an amalgam of global and national labor movements together with transnational advocacy networks might pursue a counter-hegemonic globalization capable of confronting global neoliberal capitalism.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical reflection traces a 60-year intellectual journey through the field of comparative political economy. Beginning with the concept of embedded autonomy, which explored the synergistic relationship between state and society in fostering economic development, the narrative evolves to encompass broader themes of dependent development and the role of developmental states. The author's research trajectory then shifts towards examining counter-hegemonic globalization and transnational advocacy networks, highlighting the dynamic interplay between local and global forces in shaping economic and political outcomes. Throughout this academic odyssey, the author's work has consistently challenged conventional wisdom, offering nuanced perspectives on state-society relations, development strategies, and global power dynamics. This retrospective not only provides insights into the author's scholarly contributions but also illuminates the evolving landscape of comparative political economy over the past six decades.", "label": 1}
