{"grounding": "This article considers the large range of empirical research that has emerged under the broad aegis of ethnomethodology, in the period between the publication of Studies in Ethnomethodology (1967) and the present day. Starting with a brief overview of Garfinkel's intellectual career, we discuss the relation of ethnomethodology to Sch\u00fctz's phenomenology, Parsons's systems theory, and Weber's concern with meaning construction. A central concern was with the problem of contextuality, which Garfinkel initially addressed by drawing on, while fashioning in his own way, Mannheim's concern with the documentary method of interpretation. Ethnomethodologically-related studies have proliferated in a variety of domains, including conversation analysis, membership categorization analysis, and (related to Garfinkel's own early work) empirical initiatives in the study of everyday life involving racial, gender and other minoritized groups. Further ethnomethodological studies emerged from legal environments, from social problems and deviance, and in relation to ability differences. Still other investigations concerned instructed action and its ramifications for the sciences, technology and organizations, including the workplace. A longstanding concern for ethnomethodology has been with the conduct of social sciences\u2014how coding is done, how surveys are conducted, and how standardization is achieved. Many of these areas have given rise to thriving subfields, have dedicated journals, and resulted in applications. Few initiatives in sociological theory have resulted in a wider range of innovative research than Garfinkel's and successor studies showing, explicating, and demonstrating the organization of details in social life and their consequences for social order.", "generated_text": "Ethnomethodology, a sociological approach pioneered by Harold Garfinkel in the 1960s, has left an indelible mark on social sciences and continues to influence contemporary research. This paper examines the enduring legacies of ethnomethodology and explores its future prospects across various domains. We trace the development of ethnomethodology's core principles, including the focus on everyday practices, the emphasis on members' methods, and the commitment to naturalistic observation. The paper highlights how ethnomethodology has shaped related fields such as conversation analysis, studies of science, and workplace studies. We analyze its contributions to understanding social order, interaction, and the production of knowledge in organizational settings. The concept of instructed action and the role of rules in shaping social behavior are critically examined, revealing ethnomethodology's unique insights into the constitution of social reality. Despite facing critiques and challenges, ethnomethodology has demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability. The paper argues that its future lies in its capacity to engage with emerging technologies, evolving social practices, and interdisciplinary collaborations. We conclude by proposing new directions for ethnomethodological research, emphasizing its potential to illuminate contemporary social phenomena and contribute to theoretical debates in sociology and beyond.", "label": 1}
