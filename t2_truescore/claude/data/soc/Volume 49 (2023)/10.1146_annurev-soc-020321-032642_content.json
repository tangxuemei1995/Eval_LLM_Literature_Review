{"grounding": "Research on diverging destinies provides a compelling and influential framework for understanding relationships between socioeconomic bifurcation in family behavior and inequality within and across generations. Articulations of the diverging destinies framework stress its broad relevance for low-fertility societies, but empirical evaluations in East Asia are limited. We address this gap by summarizing and synthesizing scholarship on socioeconomic differentials in family behavior and relationships between family circumstances and children's well-being in mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. We seek an understanding of how and why the diverging destinies framework is or is not helpful for understanding family change and inequality in societies characterized by a highly asymmetric gender division of labor, strong emphasis on family investment in children, and limited public support for families. This article provides a contextual and empirical basis upon which to build subsequent research on family change and inequality in East Asia.", "generated_text": "This study examines the concept of 'diverging destinies' in the context of East Asian societies, focusing on how family dynamics, children's outcomes, and gender roles intersect with growing inequality. Drawing on extensive demographic data and sociological research from Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan, we analyze trends in family formation, parental investment, and intergenerational mobility. Our findings reveal that while East Asian countries share some similarities with Western nations in terms of educational disparities and delayed marriage, unique cultural and policy contexts shape distinct patterns of divergence. We observe that gender norms, work-family balance policies, and rapid economic development contribute to widening gaps in children's life chances across socioeconomic strata. This research contributes to the broader understanding of how global trends in inequality manifest in East Asian family structures and suggests policy implications for addressing these emerging disparities.", "label": 1}
