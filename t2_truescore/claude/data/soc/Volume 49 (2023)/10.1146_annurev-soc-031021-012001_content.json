{"grounding": "Social isolation is a potent predictor of poor health, mortality, and dementia risk. A great deal of research across national contexts provides causal evidence for these linkages and identifies key explanatory mechanisms through which isolation affects health. Research on social isolation recognizes that some people are more likely than others to be isolated, but over the past several decades, researchers have focused primarily on the consequences of isolation for health rather than a systematic assessment of the social conditions that foster isolation over the life course. In this article, we review the available evidence on inequities in social isolation and develop a conceptual framework to guide future research on structural systems that fuel social isolation over the life course. Future work in this area has the potential to identify root causes of inequality in social isolation, as well as targeted policy levers to reduce isolation in vulnerable populations.", "generated_text": "Social isolation has emerged as a significant public health concern, with far-reaching consequences for individual and community well-being. This review examines the unequal distribution of social isolation across various demographic groups, considering factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. By adopting a life course perspective, we explore how social isolation manifests and evolves throughout different stages of life. Our analysis reveals stark disparities in the prevalence and impact of social isolation, with marginalized populations often bearing a disproportionate burden. We discuss the complex interplay between social determinants of health and isolation, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and policies. This comprehensive examination of social isolation as an unequally distributed health hazard underscores the importance of addressing this issue through an intersectional lens to promote health equity and social justice.", "label": 1}
