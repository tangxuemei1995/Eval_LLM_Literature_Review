{"grounding": "The global dimensions of diasporic politics and state response have generated a large, interdisciplinary literature. Yet, scholars struggle to find the most productive conceptual tools, as one literature, at point of origin, studies emigration and the other, at point of destination, studies immigration. The transnational turn in the social sciences four decades ago propelled scholars to study cross-border political mobilization by viewing immigration and emigration as two sides of the same coin. This article provides a guide to this scholarship. We show how the political nature of cross-border movements creates and circumscribes conditions for diasporic political mobilization. We then identify the different types of cross-border political activities and the modalities of corresponding home state policies. We conclude by reflecting how the world today has changed since the geopolitical moment in which the transnational turn was born and what these changes mean for studying immigrant and emigrant cross-border politics.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex dynamics of cross-border politics, focusing on diasporic mobilization and state responses in an increasingly interconnected world. Drawing on theories of transnationalism and geopolitics, we analyze how diasporic communities engage in homeland politics and influence international relations. The research explores the multifaceted nature of emigrant political activities, ranging from grassroots movements to formal diplomatic channels. We investigate how nation-states adapt their policies to address the challenges and opportunities presented by politically active diasporas. Through case studies and comparative analysis, this study reveals the intricate interplay between diaspora groups, home countries, and host nations. The findings highlight the significant role of nationalism in shaping diasporic identities and political engagement. This research contributes to our understanding of the evolving nature of citizenship, sovereignty, and political participation in a globalized context.", "label": 1}
