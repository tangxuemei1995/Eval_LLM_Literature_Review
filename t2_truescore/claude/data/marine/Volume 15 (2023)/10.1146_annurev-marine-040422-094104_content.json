{"grounding": "Lipids are structurally diverse biomolecules that serve multiple roles in cells. As such, they are used as biomarkers in the modern ocean and as paleoproxies to explore the geological past. Here, I review lipid geochemistry, biosynthesis, and compartmentalization; the varied uses of lipids as biomarkers; and the evolution of analytical techniques used to measure and characterize lipids. Advancements in high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry have revolutionized the lipidomic and metabolomic fields, both of which are quickly being integrated into marine meta-omic studies. Lipidomics allows us to analyze tens of thousands of features, providing an open analytical window and the ability to quantify unknown compounds that can be structurally elucidated later. However, lipidome annotation is not a trivial matter and represents one of the biggest challenges for oceanographers, owing in part to the lack of marine lipids in current in silico databases and data repositories. A case study reveals the gaps in our knowledge and open opportunities to answer fundamental questions about molecular-level control of chemical reactions and global-scale patterns in the lipidscape.", "generated_text": "Lipid biogeochemistry plays a crucial role in understanding marine ecosystems and global carbon cycling. This review explores the intersection of lipid geochemistry and modern lipidomic techniques in the context of microbial oceanography. Recent advancements in high-resolution mass spectrometry and chromatography have revolutionized our ability to characterize complex lipid mixtures in marine environments. These lipidomic approaches, combined with meta-omic techniques, provide unprecedented insights into microbial community structure, function, and adaptation to environmental stressors. We discuss the application of these methods to elucidate the sources, transformations, and fates of lipids in the ocean, as well as their potential as biomarkers for past and present oceanic conditions. Furthermore, we highlight the integration of lipidomics with other -omics approaches to create a more comprehensive understanding of marine biogeochemical processes. This review emphasizes the importance of lipid biogeochemistry in addressing key questions in microbial oceanography and its potential to unravel the complexities of ocean-climate interactions.", "label": 1}
