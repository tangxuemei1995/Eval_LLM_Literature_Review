{"grounding": "Nitrogen is a major limiting element for biological productivity, and thus understanding past variations in nitrogen cycling is central to understanding past and future ocean biogeochemical cycling, global climate cycles, and biodiversity. Organic nitrogen encapsulated in fossil biominerals is generally protected from alteration, making it an important archive of the marine nitrogen cycle on seasonal to million-year timescales. The isotopic composition of fossil-bound nitrogen reflects variations in the large-scale nitrogen inventory, local sources and processing, and ecological and physiological traits of organisms. The ability to measure trace amounts of fossil-bound nitrogen has expanded with recent method developments. In this article, we review the foundations and ground truthing for three important fossil-bound proxy types: diatoms, foraminifera, and corals. We highlight their utility with examples of high-resolution evidence for anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen to the oceans, glacial\u2013interglacial-scale assessments of nitrogen inventory change, and evidence for enhanced CO2 drawdown in the high-latitude ocean. Future directions include expanded method development, characterization of ecological and physiological variation, and exploration of extended timescales to push reconstructions further back in Earth's history.", "generated_text": "This study explores the use of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes in diatoms, foraminifera, and corals as valuable proxies for reconstructing past oceanic conditions and biogeochemical cycles. We review recent advancements in analytical techniques that have enabled the extraction and measurement of nitrogen isotopes from biominerals, providing insights into nutrient dynamics and nitrogen cycling over geological timescales. Our analysis reveals that diatom-bound nitrogen isotopes offer a robust record of surface ocean nitrate utilization, while foraminiferal-bound nitrogen isotopes reflect changes in the marine nitrogen cycle and water column denitrification. Coral-bound nitrogen isotopes provide information on both local and basin-wide nitrogen sources and cycling. By comparing these proxies across different marine environments and time periods, we demonstrate their complementary nature in reconstructing past oceanic conditions. This research highlights the potential of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes as powerful tools for understanding long-term changes in marine ecosystems, nutrient availability, and global biogeochemical cycles, with implications for predicting future ocean responses to climate change.", "label": 1}
