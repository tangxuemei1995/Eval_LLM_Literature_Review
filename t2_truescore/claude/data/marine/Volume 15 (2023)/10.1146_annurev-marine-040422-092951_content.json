{"grounding": "Tidal marshes and mangroves are increasingly valued for nature-based mitigation of coastal storm impacts, such as flooding and shoreline erosion hazards, which are growing due to global change. As this review highlights, however, hazard mitigation by tidal wetlands is limited to certain conditions, and not all hazards are equally reduced. Tidal wetlands are effective in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves, but long-period storm surges, which elevate sea levels up to several meters for up to more than a day, are attenuated less effectively, or in some cases not at all, depending on storm conditions, wetland properties, and larger-scale coastal landscape geometry. Wetlands often limit erosion, but storm damage to vegetation (especially mangrove trees) can be substantial, and recovery may take several years. Longer-term wetland persistence can be compromised when combined with other stressors, such as climate change and human disturbances. Due to these uncertainties, nature-based coastal defense projects need to adopt adaptive management strategies.", "generated_text": "Coastal wetlands, including marshes and mangroves, are increasingly recognized as valuable nature-based solutions for storm protection. This review synthesizes recent research on the effectiveness of tidal wetlands in buffering against cyclones, hurricanes, and flooding events. Studies demonstrate that these ecosystems can significantly attenuate wave energy, reduce storm surge heights, and mitigate coastal erosion. The protective capacity of wetlands varies based on factors such as vegetation structure, topography, and storm characteristics. Mangroves, with their complex root systems and dense canopies, show particular promise in tropical and subtropical regions. However, the benefits of wetlands extend beyond storm protection, encompassing carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and water quality improvement. As coastal communities face increasing threats from climate change and sea-level rise, integrating wetland conservation and restoration into coastal engineering strategies offers a sustainable and cost-effective approach to enhancing resilience and protecting vulnerable shorelines.", "label": 1}
