{"grounding": "To thrive in nutrient-poor waters, coral reefs must retain and recycle materials efficiently. This review centers microbial processes in facilitating the persistence and stability of coral reefs, specifically the role of these processes in transforming and recycling the dissolved organic matter (DOM) that acts as an invisible currency in reef production, nutrient exchange, and organismal interactions. The defining characteristics of coral reefs, including high productivity, balanced metabolism, high biodiversity, nutrient retention, and structural complexity, are inextricably linked to microbial processing of DOM. The composition of microbes and DOM in reefs is summarized, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of biogeochemical processes carried out by microorganisms in diverse reef habitats are explored in a variety of key reef processes, including decomposition, accretion, trophictransfer, and macronutrient recycling. Finally, we examine how widespread habitat degradation of reefs is altering these important microbe\u2013DOM interactions, creating feedbacks that reduce reef resilience to global change.", "generated_text": "Coral reef ecosystems are increasingly threatened by global environmental changes, necessitating a deeper understanding of their functional dynamics. This review explores the pivotal role of microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in coral reef ecosystem function and resilience. We synthesize recent findings on how microbiomes mediate nutrient cycling and energy flow through their processing of DOM, highlighting the complex interplay between coral-associated microbes, water column microorganisms, and reef substrates. The review examines how anthropogenic stressors, such as ocean warming and deoxygenation, alter microbial-DOM interactions and subsequently impact reef health. We discuss the potential of leveraging microbial-DOM dynamics for reef conservation and restoration efforts, emphasizing the need for integrative approaches that consider these interactions in ecosystem management strategies. This synthesis underscores the critical importance of microbial-DOM interactions in maintaining coral reef ecosystem function and enhancing resilience in the face of global change.", "label": 1}
