{"grounding": "Exchange of material across the nearshore region, extending from the shoreline to a few kilometers offshore, determines the concentrations of pathogens and nutrients near the coast and the transport of larvae, whose cross-shore positions influence dispersal and recruitment. Here, we describe a framework for estimating the relative importance of cross-shore exchange mechanisms, including winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling. For each mechanism, we define an exchange velocity as a function of environmental conditions. The exchange velocity applies for organisms that keep a particular depth due to swimming or buoyancy. A related exchange diffusivity quantifies horizontal spreading of particles without enough vertical swimming speed or buoyancy to counteract turbulent velocities. This framework provides a way to determinewhich processes are important for cross-shore exchange for a particular study site, time period, and particle behavior.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of cross-shore exchange in the nearshore region, focusing on the transport of plankton, pollutants, and particles. We examine the interplay of various physical processes, including turbulence, wind-driven currents, surface waves, and internal waves, to understand their collective impact on particle behavior and transport. Using a combination of field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling, we quantify the relative contributions of these mechanisms to cross-shore exchange rates. Our findings reveal that surface waves and internal waves play a dominant role in particle transport, while wind-driven currents and turbulence contribute to smaller-scale mixing processes. We also identify key differences in the transport patterns of plankton, pollutants, and inert particles, highlighting the importance of considering particle-specific characteristics in nearshore exchange models. These results provide valuable insights for coastal management and pollution mitigation strategies.", "label": 0}
