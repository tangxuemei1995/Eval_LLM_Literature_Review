{"grounding": "Constraining rates of marine carbonate burial through geologic time is critical for interpreting reconstructed changes in ocean chemistry and understanding feedbacks and interactions between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. The Quaternary Period (the past 2.6 million years) is of particular interest due to dramatic variations in sea level that periodically exposed and flooded areas of carbonate accumulation on the continental shelf, likely impacting the global carbonate budget and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These important effects remain poorly quantified. Here, we summarize the importance of carbonate burial in the ocean\u2013climate system, review methods for quantifying carbonate burial across depositional environments, discuss advances in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial over the past three decades, and identify gaps and challenges in reconciling the existing records. Emerging paleoceanographic proxies such as the stable strontium and calcium isotope systems, as well as innovative modeling approaches, are highlighted as new opportunities to produce continuous records of global carbonate burial.", "generated_text": "This study synthesizes proxy- and model-based reconstructions of global Quaternary carbonate burial to assess variations between glacial and interglacial periods and their implications for the carbon cycle. We compile and analyze sediment core data, geochemical proxies, and Earth system model simulations to quantify changes in carbonate accumulation rates across different ocean basins. Our results indicate significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in carbonate burial, with generally higher rates during interglacials. However, uncertainties persist due to limited spatial coverage of proxy records and model parameterization challenges. We discuss the potential drivers of these variations, including changes in ocean chemistry, biological productivity, and sediment transport. The study highlights the complex interplay between climate, ocean circulation, and marine biogeochemistry in modulating carbonate burial. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the global carbon cycle and its response to glacial-interglacial transitions, with implications for future climate change projections.", "label": 0}
