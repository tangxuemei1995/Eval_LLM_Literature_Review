{"grounding": "Climatic extremes are becoming increasingly common against a background trend of global warming. In the oceans, marine heatwaves (MHWs)\u2014discrete periods of anomalously warm water\u2014have intensified and become more frequent over the past century, impacting the integrity of marine ecosystems globally. We review and synthesize current understanding of MHW impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. We then examine how these impacts affect broader ecosystem services and discuss the current state of research on biological impacts of MHWs. Finally, we explore current and emergent approaches to predicting the occurrence andimpacts of future events, along with adaptation and management approaches. With further increases in intensity and frequency projected for coming decades, MHWs are emerging as pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems globally. A deeper mechanistic understanding of their biological impacts is needed to better predict and adapt to increased MHW activity in the Anthropocene.", "generated_text": "Marine heatwaves, characterized by prolonged periods of anomalously high ocean temperatures, are becoming increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biological impacts of these extreme events on marine ecosystems. We examine how marine heatwaves affect various trophic levels, from primary producers to top predators, and assess their consequences for ecosystem structure and function. The analysis reveals widespread impacts, including shifts in species distributions, alterations in community composition, and disruptions to ecosystem services. We also explore the potential for cumulative effects and tipping points in marine systems exposed to recurrent heatwaves. By integrating findings from diverse marine environments, this review highlights the urgent need for improved understanding and prediction of marine heatwave impacts to inform adaptive management strategies in a rapidly changing ocean.", "label": 1}
