{"grounding": "The micronutrient iron plays a major role in setting the magnitude and distribution of primary production across the global ocean. As such, an understanding of the sources, sinks, and internal cycling processes that drive the oceanic distribution of iron is key to unlocking iron's role in the global carbon cycle and climate, both today and in the geologic past. Iron isotopic analyses of seawater have emerged as a transformative tool for diagnosing iron sources to the ocean and tracing biogeochemical processes. In this review, we summarize the end-member isotope signatures of different iron source fluxes and highlight the novel insights into iron provenance gained using this tracer. We also review ways in which iron isotope fractionation might be used to understand internal oceanic cycling of iron, including speciation changes, biological uptake, and particle scavenging. We conclude with an overview of future research needed to expand the utilization of this cutting-edge tracer.", "generated_text": "Iron isotopes have emerged as powerful tools for unraveling the complex biogeochemical cycling of iron in marine environments. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of iron isotope fractionation processes and their application to marine systems. We examine the isotopic signatures of major iron sources, including atmospheric dust, sediments, and hydrothermal vents, and discuss how these signatures are modified during transport and biological uptake. Data from the GEOTRACES program have provided unprecedented spatial coverage of iron isotope distributions in the global ocean, revealing distinct patterns that reflect the interplay of physical, chemical, and biological processes. These observations have led to new insights into the relative importance of different iron sources, the extent of iron recycling, and the role of organic ligands in controlling iron bioavailability. We highlight the potential of iron isotopes as tracers of past and present ocean biogeochemistry and discuss future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
