{"grounding": "The world's eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) contribute disproportionately to global ocean productivity and provide critical ecosystem services to human society. The impact of climate change on EBUSs and the ecosystems they support is thus a subject of considerable interest. Here, we review hypotheses of climate-driven change in the physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology of EBUSs; describe observed changes over recent decades; and present projected changes over the twenty-first century. Similarities in historical and projected change among EBUSs include a trend toward upwelling intensification in poleward regions, mitigatedwarming in near-coastal regions where upwelling intensifies, and enhanced water-column stratification and a shoaling mixed layer. However, there remains significant uncertainty in how EBUSs will evolve with climate change, particularly in how the sometimes competing changes in upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification will affect productivity and ecosystem structure. We summarize the commonalities and differences in historical and projected change in EBUSs and conclude with an assessment of key remaining uncertainties and questions. Future studies will need to address these questions to better understand, project, and adapt to climate-driven changes in EBUSs.", "generated_text": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) play a crucial role in global marine ecosystems and fisheries productivity. This study examines the impacts of climate change on EBUS, focusing on the California, Humboldt, Canary, and Benguela systems. We analyze long-term observational data and employ high-resolution climate models to assess changes in upwelling intensity, seasonality, and associated oceanographic parameters. Results indicate a complex response to global warming, with regional variations in upwelling trends. While some areas show intensification of upwelling-favorable winds, others experience weakening or shifts in seasonality. These changes have significant implications for nutrient dynamics, primary productivity, and marine food webs. We also observe alterations in coastal stratification and oxygen levels, potentially leading to expanded oxygen minimum zones. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of EBUS to climate change and emphasize the need for adaptive management strategies to ensure the sustainability of these ecologically and economically important marine ecosystems.", "label": 1}
