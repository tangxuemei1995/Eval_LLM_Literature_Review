{"grounding": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) is rapidly attracting interest, as climate change is putting ecosystems at risk and endangering human communities globally. Due to the centrality of the ocean in the global carbon cycle, augmenting the carbon sequestration capacity of the ocean could be a powerful mechanism for the removal of legacy excess emissions. However, OCDR requires careful assessment due to the unique biophysical characteristics of the ocean and its centrality in the Earth system and many social systems. Using a sociotechnical system lens, this review identifies the sets of considerations that need to be included within robust assessments for OCDR decision-making. Specifically, it lays out the state of technical assessments of OCDR approaches along with key financial concerns, social issues (including public perceptions), and the underlying ethical debates and concerns that would need to be addressed if OCDR were to be deployed as a carbon dioxide removal strategy.", "generated_text": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has emerged as a potential strategy to mitigate climate change, but its implementation raises complex sociotechnical challenges. This review examines the multifaceted considerations surrounding ocean CDR, including technological feasibility, climate finance mechanisms, public perception, and environmental ethics. We analyze the current state of ocean CDR technologies and their potential impacts on marine ecosystems. The study also explores the role of international climate finance in supporting ocean CDR initiatives and the challenges of developing equitable funding models. Furthermore, we investigate public attitudes towards ocean-based climate interventions and the factors influencing societal acceptance. Ethical considerations, such as intergenerational justice and the potential for unintended consequences, are critically examined. By synthesizing these diverse perspectives, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sociotechnical landscape of ocean CDR and inform future policy and research directions.", "label": 1}
