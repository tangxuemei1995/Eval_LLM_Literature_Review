{"grounding": "The oceanic waters below a depth of 200 m represent, in terms of volume, the largest habitat of the biosphere, harboring approximately 70% of the prokaryotic biomass in the oceanic water column. These waters are characterized by low temperature, increasing hydrostatic pressure, and decreasing organic matter supply with depth. Recent methodological advances in microbial oceanography have refined our view of the ecology of prokaryotes in the dark ocean. Here, we review the ecology of prokaryotes of the dark ocean, present data on the biomass distribution and heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic prokaryotic production in the major oceanic basins, and highlight the phylogenetic and functional diversity of this part of the ocean. We describe the connectivity of surface and deep-water prokaryotes and the molecular adaptations of piezophilic prokaryotes to high hydrostatic pressure. We also highlight knowledge gaps in the ecology of the dark ocean's prokaryotes and their role in the biogeochemical cycles in the largest habitat of the biosphere.", "generated_text": "The deep ocean's water column harbors a diverse and abundant prokaryotic community, playing a crucial role in global biogeochemical cycles. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the distribution, diversity, and metabolic activities of bacteria and archaea in the deep ocean. Recent advances in microbial oceanography have revealed unique adaptations of these organisms to high-pressure, low-temperature environments. Molecular techniques have uncovered previously unknown prokaryotic lineages and metabolic pathways, highlighting the importance of chemosynthetic processes in sustaining deep-sea ecosystems. The vertical stratification of prokaryotic communities along the water column reflects changes in nutrient availability and physicochemical parameters. Furthermore, the deep ocean serves as a reservoir of genetic diversity and potential biotechnological resources. Understanding the ecology and function of deep-sea prokaryotes is essential for predicting the impacts of climate change on ocean ecosystems and global carbon cycling.", "label": 1}
