{"grounding": "Fishing provides the world with an important component of its food supply, but it also negatively impacts the biodiversity of marine and freshwater ecosystems, especially when industrial fishing is involved. To mitigate these impacts, civil society needs access to fisheries data (i.e., catches and catch-derived indicators of these impacts). Such data, however, must be more comprehensive than the official fisheries statistics supplied to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) by its member countries, which shape public policy in spite of their deficiencies, notably underestimating small-scale fisheries. This article documents the creation, based on the geographically coarse FAO data, of a database and website (\nhttps://www.seaaroundus.org\n) that provides free reconstructed (i.e., corrected) catch data by ecosystem, country, species, gear type, commercial value, etc., to any interested person, along with catch-derived indicators from 1950 to the near present for the entire world.", "generated_text": "The Sea Around Us project has emerged as a pivotal resource in documenting the global impact of human activities on marine ecosystems. This comprehensive initiative combines data science and global studies to provide open access to crucial information on fisheries worldwide. By focusing on artisanal, subsistence, and large-scale fisheries, the project offers a holistic view of the complex interactions between human exploitation and ocean health. The Sea Around Us serves as an invaluable tool for civil society, policymakers, and researchers in the twenty-first century, enabling informed decision-making and fostering sustainable management practices. Through its commitment to open data and rigorous scientific methodologies, the project continues to illuminate the pressing challenges facing our oceans and supports efforts to mitigate human-induced pressures on marine ecosystems.", "label": 1}
