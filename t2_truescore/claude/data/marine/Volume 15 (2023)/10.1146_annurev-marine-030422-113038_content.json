{"grounding": "The regular movements of waves and tides are obvious representations of the oceans\u2019 rhythmicity. But the rhythms of marine life span across ecological niches and timescales, including short (in the range of hours) and long (in the range of days and months) periods. These rhythms regulate the physiology and behavior of individuals, as well as their interactions with each other and with the environment. This review highlights examples of rhythmicity in marine animals and algae that represent important groups of marine life across different habitats. The examples cover ecologically highly relevant species and a growing number of laboratory model systems that are used to disentangle key mechanistic principles. The review introduces fundamental concepts of chronobiology, such as the distinction between rhythmic and endogenous oscillator\u2013driven processes. It also addresses the relevance of studying diverse rhythms and oscillators, as well as their interconnection, for making better predictions of how species will respond to environmental perturbations, including climate change. As the review aims to address scientists from the diverse fields of marine biology, ecology, and molecular chronobiology, all of which have their own scientific terms, we provide definitions of key terms throughout the article.", "generated_text": "Marine organisms have evolved intricate endogenous oscillators to synchronize their biological processes with environmental cycles. This review explores the diverse rhythms and clocks observed in marine species, including circadian, circatidal, circalunar, and circannual patterns. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying these oscillators in various marine algae and animals, highlighting their adaptive significance in regulating physiological and behavioral responses to predictable environmental changes. The interplay between endogenous clocks and external cues, such as light, temperature, and tidal cycles, is discussed, emphasizing the importance of these interactions for survival and reproduction in marine ecosystems. Furthermore, we address the potential impacts of climate change on marine biological rhythms, considering how altered environmental cues may disrupt the timing of critical life-history events. This synthesis underscores the need for further research to elucidate the complex relationships between marine organisms' internal clocks and their changing environment, ultimately informing conservation strategies and predictions of ecosystem responses to global climate shifts.", "label": 1}
