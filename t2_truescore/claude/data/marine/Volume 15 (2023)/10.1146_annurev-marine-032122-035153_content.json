{"grounding": "Understanding the nature of organic matter flux in the ocean remains a major goal of oceanography because it impacts some of the most important processes in the ocean. Sinking particles are important for carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and its movement to the deep ocean. They also feed life below the ocean's productive surface and sustain life in the deep sea, in addition to depositing organic matter on the seafloor. However, the magnitude of all of these processes is dependent on the transformation of sinking particles during their journey through the water column. This review focuses on the movement of organic matter from the surface ocean to the deep sea via the biological carbon pump and examines the processes that prevent this downward movement\u2014namely, attenuation via microbial colonization and zooplankton feeding. It also discusses how the depth-specific interactions among microbes, zooplankton, and aggregates determine carbon export as well as nutrient recycling, which in turn impact ocean production and Earth's climate.", "generated_text": "The biological carbon pump plays a crucial role in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels by exporting organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of carbon export processes from a biologist's perspective. We examine the formation and transformation of marine snow, fecal pellets, and other particulate organic matter that contribute to the vertical flux of carbon. The complex interplay between microbial degradation and zooplankton feeding on sinking particles is explored, highlighting their impact on flux attenuation. We discuss the importance of aggregate formation and disaggregation in modulating export efficiency. Additionally, we consider how changing ocean conditions, such as warming and acidification, may alter these biological processes and subsequently affect carbon export. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the intricate mechanisms governing the biological carbon pump and emphasizes the need for further research to better predict its response to global environmental changes.", "label": 1}
