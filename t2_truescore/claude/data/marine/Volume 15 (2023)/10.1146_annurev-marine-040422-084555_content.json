{"grounding": "The modes of Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV), traditionally defined as statistical patterns of variance, reflect to first order the ocean's integration (i.e., reddening) of atmospheric forcing that arises from both a shift and a change in strength of the climatological (time-mean) atmospheric circulation. While these patterns concisely describe PDV, they do not distinguish among the key dynamical processes driving the evolution of PDV anomalies, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks with similar spatial structures that operate on different timescales. In this review, we synthesize past analysis using an empirical dynamical model constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies drawn from several reanalysis products, showing that the PDV modes of variance result from two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes: the North Pacific\u2013central Pacific (NP-CP) and Kuroshio\u2013Oyashio Extension (KOE) modes. Both eigenmodes highlight how two-way tropical\u2013extratropical teleconnection dynamics are the primary mechanisms energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale footprint of PDV. While the NP-CP mode captures interannual- to decadal-scale variability, the KOE mode is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV on decadal to multidecadal timescales, including contributions from the South Pacific.", "generated_text": "Pacific decadal variability (PDV) plays a crucial role in modulating global climate patterns and has significant implications for long-term climate change projections. This review synthesizes current understanding of the modes and mechanisms driving PDV in the Pacific Ocean. We examine the interplay between ocean-atmosphere teleconnections, El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and other climate phenomena that contribute to decadal-scale variability. The study explores the spatial and temporal characteristics of PDV, including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). We analyze observational data, paleoclimate records, and climate model simulations to elucidate the underlying physical processes and feedbacks that govern PDV. The review also addresses the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on PDV patterns and their global consequences. By integrating diverse lines of evidence, this work provides a comprehensive overview of PDV mechanisms and their implications for climate variability and predictability on decadal timescales.", "label": 1}
