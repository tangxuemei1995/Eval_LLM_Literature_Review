{"grounding": "Since the early 1990s, single-molecule detection in solution at room temperature has enabled direct observation of single biomolecules at work in real time and under physiological conditions, providing insights into complex biological systems that the traditional ensemble methods cannot offer. In particular, recent advances in single-molecule tracking techniques allow researchers to follow individual biomolecules in their native environments for a timescale of seconds to minutes, revealing not only the distinct pathways these biomolecules take for downstream signaling but also their roles in supporting life. In this review, we discuss various single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques developed to date, with an emphasis on advanced three-dimensional (3D) tracking systems that not only achieve ultrahigh spatiotemporal resolution but also provide sufficient working depths suitable for tracking single molecules in 3D tissue models. We then summarize the observables that can be extracted from the trajectory data. Methods to perform single-molecule clustering analysis and future directions are also discussed.", "generated_text": "Single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques have revolutionized our understanding of molecular dynamics in biological systems. This review highlights recent advances in this rapidly evolving field. We discuss improvements in feedback-control tracking systems, which enable prolonged observation of individual molecules with enhanced spatiotemporal resolution. Point-spread-function engineering has expanded the capabilities of 3D tracking, allowing for precise localization of molecules in complex cellular environments. Multiple plane microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for simultaneous imaging of molecules across different focal planes. We also examine progress in trajectory analysis methods, including novel algorithms for extracting meaningful information from large datasets. Additionally, we explore advancements in clustering analysis techniques, which provide insights into molecular interactions and spatial organization. These developments collectively contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of molecular behavior in living cells, opening new avenues for research in cell biology, biophysics, and drug discovery.", "label": 1}
