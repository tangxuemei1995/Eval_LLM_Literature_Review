{"grounding": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect tropical and subtropical countries and are caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. These kinds of diseases spread quickly due to the tropical climate and limited access to clean water, sanitation, and health care, which make exposed people more vulnerable. NTDs are reported to be difficult and inefficient to diagnose. As mentioned, most NTDs occur in countries that are socially vulnerable, and the lack of resources and access to modern laboratories and equipment intensify the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment, leading to an increase in the mortality rate. Portable and low-cost microfluidic systems have been widely applied for clinical diagnosis, offering a promising alternative that can meet the needs for fast, affordable, and reliable diagnostic tests in developing countries. This review provides a critical overview of microfluidic devices that have been reported in the literature for the detection of the most common NTDs over the past 5 years.", "generated_text": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose significant health challenges in resource-limited settings. This review explores the development of low-cost microfluidic systems for the detection of NTDs, focusing on paper-based microfluidics and lateral flow assays. We examine recent advancements in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests adapted for point-of-care testing. These innovative platforms offer rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic capabilities while minimizing costs and infrastructure requirements. We discuss the integration of smartphone-based detection systems and the potential for multiplexed assays to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, we address the challenges of implementing these technologies in remote areas, including sample preparation, reagent stability, and result interpretation. The review highlights the promising role of low-cost microfluidic systems in improving clinical diagnosis and disease management for NTDs, ultimately contributing to global health equity.", "label": 1}
