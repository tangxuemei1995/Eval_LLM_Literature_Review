{"grounding": "In recent years, there has been a revived appreciation for the importance of spatial context and morphological phenotypes for both understanding disease progression and guiding treatment decisions. Compared with conventional 2D histopathology, which is the current gold standard of medical diagnostics, nondestructive 3D pathology offers researchers and clinicians the ability to visualize orders of magnitude more tissue within their natural volumetric context. This has been enabled by rapid advances in tissue-preparation methods, high-throughput 3D microscopy instrumentation, and computational tools for processing these massive feature-rich data sets. Here, we provide a brief overview of many of these technical advances along with remaining challenges to be overcome. We also speculate on the future of 3D pathology as applied in translational investigations, preclinical drug development, and clinical decision-support assays.", "generated_text": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a powerful tool for nondestructive 3D pathology, offering unprecedented insights into tissue architecture and cellular interactions. This review explores the application of LSFM in translational research and clinical assays, highlighting its potential to revolutionize precision medicine. We discuss the integration of LSFM with computational and digital pathology techniques, enabling high-resolution spatial biology analyses. The optical-sectioning capabilities of LSFM allow for rapid, large-scale imaging of intact specimens, preserving spatial context and reducing artifacts associated with traditional histological methods. We examine recent advancements in LSFM technology, including improved clearing techniques and multi-view imaging, which enhance its utility in diverse biomedical applications. Finally, we address the challenges and opportunities for implementing LSFM in clinical settings, emphasizing its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide personalized treatment strategies.", "label": 0}
