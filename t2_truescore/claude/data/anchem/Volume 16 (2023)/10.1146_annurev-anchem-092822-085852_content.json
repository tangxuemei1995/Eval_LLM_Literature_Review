{"grounding": "Cell functions rely on signal transduction\u2014the cascades of molecular interactions and biochemical reactions that relay extracellular signals to the cell interior. Dissecting principles governing the signal transduction process is critical for the fundamental understanding of cell physiology and the development of biomedical interventions. The complexity of cell signaling is, however, beyond what is accessible by conventional biochemistry assays. Thanks to their unique physical and chemical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly used for the quantitative measurement and manipulation of cell signaling. Even though research in this area is still in its infancy, it has the potential to yield new, paradigm-shifting knowledge of cell biology and lead to biomedical innovations. To highlight this importance, we summarize in this review studies that pioneered the development and application of NPs for cell signaling, from quantitative measurements of signaling molecules to spatiotemporal manipulation of cell signal transduction.", "generated_text": "This review explores the application of nanoparticles in interrogating cell signaling pathways. We discuss how nanoparticles serve as powerful tools for intracellular sensing, enabling real-time monitoring of signaling events with high spatial and temporal resolution. The review highlights the use of magnetic and optical manipulation techniques to control nanoparticle behavior within cells, allowing for precise probing of signaling cascades. We examine recent advances in quantitative imaging methods that leverage nanoparticle-based sensors to visualize and measure signaling dynamics. The integration of these approaches provides unprecedented insights into the complex networks of cellular communication. Furthermore, we address the challenges and future directions in developing biocompatible nanoparticles with enhanced specificity and sensitivity for investigating cell signaling processes. This emerging field holds great promise for advancing our understanding of cellular function and disease mechanisms.", "label": 1}
