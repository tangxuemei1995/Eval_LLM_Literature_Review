{"grounding": "The goal of protecting the health of future generations is a blueprint for future biosensor design. Systems-level decision support requires that biosensors provide meaningful service to society. In this review, we summarize recent developments in cyber physical systems and biosensors connected with decision support. We identify key processes and practices that may guide the establishment of connections between user needs and biosensor engineering using an informatics approach. We call for data science and decision science to be formally connected with sensor science for understanding system complexity and realizing the ambition of biosensors-as-a-service. This review calls for a focus on quality of service early in the design process as a means to improve the meaningful value of a given biosensor. We close by noting that technology development, including biosensors and decision support systems, is a cautionary tale. The economics of scale govern the success, or failure, of any biosensor system.", "generated_text": "In an increasingly interconnected world, biosensors play a crucial role in bridging the gap between biological systems and digital technologies. This paper explores the potential of biosensors to provide system-level support across various domains, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, and industrial processes. We examine how biosensors can enhance decision support systems by providing real-time, accurate data for meaningful use in critical applications. The integration of biosensors into knowledge networks is discussed, highlighting their ability to contribute to the creation and dissemination of valuable insights. Furthermore, we analyze the quality of service considerations in biosensor-based systems, addressing challenges such as reliability, scalability, and data security. By synthesizing current research and identifying future directions, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the transformative potential of biosensors in creating a more connected and responsive world.", "label": 1}
