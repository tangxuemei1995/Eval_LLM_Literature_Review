{"grounding": "Biofilms are multicellular communities held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix and exhibit a set of properties that distinguish them from free-living bacteria. Biofilms are exposed to a variety of mechanical and chemical cues resulting from fluid motion and mass transport. Microfluidics provides the precise control of hydrodynamic and physicochemical microenvironments to study biofilms in general. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in microfluidics-based biofilm research, including understanding the mechanism of bacterial adhesion and biofilm development, assessment of antifouling and antimicrobial properties, development of advanced in vitro infection models, and advancement in methods to characterize biofilms. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future direction of microfluidics-assisted biofilm research.", "generated_text": "Microfluidic systems have emerged as powerful tools for studying biofilms, offering precise control over flow dynamics and shear stress. This review explores recent advancements in microfluidic platforms for biofilm research, highlighting their applications in in situ visualization, antifouling strategies, and antimicrobial resistance studies. We discuss the integration of microfluidics with organ-on-chip models and biosensors, enabling more accurate representations of physiological conditions and real-time monitoring of biofilm formation. The miniaturized nature of these systems allows for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial agents and novel antifouling materials. Furthermore, we examine how microfluidics facilitates the investigation of biofilm-host interactions and the development of personalized treatment strategies. This review underscores the potential of microfluidic technologies in advancing our understanding of biofilm biology and combating biofilm-related challenges.", "label": 1}
