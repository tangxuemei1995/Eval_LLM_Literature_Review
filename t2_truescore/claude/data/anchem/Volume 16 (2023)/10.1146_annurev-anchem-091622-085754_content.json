{"grounding": "Label-free electrochemical biosensing leverages the advantages of label-free techniques, low cost, and fewer user steps, with the sensitivity and portability of electrochemical analysis. In this review, we identify four label-free electrochemical biosensing mechanisms: (a) blocking the electrode surface, (b) allowing greater access to the electrode surface, (c) changing the intercalation or electrostatic affinity of a redox probe to a biorecognition unit, and (d) modulating ion or electron transport properties due to conformational and surface charge changes. Each mechanism is described, recent advancements are summarized, and relative advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are discussed. Furthermore, two avenues for gaining further diagnostic information from label-free electrochemical biosensors, through multiplex analysis and incorporating machine learning, are examined.", "generated_text": "This review explores label-free electrochemical methods for disease detection, highlighting recent advancements in biosensing and diagnostics. We discuss various electrochemical techniques that enable rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective detection of disease biomarkers without the need for labeling agents. The principles of label-free electrochemical sensing are examined, along with their applications in detecting a wide range of diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. We also address the challenges and limitations of these methods, as well as potential future developments in the field. This comprehensive overview demonstrates the significant potential of label-free electrochemical approaches in revolutionizing disease diagnostics and improving patient outcomes through early and accurate detection.", "label": 1}
