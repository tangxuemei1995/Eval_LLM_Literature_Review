{"grounding": "This article critically reviews analytical method validation and quality control applied to the environmental chemistry field. The review focuses on the determination of organic micropollutants (OMPs), specifically emerging contaminants and pesticides, in the aquatic environment. The analytical technique considered is (gas and liquid) chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), including high-resolution MS for wide-scope screening purposes. An analysis of current research practices outlined in the literature has been performed, and key issues and analytical challenges are identified and critically discussed. It is worth emphasizing the lack of specific guidelines applied to environmental analytical chemistry and the minimal regulation of OMPs in waters, which greatly affect method development and performance, requirements for method validation, and the subsequent application to samples. Finally, a proposal is made for method validation and data reporting, which can be understood as starting points for further discussion with specialists in environmental analytical chemistry.", "generated_text": "This review explores efficient validation strategies for environmental analytical methods focusing on organic micropollutants in water samples. The increasing complexity of environmental matrices and the need for accurate, sensitive, and reliable analytical methods necessitate robust validation procedures. We discuss key aspects of method validation, including selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and limits of detection and quantification, with a specific emphasis on liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Quality assurance and quality control measures are examined, highlighting their importance in ensuring data reliability. The review also addresses challenges associated with emerging contaminants and matrix effects in water samples. By presenting current best practices and innovative approaches, this work aims to guide researchers and analytical chemists in developing and implementing efficient validation strategies for the analysis of organic micropollutants in aqueous environments, ultimately contributing to improved environmental monitoring and risk assessment.", "label": 1}
