{"grounding": "Offering superb speed, chemical specificity, and analytical sensitivity, direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies are highly amenable for the molecular analysis of complex tissues to aid in disease characterization and help identify new diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers. By enabling detection of clinically actionable molecular profiles from tissues and cells, direct MS technologies have the potential to guide treatment decisions and transform sample analysis within clinical workflows. In this review, we highlight recent health-related developments and applications of direct MS technologies that exhibit tangible potential to accelerate clinical research and disease diagnosis, including oncological and neurodegenerative diseases and microbial infections. We focus primarily on applications that employ direct MS technologies for tissue analysis, including MS imaging technologies to map spatial distributions of molecules in situ as well as handheld devices for rapid in vivo and ex vivo tissue analysis.", "generated_text": "This review explores recent advancements in direct mass spectrometry technologies for tissue analysis and their emerging medical applications. We focus on mass spectrometry imaging techniques and ambient ionization methods, highlighting their potential in clinical diagnostics. The development of handheld mass spectrometry-based devices is discussed, emphasizing their role in point-of-care testing and intraoperative decision-making. We examine the integration of these technologies with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. The review also addresses current challenges, including standardization of protocols, data interpretation, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, we present future perspectives on the integration of direct mass spectrometry technologies into routine clinical practice, potentially revolutionizing disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and personalized medicine approaches.", "label": 1}
