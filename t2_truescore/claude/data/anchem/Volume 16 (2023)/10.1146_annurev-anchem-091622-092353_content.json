{"grounding": "The identification of thousands of proteins and their relative levels of expression has furthered understanding of biological processes and disease and stimulated new systems biology hypotheses. Quantitative proteomics workflows that rely on analytical assays such as mass spectrometry have facilitated high-throughput measurements of proteins partially due to multiplexing. Multiplexing allows proteome differences across multiple samples to be measured simultaneously, resulting in more accurate quantitation, increased statistical robustness, reduced analysis times, and lower experimental costs. The number of samples that can be multiplexed has evolved from as few as two to more than 50, with studies involving more than 10 samples being denoted as enhanced multiplexing or hyperplexing. In this review, we give an update on emerging multiplexing proteomics techniques and highlight advantages and limitations for enhanced multiplexing strategies.", "generated_text": "This study introduces an advanced multiplexing technology for high-throughput proteomics, termed 'hyperplexing'. By combining innovative sample preparation techniques, automated liquid handling systems, and state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, we have significantly increased the number of samples that can be analyzed simultaneously. Our approach enables the quantification of thousands of proteins across hundreds of samples in a single experiment, dramatically improving throughput and reducing experimental variability. We demonstrate the utility of hyperplexing in large-scale clinical studies, drug discovery pipelines, and systems biology investigations. The enhanced multiplexing capacity not only accelerates proteome-wide analyses but also facilitates the detection of subtle protein abundance changes across complex biological systems. This technology represents a significant advancement in proteomics research, offering new possibilities for understanding cellular processes and disease mechanisms at unprecedented scale and depth.", "label": 0}
