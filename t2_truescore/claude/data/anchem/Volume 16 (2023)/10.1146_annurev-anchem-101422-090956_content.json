{"grounding": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging records spatially resolved molecular vibrational spectra, enabling a comprehensive measurement of the chemical makeup and heterogeneity of biological tissues. Combining this novel contrast mechanism in microscopy with the use of artificial intelligence can transform the practice of histopathology, which currently relies largely on human examination of morphologic patterns within stained tissue. First, this review summarizes IR imaging instrumentation especially suited to histopathology, analyses of its performance, and major trends. Second, an overview of data processing methods and application of machine learning is given, with an emphasis on the emerging use of deep learning. Third, a discussion on workflows in pathology is provided, with four categories proposed based on the complexity of methods and the analytical performance needed. Last, a set of guidelines, termed experimental and analytical specifications for spectroscopic imaging in histopathology, are proposed to help standardize the diversity of approaches in this emerging area.", "generated_text": "Digital histopathology using infrared spectroscopic imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for disease diagnosis and tissue characterization. This technique combines the chemical specificity of infrared spectroscopy with high-resolution imaging capabilities, enabling the visualization and analysis of tissue samples at the molecular level. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms, researchers can extract valuable information from spectral data, leading to improved accuracy in tissue classification and disease detection. This review explores recent advancements in infrared spectroscopic imaging for digital histopathology, highlighting its potential to revolutionize pathology workflows and enhance diagnostic precision. We discuss the principles of chemical imaging, data processing techniques, and the integration of artificial intelligence for automated tissue analysis. Furthermore, we examine the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing this technology in clinical settings, emphasizing its potential to complement traditional histopathology methods and contribute to personalized medicine.", "label": 1}
