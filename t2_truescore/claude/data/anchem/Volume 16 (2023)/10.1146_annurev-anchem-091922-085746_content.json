{"grounding": "In situ water monitoring sensors are critical to gain an understanding of ocean biochemistry and ecosystem health. They enable the collection of high-frequency data and capture ecosystem spatial and temporal changes, which in turn facilitate long-term global predictions. They are used as decision support tools in emergency situations and for risk mitigation, pollution source tracking, and regulatory monitoring. Advanced sensing platforms exist to support various monitoring needs together with state-of-the-art power and communication capabilities. To be fit-for-purpose, sensors must withstand the challenging marine environment and provide data at an acceptable cost. Significant technological advancements have catalyzed the development of new and improved sensors for coastal and oceanographic applications. Sensors are becoming smaller, smarter, more cost-effective, and increasingly specialized and diversified. This article, therefore, provides a review of the state-of-the art oceanographic and coastal sensors. Progress in sensor development is discussed in terms of performance and the key strategies used for achieving robustness, marine rating, cost reduction, and antifouling protection.", "generated_text": "This review examines the current state of in situ sensors for coastal and ocean monitoring, highlighting recent advancements and challenges in the field. We discuss various sensor types and their applications in oceanography, including physical, chemical, and biological parameters. The integration of these sensors into networked systems for comprehensive environmental monitoring is explored, emphasizing the importance of real-time data collection and analysis. Particular attention is given to the issue of biofouling, a significant obstacle in long-term deployments, and emerging strategies to mitigate its effects. The review also addresses the growing role of autonomous platforms and the potential for machine learning in data interpretation. Finally, we identify key areas for future research and development, such as improving sensor durability, enhancing data quality, and expanding the range of measurable parameters to better understand complex coastal and ocean ecosystems.", "label": 0}
