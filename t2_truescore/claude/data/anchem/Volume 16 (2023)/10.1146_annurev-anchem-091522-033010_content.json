{"grounding": "This review summarizes the current status of development in photoluminescent probes, multidimensional photoluminescence detection, and multivariate data analysis methods. It then highlights reports featuring multivariate analysis of multidimensional measurements of photoluminescent probes published between June 2015 and June 2022, emphasizing work in the last 5 years. Important trends include the development of probe arrays, which provide fingerprint responses to the analyte(s) of interest and facilitate the analysis of complex samples; the application of neural networks and deep learning to pattern recognition and feature selection in photoluminescence images; and the application of multiway multivariate analysis to mining matrices, three-way arrays, and higher-order measurements, including hyperspectral intensity and lifetime images. These examples illustrate the increase in information extraction provided by the combination of multidimensional measurements and multivariate analysis.", "generated_text": "This review explores the emerging field of data-enabled sensing using photoluminescent probes, focusing on multidimensional fluorescence and phosphorescence techniques. We discuss recent advancements in multivariate analysis and image processing methods that have revolutionized the interpretation of complex luminescence data. The integration of N-way analysis with photoluminescent probes has enabled the extraction of valuable information from high-dimensional datasets, enhancing sensitivity and selectivity in various sensing applications. We highlight the synergistic relationship between probe design and data analysis techniques, emphasizing how this approach has led to breakthroughs in environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and materials characterization. Furthermore, we examine the challenges and future prospects of data-enabled sensing, including the development of machine learning algorithms for real-time analysis and the potential for creating adaptive, intelligent sensing systems.", "label": 0}
