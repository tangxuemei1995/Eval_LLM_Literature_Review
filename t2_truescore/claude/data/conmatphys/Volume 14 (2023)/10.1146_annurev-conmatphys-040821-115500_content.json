{"grounding": "Active colloids are self-propelled particles moving in viscous fluids by consuming fuel from their surroundings. Here, we review the numerical and theoretical modeling of active colloids propelled by self-generated near-surface flows. We start with the generic model of an active Brownian particle taking into account potential forces and effective pairwise interaction, which include hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. Also, the squirmer as a model microswimmer is introduced. We then discuss the explicit modeling of self-generated fluid flow and the full hydrodynamic-chemical coupling. Finally, we discuss recent advances in selected topics in which modeling of active colloids is used to study motion in crowded and complex environments, microrheology in active baths, active colloidal engines, adaptive responses of active colloids with the help of machine learning techniques, as well as effects of colloid and fluid inertia.", "generated_text": "This review explores the modeling of active colloids, ranging from simple active Brownian particle models to complex hydrodynamic and chemical field descriptions. We discuss various numerical approaches used to simulate microswimmers, including their interactions with complex environments and each other. The review covers recent advancements in modeling active baths and active engines, highlighting the importance of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions in these systems. We examine the challenges and opportunities in simulating large-scale collective behavior of active colloids, emphasizing the need for multiscale modeling techniques. The paper also addresses the role of external fields and confinement in shaping the dynamics of active colloids. Finally, we provide insights into future directions for numerical modeling of active matter systems and their potential applications in various fields.", "label": 1}
