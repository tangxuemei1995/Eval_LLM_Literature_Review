{"grounding": "Elasticity typically refers to a material's ability to store energy, whereas viscosity refers to a material's tendency to dissipate it. In this review, we discuss fluids and solids for which this is not the case. These materials display additional linear response coefficients known as odd viscosity and odd elasticity. We first introduce odd viscosity and odd elasticity from a continuum perspective, with an emphasis on their rich phenomenology, including transverse responses, modified dislocation dynamics, and topological waves. We then provide an overview of systems that display odd viscosity and odd elasticity. These systems range from quantum fluids and astrophysical gases to active and driven matter. Finally, we comment on microscopic mechanisms by which odd viscosity and odd elasticity arise.", "generated_text": "This study explores the novel concepts of odd viscosity and odd elasticity in continuum mechanics, with a focus on their applications in fluid mechanics and active matter systems. We investigate the emergence of these unconventional properties in nonequilibrium systems and their impact on hydrodynamic behavior. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate how odd viscosity and odd elasticity lead to unique rheological responses and flow patterns that deviate from traditional fluid dynamics. Our findings reveal the importance of these odd transport coefficients in describing the complex behavior of active fluids and soft materials. This work contributes to the growing field of nonequilibrium physics and provides new insights into the fundamental principles governing the mechanics of active matter systems.", "label": 1}
