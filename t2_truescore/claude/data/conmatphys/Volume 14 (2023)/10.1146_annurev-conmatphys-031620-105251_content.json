{"grounding": "Life is a nonequilibrium phenomenon: Metabolism provides a continuous supply of energy that drives nearly all cellular processes. However, very little is known about how much energy different cellular processes use, i.e., their energetic costs. The most direct experimental measurements of these costs involve modulating the activity of cellular processes and determining the resulting changes in energetic fluxes. In this review, we present a flux balance framework to aid in the design and interpretation of such experiments and discuss the challenges associated with measuring the relevant metabolic fluxes. We then describe selected techniques that enable measurement of these fluxes. Finally, we review prior experimental and theoretical work that has employed techniques from biochemistry and nonequilibrium physics to determine the energetic costs of cellular processes.", "generated_text": "Understanding cellular energetics is crucial for deciphering complex biological processes. This review explores advanced techniques and challenges in measuring energetic costs in cell biology through flux balance analysis. We discuss state-of-the-art methods for quantifying metabolic fluxes and energy balances, including isotope labeling, metabolomics, and computational modeling approaches. The integration of these techniques allows for a comprehensive assessment of cellular bioenergetics, revealing insights into energy allocation across various cellular processes. We highlight the challenges faced in accurately measuring and interpreting flux data, such as compartmentalization, metabolic regulation, and dynamic cellular responses. Additionally, we examine the potential applications of flux balance analysis in understanding disease mechanisms, drug development, and metabolic engineering. This review provides a critical evaluation of current methodologies and future directions in dissecting cellular energetics through flux balance analysis.", "label": 1}
