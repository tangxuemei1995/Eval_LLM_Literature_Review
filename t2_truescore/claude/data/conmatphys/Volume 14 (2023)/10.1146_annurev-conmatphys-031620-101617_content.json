{"grounding": "Weakly interacting quasiparticles play a central role in the low-energy description of many phases of quantum matter. At higher energies, however, quasiparticles cease to be well defined in generic many-body systems owing to a proliferation of decay channels. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of quantum many-body scars, which can give rise to certain species of stable quasiparticles throughout the energy spectrum. This goes along with a set of unusual nonequilibrium phenomena including many-body revivals and nonthermal stationary states. We provide a pedagogical exposition of this physics via a simple yet comprehensive example, that of a spin-1 XY model. We place our discussion in the broader context of symmetry-based constructions of many-body scar states, projector embeddings, and Hilbert space fragmentation. We conclude with a summary of experimental progress and theoretical puzzles.", "generated_text": "Quantum many-body scars have emerged as a fascinating phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, challenging the conventional understanding of eigenstate thermalization. This study presents a novel quasiparticle perspective on quantum many-body scars, offering insights into their underlying mechanisms. By analyzing constrained dynamics in various quantum systems, we demonstrate how quasiparticles can give rise to non-thermalizing behavior and long-lived coherent oscillations. Our approach provides a unified framework for understanding scarred eigenstates and their stability across different models. We explore the connections between quantum chaos, localization, and the emergence of scars, shedding light on the interplay between these phenomena. Our findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on non-ergodic quantum systems and have potential implications for quantum information processing and the design of novel quantum materials.", "label": 1}
