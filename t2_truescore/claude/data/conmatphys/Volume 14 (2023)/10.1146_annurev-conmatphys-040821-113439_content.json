{"grounding": "Learning is traditionally studied in biological or computational systems. The power of learning frameworks in solving hard inverse problems provides an appealing case for the development of physical learning in which physical systems adopt desirable properties on their own without computational design. It was recently realized that large classes of physical systems can physically learn through local learning rules, autonomously adapting their parameters in response to observed examples of use. We review recent work in the emerging field of physical learning, describing theoretical and experimental advances in areas ranging from molecular self-assembly to flow networks and mechanical materials. Physical learning machines provide multiple practical advantages over computer designed ones, in particular by not requiring an accurate model of the system, and their ability to autonomously adapt to changing needs over time. As theoretical constructs, physical learning machines afford a novel perspective on how physical constraints modify abstract learning theory.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of learning in physical systems without traditional neural networks. We investigate how principles of physical learning can be applied to various domains, including metamaterials, self-assembly, and molecular computing. By leveraging inverse design techniques and machine learning algorithms, we demonstrate that non-neural physical systems can exhibit learning behaviors comparable to those of conventional neural networks. Our research focuses on developing a unified learning theory for physical systems, encompassing both natural and artificial structures. We present experimental results showcasing the potential of physical learning in diverse applications, such as adaptive metamaterials and self-organizing molecular systems. This work provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying learning in non-neural contexts and opens new avenues for designing intelligent materials and computing systems that harness the inherent learning capabilities of physical phenomena.", "label": 1}
