{"grounding": "The modern scope of fermiology encompasses not just the classical geometry of Fermi surfaces but also the geometry of quantum wave functions over the Fermi surface. This enlarged scope is motivated by the advent of topological metals\u2014metals whose Fermi surfaces are characterized by a robustly nontrivial Berry phase. We review the extent to which topological metals can be diagnosed from magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations of transport and thermodynamic quantities. A holistic analysis of the oscillatory wave form is proposed, in which different characteristics of the wave form (e.g., phase offset, high-harmonic amplitudes, temperature-dependent frequency) encode different aspects of a topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. Which characteristic to focus on depends on (a) the orientation of the magnetic field relative to certain crystallographic axes, (b) the symmetry class of the topological metal, and (c) the separation of Fermi-surface pockets in quasimomentum \n\n space. Closely proximate pockets arise when (1) spin\u2013split pockets are nearly overlapping due to a weak spin\u2013orbit force or when (2) two pockets touch at an isolated \n\n point, which can be a topological band-touching point or a saddlepoint in the energy-momentum dispersion. The emergence of a pseudospin degree of freedom (in case 1) and the implications of magnetic breakdown (in case 2) are reviewed, with emphasis on new aspects originating from the (nonabelian) Berry connection of the Fermi surface. Future extensions of topofermiology are suggested in the directions of interaction-induced Fermi-liquid instabilities and two-dimensional electron liquids.", "generated_text": "The study of Fermi surfaces in topological metals has emerged as a crucial area of research in condensed matter physics, offering insights into the interplay between electronic structure and topological properties. This review explores the fermiology of topological metals, focusing on the unique characteristics of their Fermi surfaces and the associated quantum phenomena. We discuss the role of Berry phase in shaping the electronic properties of these materials and its manifestation in quantum oscillation experiments. The geometry and topology of Fermi surfaces in various classes of topological metals, including Dirac and Weyl semimetals, are examined in detail. We highlight the importance of magnetic breakdown in probing the intricate structure of these surfaces and its implications for understanding the underlying band structure. The review also covers recent experimental advances in mapping Fermi surfaces of topological metals using techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillation measurements. Furthermore, we explore the theoretical frameworks developed to describe the complex Fermi surface geometries in these materials and their connection to observable physical properties. This comprehensive overview provides a foundation for understanding the rich physics of topological metals and paves the way for future investigations into novel quantum states and potential technological applications.", "label": 1}
