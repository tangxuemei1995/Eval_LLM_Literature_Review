{"grounding": "Inversion and time reversal are essential symmetries for the structure of Cooper pairs in superconductors. The loss of one or both leads to modifications to this structure and can change the properties of the superconducting phases in profound ways. Superconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry, or noncentrosymmetric materials, has become an important topic. These materials show unusual magnetic and magnetoelectric properties and can host topological superconductivity. Recently, crystal structures with local, but not global, inversion-symmetry breaking have attracted attention. Here, superconductivity can exhibit phenomena not naively expected in centrosymmetric materials. In this review, we first introduce the concept of locally noncentrosymmetric crystals and different material realizations. We then discuss consequences of such local symmetry breaking on the normal state electronic structure and the classification of superconducting order parameters. Finally, we review the expected and, in parts, already observed phenomenology of unconventional superconductivity and possible topological superconducting phases.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the interplay between superconductivity and local inversion-symmetry breaking in crystalline materials. We explore how the absence of inversion symmetry at atomic sites, coupled with strong spin-orbit interactions, can lead to unconventional superconducting states. Our theoretical analysis reveals that Rashba spin-orbit coupling, induced by local inversion-symmetry breaking, plays a crucial role in generating topological superconductivity. We demonstrate that hidden spin polarization, a consequence of site-specific symmetry breaking, can significantly influence the superconducting order parameter. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we predict novel superconducting phases and identify potential materials for experimental realization. Our findings provide new insights into the fundamental relationship between crystal symmetry and exotic superconducting states, paving the way for the design of topological superconductors with enhanced functionality for quantum computing applications.", "label": 0}
