{"grounding": "Quantum circuits\u2014built from local unitary gates and local measurements\u2014are a new playground for quantum many-body physics and a tractable setting to explore universal collective phenomena far from equilibrium. These models have shed light on longstanding questions about thermalization and chaos, and on the underlying universal dynamics of quantum information and entanglement. In addition, such models generate new sets of questions and give rise to phenomena with no traditional analog, such as dynamical phase transitions in quantum systems that are monitored by an external observer. Quantum circuit dynamics is also topical in view of experimental progress in building digital quantum simulators that allow control of precisely these ingredients. Randomness in the circuit elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice models or dynamical processes. Many of the universal phenomena that can be identified in this tractable setting apply to much wider classes of more structured many-body dynamics.", "generated_text": "Random quantum circuits have emerged as powerful tools for studying fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and developing quantum technologies. This review explores recent advances in the field, focusing on their applications in probing entanglement, nonequilibrium dynamics, and quantum chaos. We discuss how random circuits serve as effective models for quantum simulators, enabling the investigation of complex quantum systems that are challenging to study analytically or simulate classically. The role of quantum measurements in random circuits is examined, highlighting their impact on entanglement dynamics and information scrambling. Furthermore, we analyze the connections between random quantum circuits and quantum chaos, shedding light on the nature of quantum information propagation and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. This work synthesizes theoretical developments and experimental implementations, providing insights into the potential of random quantum circuits for advancing our understanding of quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing.", "label": 1}
