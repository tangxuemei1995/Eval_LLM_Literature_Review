{"grounding": "We review the literature on swimming in complex fluids. A classification is proposed by comparing the length- and timescales of a swimmer with those of nearby obstacles, interpreted broadly, extending from rigid or soft confining boundaries to molecules that confer the bulk fluid with complex stresses. A third dimension in the classification is the concentration of swimmers, which incorporates fluids whose complexity arises purely by the collective motion of swimming organisms. For each of the eight system types that we identify, we provide a background and describe modern research findings. Although some types have seen a great deal of attention for decades, others remain uncharted waters still open and awaiting exploration.", "generated_text": "Swimming in complex fluids presents unique challenges and opportunities for microorganisms and artificial swimmers alike. This review explores the intricate interplay between locomotion strategies and the properties of soft matter, active matter, and biological fluids. We examine how swimmers navigate through active suspensions, adapting their propulsion mechanisms to overcome viscosity and exploit non-Newtonian behaviors. The study of swimming in complex fluids has implications for understanding microbial ecology, designing microrobots for medical applications, and developing novel propulsion systems. By synthesizing recent advances in experimental techniques and theoretical models, we provide insights into the fundamental physics governing locomotion in these diverse environments and highlight emerging directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
