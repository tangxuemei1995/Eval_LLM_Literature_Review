{"grounding": "The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) refers to the generation of a spin current as a result of a temperature gradient in a magnetic material, which can be detected electrically via the inverse spin Hall effect in a metallic contact. Since the discovery of the SSE in 2008, intensive studies on the SSE have been conducted to elucidate its origin. SSEs appear in a wide range of magnetic materials including ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnets and also paramagnets with classical or quantum spin fluctuation. SSE voltage reflects fundamental properties of a magnet, such as elementary excitation, static magnetic order, spin correlation, and spin transport. In this article, we review recent progress on the SSE in various systems, with particular emphasis on its emerging role as a probe of these magnetic properties in solids. We also briefly discuss the recently discovered nuclear SSE.", "generated_text": "The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating various phenomena in solid-state physics. This review explores the SSE's role as a sensitive probe for elementary excitations, spin correlations, transport mechanisms, magnetic order, and domain structures in solids. We discuss its applications in spintronics and antiferromagnetic spintronics, highlighting the interplay with the inverse spin Hall effect. The SSE's ability to detect and manipulate magnons, nuclear spins, and quantum spin liquid states is examined, revealing its potential for advancing our understanding of complex magnetic systems. Furthermore, we analyze the SSE's sensitivity to magnetic domain dynamics and its implications for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena. This comprehensive overview demonstrates the SSE's versatility as a non-invasive technique for probing fundamental properties of magnetic materials, paving the way for novel applications in quantum technologies and beyond.", "label": 1}
