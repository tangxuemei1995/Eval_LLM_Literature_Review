{"grounding": "Recent advances in our understanding of symmetry in quantum many-body systems offer the possibility of a generalized Landau paradigm that encompasses all equilibrium phases of matter. This is a brief and elementary review of some of these developments.", "generated_text": "This review explores generalized symmetries in condensed matter systems, focusing on their role in quantum phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking. We examine low-energy effective field theories and their applications in understanding exotic quantum states, providing insights into the fundamental nature of symmetry in quantum matter.", "label": 0}
