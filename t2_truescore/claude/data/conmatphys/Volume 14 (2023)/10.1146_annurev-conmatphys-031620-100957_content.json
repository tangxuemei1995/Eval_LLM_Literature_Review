{"grounding": "The solar\u2013to\u2013chemical energy conversion of Earth-abundant resources like water or greenhouse gas pollutants like CO2 promises an alternate energy source that is clean, renewable, and environmentally friendly. The eventual large-scale application of such photo-based energy conversion devices can be realized through the discovery of novel photocatalytic materials that are efficient, selective, and robust. In the past decade, the Materials Genome Initiative has led to a major leap in the development of materials databases, both computational and experimental. Hundreds of photocatalysts have recently been discovered for various chemical reactions, such as water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, employing these databases and/or data informatics, machine learning, and high-throughput computational and experimental methods. In this article, we review these data-driven photocatalyst discoveries, emphasizing the methods and techniques developed in the last few years to determine the (photo)electrochemical stability of photocatalysts, leading to the discovery of photocatalysts that remain robust and durable under operational conditions.", "generated_text": "This study presents a data-driven approach for the discovery of robust materials for photocatalytic energy conversion. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and high-throughput computational screening, we systematically explored a vast chemical space to identify promising photocatalysts with enhanced stability and efficiency. Our methodology integrates experimental data, theoretical calculations, and predictive models to evaluate key properties such as band gap, aqueous stability, and photocatalytic activity. We developed a novel descriptor-based framework that enables rapid assessment of candidate materials, significantly accelerating the discovery process. Our findings reveal several previously unexplored classes of materials with exceptional potential for photocatalytic energy conversion applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability and transferability of our approach, paving the way for future advancements in renewable energy technologies.
