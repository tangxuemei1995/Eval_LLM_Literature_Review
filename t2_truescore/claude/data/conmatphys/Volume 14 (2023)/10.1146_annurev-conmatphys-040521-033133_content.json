{"grounding": "The past decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in topological materials, and a lot of mathematical concepts have been introduced in condensed matter physics. Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central topic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on boundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex. Besides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon called the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition. In this article, we review developments in non-Hermitian topological physics by focusing mainly on the boundary problem. As well as the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena, we discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself.", "generated_text": "This review explores the rapidly evolving field of non-Hermitian topological phenomena, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian physics and topological phases of matter. We discuss the unique features of non-Hermitian systems, including exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, and their impact on topological properties. The breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian settings is examined, along with proposed generalizations. We survey recent theoretical advances in spectral theory applied to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and their topological classifications. Experimental realizations in photonic, acoustic, and mechanical systems are highlighted, demonstrating the practical significance of these concepts. Finally, we outline open questions and potential future directions in this interdisciplinary field, emphasizing its implications for fundamental physics and technological applications.", "label": 1}
