{"grounding": "Current digital health approaches have not engaged diverse end users or reduced health or health care inequities, despite their promise to deliver more tailored and personalized support to individuals at the right time and the right place. To achieve digital health equity, we must refocus our attention on the current state of digital health uptake and use across the policy, system, community, individual, and intervention levels. We focus here on (a) outlining a multilevel framework underlying digital health equity; (b) summarizingfive types of interventions/programs (with example studies) that hold promise for advancing digital health equity; and (c) recommending future steps for improving policy, practice, and research in this space.", "generated_text": "This literature synthesis explores the multilevel determinants of digital health equity, addressing the intersection of digital health technologies and social determinants of health. The review examines how various factors at individual, community, and societal levels influence access to and utilization of digital health resources. Findings reveal persistent disparities in digital health adoption and outcomes across socioeconomic, racial, and geographic lines. Key determinants include digital literacy, technological infrastructure, cultural relevance of digital health solutions, and policy frameworks. The synthesis highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to digital health equity that considers social, economic, and technological factors. Recommendations for future research and policy interventions are provided to advance equitable access and outcomes in digital health.", "label": 1}
