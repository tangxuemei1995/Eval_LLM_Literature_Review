{"grounding": "Mass incarceration is a sociostructural driver of profound health inequalities in the United States. The political and economic forces underpinning mass incarceration are deeply rooted in centuries of the enslavement of people of African descent and the genocide and displacement of Indigenous people and is inextricably connected to labor exploitation, racial discrimination, the criminalization of immigration, and behavioral health problems such as mental illness and substance use disorders. This article focuses on major public health crises and advances in state and federal prisons and discusses a range of practical strategies for health scholars, practitioners, and activists to promote the health and dignity of incarcerated people. It begins by summarizing the historical and sociostructural factors that have led to mass incarceration in the United States. It then describes the ways in which prison conditions create or worsen chronic, communicable, and behavioral health conditions, while highlighting priority areas for public health research and intervention to improve the health of incarcerated people, including decarceral solutions that can profoundly minimize\u2014and perhaps one day help abolish\u2014the use of prisons.", "generated_text": "The era of mass incarceration in the United States has brought unprecedented challenges to public health within correctional facilities. This paper examines the critical intersection of public health and the prison system, highlighting the urgent need for reform in the age of mass incarceration. We analyze the health disparities faced by incarcerated populations, including higher rates of chronic diseases, mental health disorders, and infectious diseases. The overcrowding and substandard living conditions in many prisons exacerbate these health issues, creating a public health crisis that extends beyond prison walls. We argue that addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including improved healthcare services within prisons, better coordination with community health systems, and policies aimed at decarceration. By prioritizing public health in correctional settings, we can not only improve the well-being of incarcerated individuals but also contribute to broader public health goals and reduce recidivism rates. This paper underscores the importance of viewing correctional health as an integral component of public health policy and practice.", "label": 1}
