{"grounding": "Extreme weather events are expected to increase due to climate change, which could pose an additional burden of morbidity and mortality. In recent decades, drought severity has increased in several regions around the world, affecting health by increasing the risk of water-, food-, and vector-borne diseases, malnutrition, cardiovascular and respiratory illness, mental health disorders, and mortality. Drought frequency and severity are expected to worsen across large regions as a result of a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature and atmospheric evaporative demand, posing a pressing challenge for public health. Variation in impacts among countries and communities is due to multiple factors, such as aging, socioeconomic status, access to health care, and gender, affecting population resilience. Integrative proactive action plans focused on risk management are required, and resources should be transferred to developing countries to reduce their vulnerability and risk.", "generated_text": "This critical review examines the public health implications of drought in the context of climate change. As global temperatures rise, drought events are becoming more frequent and severe, posing significant challenges to human health and well-being. The study synthesizes current literature on drought trends, their impacts on public health, and the vulnerability of different populations. Key findings highlight the direct and indirect health effects of drought, including water scarcity, food insecurity, and increased risk of infectious diseases. The review also explores the complex interplay between drought and socioeconomic factors that exacerbate health disparities. Furthermore, it evaluates existing drought risk management strategies and their effectiveness in mitigating health impacts. The paper concludes by identifying knowledge gaps and proposing recommendations for integrated drought management approaches that prioritize public health in a changing climate.", "label": 1}
