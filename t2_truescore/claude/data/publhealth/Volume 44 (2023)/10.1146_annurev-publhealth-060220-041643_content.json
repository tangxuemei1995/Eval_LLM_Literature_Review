{"grounding": "Health behaviors are inextricably linked to health and well-being, yet issues such as physical inactivity and insufficient sleep remain significant global public health problems. Mobile technology\u2014and the unprecedented scope and quantity of data it generates\u2014has a promising but largely untapped potential to promote health behaviors at the individual and population levels. This perspective article provides multidisciplinary recommendations on the design and use of mobile technology, and the concomitant wealth of data, to promote behaviors that support overall health. Using physical activity as anexemplar health behavior, we review emerging strategies for health behavior change interventions. We describe progress on personalizing interventions to an individual and their social, cultural, and built environments, as well as on evaluating relationships between mobile technology data and health to establish evidence-based guidelines. In reviewing these strategies and highlighting directions for future research, we advance the use of theory-based, personalized, and human-centered approaches in promoting health behaviors.", "generated_text": "This study explores the potential of mobile technology in promoting public health, focusing on physical activity and health behavior change. Drawing from a multidisciplinary perspective, we examine the integration of digital health tools, wearable sensors, and culturally relevant personalized medicine approaches. Our research synthesizes findings from public health, computer science, and behavioral psychology to develop a comprehensive framework for leveraging mobile technology in health promotion. We analyze the effectiveness of various mobile interventions, including smartphone applications and wearable devices, in encouraging sustained physical activity and positive health behaviors. Additionally, we investigate the role of personalization and cultural relevance in enhancing user engagement and long-term adherence to health promotion programs. Our findings highlight the promising potential of mobile technology in public health promotion and offer insights for developing more effective, user-centered digital health interventions.", "label": 1}
