{"grounding": "Given its origins in high-income countries, the field of physical activity and public health research and promotion has broadly followed a choice-based model. However, a substantial amount of the physical activity occurring routinely in many settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is the result of economic necessity and is not due to true, free choices. We propose the \u201cnecessity- versus choice-based physical activity models\u201d framework as a conceptual tool to ground physical activity and public health research and promotion efforts in LMICs, helping ensurethat these efforts are relevant, ethical, responsive, and respectful to local contexts. Identifying ways to ensure that LMIC populations can maintain high levels of active transport while increasing opportunities for active leisure must be prioritized. To promote equity, physical activity research, programs, and policies in LMICs must focus on improving the conditions under which necessity-driven physical activity occurs for a vast majority of the population.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex relationship between necessity-driven physical activity and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While physical activity is widely recognized as beneficial for health, the context in which it occurs in LMICs often stems from economic necessity rather than choice. We examine how active transport and labor-intensive occupations contribute to overall physical activity levels in these populations, and investigate the potential health implications of such necessity-driven movement. Our findings suggest that while these forms of physical activity may provide some health benefits, they are often associated with increased exposure to environmental hazards and occupational risks. We argue for a more nuanced approach to promoting physical activity in LMICs that considers the socioeconomic context and emphasizes the importance of safe, equitable, and sustainable options for movement. This research highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address the unique challenges of promoting health through physical activity in resource-limited settings.", "label": 1}
