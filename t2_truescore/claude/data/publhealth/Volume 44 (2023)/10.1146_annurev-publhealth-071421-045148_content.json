{"grounding": "The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events, are expected to increase and alter human migration and mobility. Climate-related mobility is not inherently a crisis; it can provide a pathway for adaptation to climate change. However, a growing body of research identifies health risks and some opportunities associated with climate-related mobility. This review examines recent research (published since 2018) on the climate change\u2013mobility\u2013health nexus; this research focuses largely on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. It considers the links between human mobility and anthropogenic climate change and documents the findings of empirical research that addresses the health consequences of displacement, planned relocation, migration, and migration into sites of climate risk. The findings highlight the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health care in a heating world.", "generated_text": "This review examines the complex interplay between climatic and environmental change, human migration, and health outcomes. As global temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, populations are increasingly displaced or compelled to relocate. We analyze the direct and indirect impacts of climate-induced migration on physical and mental health, considering both acute and chronic effects. The study explores various forms of mobility, including temporary displacement, planned relocation, and permanent migration, and their differential health implications. We also investigate the unique vulnerabilities of specific populations, such as indigenous communities and low-income groups. Our findings highlight the urgent need for interdisciplinary research, adaptive policies, and strengthened healthcare systems to address the emerging health challenges associated with climate-driven human mobility.", "label": 1}
