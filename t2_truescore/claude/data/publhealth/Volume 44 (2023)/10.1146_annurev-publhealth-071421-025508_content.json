{"grounding": "Heat is a dangerous hazard that causes acute heat illness, chronic disease exacerbations, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a range of injuries. Risks are highest during extreme heat events (EHEs), which challenge the capacity of health systems and other critical infrastructure. EHEs are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is driving an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality, necessitating more investment in health protection. Climate-resilient health systems are better positioned for EHEs, and EHE preparedness is a form of disaster risk reduction. Preparedness activities commonly take the form of heat action plans (HAPs), with many examples at various administrative scales. HAP activities can be divided into primary prevention, most important in the pre-event phase; secondary prevention, key to risk reduction early in an EHE;and tertiary prevention, important later in the event phase. After-action reports and other postevent evaluation activities are central to adaptive management of this climate-sensitive hazard.", "generated_text": "Extreme heat events pose significant public health risks, exacerbated by climate change. This study examines the effectiveness of heat action plans in mitigating the impacts of extreme heat on vulnerable populations. A comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies from various urban centers was conducted to identify best practices in public health preparedness. The research highlights the importance of early warning systems, community outreach, and targeted interventions for high-risk groups. Findings indicate that well-implemented heat action plans can significantly reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality. However, challenges remain in addressing socioeconomic disparities and improving urban infrastructure to enhance resilience. The study emphasizes the need for adaptive strategies that integrate climate change projections into long-term disaster risk reduction planning. Recommendations include strengthening cross-sector collaborations and investing in sustainable cooling solutions to better protect public health during extreme heat events.", "label": 0}
