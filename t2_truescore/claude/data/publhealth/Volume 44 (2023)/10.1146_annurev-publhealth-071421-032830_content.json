{"grounding": "Between the 2009 Great Recession and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US state and local governmental public health workforce lost 40,000 jobs. Tens of thousands of workers also left during the pandemic and continue to leave. As governmental health departments are now receiving multimillion-dollar, temporary federal investments to replenish their workforce, this review synthesizes the evidence regarding major challenges that preceded the pandemic and remain now. These include the lack of the field's ability to readily enumerate and define the governmental public health workforce as well as challenges with the recruitment and retention of public health workers. This review finds that many workforce-related challenges identified more than 20 years ago persist in the field today. Thus, it is critical that we look back to be able to then move forward to successfully rebuild the workforce and assure adequate capacity to protect the public's health and respond to public health emergencies.", "generated_text": "The US public health workforce faces significant challenges in recruitment, retention, and development. This review examines the current state of the public health workforce, highlighting ongoing issues and proposing future directions. Despite efforts to strengthen the workforce, persistent problems include inadequate funding, an aging workforce, and difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled professionals. The lack of comprehensive workforce enumeration data further complicates strategic planning. To address these challenges, the review recommends increased investment in workforce development programs, enhanced collaboration between academic institutions and public health agencies, and the implementation of innovative recruitment strategies. Additionally, the importance of standardized competency-based training and the need for improved data collection and analysis are emphasized. By addressing these critical areas, the US can work towards building a more robust and resilient public health workforce capable of meeting current and future health challenges.", "label": 1}
