{"grounding": "Housing quality is essential for population health and broader well-being. The World Health Organization Housing and health guidelines highlight interventions that protect occupants from cold and hot temperatures, injuries, and other hazards. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of ventilation standards. Housing standards are unevenly developed, implemented, and monitored globally, despite robust research demonstrating that retrofitting existing houses and constructing high-quality new ones can reduce respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and people with low incomes face cumulative disadvantages that are exacerbated by poor-quality housing. These can be partially ameliorated by community-based programs to improve housing quality, particularly for children and older people, who are hospitalized more often for housing-related illnesses. There is renewed interest among policy makers and researchers in the health and well-being of people in public and subsidized housing, who are disproportionately disadvantaged by avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries. Improving the overall quality of new and existing housing and neighborhoods has multiple cobenefits, including reducing carbon emissions.", "generated_text": "This review examines the intricate relationship between housing quality and inequalities in health and well-being. The study synthesizes existing literature to explore how various aspects of the indoor environment, including air quality, temperature, lighting, and noise levels, influence occupants' physical and mental health outcomes. The review highlights the disproportionate impact of poor housing conditions on vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing health disparities. It also investigates the potential co-benefits of improving housing quality, such as reduced healthcare costs and enhanced social cohesion. The analysis of current healthy housing guidelines reveals gaps in implementation and enforcement, particularly in low-income areas. The findings underscore the urgent need for evidence-based policies and interventions to address housing-related health inequalities. This review contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the importance of quality housing as a social determinant of health and provides recommendations for future research and policy directions to promote equitable access to healthy living environments.", "label": 0}
