{"grounding": "Public health surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data and is closely integrated with the timely dissemination of information that the public needs to know and upon which the public should act. Public health surveillance is central to modern public health practice by contributing data and information usually through a national notifiable disease reporting system (NNDRS). Although early identification and prediction of future disease trends may be technically feasible, more work is needed to improve accuracy so that policy makers can use these predictions to guide prevention and control efforts. In this article, we review the advantages and limitations of the current NNDRS in most countries, discuss some lessons learned about prevention and control from the first wave of COVID-19, and describe some technological innovations in public health surveillance, including geographic information systems (GIS), spatial modeling, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the digital twin method. We conclude that the technology-driven innovative public health surveillance systems are expected to further improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of case reporting during outbreaks and also enhance feedback and transparency, whereby all stakeholders should receive actionable information on control and be able to limit disease risk earlier than ever before.", "generated_text": "Public health surveillance systems play a crucial role in detecting and responding to emerging infectious diseases. This review explores recent innovations in surveillance methodologies, focusing on advancements in the national notifiable disease reporting system and their application to emerging infections, particularly COVID-19. We examine the integration of spatial modeling techniques and artificial intelligence in enhancing surveillance capabilities. The review highlights how these technologies improve real-time data collection, analysis, and visualization, enabling more rapid and targeted public health responses. Spatial modeling has significantly enhanced our understanding of disease spread patterns and risk factors, while AI algorithms have demonstrated potential in early outbreak detection and prediction. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption and refinement of these innovative approaches, leading to more robust and adaptable surveillance systems. However, challenges remain in data standardization, privacy concerns, and equitable implementation across diverse healthcare settings. This review underscores the importance of continued investment in and development of advanced surveillance technologies to strengthen global preparedness for future infectious disease threats.", "label": 1}
