{"grounding": "The implementation of primary and secondary preventive strategies is based on the evidence generated by cancer epidemiology, where the identification of risk factors and the description of their prevalence are fundamental to derive estimates on the burden of cancer from different etiologies, typically expressed as the population attributable fraction, which corresponds to the proportion of a cancer that may be prevented by controlling a given risk factor. However, even when cancer finds its etiology in modifiable factors, its prevention through the control of those factors is not always feasible, or it remains suboptimal despite the possibility of reducing the burden. We reviewed selected associations between modifiable risk factors and cancer, including tobacco smoking, occupational exposures, infections, air pollution, alcohol, and diet and obesity, and illustrated examples of both successes and failures in cancer control, underlying how current understanding of the avoidable causes of cancer is incomplete.", "generated_text": "This study provides a comprehensive analysis of cancers attributable to modifiable risk factors, offering a road map for prevention strategies. By examining attributable fractions across various risk factors, we identify key areas for targeted interventions in cancer control. Our findings reveal that a significant proportion of cancer cases could be prevented through lifestyle modifications and environmental improvements. We assess the impact of factors such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, diet, physical inactivity, and environmental exposures on cancer incidence. The results highlight the potential for substantial reductions in cancer burden through evidence-based prevention measures. This research emphasizes the importance of public health initiatives and policy changes aimed at addressing modifiable risk factors. By quantifying the avoidable cancer burden, we provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public to guide effective cancer prevention efforts and resource allocation.", "label": 0}
