{"grounding": "Rapid randomized controlled trials have been surprisingly rare in health care quality improvement (QI) and systems interventions. Applying clinical trials methodology QI work brings two distinct fields together, applying the robustness of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to the practical, operational learnings of the well-established QI field. Rapid trials also add a third element\u2014speed\u2014that enables health care systems to rapidly test multiple variations of an intervention in much the same way that A/B testing is done in the technology sector. When performed well, these rapid trials free researchers and health care systems from the requirement to be correct the first time (because it is low cost and quick to try something else) while offering a standard of evidence often absent in QI. Here we outline the historical underpinnings of this approach, provide guidance about how best to implement it, and describe lessons learned from running more than 20 randomized projects in the NYU Langone Health system.", "generated_text": "Health care systems face ongoing challenges in improving quality and safety. Traditional research methods often struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. This paper explores the potential of rapid randomized trials as an innovative approach to quality improvement in health care systems. By leveraging the principles of randomized controlled trials within shorter timeframes and more flexible designs, rapid trials can provide timely, actionable evidence to inform system-level changes. We review recent applications of this methodology across various healthcare settings, highlighting its advantages in addressing urgent safety concerns and optimizing resource allocation. Additionally, we discuss the ethical considerations and methodological challenges associated with implementing rapid trials in complex health care environments. Our findings suggest that rapid randomized trials offer a promising avenue for accelerating quality improvement efforts and enhancing patient outcomes in dynamic health care systems.", "label": 1}
