{"grounding": "In many cases, implementation approaches (composed of one or more strategies) may need to change over time to work optimally. We use a literature review to inform a mechanistic analysis of such on-the-go adaptations. We suggest that such adaptations of implementation strategies consist of three necessary steps. The first component is the initial effect of the implementation approach on intended implementation, service delivery, or clinical outcomes. Second, these initial effects must in turn be used to modify, alter, intensify, or otherwise change the implementation approach. Third, the modified approach itself has effects. Conceiving of adaptation as all three steps implies that a full understanding of adaptation involves (a) a sense of initial effects, (b) conceptualizing and documenting content and rationale for changes in approach (e.g., alteration, intensification), and (c) the effects of the changed approach (including how the latter effects depend on initial effects). Conceptualizing these steps can help researchers ask questions about adaptation (e.g., thresholds for change, dosing, potentiation, sequencing) to advance our understanding of implementation strategies.", "generated_text": "Implementation science has traditionally focused on pre-planned strategies to promote evidence-based practices in healthcare settings. However, emerging perspectives highlight the importance of on-the-go adaptation of implementation approaches to address dynamic contextual factors and unforeseen challenges. This review explores the concept of adaptive implementation in health settings, examining how practitioners and researchers modify strategies in real-time to enhance effectiveness and sustainability. We synthesize recent literature on adaptive implementation, identifying key drivers, mechanisms, and outcomes of on-the-go modifications. The review also discusses methodological approaches for studying adaptive implementation processes and their impact on implementation success. Furthermore, we highlight research gaps and opportunities for future studies, including the need for more robust theoretical frameworks, improved measurement tools, and longitudinal investigations of adaptive implementation trajectories. By advancing our understanding of on-the-go adaptation, this review aims to inform more flexible and responsive implementation approaches that can better navigate the complexities of real-world healthcare settings.", "label": 1}
