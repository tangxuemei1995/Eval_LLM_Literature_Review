{"grounding": "Taking stock of environmental justice (EJ) is daunting. It is at once a scholarly field, an ongoing social movement, and an administrative imperative adopted by government agencies and incorporated into legislation. Moreover, within academia, it is multidisciplinary and multimethodological, comprising scholars who do not always speak to one another. Any review of EJ is thus necessarily restrictive.\nThis article explores several facets of EJ activism. One is its coalitional and \u201cinside-outside\u201d orientation. EJ activists are constantly forming alliances with other stakeholders, but these coalitions do not flout the importance of engaging with formal institutions. The review next turns to one set of such institutions\u2014the courts and regulatory agencies\u2014to see how well EJ claims have fared there. I then survey scientific findings that have been influenced by EJ. The review concludes with future directions for activists and scholars to consider: the changing nature of EJ coalitions, fragmentation within EJ and with other fields, the historical roots of environmental injustice, and opportunities for stronger infusion of the EJ lens.", "generated_text": "Environmental justice has emerged as a critical field addressing the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities. This review examines the historical development of environmental justice, tracing its roots in the civil rights movement and its evolution into a multifaceted discipline. We explore key milestones, including the recognition of environmental racism and its impact on racial health disparities. The paper analyzes the role of structural racism in perpetuating environmental inequities and discusses the intersection of environmental justice with public health, urban planning, and policy-making. Furthermore, we investigate the growing influence of health advocacy and activism in shaping the environmental justice landscape. Looking ahead, we consider potential future directions for the field, including the integration of climate justice, the application of new technologies for monitoring and mitigation, and the expansion of environmental justice principles into global contexts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of environmental justice's past achievements and potential future trajectories.", "label": 1}
