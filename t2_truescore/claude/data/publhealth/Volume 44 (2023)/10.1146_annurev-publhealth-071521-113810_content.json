{"grounding": "Public health researchers are increasingly questioning the consequences of gentrification for population health and health equity, as witnessed in the rapid increase in public health publications on the health (equity) effects of gentrification. Despite methodological challenges, and mixed results from existing quantitative research, qualitative evidence to date points to the role of gentrification processes in exacerbating health inequities. Here we discuss past methodological and theoretical challenges in integrating the study of gentrification with public health research. We suggest taking an interdisciplinary approach, considering the conceptualization of gentrification in measurement techniques and conceiving this process as a direct exposure or as a part of broader neighborhood changes. Finally, we discuss existingpolicy approaches to mitigating and preventing gentrification and how these could be evaluated for effectiveness and as public health promotion and specifically as interventions to promote health equity.", "generated_text": "Gentrification, a process of urban transformation, has significant implications for health equity in cities worldwide. This theoretical and methodological guide explores the complex relationship between gentrification, displacement, and urban health outcomes. By synthesizing existing literature and proposing novel approaches, we aim to provide researchers and policymakers with a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing the health impacts of gentrification. The guide examines various methodologies for measuring displacement and health outcomes, discusses the role of urban regeneration in promoting or hindering health equity, and proposes strategies for mitigating negative health effects associated with gentrification. Additionally, we highlight the importance of community engagement and participatory research in developing effective interventions. This guide serves as a valuable resource for interdisciplinary collaboration in urban planning, public health, and social policy to promote health equity in rapidly changing urban environments.", "label": 1}
