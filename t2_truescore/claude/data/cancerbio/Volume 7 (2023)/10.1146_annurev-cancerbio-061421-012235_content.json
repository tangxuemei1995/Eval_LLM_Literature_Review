{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a new opportunity for cancer treatment; however, resistance can occur due to intrinsic (T cells), extrinsic (tumors), or acquired (tumors) factors. In many cases, the knowledge of these mechanisms comes from clinical observations of patients treated with CAR T cells. In addition, the structure of the CAR molecule and the manufacturing process can impact CAR T cell efficacy. Extrinsic factors such as the mutations in the tumor cell, or cells in the tumor microenvironment, can also play a role. Tumor cells may exhibit acquired antigen loss or heterogeneity that enables resistance to CAR T cell killing; additionally, myeloid cells, T regulatory cells, and fibroblasts can exert an immunosuppressive effect and abrogate CAR T cell antitumor efficacy. We will discuss these mechanisms of resistance and the novel approaches being used to overcome them to improve the widespread use of this promising cancer therapy.", "generated_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary approach in cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating remarkable success in treating certain hematological malignancies. However, the efficacy of CAR T cells in solid tumors remains limited due to various resistance mechanisms. This review explores the intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to CAR T cell resistance, including antigen loss, T cell exhaustion, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We discuss the molecular and cellular pathways involved in these resistance mechanisms and highlight potential strategies to overcome them. Recent advances in CAR design, combination therapies, and novel targeting approaches are examined as promising avenues to enhance CAR T cell efficacy. Understanding and addressing these resistance mechanisms is crucial for improving the clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapy and expanding its application to a broader range of cancer types.", "label": 1}
