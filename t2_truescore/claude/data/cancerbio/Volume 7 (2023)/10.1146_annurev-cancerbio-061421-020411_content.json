{"grounding": "The principle of independent drug action proposes that responses to drug combinations result from responses to one or the other of two combining agents, but not both. Explorations of biological pathway interactions in signal transduction and immunobiology as synergy have not been connected to mathematical demonstrations of above\u2013independent action activity, which would define pharmacologic synergy. We review independent action as the explanation for cancer drug combinations and find no evidence for pharmacologic synergy. Rather, a measure of correlation of response (\u03c1) when positive can explain below\u2013independent action results, and negative correlation can explain above\u2013independent action results. Anticorrelated responses may be a mathematical demonstration of collateral sensitivity, which can achieve above\u2013independent action activity. Inappropriate use of biological concepts of synergy may be contributing to high failure rates for immuno-oncology clinical trials, indicating a need for more rigorous applications of independent action to the development of cancer drug combination therapy.", "generated_text": "Combination therapies have emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment, offering potential advantages over single-agent interventions. This review explores the rationales behind combining therapies, focusing on three key mechanisms: independent action, response correlation, and collateral sensitivity, as well as synergy. We examine how these concepts influence treatment outcomes and discuss their implications for clinical trial design. Particular attention is given to the role of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in combination strategies, highlighting their potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy. By analyzing the interplay between different treatment modalities, we aim to provide insights into optimizing combination therapies for improved patient outcomes. This comprehensive overview of combination therapy rationales serves as a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop more effective cancer treatment strategies and design targeted clinical trials.", "label": 1}
