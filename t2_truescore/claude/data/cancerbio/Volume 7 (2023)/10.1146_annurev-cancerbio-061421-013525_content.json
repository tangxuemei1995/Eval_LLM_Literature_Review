{"grounding": "Estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 is expressed in the vast majority of breast cancers and is one of the most successfully prosecuted drug targets in oncology, with multiple classes of endocrine therapies approved for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer. These existing agents are highly active, both as single agents and as combination partners for other targeted therapies, and have significantly benefited patients. However, each of these standard-of-care (SOC) therapies has liabilities that allow for the reengagement of ER signaling as a mechanism of resistance. Data supporting the continued dependence of tumors on ER signaling following exposure to SOC agents have underpinned an extraordinary reenergizing of academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical groups pursuing next-generation ER-targeted therapies. The hypothesis that there remains an opportunity to bring further meaningful benefit to patients through fully optimized ER-targeted therapies is currently being investigated in the clinic.", "generated_text": "Estrogen receptor (ER) signaling plays a crucial role in breast cancer development and progression. This review explores the latest advancements in ER-targeted therapeutics, focusing on next-generation selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs). We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these novel compounds and their potential to overcome resistance to current endocrine therapies. The review highlights recent clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of emerging SERMs and SERDs, as well as their impact on patient outcomes. Additionally, we examine combination strategies involving these agents with other targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Finally, we address the challenges and future directions in developing more potent and selective ER-targeted therapeutics, emphasizing the importance of personalized medicine approaches in breast cancer treatment.", "label": 0}
