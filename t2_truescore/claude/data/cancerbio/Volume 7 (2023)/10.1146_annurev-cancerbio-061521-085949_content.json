{"grounding": "Myeloid cells represent a dominant cellular compartment of tumor lesions and play key roles in tumor inception, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), which include dendritic cells and macrophages, are unique among myeloid cells, as they not only shape both the broader composition and state of the tumor microenvironment but can also specifically instruct cancer-specific, T cell\u2013mediated tumor cell killing, making them especially attractive targets for cancer treatment. Although MNPs remain difficult to modulate therapeutically, our understanding of MNP biology in the antitumor immune response has expanded significantly, offering hope for new possibilities in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the recent advances in our study of the cellular identity, molecular diversity, and spatial organization of MNPs in tumors, and we discuss the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to incorporate these new insights into cancer treatment design.", "generated_text": "This review explores the pivotal roles of macrophages and dendritic cells in the cancer microenvironment, focusing on their biological functions and potential as therapeutic targets. We examine the complex interactions between these mononuclear phagocytes and tumor cells, highlighting their impact on cancer progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. The plasticity of macrophages and dendritic cells in response to environmental cues is discussed, emphasizing their dual nature in both promoting and inhibiting tumor growth. We analyze current strategies for modulating these cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity, including reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages and optimizing dendritic cell-based immunotherapies. Additionally, we evaluate emerging approaches that combine targeting of mononuclear phagocytes with existing cancer treatments. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the intricate biology of macrophages and dendritic cells in cancer and their potential for therapeutic manipulation.", "label": 1}
