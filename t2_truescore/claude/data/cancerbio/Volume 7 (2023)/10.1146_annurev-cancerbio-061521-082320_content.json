{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been a great success in CD19+ hematological diseases. Natural killer (NK) CAR cells offer an alternative to CAR T cells with an intrinsic potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. The choice of cell type and the choice of CAR are both relevant for the feasibility, effectivity, engraftment, persistence, side effects, and safety of the cell therapy. Until recently CAR NK cells have proven difficult to develop into therapeutic products. Here, we give an overview of the source of CAR NK cells, gene transfer methods, and the manufacture of CAR NK cells for clinical application. We discuss improvements, as well as future options and problems that need to be addressed.", "generated_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells represent a promising frontier in cancer immunotherapy. This review explores the potential of CAR NK cells as an off-the-shelf product for cancer treatment, highlighting their advantages over traditional CAR T cells. We discuss the unique properties of NK cells, including their innate tumor-killing abilities and reduced risk of cytokine release syndrome. The article examines recent advancements in CAR NK cell engineering, focusing on enhanced targeting specificity and persistence. Additionally, we address challenges in large-scale production and clinical translation. With ongoing clinical trials showing encouraging results, CAR NK cells are poised to revolutionize cancer treatment, offering a potentially safer and more accessible alternative to current cell therapies.", "label": 1}
