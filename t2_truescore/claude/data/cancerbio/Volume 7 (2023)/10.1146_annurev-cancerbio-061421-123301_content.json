{"grounding": "During tumor evolution, cancer cells can acquire the ability to proliferate, invade neighboring tissues, evade the immune system, and spread systemically. Tracking this process remains challenging, as many key events occur stochastically and over long times, which could be addressed by studying the phylogenetic relationships among cancer cells. Several lineage tracing approaches have been developed and employed in many tumor models and contexts, providing critical insights into tumor evolution. Recent advances in single-cell lineage tracing have greatly expanded the resolution, scale, and readout of lineage tracing toolkits. In this review, we provide an overview of static lineage tracing methods, and then focus on evolving lineage tracing technologies that enable reconstruction of tumor phylogenies at unprecedented resolution. We also discuss in vivo applications of these technologies to profile subclonal dynamics, quantify tumor plasticity, and track metastasis. Finally, we highlight outstanding questions and emerging technologies for building comprehensive cancer evolution roadmaps.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in lineage tracing techniques have revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology and tumor evolution. This review explores cutting-edge tools for in vivo lineage tracing in cancer research, focusing on single-cell analysis and cell barcoding methods. We discuss how these technologies enable the tracking of individual cancer cells and their progeny throughout tumor progression and metastasis. The integration of genetic barcoding with high-throughput sequencing has provided unprecedented insights into clonal dynamics and heterogeneity within tumors. Additionally, we examine the application of CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage tracing systems, which offer enhanced spatiotemporal resolution and multiplexing capabilities. These innovative approaches have revealed critical information about cancer stem cells, therapy resistance, and metastatic potential. By elucidating the complex cellular hierarchies and evolutionary trajectories within tumors, these new lineage tracing tools are poised to significantly impact cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies.", "label": 1}
