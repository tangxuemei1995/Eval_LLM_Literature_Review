{"grounding": "Normal tissues progressively acquire mutations. Some mutations are positively selected, driving clonal expansions that may colonize the majority of a tissue by old age. In several cases mutant clonal expansion is due to biasing stem cell fate toward proliferation. However, the expansionary phase is transient and is followed by reversion toward wild-type behavior so that normal tissue integrity is retained. Here we consider the implications of these findings for carcinogenesis. We propose that to be considered a cancer driver, a mutant gene should be more prevalent in tumors than the normal lineage from which it emerged. Cancer risk is not dependent on mutational burden, but rather may reflect the relative frequency of pro- and anti-oncogenic mutants within a tissue. Understanding the basis of mutant clonal advantage over wild-type cells allows interventions to halt the expansion or even deplete oncogenic mutants from normal tissue, potentially lowering cancer risk.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in sequencing technologies have revealed the presence of somatic mutations in normal tissues, challenging our understanding of early carcinogenesis. This review explores the accumulation of mutations in stem cells throughout the aging process and their potential role in cancer initiation. We discuss how environmental carcinogens and endogenous processes contribute to the mutational landscape of normal tissues, and examine the implications for cancer prevention strategies. The concept of field cancerization is revisited in light of these findings, highlighting the importance of early detection and intervention. Furthermore, we analyze the interplay between stem cell dynamics, tissue microenvironment, and mutational burden in driving neoplastic transformation. This emerging field offers new perspectives on cancer risk assessment and opens avenues for developing targeted prevention approaches aimed at maintaining genomic integrity in aging tissues.", "label": 1}
