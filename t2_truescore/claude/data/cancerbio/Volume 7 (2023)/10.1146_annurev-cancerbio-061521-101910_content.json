{"grounding": "Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with tumor progression in several clinical and experimental settings and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Its relation to cancer immunosurveillance is complex. Clonally heterogeneous tumors are associated with decreased immunosurveillance and are less responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition, but the mechanistic basis underlying these observations remains unclear. One possibility is that tumors that are under active immunosurveillance are relatively homogeneous because immunosurveillance prevents the outgrowth of immunogenic subclones. Alternatively, high ITH might directly impair immunosurveillance due to lower dosages of subclonal antigens, competition between antigens and immunodominance, the induction of detrimental T cell differentiation programs, or negative feedback loops. Here we review the evidence for these scenarios and outline hypotheses that could underlie the negative association between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance.", "generated_text": "Intratumor heterogeneity poses significant challenges in cancer treatment, particularly in the context of immunotherapy. This review explores the complex relationship between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance, focusing on its implications for immune checkpoint inhibition. We examine how diverse subclonal populations within tumors can influence immune recognition, escape mechanisms, and treatment responses. Recent studies have revealed that clonal neoantigen burden and T cell infiltration patterns are critical determinants of immunotherapy efficacy. Furthermore, we discuss how heterogeneity-driven immune evasion strategies can lead to treatment resistance and disease progression. Understanding these intricate interactions is crucial for developing more effective immunotherapeutic approaches and personalized treatment strategies. This review highlights the need for innovative techniques to assess and target clonal heterogeneity in order to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.", "label": 1}
