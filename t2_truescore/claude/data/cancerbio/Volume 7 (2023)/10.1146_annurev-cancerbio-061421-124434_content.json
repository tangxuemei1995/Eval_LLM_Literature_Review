{"grounding": "Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that promotes tissue homeostasis by identifying damaged cells for immune-mediated clearance. Thus, the ability to evade senescence and the ensuing immune surveillance is a hallmark of cancer. Reactivation of senescence programs can result in profound immune-mediated tumor regressions or sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, although the aberrant persistence of senescent cells can promote tissue decline and contribute to the side effects of some cancer therapies. In this review, we first briefly describe the discovery of senescence as a tumor-suppressive program. Next, we highlight the dueling good and bad effects of the senescence-associated secretory program (SASP) in cancer, including SASP-dependent immune effects. We then summarize the beneficial and deleterious effects of senescence induction by cancer therapies and strategies in development to leverage senescence therapeutically. Finally, we highlight challenges and unmet needs in understanding senescence in cancer and developing senescence-modulating therapies.", "generated_text": "Cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, plays a complex and paradoxical role in cancer biology. This review explores the dual nature of senescence in tumor suppression and promotion. We discuss how senescence acts as a barrier to malignant transformation through growth arrest and immune surveillance, while simultaneously contributing to tumor progression via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The potential of therapy-induced senescence as a cancer treatment strategy is examined, along with the emerging concept of 'one-two punch' therapy combining senescence induction with senolytic drugs. We also address the challenges and opportunities in targeting senescent cells within the tumor microenvironment. This comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between senescence and cancer, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach in harnessing senescence for therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
