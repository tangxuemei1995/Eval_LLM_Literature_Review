{"grounding": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors induce significant and durable treatment responses in about 20% of all cancers, but many patients have natural resistance to current immunotherapies. The past decade of technological advances has resulted in large-scale profiling of many cancers and their tumor microenvironments, rapidly expanding our understanding of the mechanisms utilized by tumors to create immune-resistant microenvironments. In this review, we discuss key factors that create immune resistance and emerging concepts that are redefining how we view immune resistance, as well as highlight novel strategies that aim to convert immune-resistant into immune-sensitive tumors.", "generated_text": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet many tumors remain unresponsive due to their 'cold' immunosuppressive microenvironment. This review explores strategies to convert cold tumors into 'hot' immunogenic ones, enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We discuss approaches such as radiation therapy, oncolytic viruses, and targeted molecular agents that can stimulate immune cell infiltration and activation. Recent clinical trials combining these strategies with immunotherapies are examined, highlighting promising outcomes and potential challenges. By understanding and manipulating the tumor microenvironment, we can potentially expand the reach of immunotherapy to a broader range of cancer patients.", "label": 1}
