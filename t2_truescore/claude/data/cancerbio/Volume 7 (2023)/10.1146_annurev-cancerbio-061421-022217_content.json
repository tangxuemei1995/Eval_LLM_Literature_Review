{"grounding": "Ultrahigh\u2013dose rate FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a potentially paradigm-shifting treatment modality that holds the promise of expanding the therapeutic index for nearly any cancer. At the heart of this exciting technology comes the capability to ameliorate major normal tissue complications without compromising the efficacy of tumor killing. This combination of benefits has now been termed the FLASH effect and relies on an in vivo validation to rigorously demonstrate the absence of normal tissue toxicity. The FLASH effect occurs when the overall irradiation time is extremely short (<500 ms), and in this review we attempt to understand how FLASH-RT can kill tumors but spare normal tissues\u2014likely the single most pressing question confronting the field today.", "generated_text": "FLASH radiotherapy, characterized by ultrahigh dose rates, has emerged as a groundbreaking approach in cancer treatment. This review explores the fundamental principles of FLASH radiotherapy and its potential to revolutionize radiobiology. We compare FLASH to conventional radiotherapy, highlighting its unique ability to spare normal tissues while maintaining isoefficient tumor killing. The underlying mechanisms of the FLASH effect are examined, including oxygen depletion, DNA damage response, and immune system modulation. We discuss the challenges in translating FLASH to clinical practice, such as technical limitations and dosimetry concerns. Finally, we consider the implications of FLASH for radiobiology research and the need to reevaluate established radiobiological models in light of this innovative treatment modality.", "label": 1}
