{"grounding": "With the significant successes of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cellular therapy, immunotherapy has now become an established treatment option to effectively treat cancer. However, the full potential of this treatment modality has yet to be realized, as there are many additional mechanisms whereby tumors continue to evade immune destruction. To this end, metabolic reprogramming by cancer cells serves not only to promote their own growth but also to create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The tumor metabolic microenvironment not only inhibits antitumor effector function but also supports the differentiation and function of suppressive immune cells. In this review, we delineate the major metabolic programs of cancer cells and immune cells. Furthermore, we discuss the role of so-called metabolic checkpoints that promote immune evasion and tumor growth. Finally, we review current and potential future strategies to target metabolism in order to not simply inhibit tumor growth but also enhance antitumor immune responses. Such strategies have the great potential to enhance the breadth and depth of immunotherapy for cancer by targeting metabolic checkpoints.", "generated_text": "The intersection of immune cell metabolism and immuno-oncology has emerged as a critical area of research in cancer therapeutics. This review explores the complex interplay between immune cell metabolic pathways and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the potential for targeting metabolic processes to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. We discuss how cancer cells manipulate the metabolic landscape to evade immune surveillance and suppress effector immune cell functions. Recent advances in understanding the metabolic requirements of various immune cell subsets, including T cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells, are examined. Additionally, we evaluate promising strategies for metabolic reprogramming of immune cells to improve their anti-tumor efficacy. The review also addresses the challenges and opportunities in developing metabolism-targeted immunotherapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the metabolic crosstalk between immune cells and cancer cells. Overall, this work underscores the importance of immunometabolism in shaping the future of immuno-oncology and personalized cancer treatment approaches.", "label": 1}
