{"grounding": "T cell reactivity to tumor-specific neoantigens can drive endogenous and therapeutically induced antitumor immunity. However, most tumor-specific neoantigens are unique to each patient (private) and targeting them requires personalized therapy. A smaller subset of neoantigens includes epitopes that span recurrent mutation hotspots, translocations, or gene fusions in oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors, as well as epitopes that arise from viral oncogenic proteins. Such antigens are likely to be shared across patients (public), uniformly expressed within a tumor, and required for cancer cell survival and fitness. Although a limited number of these public neoantigens are naturally immunogenic, recent studies affirm their clinical utility. In this review, we highlight efforts to target mutant KRAS, mutant p53, and epitopes derived from oncogenic viruses using T cells engineered with off-the-shelf T cell receptors. We also discuss the challenges and strategies to achieving more effective T cell therapies, particularly in the context of solid tumors.", "generated_text": "This review explores the potential of T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular therapy in targeting driver oncogenes and public neoantigens for cancer treatment. We discuss recent advances in identifying and characterizing these tumor-specific antigens, which are shared across multiple patients and cancer types. The study highlights the advantages of targeting public neoantigens, including their prevalence and potential for off-the-shelf therapies. We examine various TCR-based approaches, such as engineered T cells and TCR-mimic antibodies, and their efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings. Additionally, we address challenges in developing these therapies, including optimal target selection, TCR affinity optimization, and potential off-target effects. The review concludes by outlining future directions for improving TCR-based cellular therapies and their potential impact on cancer immunotherapy outcomes.", "label": 1}
