{"grounding": "Histopathology plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and subtyping of solid tumors and has become a cornerstone of modern precision oncology. Histopathological evaluation is typically performed manually by expert pathologists due to the complexity of visual data. However, in the last ten years, new artificial intelligence (AI) methods have made it possible to train computers to perform visual tasks with high performance, reaching similar levels as experts in some applications. In cancer histopathology, these AI tools could help automate repetitive tasks, making more efficient use of pathologists\u2019 time. In research studies, AI methods have been shown to have an astounding ability to predict genetic alterations and identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers directly from routine tissue slides. Here, we give an overview of these recent applications of AI in computational pathology, focusing on new tools for cancer research that could be pivotal in identifying clinical biomarkers for better treatment decisions.", "generated_text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing computational pathology in cancer research and diagnosis. This review explores the integration of machine learning and deep learning techniques in oncology, focusing on their applications in tumor detection, biomarker identification, and histopathological analysis. We examine how AI-driven approaches are enhancing diagnostic workflows, improving accuracy, and potentially leading to better clinical outcomes. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities in implementing AI systems for analyzing complex pathological data, including issues of data quality, model interpretability, and clinical validation. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of AI to uncover novel biomarkers and patterns in histopathological images that may escape human detection. While acknowledging the promising advancements, we also address the need for robust validation studies and ethical considerations in the clinical adoption of AI-assisted pathology tools for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.", "label": 1}
