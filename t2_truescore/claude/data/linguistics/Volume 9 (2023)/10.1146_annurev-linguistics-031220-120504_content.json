{"grounding": "Language documentation as a subfield of linguistics has arisen over the past roughly two and a half decades more or less simultaneously with the widespread availability of inexpensive hardware and software for creating, storing, and sharing digital objects. Thus, in some ways the history of advancements within the discipline is also a history of how technological tools have been developed, tested, adopted, and eventually abandoned as newer technologies appear. In this article we examine some recent technologies used both for creating documentary resources, usually considered to include recorded language events in a variety of genres and settings and enough annotation to make them decipherable, and for then mobilizing those resources so that they can be used and shared in language learning, reclamation, revitalization, and analysis.", "generated_text": "This paper surveys recent technological advancements in language documentation, focusing on resource creation and mobilization. We examine innovative tools and platforms that have emerged in the past decade, enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of language documentation processes. Key areas of progress include mobile applications for field data collection, cloud-based collaboration systems, and automated transcription and annotation tools. The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in language documentation workflows is also discussed, highlighting their potential to accelerate resource creation and analysis. Additionally, we explore novel approaches to resource mobilization, such as crowdsourcing and gamification, which have expanded participation in language documentation efforts. This review underscores the transformative impact of technology on the field and identifies promising directions for future research and development.", "label": 1}
