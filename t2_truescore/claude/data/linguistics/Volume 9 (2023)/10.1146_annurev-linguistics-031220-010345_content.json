{"grounding": "Much has been written on the abuse and misuse of statistical methods, including p values, statistical significance, and so forth. I present some of the best practices in statistics using a running example data analysis. Focusing primarily on frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models, I illustrate some defensible ways in which statistical inference\u2014specifically, hypothesis testing using Bayes factors versus estimation or uncertainty quantification\u2014can be carried out. The key is to not overstate the evidence and to not expect too much from statistics. Along the way, I demonstrate some powerful ideas, including the use of simulation to understand the design properties of one's experiment before running it, visualization of data before carrying out a formal analysis, and simulation of data from the fitted model to understand the model's behavior.", "generated_text": "This paper addresses critical issues in the analysis of experimental linguistic data, proposing a shift towards more robust and informative statistical approaches. We advocate for the adoption of Bayesian methods as a superior alternative to traditional null hypothesis significance testing. The benefits of Bayesian analysis, including the ability to quantify uncertainty and compare competing hypotheses using Bayes factors, are discussed in the context of psycholinguistic research. We provide practical guidelines for implementing these methods and interpreting their results. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of pre-registration, power analysis, and effect size estimation in experimental design. By embracing these 'right ways' of data analysis, researchers can enhance the reliability and reproducibility of their findings, ultimately advancing our understanding of language processing and acquisition.", "label": 0}
