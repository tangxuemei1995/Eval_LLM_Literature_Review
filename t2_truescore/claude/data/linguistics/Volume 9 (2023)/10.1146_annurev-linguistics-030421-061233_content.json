{"grounding": "Detailed comparative studies have revealed many surface similarities between linguistic communication and the communication of nonhumans. How should we interpret these discoveries in linguistic and cognitive perspective? We review the literature with a specific focus on analogy (similar features and function but not shared ancestry) and homology (shared ancestry). We conclude that combinatorial features of animal communication are analogous but not homologous to natural language. Homologies are found instead in cognitive capacities of attention manipulation, which are enriched in humans, making possible many distinctive forms of communication, including language use. We therefore present a new, graded taxonomy of means of attention manipulation, including a new class we call Ladyginian, which is related to but slightly broader than the more familiar class of Gricean interaction. Only in the latter do actors have the goal of revealing specifically informative intentions. Great ape interaction may be best characterized as Ladyginian but not Gricean.", "generated_text": "This study explores animal communication from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, drawing on seminal works by Washburn, Ladygina-Kohts, and Grice. It examines the extent to which animal communication systems exhibit key features of human language, such as duality of patterning and generativity. The research synthesizes findings from comparative cognition studies to assess the cognitive underpinnings of animal communication across various species. By analyzing vocalizations, gestures, and other communicative behaviors, the study investigates the presence of Gricean maxims and intentionality in animal interactions. The findings reveal both similarities and differences between human and animal communication systems, highlighting the evolutionary continuum of cognitive and linguistic abilities. This interdisciplinary approach provides new insights into the nature of communication and cognition, contributing to our understanding of language evolution and the cognitive capacities of non-human animals.", "label": 0}
