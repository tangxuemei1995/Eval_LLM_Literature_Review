{"grounding": "Environmental linguistics is an emerging field at the intersection of linguistics and natural sciences. It recognizes the mutual relationship between cultural and ecological diversity, documenting linguistic structures and verbal practices by which speakers conceptualize, encode, and transmit knowledge about the natural world. It surpasses the largely metaphorical and narrative program of ecolinguistics to position language as the preeminent conceptual framework and channel for environmental knowledge. Natural phenomena\u2014as Indigenous experts explain\u2014cannot be understood apart from the languages that encode them, and vice versa. Language diversity is thus the key to safeguarding biodiversity and a balanced human relationship with nature. Environmental linguistics helps decolonize linguistics as our field evolves to prioritize knowledge coproduction over data extraction. Examples from my fieldwork in Tuva cover six domains of knowledge: landscapes, lifeforms, time, sound, memory, and survival. This article reviews recent literature from many cultures, emphasizing works by Indigenous authors.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of environmental linguistics, biodiversity conservation, and indigenous knowledge systems, focusing on the Tuvan people of Southern Siberia. By examining the relationship between language, ecological understanding, and environmental stewardship, we investigate how native science and environmental intelligence contribute to sustainable practices. The research employs a decolonial approach to highlight the importance of preserving indigenous languages and traditional ecological knowledge in biodiversity conservation efforts. Through ethnographic fieldwork and linguistic analysis, we demonstrate how Tuvan language encodes crucial environmental information and supports adaptive strategies for ecosystem management. Our findings suggest that integrating native science with contemporary conservation approaches can enhance biodiversity protection and promote more holistic environmental policies. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on environmental linguistics and emphasizes the need for collaborative, culturally-sensitive approaches to global environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
