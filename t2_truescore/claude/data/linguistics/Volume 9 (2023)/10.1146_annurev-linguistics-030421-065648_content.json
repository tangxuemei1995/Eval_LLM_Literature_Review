{"grounding": "Chinese developmental dyslexia (DD) research provides important insights into the language-universal and language-specific mechanisms underlying dyslexia. In this article, we review recent advances in Chinese DD. Converging behavioral evidence suggests that, while phonological and rapid automatized naming deficits are language universal, orthographic and morphological deficits are specific to the linguistic properties of Chinese. At the neural level, hypoactivation in the left superior temporal/inferior frontal regions in dyslexic children across Chinese and alphabetic languages may indicate a shared phonological processing deficit, whereas hyperactivation in the right inferior occipital/middle temporal regions and atypical activation in the left frontal areas in Chinese dyslexic children may indicate a language-specific compensatory strategy for impaired visual-spatial analysis and a morphological deficit in Chinese DD, respectively. The findings call for further theoretical endeavors to understand the language-universal and Chinese-specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying dyslexia and to design more effective and efficient intervention programs.", "generated_text": "This review examines recent advances in understanding Chinese developmental dyslexia, focusing on linguistic profiles, brain abnormalities, and genetic factors. Research reveals both language-universal and language-specific characteristics in Chinese dyslexia. Linguistic profiles highlight deficits in phonological awareness, rapid naming, and orthographic processing. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate structural and functional abnormalities in left-hemisphere reading-related regions, with some unique features compared to alphabetic languages. Genetic investigations have identified several susceptibility genes, some shared with other populations and others potentially specific to Chinese dyslexia. The interplay between universal and language-specific factors in Chinese dyslexia underscores the importance of cross-linguistic research. This review synthesizes current findings, discusses their implications for diagnosis and intervention, and identifies areas for future investigation to enhance our understanding of developmental dyslexia in Chinese and other writing systems.", "label": 1}
