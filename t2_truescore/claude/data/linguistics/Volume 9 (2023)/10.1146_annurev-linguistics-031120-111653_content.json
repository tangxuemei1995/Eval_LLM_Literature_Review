{"grounding": "Interpreting anaphoric references is a fundamental aspect of our language competence that has long attracted the attention of computational linguists. The appearance of ever-larger anaphorically annotated data sets covering more and more anaphoric phenomena in ever-greater detail has spurred the development of increasingly more sophisticated computational models; as a result, the most recent state-of-the-art neural models are able to achieve impressive performance by leveraging linguistic, lexical, discourse, and encyclopedic information. This article provides a thorough survey of anaphora resolution (coreference) throughout this development, reviewing the available data sets and covering both the preneural history of the field and\u2014in more detail\u2014current neural models, including research on less-studied aspects of anaphoric interpretation such as bridging reference resolution and discourse deixis interpretation.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of computational models for anaphora resolution, a crucial task in natural language processing. We examine various approaches, including traditional rule-based methods, machine learning techniques, and state-of-the-art neural models. The study analyzes the effectiveness of these models in addressing different types of anaphora, such as coreference, bridging reference, and discourse deixis. We also discuss the challenges posed by the Winograd Schema Challenge and its implications for anaphora resolution systems. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of corpora availability and quality on model performance. Our findings highlight the recent advancements in neural models for coreference resolution while identifying areas for future research to improve the handling of complex anaphoric phenomena.", "label": 1}
