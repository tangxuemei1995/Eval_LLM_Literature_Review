{"grounding": "The term homesign has been used to describe the signing of deaf individuals who have not had sustained access to the linguistic resources of a named language. Early studies of child homesigners focused on documenting their manual communication systems through the lens of developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics, but a recent wave of linguistic ethnographic investigations is challenging many of the established theoretical presuppositions that underlie the foundational homesign research. Sparked by a larger critical movement within Deaf Studies led by deaf scholars, this new generation of scholarship interrogates how researchers portray deaf individuals and their communication practices and questions the conceptualization of language in the foundational body of homesign research. In this review, we discuss these contested issues and the current moment of transition within research on homesign.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the contentious issues surrounding homesign, a gestural communication system developed by deaf individuals without access to conventional sign languages. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and linguistic ethnographic studies, we explore the debates concerning homesign's status as a language, its role in language emergence, and its sociolinguistic implications. The research highlights the complex interplay between homesign and established sign languages, addressing questions of linguistic complexity, grammatical structure, and communicative efficacy. We investigate the challenges faced by homesigners in various social contexts and the potential impact of homesign on deaf education and language policy. By synthesizing diverse perspectives from sociolinguistics and language acquisition studies, this paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of homesign's place within the broader landscape of human communication and language development.", "label": 1}
