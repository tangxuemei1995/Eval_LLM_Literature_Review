{"grounding": "In response to uncovering brain mechanisms underlying vocal communication and searching for biomarkers for mental illnesses, speech prosody has been increasingly studied in recent years in multiple disciplines, including psycholinguistics. In this article, we provide an up-to-date synthesis of the theoretical foundation and empirical evidence to profile linguistic and emotional prosody in the proper characterization of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. Our review reveals a need to develop theoretically motivated and methodologically integrated approaches to the study of context-driven comprehension and expression of pragmatic-affective prosody, which will help elucidate the core features of socio-communicative problems in individuals with mental disorders. We propose that comprehensive models within and across the conventional cognition-emotion-language trichotomy need to be developed to integrate current findings and guide future research. In particular, there needs to be due emphasis on investigating multisensory and cross-modal effects in normal and pathological prosody research. Our review calls for multidisciplinary efforts to address the challenging issues to inform and inspire the advancement of linguistic theories and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.", "generated_text": "Speech prosody plays a crucial role in human communication, conveying both linguistic and paralinguistic information. This review examines the relationship between speech prosody and mental disorders, focusing on prosody recognition, production, and pragmatic and affective aspects. We synthesize findings from recent studies investigating prosodic abnormalities in various mental disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, autism spectrum disorders, and anxiety disorders. The literature reveals consistent patterns of impaired prosody recognition and production across multiple disorders, with varying degrees of severity. Pragmatic prosody deficits are particularly pronounced in autism spectrum disorders, while affective prosody abnormalities are common in mood disorders. These prosodic disturbances can significantly impact social functioning and quality of life for individuals with mental disorders. We discuss potential underlying mechanisms, including neurocognitive deficits and altered brain connectivity. Finally, we highlight the clinical implications of these findings and suggest directions for future research, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve prosodic abilities in individuals with mental disorders.", "label": 1}
