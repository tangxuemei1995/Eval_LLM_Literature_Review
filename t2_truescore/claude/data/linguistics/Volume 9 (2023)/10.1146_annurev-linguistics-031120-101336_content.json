{"grounding": "The actuation problem asks why a linguistic change occurs in a particular language at a particular time and space. Responses to this problem are multifaceted. This review approaches the problem of actuation through the lens of sound change, examining it from both individual and population perspectives. Linguistic changes ultimately actuate in the form of idiolectal differences. An understanding of language change actuation at the idiolectal level requires an understanding of (a) how individual speaker-listeners\u2019 different past linguistic experiences and physical, perceptual, cognitive, and social makeups affect the way they process and analyze the primary learning data and (b) how these factors lead to divergent representations and grammars across speakers-listeners. Population-level incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovation depend not only on the nature of contact between speakers with unique idiolects but also on individuals who have the wherewithal to take advantage of the linguistic innovations they encountered to achieve particular ideological projects at any given moment. Because of the vast number of contingencies that need to be aligned properly, the incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovation are predicted to be rare. Agent-based modeling promises to provide a controlled way to investigate the stochastic nature of language change propagation, but a comprehensive model of linguistic change actuation at the individual level remains elusive.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the actuation problem in sound change, focusing on the role of individual differences in cognitive processing styles. While previous research has explored various factors contributing to linguistic change, the specific mechanisms triggering actuation remain elusive. We propose that variations in cognitive processing styles among speakers may play a crucial role in initiating and propagating sound changes. Using agent-based modeling, we simulate a population of speakers with diverse cognitive profiles, incorporating factors such as attention to phonetic detail, memory capacity, and social network position. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between these individual differences and environmental factors can lead to the emergence and spread of novel linguistic variants. Specifically, we find that speakers with heightened sensitivity to phonetic variation are more likely to initiate sound changes, while those with strong social connections facilitate their propagation. This study contributes to our understanding of the actuation problem by highlighting the importance of cognitive heterogeneity in linguistic communities and provides a framework for future research on the complex interplay between individual and social factors in language change.", "label": 1}
