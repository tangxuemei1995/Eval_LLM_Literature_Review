{"grounding": "Impersonal pronouns are prototypically used in generic sentences to make generalizations about people. Yet they are unlike bare plural people or indefinite singular a person in that they exhibit a sensitivity to first-person perspective. This relationship can be seen in (a) inferences of first-person experience associated with use of these pronouns, (b) additional meaning components carried by impersonally used personal pronouns involving a presumption of empathy or (dis)agreement, and (c) their interpretation in attitude reports, including referential dependency on the attitude holder and the de se/de re distinction. I survey recent findings on the perspectival interpretation of impersonal pronouns including English generic one, German man, French on, and Italian si, as well as impersonally used personal pronouns like English you and German ich and du. I end by identifying some common themes emerging from recent formal semantic analyses of impersonal pronouns. One of the key notions here is the treatment of impersonals as Heimian indefinites, which in generic contexts get bound by the generic operator.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the relationship between impersonal pronouns and first-person perspective in language, focusing on their roles in attitude reports, de se interpretations, and generic statements. By analyzing cross-linguistic data and conducting experimental studies, we explore how impersonal pronouns interact with indexicality and perspective-taking mechanisms. Our findings reveal that impersonal pronouns often serve as a bridge between personal and generic interpretations, allowing speakers to express subjective experiences while maintaining a degree of detachment. We demonstrate that the use of impersonal pronouns in attitude reports can lead to ambiguities between de se and de re readings, highlighting the complex interplay between grammatical form and cognitive perspective. Furthermore, we show that impersonal pronouns contribute to the formation of generic statements, enabling speakers to generalize personal experiences to broader populations. This research enhances our understanding of the cognitive and linguistic processes underlying perspective-taking and self-reference in natural language.", "label": 1}
