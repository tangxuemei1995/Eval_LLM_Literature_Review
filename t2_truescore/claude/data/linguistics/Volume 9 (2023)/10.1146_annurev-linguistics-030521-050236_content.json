{"grounding": "A heritage language is a sociopolitically minority and/or minoritized language acquired as the first or one of the first languages in a bilingual or multilingual context. Heritage languages are typically acquired under conditions of reduced exposure and are often used less than the majority language during late childhood and adolescence. Heritage languages show structural differences and changes at all levels of linguistic analysis from baseline grammars that arise from the complex interaction between the nature and quantity of input and the age of bilinguals. Although many situations give rise to heritage languages, this article focuses on immigrants and their children and reviews foundational studies of the linguistic properties of heritage languages; studies of age effects that have shed light on critical differences between first, second, and heritage language acquisition; and recent studies of heritage language relearning and reactivation. The implications of the study of heritage languages for bilingualism and society and for the language and cognitive sciences are discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex dynamics of heritage languages, focusing on the processes of acquisition, loss, and potential regaining among heritage speakers. Drawing on extensive research in bilingualism and language attrition, we examine the unique linguistic profiles of heritage speakers compared to native speakers. The investigation delves into the factors contributing to L1 attrition in heritage language contexts and the potential for language reactivation and relearning. Our findings suggest that while heritage speakers often experience incomplete acquisition or attrition of their heritage language, they possess latent linguistic knowledge that can be leveraged for language regaining. The study highlights the importance of tailored language instruction and immersion experiences in facilitating the reactivation of heritage languages. These insights contribute to our understanding of language maintenance in multilingual societies and have implications for heritage language education and revitalization efforts.", "label": 1}
