{"grounding": "In science, we look for the big picture, but in autobiography, it is the details that we care more about. Inevitably, my piece embodies this contradiction. The linguistic parts aim to bring out the unifying themes behind what may look like a hopelessly all-over-the-place curriculum vitae of research and teaching. The autobiographical parts are mostly vignettes of my formative years, places where I have lived, events that have made an impression on me, and people I have crossed paths with.", "generated_text": "This study examines the interplay between language change and poetic form, focusing on the enduring influence of P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar. Through a retrospective analysis of historical texts and an autobiographical lens, we explore how linguistic evolution has shaped poetic expression over time. The research also considers future prospects for poetry in light of ongoing language shifts. By synthesizing insights from linguistics, literary theory, and personal experience, this work offers a unique perspective on the dynamic relationship between grammatical structures and artistic creativity in verse.", "label": 0}
