{"grounding": "The past decade has seen the rapid development of a new approach to pragmatics that attempts to integrate insights from formal and experimental semantics and pragmatics, psycholinguistics, and computational cognitive science in the study of meaning: probabilistic pragmatics. The most influential probabilistic approach to pragmatics is the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework. In this review, I demonstrate the basic mechanics and commitments of RSA as well as some of its standard extensions, highlighting the key features that have led to its success in accounting for a wide variety of pragmatic phenomena. Fundamentally, it treats language as probabilistic, informativeness as gradient, alternatives as context-dependent, and subjective prior beliefs (world knowledge) as a crucial facet of interpretation. It also provides an integrated account of the link between production and interpretation. I highlight key challenges for RSA, which include scalability, the treatment of the boundedness of cognition, and the incremental and compositional nature of language.", "generated_text": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework has emerged as a powerful approach in computational pragmatics, bridging the gap between theoretical linguistics and empirical research. This framework models language use as a process of recursive social reasoning, where speakers and listeners reason about each other's intentions and knowledge. By integrating probabilistic inference with game-theoretic principles, RSA provides a formal account of how context and shared knowledge influence language interpretation and production. This paper reviews the key components of the RSA framework, its applications in various linguistic phenomena, and its contributions to experimental pragmatics and semantics. We discuss how RSA has shed light on pragmatic phenomena such as scalar implicature, metaphor comprehension, and referential communication. Furthermore, we explore the framework's potential for advancing our understanding of the interplay between semantics, pragmatics, and cognitive processes in natural language use.", "label": 1}
