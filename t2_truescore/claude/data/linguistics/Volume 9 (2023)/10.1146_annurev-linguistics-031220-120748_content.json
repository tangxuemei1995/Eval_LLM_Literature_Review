{"grounding": "Opacity is a natural language phenomenon where a phonological process is rendered non-surface-true by virtue of its interaction with other processes. Phonologists have long been fascinated with opaque generalizations both from a typological standpoint (What kinds of non-surface-true generalizations are found?) and a theoretical one (Which formal tools permit an analysis of opacity?). This review aims to (a) discuss the breadth of non-surface-true generalizations in light of phonologists\u2019 (often implicit) working definitions of opacity and (b) address opacity as a flashpoint in one of the larger debates in generative phonology, between the rule-based serial approach of Chomsky & Halle's Sound Pattern of English and constraint-based parallel Optimality Theory. A conclusion offered here is that the well-known problems Optimality Theory faces with some kinds of opacity are due not to its lack of serialism but to the fact that such processes are input-motivated rather than output-motivated.\n", "generated_text": "This paper examines the role of serialism and opacity in phonological theory, focusing on the challenges posed by opaque processes to parallel frameworks such as classic Optimality Theory (OT). We argue that while OT has been successful in accounting for many phonological phenomena, it struggles to adequately capture opaque interactions without additional machinery. We propose that Harmonic Serialism, a serial variant of OT, offers a more elegant solution to opacity problems by incorporating derivational steps into the constraint-based framework. Through a series of case studies involving counterfeeding and counterbleeding interactions, we demonstrate how Harmonic Serialism can account for opaque processes that are problematic for parallel OT. Our findings suggest that a return to serial derivation, albeit within a constraint-based model, may be necessary to fully capture the complexities of phonological opacity.", "label": 1}
