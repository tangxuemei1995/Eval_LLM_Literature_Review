{"grounding": "In this review, we discuss the limits of the concept of the modern nation-state to explore language issues in postcolonial contexts, as in Africa. We argue in favor of a revision of the history of the field of language policy and planning (LPP) and sociolinguistics, paying attention to how the colonial issue has been erased and downplayed. We first explore the colonial history of LPP and how this field contributed to frame African multilingualisms as problems to be solved. Second, we briefly discuss how the contemporary understanding of citizenship in Africa is entangled with the colonial history of a particular version of the state in Africa; we focus on Sudan as an example. We problematize the construct of \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d inscribed in the methodological nationalism that characterizes the early LPP framework, which reverberates in contemporary public policies. By doing so, we advocate for a perspective of language that is historically and locally embedded, following a politics that recognizes the importance of Southern epistemologies to language studies.", "generated_text": "This study critically examines the concept of language policy and planning (LPP) within the context of postcolonial nation-states, focusing on Sudan as a case study. It challenges the traditional notion of the modern state as a homogeneous entity and explores the limitations of applying Western-centric LPP models to postcolonial contexts. By adopting a Southern perspective, the research investigates how colonial legacies, linguistic diversity, and power dynamics shape language policies in Sudan. The study employs a qualitative approach, analyzing historical documents, policy papers, and interviews with key stakeholders. Findings reveal that the complexities of Sudan's linguistic landscape and socio-political realities often render conventional LPP frameworks inadequate. The research contributes to the growing body of literature on postcolonial approaches to LPP and advocates for more nuanced, context-specific strategies that acknowledge the unique challenges faced by postcolonial nation-states in managing linguistic diversity and promoting national unity.", "label": 1}
