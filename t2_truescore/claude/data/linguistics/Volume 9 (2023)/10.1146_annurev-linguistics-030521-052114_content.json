{"grounding": "In today's global economy, most people all over the world need to speak a second language (L2) for study, work, or social purposes. Assessment of speaking, either in the classroom or as an external exam, is therefore an important task. However, because of its fleeting nature, the assessment of speaking proficiency is difficult. For valid assessment, a speaking test must measure speaking proficiency without construct-irrelevant variance, for instance, due to tasks, raters, and interlocutors. This article begins by bringing together insights from different disciplines to develop a multi-componential construct of speaking proficiency, which includes linguistic and strategic competencies. Because speaking usually takes place in conversation, the ability to take part in interaction, including rapid prediction, is described as part of the speaking construct. Next, the factors that need to be controlled when making a speaking assessment are discussed. Finally, challenges and ideas for future research are briefly described.", "generated_text": "This study examines the assessment of second language speaking proficiency, focusing on the challenges and methodologies involved in evaluating learners' oral communication skills. The research explores various approaches to speaking assessment, including task-based evaluations, interactive interviews, and technology-enhanced methods. By analyzing data from multiple assessment contexts, the study investigates the reliability and validity of different assessment techniques in capturing the complexities of spoken language production. Particular attention is given to the role of interaction in speaking proficiency and how it can be effectively measured. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating authentic communicative tasks and considering both linguistic and pragmatic competencies in speaking assessments. This research contributes to the ongoing development of more comprehensive and accurate methods for evaluating second language speaking proficiency, with implications for language teaching, testing, and curriculum design.", "label": 1}
