{"grounding": "Enzymes that phosphorylate, dephosphorylate, and ligate RNA 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were discovered more than half a century ago and were eventually shown to repair purposeful site-specific endonucleolytic breaks in the RNA phosphodiester backbone. The pace of discovery and characterization of new candidate RNA repair activities in taxa from all phylogenetic domains greatly exceeds our understanding of the biological pathways in which they act. The key questions anent RNA break repair in vivo are (a) identifying the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage and (b) determining whether RNA repair results in restoration of the original RNA, modification of the RNA (by loss or gain at the ends), or rearrangements of the broken RNA segments (i.e., RNA recombination). This review provides a perspective on the discovery, mechanisms, and physiology of purposeful RNA break repair, highlighting exemplary repair pathways (e.g., tRNA restriction-repair and tRNA splicing) for which genetics has figured prominently in their elucidation.", "generated_text": "RNA repair mechanisms, once thought to be rare, are increasingly recognized as crucial components of cellular RNA metabolism. This review explores the emerging field of RNA repair, focusing on tRNA restriction and splicing processes. We examine the intricate mechanisms of end healing and end sealing, highlighting the roles of key enzymes such as polynucleotide kinase\u2013phosphatase and RNA ligase. Recent discoveries in enzyme function and substrate specificity have shed light on the complexity and diversity of RNA repair pathways. We discuss how these repair mechanisms contribute to maintaining RNA integrity and regulating gene expression. Furthermore, we explore the potential implications of RNA repair in various biological contexts, including stress response and disease pathogenesis. This review underscores the importance of continued research in this field, as understanding RNA repair mechanisms may lead to novel therapeutic strategies and biotechnological applications.", "label": 1}
