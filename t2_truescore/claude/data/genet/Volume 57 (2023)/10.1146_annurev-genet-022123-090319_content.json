{"grounding": "Many human phenotypes are impossible to recapitulate in model organisms or immortalized human cell lines. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a way to study disease mechanisms in a variety of differentiated cell types while circumventing ethical and practical issues associated with finite tissue sources and postmortem states. Here, we discuss the broad utility of iPSCs in genetic medicine and describe how they are being used to study musculoskeletal, pulmonary, neurologic, and cardiac phenotypes. We summarize the particular challenges presented by each organ system and describe how iPSC models are being used to address them. Finally, we discuss emerging iPSC-derived organoid models and the potential value that they can bring to studies of human disease.", "generated_text": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have revolutionized the field of disease modeling and drug discovery. This review explores the current state of iPSC technology in understanding human disease biology and its in vitro applications. We discuss the role of iPSCs in elucidating gene regulation mechanisms and genetic factors underlying various disorders. The potential of iPSC-derived organoids in recapitulating complex tissue structures and disease phenotypes is examined. We evaluate the evidence supporting the utility of iPSCs in drug screening, toxicity testing, and personalized medicine approaches. Additionally, we address the challenges and limitations of iPSC-based models, including epigenetic memory and maturation issues. Overall, this review highlights the significant impact of iPSCs on advancing our understanding of human diseases and their potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
