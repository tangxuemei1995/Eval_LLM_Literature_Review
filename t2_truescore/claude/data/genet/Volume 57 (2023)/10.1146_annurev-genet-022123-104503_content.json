{"grounding": "Organismal development requires the reproducible unfolding of an ordered sequence of discrete steps (cell fate determination, migration, tissue folding, etc.) in both time and space. Here, we review the mechanisms that grant temporal specificity to developmental steps, including molecular clocks and timers. Individual timing mechanisms must be coordinated with each other to maintain the overall developmental sequence. However, phenotypic novelties can also arise through the modification of temporal patterns over the course of evolution. Two main types of variation in temporal patterning characterize interspecies differences in developmental time: allochrony, where the overall developmental sequence is either accelerated or slowed down while maintaining the relative duration of individual steps, and heterochrony, where the duration of specific developmental steps is altered relative to the rest. New advances in in vitro modeling of mammalian development using stem cells have recently enabled the revival of mechanistic studies of allochrony and heterochrony. In both cases, differences in the rate of basic cellular functions such as splicing, translation, protein degradation, and metabolism seem to underlie differences in developmental time. In the coming years, these studies should identify the genetic differences that drive divergence in developmental time between species.", "generated_text": "The precise regulation of developmental rate is crucial for proper embryogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This review explores the concept of the 'clockwork embryo,' examining the intricate interplay of biological clocks and developmental processes that govern the timing of embryonic events. We synthesize recent findings in developmental biology that shed light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling developmental rate across various model organisms. Key topics include the role of oscillatory gene expression, cell cycle regulation, and metabolic cues in pacing embryonic development. We also discuss the importance of species-specific developmental timers and their evolutionary significance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging technologies, such as real-time imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, that are advancing our understanding of temporal control in embryogenesis. By integrating these diverse lines of evidence, we propose a unified framework for conceptualizing the regulation of developmental time and identify critical areas for future research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
