{"grounding": "The goal of comparative developmental biology is identifying mechanistic differences in embryonic development between different taxa and how these evolutionary changes have led to morphological and organizational differences in adult body plans. Much of this work has focused on direct-developing species in which the adult forms straight from the embryo and embryonic modifications have direct effects on the adult. However, most animal lineages are defined by indirect development, in which the embryo gives rise to a larval body plan and the adult forms by transformation of the larva. Historically, much of our understanding of complex life cycles is viewed through the lenses of ecology and zoology. In this review, we discuss the importance of establishing developmental rather than morphological or ecological criteria for defining developmental mode and explicitly considering the evolutionary implications of incorporating complex life cycles into broad developmental comparisons of embryos across metazoans.", "generated_text": "The integration of complex life cycles in comparative developmental biology offers a novel perspective on the evolution of body plans and developmental modes. This review explores how diverse life cycle strategies, particularly those involving larval stages, influence the formation and modification of head and trunk structures across animal phyla. We examine the developmental mechanisms underlying the transition from larval to adult forms, highlighting the plasticity and constraints in body plan evolution. By synthesizing recent findings from molecular, genetic, and morphological studies, we demonstrate the importance of considering entire life cycles when investigating developmental processes. This approach reveals previously overlooked connections between seemingly disparate animal groups and provides insights into the evolutionary origins of complex body plans. Our analysis underscores the significance of integrating life cycle diversity in comparative developmental biology to gain a more comprehensive understanding of animal evolution and development.", "label": 0}
