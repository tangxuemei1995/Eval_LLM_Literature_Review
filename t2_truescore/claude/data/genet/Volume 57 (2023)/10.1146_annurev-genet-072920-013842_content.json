{"grounding": "Assigning functions to genes and learning how to control their expression are part of the foundation of cell biology and therapeutic development. An efficient and unbiased method to accomplish this is genetic screening, which historically required laborious clone generation and phenotyping and is still limited by scale today. The rapid technological progress on modulating gene function with CRISPR-Cas and measuring it in individual cells has now relaxed the major experimental constraints and enabled pooled screening with complex readouts from single cells. Here, we review the principles and practical considerations for pooled single-cell CRISPR screening. We discuss perturbation strategies, experimental model systems, matching the perturbation to the individual cells, reading out cell phenotypes, and data analysis. Our focus is on single-cell RNA sequencing and cell sorting\u2013based readouts, including image-enabled cell sorting. We expect this transformative approach to fuel biomedical research for the next several decades.", "generated_text": "Pooled CRISPR screens have revolutionized functional genomics, enabling high-throughput interrogation of gene function. However, traditional bulk approaches limit the resolution of cellular phenotypes. This study presents a novel method for conducting genome-scale CRISPR screens at single-cell resolution, combining CRISPR technology with single-cell sequencing and cell sorting. By integrating guide RNA expression with transcriptome profiling in individual cells, we achieve unprecedented insights into gene function and cellular heterogeneity. Our approach allows for the simultaneous assessment of multiple phenotypes and the identification of subtle cellular states affected by genetic perturbations. We demonstrate the utility of this method by screening for genes involved in cell differentiation and drug resistance in cancer cells. This powerful technique enhances our understanding of complex biological processes and has broad applications in various fields, including developmental biology, cancer research, and drug discovery.", "label": 1}
