{"grounding": "Antibiotic resistance genes predate the therapeutic uses of antibiotics. However, the current antimicrobial resistance crisis stems from our extensive use of antibiotics and the generation of environmental stressors that impose new selective pressure on microbes and drive the evolution of resistant pathogens that now threaten human health. Similar to climate change, this global threat results from human activities that change habitats and natural microbiomes, which in turn interact with human-associated ecosystems and lead to adverse impacts on human health. Human activities that alter our planet at global scales exacerbate the current resistance crisis and exemplify our central role in large-scale changes in which we are both protagonists and architects of our success but also casualties of unanticipated collateral outcomes. As cognizant participants in this ongoing planetary experiment, we are driven to understand and find strategies to curb the ongoing crises of resistance and climate change.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex relationship between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change, focusing on the impact of human activities and climate change on the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We review current literature to examine how environmental contamination with antibiotics and resistant organisms, coupled with climate-induced alterations in ecosystems, contribute to the emergence and dissemination of AMR. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic factors, including pollution and land-use changes, interact synergistically with climate change to create favorable conditions for the evolution and transmission of resistant pathogens. We highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to address this global health threat, emphasizing the importance of sustainable antibiotic use, improved waste management, and climate change mitigation strategies. This research underscores the urgency of integrating AMR considerations into environmental policies and public health initiatives to safeguard human and ecological health.", "label": 0}
