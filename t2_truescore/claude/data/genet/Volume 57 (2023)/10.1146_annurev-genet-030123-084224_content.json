{"grounding": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by excess activation of the innate immune system in an antigen-independent manner. Starting with the discovery of the causal gene for familial Mediterranean fever, more than 50\u00a0monogenic SAIDs have been described. These discoveries, paired with advances in immunology and genomics, have allowed our understanding of these diseases to improve drastically in the last decade. The genetic causes of SAIDs are complex and include both germline and somatic pathogenic variants that affect various inflammatory signaling pathways. We provide an overview of the acquired SAIDs from a genetic perspective and summarize the clinical phenotypes and mechanism(s) of inflammation, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a group of disorders characterized by dysregulation of the innate immune system. This review explores the genetic underpinnings of SAIDs, focusing on monogenic, digenic, and polygenic forms. We discuss recent advances in understanding the complex genetic architecture of these conditions, including the role of epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations. The review highlights key genes and pathways involved in SAIDs, such as those regulating inflammasome activation and cytokine signaling. Additionally, we examine how genetic insights have led to improved diagnostic approaches and targeted therapies. Finally, we address the challenges in interpreting genetic data and the potential for personalized medicine in managing SAIDs. This comprehensive overview provides a foundation for understanding the genetic basis of autoinflammatory diseases and its implications for clinical practice.", "label": 1}
