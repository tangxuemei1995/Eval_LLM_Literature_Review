{"grounding": "The ease and throughput of single-cell genomics have steadily improved, and its current trajectory suggests that surveying single-cell populations will become routine. We discuss the merger of quantitative genetics with single-cell genomics and emphasize how this synergizes with advantages intrinsic to plants. Single-cell population genomics provides increased detection resolution when mapping variants that control molecular traits, including gene expression or chromatin accessibility. Additionally, single-cell population genomics reveals the cell types in which variants act and, when combined with organism-level phenotype measurements, unveils which cellular contexts impact higher-order traits. Emerging technologies, notably multiomics, can facilitate the measurement of both genetic changes and genomic traits in single cells, enabling single-cell genetic experiments. The implementation of single-cell genetics will advance the investigation of the genetic architecture of complex molecular traits and provide new experimental paradigms to study eukaryotic genetics.", "generated_text": "Single-cell genomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, but its potential to elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits remains largely untapped. This study presents a novel approach that integrates single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility data with quantitative genetics to uncover the genetic architecture of complex traits. By analyzing diverse populations of mutants, we demonstrate how single-cell resolution can reveal cell type-specific genetic effects and identify causal variants with unprecedented precision. Our method leverages the power of population genetics to dissect the contributions of individual genes and regulatory elements to trait variation. We showcase the utility of this approach in model organisms and human populations, providing new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying complex phenotypes. This integrative framework opens new avenues for understanding the genetic basis of diseases and traits at single-cell resolution.", "label": 1}
