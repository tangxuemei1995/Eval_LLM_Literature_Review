{"grounding": "Coral reefs are both exceptionally biodiverse and threatened by climate change and other human activities. Here, we review population genomic processes in coral reef taxa and their importance for understanding responses to global change. Many taxa on coral reefs are characterized by weak genetic drift, extensive gene flow, and strong selection from complex biotic and abiotic environments, which together present a fascinating test of microevolutionary theory. Selection, gene flow, and hybridization have played and will continue to play an important role in the adaptation or extinction of coral reef taxa in the face of rapid environmental change, but research remains exceptionally limited compared to the urgent needs. Critical areas for future investigation include understanding evolutionary potential and the mechanisms of local adaptation, developing historical baselines, and building greater research capacity in the countries where most reef diversity is concentrated.", "generated_text": "Coral reefs face unprecedented threats from climate change, necessitating a deeper understanding of their adaptive potential. This review synthesizes recent advances in coral reef population genomics, focusing on local adaptation, evolutionary rescue, and dispersal in reef-associated fish species. We examine how genomic tools reveal fine-scale population structure and adaptive variation across environmental gradients. The interplay between gene flow and local adaptation is explored, highlighting the role of connectivity in maintaining genetic diversity and facilitating evolutionary rescue. We discuss how genomic data can inform conservation strategies, including assisted gene flow and the design of marine protected areas. Finally, we identify key knowledge gaps and future research directions to enhance our ability to predict and manage coral reef responses to global change, emphasizing the integration of genomic data with ecological and environmental information.", "label": 1}
