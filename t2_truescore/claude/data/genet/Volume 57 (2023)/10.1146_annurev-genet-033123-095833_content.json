{"grounding": "Programmed cell death (self-induced) is intrinsic to all cellular life forms, including unicellular organisms. However, cell death research has focused on animal models to understand cancer, degenerative disorders, and developmental processes. Recently delineated suicidal death mechanisms in bacteria and fungi have revealed ancient origins of animal cell death that are intertwined with immune mechanisms, allaying earlier doubts that self-inflicted cell death pathways exist in microorganisms. Approximately 20 mammalian death pathways have been partially characterized over the last 35 years. By contrast, more than 100 death mechanisms have been identified in bacteria and a few fungi in recent years. However, cell death is nearly unstudied in most human pathogenic microbes that cause major public health burdens. Here, we consider how the current understanding of programmed cell death arose through animal studies and how recently uncovered microbial cell death mechanisms in fungi and bacteria resemble and differ from mechanisms of mammalian cell death.", "generated_text": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process traditionally associated with multicellular organisms. However, recent research has revealed that PCD also occurs in unicellular microorganisms, challenging our understanding of its evolutionary origins and functions. This review compares and contrasts PCD mechanisms in unicellular and multicellular organisms, exploring their similarities, differences, and potential evolutionary links. We examine the molecular pathways involved in microbial cell death, including apoptosis-like, autophagy-like, and necrosis-like processes, and discuss their roles in population dynamics, stress responses, and community interactions. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptive significance of PCD in microorganisms, considering its potential benefits in nutrient recycling, genetic diversity, and biofilm formation. By synthesizing current knowledge on PCD across diverse life forms, this review provides insights into the evolutionary conservation and divergence of cell death mechanisms, highlighting the importance of regulated cell death in all domains of life.", "label": 1}
