{"grounding": "Despite accumulating evidence implicating noncoding variants in human diseases, unraveling their functionality remains a significant challenge. Systematic annotations of the regulatory landscape and the growth of sequence variant data sets have fueled the development of tools and methods to identify causal noncoding variants and evaluate their regulatory effects. Here, we review the latest advances in the field and discuss potential future research avenues to gain a more in-depth understanding of noncoding regulatory variants.", "generated_text": "Identifying functional noncoding variants in the vast genomic landscape remains a significant challenge. This review explores innovative strategies for uncovering regulatory variants, focusing on enhancer regions and their impact on gene expression. We discuss the integration of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare-variant association tests, and machine learning approaches to prioritize candidate variants. Additionally, we examine the role of functional assays in validating predicted regulatory elements and their potential clinical implications.", "label": 1}
