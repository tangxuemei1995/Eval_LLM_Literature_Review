{"grounding": "Transcription and replication both require large macromolecular complexes to act on a DNA template, yet these machineries cannot simultaneously act on the same DNA sequence. Conflicts between the replication and transcription machineries (transcription\u2013replication conflicts, or TRCs) are widespread in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and have the capacity to both cause DNA damage and compromise complete, faithful replication of the genome. This review will highlight recent studies investigating the genomic locations of TRCs and the mechanisms by which they may be prevented, mitigated, or resolved. We address work from both model organisms and mammalian systems but predominantly focus on multicellular eukaryotes owing to the additional complexities inherent in the coordination of replication and transcription in the context of cell type\u2013specific gene expression and higher-order chromatin organization.", "generated_text": "Transcription\u2013replication conflicts (TRCs) have emerged as a significant source of genome instability, with profound implications for cellular health and disease. This review explores the mechanisms underlying TRCs, focusing on the collision between the replisome and RNA polymerase complexes during simultaneous DNA replication and transcription. We discuss how TRCs can lead to replication stress, DNA damage, and genomic instability, highlighting the cellular responses and repair pathways activated to mitigate these conflicts. The review also examines the role of origin firing regulation in preventing TRCs and the consequences of persistent conflicts on gene expression and genome stability. Understanding the complex interplay between transcription and replication machineries provides crucial insights into the maintenance of genome integrity and the development of potential therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with genomic instability.", "label": 1}
