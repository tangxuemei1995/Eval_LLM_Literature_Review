{"grounding": "Germ cells are the only cell type that is capable of transmitting genetic information to the next generation, which has enabled the continuation of multicellular life for the last 1.5 billion years. Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms supporting the germline's remarkable ability to continue in this eternal cycle, termed germline immortality. Even unicellular organisms age at a cellular level, demonstrating that cellular aging is inevitable. Extensive studies in yeast have established the framework of how asymmetric cell division and gametogenesis may contribute to the resetting of cellular age. This review examines the mechanisms of germline immortality\u2014how germline cells reset the aging of cells\u2014drawing a parallel between yeast and multicellular organisms.", "generated_text": "Germline immortality, the ability of germ cells to maintain their replicative potential across generations, is a fundamental aspect of reproductive biology. This review explores the role of asymmetric stem cell division in preserving germline immortality and its implications for aging. We examine the mechanisms by which asymmetric division segregates damaged cellular components, particularly ribosomal DNA, to somatic daughter cells while maintaining the integrity of germ cells. The interplay between asymmetric division and the regulation of ribosomal DNA copy number is discussed as a potential factor in germline maintenance. Understanding these processes may provide insights into the aging process and potential interventions to promote cellular longevity in both germline and somatic tissues.", "label": 1}
