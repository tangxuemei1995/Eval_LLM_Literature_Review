{"grounding": "Modifications to land can serve to jointly reduce risks of floods and droughts to people and to ecosystems. Whether land modifications are implemented will depend on the willingness and ability of a diversity of actors. This article reviews the state of knowledge on land modification use in areas exposed to dual hydrologic risks and the land owners, managers, and users who directly make decisions about action on lands they control. The review presents a typology of land modifications and explains how land modifications interact with the hydrological cycle to reduce risks. It then addresses the roles and perspectives of the land owners, managers, and users undertaking land modifications, summarizing theories explaining motivations for, as well as barriers to and enablers of, land modification implementation. The analysis reveals geographical differences in narratives on land modifications as well as knowledge gaps regarding variation across actors and types of land modifications.", "generated_text": "Climate change is exacerbating the occurrence of concurrent flood and drought events, posing significant challenges to land management. This study explores the potential of land modifications as a strategy to mitigate these concurrent risks and investigates land users' perspectives on implementing such measures. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining geospatial analysis and stakeholder surveys, we assess the effectiveness of various land modification techniques in reducing flood and drought impacts. Results indicate that targeted interventions, such as improved drainage systems, water retention structures, and soil conservation practices, can significantly enhance landscape resilience. However, land users' motivations and barriers to adoption vary widely, influenced by factors including economic constraints, knowledge gaps, and policy support. Our findings highlight the need for tailored approaches that consider local contexts and stakeholder engagement to promote widespread implementation of land modifications as a climate change adaptation strategy.", "label": 1}
