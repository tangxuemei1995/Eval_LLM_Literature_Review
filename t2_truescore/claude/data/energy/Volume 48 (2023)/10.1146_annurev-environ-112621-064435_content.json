{"grounding": "The nuclear waste management and disposal program in the United States for highly radioactive waste (spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste) has thus far been unsuccessful despite an effort that spans 40 years and the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars. Yet, today, there is considerable interest in and promotion of advanced reactor technologies, such as small modular reactors that will expand spent fuel inventories that may very well remain at the site where they are generated, awaiting permanent, geologic disposal. We examine critical elements of the US legal and regulatory framework that have impeded the success of the US program. We make recommendations on steps that are required for a successful nuclear waste program, particularly considering the development of advanced nuclear reactors and their fuel cycles.", "generated_text": "This study examines the US legal and regulatory framework governing nuclear waste management for current and future reactors and their fuel cycles. It analyzes existing regulations, including the Standard Contract for spent nuclear fuel, and evaluates their applicability to advanced reactor designs and novel fuel cycles. The research explores challenges in adapting current policies to accommodate emerging technologies, particularly concerning waste retrievability and long-term storage solutions. Key focus areas include the regulatory gaps for non-traditional fuel types, the impact of new reactor designs on waste classification, and the potential need for updated legislation to address the unique characteristics of advanced nuclear systems. The findings highlight the importance of proactive policy development to ensure a robust regulatory framework capable of supporting innovation in nuclear energy while maintaining stringent safety and environmental standards.", "label": 1}
