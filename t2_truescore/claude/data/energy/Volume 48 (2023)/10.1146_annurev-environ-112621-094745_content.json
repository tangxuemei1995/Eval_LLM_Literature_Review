{"grounding": "Brine contains cations such as K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Li+, B3+, Rb2+, and Cs2+, as well as anions such as SO4\n2\u2212, Cl\u2212, HCO3\n\u2212, CO3\n2\u2212, NO3\n\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212, which are valuable elements. Brines are widely distributed in salt lakes in the world's three enormous plateaus and beyond and are classified into three types: sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines. Sulfate-type brine forms in salt lakes, whereas carbonate-type brine results from magmatic and hydrothermal activity. Chloride-type brine forms in deep basins due to the reduction and transformation of buried brine. Li in brine plays a critical role in clean energy transitions, and K in brine is important for potash production. Recently, new techniques for extracting Li from brine have been developed, and the large-scale, comprehensive development pattern of brines has formed the basis for a recycling economic model, which contributes to the efficient use of brines for potash and Li2CO3 development and CO2 emission reduction. This article reviews the genesis of brines and highlights new utilization techniques, trends, and sustainable development.", "generated_text": "Brine, a highly concentrated saline solution, plays a crucial role in global resource recovery and sustainable development. This review explores the genesis of brine in salt lakes and other geological formations, focusing on its potential as a valuable source of minerals such as potash and lithium. We examine the complex processes involved in brine formation, including evaporation, mineral dissolution, and geothermal activity. The paper also evaluates various processing techniques employed for extracting valuable components from brine, highlighting recent advancements in separation and purification methods. Furthermore, we discuss the concept of comprehensive utilization, emphasizing the importance of maximizing resource recovery while minimizing environmental impact. Case studies from major brine-producing regions worldwide are presented to illustrate successful implementation of sustainable practices. This review aims to provide a holistic understanding of brine as a sustainable resource and to identify future research directions for optimizing its exploitation in an environmentally responsible manner.", "label": 0}
