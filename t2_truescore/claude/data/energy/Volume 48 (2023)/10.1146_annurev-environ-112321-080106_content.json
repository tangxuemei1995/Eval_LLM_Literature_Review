{"grounding": "Qualitative research methods examine a wide range of topics in the study of environment and resource management. This first review on the topic highlights innovative and impactful research over the past few decades, drawing from social science disciplines that include sociology, geography, anthropology, political science, public policy, and psychology. We describe qualitative research methods that have addressed five scientific goals: (a) describing what the world is like, (b) predicting what the world can be like, (c) acknowl-edging researcher positionality and reflexivity and diversifying ways of knowing in theorizing and research designs, (d) integrating imaginaries into empirical research and building narratives to make sense of possible futures and to broaden our view of scientific inquiry, and (e) helping scholars grapple with the deep complexity of socioecological systems. As we explore these themes, we explain foundational qualitative approaches and highlight examples of environmental qualitative research that apply them.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews recent advances in qualitative methods for environmental research, focusing on their application to complex socioecological systems and climate change studies. We examine the growing importance of participatory research approaches in engaging diverse stakeholders and incorporating local knowledge. The review highlights innovative techniques for data collection and analysis, including digital ethnography, photovoice, and qualitative GIS. We discuss how these methods enhance our understanding of human-environment interactions and contribute to more holistic assessments of environmental challenges. The paper also explores the integration of qualitative methods with quantitative approaches, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Finally, we address ethical considerations and challenges in applying qualitative methods to sensitive environmental issues. This review underscores the vital role of qualitative research in informing environmental policy and practice, particularly in the context of rapidly changing ecosystems and climate conditions.", "label": 1}
