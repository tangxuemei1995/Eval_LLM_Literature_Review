{"grounding": "Buildings are key in supporting human activities and well-being by providing shelter and other important services to their users. Buildings are, however, also responsible for major energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during their life cycle. Improving the quality of services provided by buildings while reaching low energy demand (LED) levels is crucial for climate and sustainability targets. Building sector models have become essential tools for decision support on strategies to reduce energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet current models have significant limitations in their ability to assess the transformations required for LED. We review building sector models ranging from the subnational to the global scale to identify best practices and critical gaps in representing transformations toward LED futures. We focus on three key dimensions of intervention (socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological), three megatrends (digitalization, sharing economy, and circular economy), and decent living standards. This review recommends the model developments needed to better assess LED transformations in buildings and support decision-making toward sustainability targets.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews the current state of modeling low energy demand futures for buildings and identifies key research needs. We examine approaches for developing scenarios of residential and commercial energy demand transformation in the context of climate change mitigation. The analysis covers methods for incorporating megatrends like urbanization, digitalization, and changing work patterns into long-term projections. We assess how models account for improvements in building efficiency, electrification of end-uses, and shifts in occupant behavior. The review highlights challenges in representing decent living standards and energy poverty alleviation within low demand scenarios. We find that most models struggle to capture the full potential of demand-side solutions and behavioral changes. Key research priorities include improving representations of heterogeneous consumers, energy service demands, and interactions between the building sector and other systems. Enhanced modeling of these factors is critical for exploring ambitious low energy demand pathways aligned with climate goals.", "label": 1}
