{"grounding": "Renewable electricity generation will need to be rapidly scaled to address climate change and other environmental challenges. Doing so effectively will require an understanding of resource availability. We review estimates for renewable electricity of the global technical potential, defined as the amount of electricity that could be produced with current technologies when accounting for geographical and technical limitations as well as conversion efficiencies; economic potential, which also includes cost; and feasible potential, which accounts for societal and environmental constraints. We consider utility-scale and rooftop solar photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind, hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean (wave, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion, and salinity gradient energy) technologies. We find that the reported technical potential for each energy resource ranges over several orders of magnitude across and often within technologies. Therefore, we also discuss the main factors explaining why authors find such different results. According to this review and on the basis of the most robust studies, we find that technical potentials for utility-scale solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore wind, and offshore wind are above 100 PWh/year. Hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean thermal energy conversion have technical potentials above 10 PWh/year. Rooftop solar photovoltaic, wave, and tidal have technical potentials above 1 PWh/year. Salinity gradient has a technical potential above 0.1 PWh/year. The literature assessing the global economic potential of renewables, which considers the cost of each renewable resource, shows that the economic potential is higher than current and near-future electricity demand. Fewer studies have calculated the global feasible potential, which considers societal and environmental constraints. While these ranges are useful for assessing the magnitude of available energy sources, they may omit challenges for large-scale renewable portfolios.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive study assesses the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity sources, focusing on solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. The research synthesizes and analyzes data from numerous studies, reports, and databases to provide a holistic view of renewable energy potential worldwide. The technical potential is evaluated based on resource availability, land use constraints, and current technological capabilities. Economic potential is then derived by considering levelized costs of electricity, market conditions, and projected technological advancements. Finally, the feasible potential is estimated by incorporating socio-political factors, grid integration challenges, and environmental considerations. Results indicate that the technical potential of renewable electricity far exceeds current global electricity demand, with solar PV and wind energy showing the highest potential. However, economic and feasible potentials are significantly lower due to various constraints. The study finds that while the economic potential of renewables is rapidly increasing due to falling costs and improved efficiencies, the feasible potential faces limitations such as grid infrastructure, energy storage requirements, and policy frameworks. Regional variations in potential are also analyzed, highlighting opportunities for targeted renewable energy development. The research concludes that achieving high penetration of renewable electricity is technically possible and increasingly economically viable, but requires addressing key challenges in grid integration, energy storage, and supportive policies to realize its full feasible potential. These findings have important implications for energy planning, climate change mitigation strategies, and sustainable development goals on a global scale.", "label": 1}
