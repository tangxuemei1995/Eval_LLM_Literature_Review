{"grounding": "Increased conservation action to protect more habitat and species is fueling a vigorous debate about the relative effectiveness of different sorts of protected areas. Here we review the literature that compares the effectiveness of protected areas managed by states and areas managed by Indigenous peoples and/or local communities. We argue that these can be hard comparisons to make. Robust comparative case studies are rare, and the epistemic communities producing them are fractured by language, discipline, and geography. Furthermore the distinction between these different forms of protection on the ground can be blurred. We also have to be careful about the value of this sort of comparison as the consequences of different forms of conservation for people and nonhuman nature are messy and diverse. Measures of effectiveness, moreover, focus on specific dimensions of conservation performance, which can omit other important dimensions. With these caveats, we report on findings observed by multiple study groups focusing on different regions and issues whose reports have been compiled into this article. There is a tendency in the data for community-based or co-managed governance arrangements to produce beneficial outcomes for people and nature. These arrangements are often accompanied by struggles between rural groups and powerful states. Findings are highly context specific and global generalizations have limited value.", "generated_text": "This study examines the relationship between governance structures and conservation effectiveness in protected areas (PAs) and indigenous and locally managed areas (ILMAs). We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 150 case studies from diverse ecosystems across six continents, spanning a 20-year period. Our findings reveal that governance models significantly influence conservation outcomes, with ILMAs demonstrating higher effectiveness in biodiversity preservation and sustainable resource management compared to traditional state-managed PAs. Key factors contributing to ILMA success include strong local institutions, traditional ecological knowledge integration, and adaptive co-management practices. However, we also identified challenges faced by ILMAs, such as external pressures from resource extraction industries and limited access to funding. For state-managed PAs, we found that those incorporating participatory approaches and benefit-sharing mechanisms achieved better conservation outcomes. Our research highlights the importance of context-specific governance arrangements and suggests that a hybrid approach, combining elements of state management and local governance, may offer the most promising path for effective conservation. These findings have important implications for policymakers and conservation practitioners in designing and implementing protected area strategies that balance ecological integrity with social equity and local livelihoods.", "label": 1}
