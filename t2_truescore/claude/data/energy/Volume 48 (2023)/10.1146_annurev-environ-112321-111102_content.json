{"grounding": "Visions of planting walls of trees to block the expansion of the desert have long been promoted but never realized. The green wall myth persists today even though it is premised on outdated understandings of desertification. We review the history of the idea of green walls and focus on two sets of contemporary initiatives to assess their outcomes: peri-Saharan programs (Algeria's Green Dam and Great Green Wall in sub-Saharan Africa) and China's Three Norths Shelterbelt Program. This review reveals a mixed record of technical success with low rates of the establishment of monocultures of fast-growing trees vulnerable to disease. While there is evidence for reduced wind erosion in some areas, afforestation is also associated with reduced soil moisture and lowering of water tables. Social impacts include increased water scarcity for people and livestock in some cases, and resource enclosures that particularly work against pastoralist livelihoods.", "generated_text": "Great Green Walls, ambitious large-scale afforestation projects aimed at combating desertification and environmental degradation, have gained prominence in recent years. This review critically examines the hype, myths, and scientific evidence surrounding these initiatives, focusing on case studies from Algeria, the Sahel region, and China. While proponents tout their potential for ecological restoration and climate change mitigation, skeptics question their efficacy and sustainability. We analyze the scientific literature to evaluate the actual impacts of these projects on soil quality, biodiversity, and local livelihoods. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between ecological benefits and socio-economic challenges, highlighting the need for context-specific approaches. We argue that while Great Green Walls offer promise, their success depends on integrating scientific knowledge with local expertise and addressing underlying drivers of land degradation. This review provides insights for policymakers and researchers to enhance the design and implementation of dryland afforestation initiatives.", "label": 1}
