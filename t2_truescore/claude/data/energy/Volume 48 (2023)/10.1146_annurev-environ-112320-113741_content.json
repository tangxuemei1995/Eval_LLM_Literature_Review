{"grounding": "For millennia, agriculture has been shaping landscapes on Earth. Technological change has increased agricultural productivity dramatically, especially in the past six decades, but also resulted in trade-offs such as land and soil degradation, emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and spreading of toxic substances. In this article we review the impacts of agriculture on the world's arable land. We start by synthesizing information on the extent of arable land and associated agricultural practices, followed by a review of the state of the art of soil health and soil carbon. We review processes of land degradation, emission of GHGs, and threats to biodiversity. To conclude, we review key social and economic aspects of arable land and identify some important concerns for the future. The article ends on a positive note describing a potential new pathway for agriculture\u2014to gradually adopt polycultures of novel perennial grain crops.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive review examines the current state of the world's arable land, focusing on critical issues affecting global food security and environmental sustainability. The study analyzes the complex interplay between land use practices, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. It highlights the alarming rate of land degradation and its impact on soil carbon sequestration, emphasizing the urgent need for sustainable land management strategies. The research also explores the consequences of these changes on rural economies and agricultural productivity. By synthesizing data from diverse sources, this review provides a holistic understanding of the challenges facing arable land worldwide. The findings underscore the importance of implementing innovative conservation techniques and policy interventions to preserve soil health, enhance biodiversity, and mitigate climate change impacts while ensuring food security for a growing global population.", "label": 1}
