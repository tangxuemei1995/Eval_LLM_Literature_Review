{"grounding": "Fungi comprise approximately 20% of all eukaryotic species and are connected to virtually all life forms on Earth. Yet, their diversity remains contentious, their distribution elusive, and their conservation neglected. We aim to flip this situation by synthesizing current knowledge. We present a revised estimate of 2\u20133 million fungal species with a \u201cbest estimate\u201d at 2.5 million. To name the unknown >90% of these by the end of this century, we propose recognition of species known only from DNA data and call for large-scale sampling campaigns. We present an updated global map of fungal richness, highlighting tropical and temperate ecoregions of high diversity. We call for further Red List assessments and enhanced management guidelines to aid fungal conservation. Given that fungi play an inseparable role in our lives and in all ecosystems, and considering the fascinating questions remaining to be answered, we argue that fungi constitute the next frontier of biodiversity research.", "generated_text": "This study explores the global diversity, distribution, and conservation status of fungi, focusing on major phyla including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and early diverging fungi. Utilizing advanced metabarcoding techniques, we present a comprehensive analysis of fungal biodiversity across various ecosystems worldwide. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into fungus:plant ratios and endemism patterns, challenging previous estimates. We identify hotspots of fungal diversity and assess their conservation status using IUCN Red List criteria. The research highlights the urgent need for both in situ and ex situ conservation strategies to protect threatened fungal species and their habitats. Our results underscore the critical role of fungi in ecosystem functioning and emphasize the importance of integrating fungal conservation into global biodiversity initiatives. This study provides a foundation for future research and conservation efforts aimed at preserving the world's fungal diversity in the face of increasing environmental pressures.", "label": 0}
