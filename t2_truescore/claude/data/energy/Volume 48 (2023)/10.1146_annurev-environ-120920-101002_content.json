{"grounding": "There are large disparities in access to green technologies between countries and among different demographic groups within countries. Unless carefully managed, the energy transition risks exacerbating some of these inequalities, for example, by burdening those who are excluded from efficient new technologies with the costs of maintaining legacy infrastructure. The energy transition will create new interdependencies between sectors\u2014for example, between buildings, the power sector, and transportation\u2014requiring integrated design of policies and infrastructure in different sectors. The equitable adoption of new technologies is contingent on broadening access to enabling technologies such as the Internet and payment systems. Decisionmakers must focus on new technologies that remove disparities in access to services but do not replicate current inefficiencies in providing those services (e.g., equitable access to mobility\u2014not only to motorized personal vehicles). Data at higher resolutions and with broader coverage are needed to design equitable technology deployment strategies and evaluate their success.", "generated_text": "This study examines the implications of green technologies for environmental justice, focusing on the concept of a just transition. The research investigates how the implementation of electrification, modal shift in transportation, and sustainable building practices affects distributional justice across different socioeconomic groups. Through a comprehensive literature review and case study analysis, we explore the potential benefits and challenges of these green technologies in addressing environmental inequalities. Our findings suggest that while these technologies have the potential to mitigate environmental harm, their implementation may inadvertently exacerbate existing disparities if not carefully managed. We propose a framework for policymakers to ensure that the transition to green technologies is equitable and inclusive, emphasizing the importance of community engagement, targeted subsidies, and workforce development programs. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on environmental justice and provides practical recommendations for achieving a truly just and sustainable future.", "label": 0}
