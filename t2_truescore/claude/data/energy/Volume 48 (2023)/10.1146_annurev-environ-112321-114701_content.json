{"grounding": "Groundwater deterioration due to enrichment with contaminants of either geogenic or anthropogenic origin has adversely affected safe water supply for drinking and irrigation, with pervasive impacts on human health and ecosystem functions. However, the spatiotemporal evolution and public health effects of groundwater quality remain unclarified, posing a grand challenge for the safe and sustainable supply of global groundwater resources. This article provides a state-of-the-art review of the complexity and dynamics of groundwater quality, as well as the impacts of various groundwater substances on human health. In particular, knowledge is growing about the health impacts of key substances ranging from nutritional elements (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+) to pollutants (e.g., heavy metals/metalloids, persistent organic pollutants, and emerging contaminants) and, further, to pathogenic microorganisms to which the human body can be exposed through multiple patterns of groundwater use. Proliferating concerns at the same time call for enhancing science-based governance directives, economic policies, and management strategies coordinating groundwater quality. We propose that safeguarding groundwater-dependent public health needs concerted efforts in source control, cross-scale rehabilitation, and social hydrology-based groundwater governance.", "generated_text": "Groundwater quality is a critical factor in public health, as it serves as a primary source of drinking water for many communities worldwide. This study examines the complex relationship between groundwater quality and human health, focusing on geogenic contaminants, emerging pollutants, and key substances of concern. We review recent literature to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of various groundwater contaminants on public health outcomes. The research highlights the importance of sustainable groundwater management practices in mitigating health risks associated with poor water quality. Our findings indicate that both natural and anthropogenic factors contribute to groundwater contamination, with geogenic contaminants such as arsenic and fluoride posing significant challenges in certain regions. Additionally, emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and microplastics, are increasingly recognized as potential threats to human health. This study emphasizes the need for comprehensive monitoring programs, improved water treatment technologies, and integrated approaches to groundwater management to safeguard public health and ensure long-term water security.", "label": 1}
