{"grounding": "Since the early 2000s, many private companies, public-private coalitions, and governments have committed to remove deforestation from commodity supply chains. Despite these zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs), high rates of deforestation persist and may even be increasing. On the upside, a few region- and commodity-specific ZDCs have contributed to reductions by up to hundreds of thousands of hectares of deforestation, with mixed evidence on associated leakage. ZDCs have also spurred progress in monitoring, traceability, and awareness of deforestation. On the downside, as currently implemented, supply chain initiatives only cover a small share of tropical deforestation. Government- and company-led ZDCs are just two components of broader policy mixes aimed at reducing deforestation. To be more impactful, ZDCs needs to cover entire biomes, supply bases of companies, and export and domestic markets, with special attention not to exclude marginal producers.", "generated_text": "This study examines the feasibility and effectiveness of deforestation-free commodity supply chains in achieving sustainable land use and forest governance. Despite growing commitments from corporations and governments to implement zero deforestation policies, the reality of these initiatives remains contentious. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and case studies, we evaluate the challenges and opportunities in translating pledges into tangible outcomes. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between market forces, policy frameworks, and local socio-economic conditions that influence the success of deforestation-free initiatives. We argue that while complete elimination of deforestation from supply chains remains elusive, significant progress can be made through a carefully designed policy mix that addresses both supply and demand-side factors. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on sustainable forest management and provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders in developing more effective strategies for forest conservation.", "label": 1}
