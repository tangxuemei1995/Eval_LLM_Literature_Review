{"grounding": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) impact lakes, estuaries, and freshwater reservoirs worldwide. The duration, severity, and spread of CyanoHABs have markedly increased over the past decades and will likely continue to increase. This article addresses the universal phenomena of cyanobacterial blooms occurring in many freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Based on analysis of ecophysiological traits of bloom-forming cyanobacteria and their interactions with environmental processes, we summarize and decipher the driving forces leading to the initiation, outbreak, and persistence of the blooms. Due to the coupling effects of eutrophication, rising CO2 levels and global warming, a multidisciplinary joint research approach is critical for better understanding the CyanoHAB phenomenon and its prediction, remediation, and prevention. There is an urgent need to evaluate and guide proper use of bloom control techniques at large scales, using science-based and environmentally friendly approaches.", "generated_text": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) pose significant threats to freshwater ecosystems and human health worldwide. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biological traits, mechanisms, and risks associated with HCBs, as well as control strategies. Climate change and eutrophication are identified as key drivers of HCB proliferation, exacerbating their frequency, intensity, and duration. The production of cyanotoxins, including microcystins, anatoxins, and cylindrospermopsins, is discussed, highlighting their diverse impacts on aquatic organisms and human health. We examine the complex interactions between cyanobacteria and their environment, emphasizing the role of adaptive strategies in bloom formation. Furthermore, we evaluate various control measures, including nutrient management, physical interventions, and biological control, to mitigate HCB occurrence and impacts. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for researchers, water managers, and policymakers in addressing the growing challenge of HCBs in freshwater systems.", "label": 1}
