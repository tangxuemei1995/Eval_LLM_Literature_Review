{"grounding": "Polarization in the United States and around the world is of growing concern. Polarization is about more than just differences in opinions in society. It occurs when groups increasingly diverge in either actual or perceived differences in opinion and can involve both disagreements about issues and negative views of other groups. Since most environmental problems are collective action problems, polarization may interfere with the kinds of deliberation and collaborations needed for effective environmental decision-making. In this review, we examine how polarization influences environmental decision-making and what strategies could be useful for preventing or reducing the negative consequences of polarization. Evidence about the extent of polarization among citizens suggests the current situation may be less severe than is sometimes assumed. The coevolution of individual views, network interactions, and social media that cause polarization is complex and subject to rapid change. However, there are interventions that seem to be effective at reducing polarization.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of opinion polarization and perceived polarization on environmental decision-making, with a focus on climate change issues. Drawing from research on intergroup relations and social psychology, we investigate how polarization affects individuals' willingness to engage in pro-environmental behaviors and support climate policies. Through a series of surveys and experiments involving 1,500 participants from diverse political backgrounds, we find that both actual and perceived polarization significantly influence environmental decision-making processes. Results indicate that higher levels of polarization are associated with decreased support for climate action and reduced willingness to compromise on environmental policies. Furthermore, we observe that perceived polarization often exceeds actual polarization, exacerbating the negative effects on decision-making. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing polarization in environmental discourse and suggest potential strategies for bridging ideological divides to promote more effective climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.", "label": 0}
