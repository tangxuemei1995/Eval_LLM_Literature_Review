{"grounding": "The few percent of soil organic carbon (SOC) among mineral components form the interface of climate, plant growth, soil biological processes, physical transport infrastructure, and chemical transformations. We explore maps, models, myths, motivation, means of implementation, and modalities for transformation. Theories of place relate geographic variation in SOC to climate, soil types, land cover, and profile depth. Process-level theories of biophysical change and socioeconomic theories of induced change explain SOC transitions that follow from land use change when a declining curve is bent and recovery toward SOC saturation starts. While the desirability of recovering from SOC deficits has been mainstreamed into climate policy, the effectiveness of proposed measures taken remains contested. Process-level requirements for transitions at plot and landscape scales remain uncertain. Expectations of policy-induced SOC transitions have to align with national cross-sectoral C accounting and be managed realistically with land users (farmers) and commodity supply chains (private sector, consumers).", "generated_text": "This review examines the role of soils as carbon stores and sinks in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. We explore current expectations, observed patterns, and underlying processes of soil carbon dynamics using advanced modeling approaches such as the Century and Millennial models. The study investigates factors influencing carbon sequestration, including decomposition rates, litter quality, and root turnover. We analyze global soil mapping efforts to assess carbon storage potential and discuss the implications for soil health and climate policy. The review highlights the complex interplay between soil properties, land management practices, and environmental factors in determining soil carbon dynamics. Finally, we evaluate the prospects of transitioning towards enhanced soil carbon sequestration, considering both challenges and opportunities in implementing effective climate change mitigation strategies. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers and researchers working towards sustainable soil management and climate change adaptation.", "label": 1}
