{"grounding": "Getting to net-zero-carbon cities while advancing well-being (W), health (H), social equity (E), and climate resilience (R) (referred to as the WHER outcomes) is critical for local and global sustainability. However, science is nascent on the linkages between zero-carbon pathways and WHER outcomes. This article presents a transboundary urban metabolism framework, rooted in seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems, to connect urban decarbonization strategies with WHER outcomes. Applying the framework along with a literature review, we find the evidence for co-beneficial decarbonization to be strong for health; limited for well-being; uncertain for resilience; and requiring intentional design to advance equity, including distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects. We describe the evidence base, identify key knowledge gaps, and delineate broad parameters of a new urban nexus science to enable zero-carbon urban transitions with WHER co-benefits. We highlight the need for fine-scale data encompassing all seven sectors across scales, along with multiple and multiscale climate risks, accompanied by next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models.", "generated_text": "This study explores the nexus between urban decarbonization strategies and their potential co-benefits for health, climate resilience, and equity. Using an urban metabolism framework, we assess the interconnections between zero-carbon transitions and sustainable development goals (SDGs) in cities. Our analysis reveals significant synergies between decarbonization efforts and improvements in public health, well-being, and social equity. We identify key intervention points within urban systems that can simultaneously reduce carbon emissions, enhance climate resilience, and address socioeconomic disparities. The research highlights the importance of integrated approaches to urban planning and policy-making that consider these multiple dimensions. Our findings suggest that targeted investments in low-carbon infrastructure, green spaces, and sustainable transportation can yield substantial co-benefits across various SDGs. This study provides valuable insights for urban decision-makers seeking to implement holistic strategies that address climate change while promoting healthier, more equitable, and resilient cities.", "label": 1}
