{"grounding": "Coastal systems are sensitive to direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Approximately 90% of all coastal areas will be affected by climate change to varying degrees. Nearly half of the world's major cities are located within 50 km of a coast, and coastal population densities are 2.6 times greater than those of inland areas, with a steep rise over the years. While coastal critical infrastructure is expanding, more social and physical systems are increasingly exposed to climate-induced hazards. The interconnectedness and interdependencies of critical infrastructure systems increase their systemic instability and fragility, resulting in greater dynamic risk and cascading impacts. Coastal critical infrastructure systems on several continents are at risk from the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events. Therefore, it is necessary to build and run climate-resilient infrastructure that is planned, designed, implemented, and operated to predict, be prepared for, and adapt to changing climatic circumstances. This review provides an up-to-date, objective, and critical assessment based on the literature to help determine what is known and what needs the future attention of researchers.", "generated_text": "Climate change poses significant threats to coastal critical infrastructure, with potential cascading effects on communities and economies. This study examines the multifaceted risks faced by coastal critical infrastructure due to climate-induced hazards, including sea-level rise, storm surge, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Through a comprehensive literature review and case study analysis, we assess the vulnerability of key infrastructure sectors such as energy, transportation, and water systems in coastal regions. Our findings reveal that the interconnected nature of these systems amplifies the potential for cascading failures, highlighting the need for integrated resilience strategies. We identify gaps in current risk assessment methodologies and propose a framework for evaluating the compound effects of multiple climate hazards on critical infrastructure. The study emphasizes the importance of adaptive management approaches and cross-sector collaboration in enhancing infrastructure resilience. Our research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on climate change adaptation and provides valuable insights for policymakers and infrastructure planners in developing robust, long-term strategies to safeguard coastal critical infrastructure.", "label": 1}
