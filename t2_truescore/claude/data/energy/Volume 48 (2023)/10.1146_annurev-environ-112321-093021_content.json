{"grounding": "Urban overheating is the most documented phenomenon of climate change impacting humans. This article presents the most recent developments on the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating and the potential synergies with global climatic change. It analyses the latest qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of higher urban temperatures on buildings\u2019 energy supply and demand, heat-related mortality, morbidity and wellbeing, human productivity, survivability of low-income populations, and environmental quality of cities. It describes the state of the art on the development of innovative mitigation materials, advanced urban greenery, heat dissipation, and evaporative techniques as the main mitigation and adaptation technologies to offset the impact of urban overheating. It also analyses the current knowledge on the impact of each mitigation technology on energy, health, environmental quality, urban economy, and survivability. Finally, this article presents the main future challenges related to urban overheating and proposes a specific research agenda to alleviate and counterbalance its impact on human life.", "generated_text": "Urban overheating, characterized by elevated temperatures in cities compared to surrounding rural areas, has become a critical environmental challenge. This comprehensive review examines the magnitude, characteristics, and impacts of urban heat islands across global cities. We analyze the complex interplay of factors contributing to urban overheating, including built environment, anthropogenic heat emissions, and reduced vegetation. The study explores the multifaceted consequences of overheating on human health, energy consumption, and urban ecosystems. We evaluate various heat mitigation strategies, such as green infrastructure, cool materials, and urban design modifications, assessing their effectiveness in different urban contexts. Additionally, we discuss adaptation measures to enhance urban resilience against heat stress. The review concludes by identifying key knowledge gaps and future research directions, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to address urban overheating in the face of climate change and rapid urbanization.", "label": 1}
