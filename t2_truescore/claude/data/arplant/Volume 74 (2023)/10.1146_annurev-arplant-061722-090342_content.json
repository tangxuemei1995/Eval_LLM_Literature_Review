{"grounding": "Plant roots associate with diverse microbes (including bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists, and viruses) collectively called the root-associated microbiome. Among them, mycorrhizal fungi colonize host roots and improve their access to nutrients, usually phosphorus and nitrogen. In exchange, plants deliver photosynthetic carbon to the colonizing fungi. This nutrient exchange affects key soil processes, the carbon cycle, and plant health and therefore has a strong influence on the plant and microbe ecosystems. The framework of nutrient exchange and regulation between host plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has recently been established. The local and systemic regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by plant nutrient status and the autoregulation of mycorrhizae are strategies by which plants maintain a stabilizing free-market symbiosis. A better understanding of the synergistic effects between mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizosphere microorganisms is an essential precondition for their use as biofertilizers and bioprotectors for sustainable agriculture and forestry management.", "generated_text": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis plays a crucial role in plant growth and stress adaptation across diverse ecosystems. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of mycorrhizal interactions, from molecular mechanisms to ecosystem-level impacts. We explore the genetic basis of symbiosis establishment, the role of mycorrhizae helper bacteria, and the complex nutrient exchange processes between plants and fungi. The common mycorrhizal network is examined as a key facilitator of inter-plant communication and resource allocation. We discuss how mycorrhizal associations enhance plant stress resistance, including drought tolerance and pathogen defense. The autoregulation of mycorrhizae is investigated as a critical control mechanism in symbiosis development. Finally, we consider the broader ecological implications of mycorrhizal symbiosis, including its influence on plant community structure and ecosystem functioning. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the multifaceted nature of mycorrhizal symbiosis and its significance in plant biology and ecology.", "label": 1}
