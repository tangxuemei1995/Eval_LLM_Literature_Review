{"grounding": "Plant invasions, a byproduct of globalization, are increasing worldwide. Because of their ecological and economic impacts, considerable efforts have been made to understand and predict the success of non-native plants. Numerous frameworks, hypotheses, and theories have been advanced to conceptualize the interactions of multiple drivers and context dependence of invasion success with the aim of achieving robust explanations with predictive power. We review these efforts from a community-level perspective rather than a biogeographical one, focusing on terrestrial systems, and explore the roles of intrinsic plant properties in determining species invasiveness, as well as the effects of biotic and abiotic conditions in mediating ecosystem invasibility (or resistance) and ecological and evolutionary processes. We also consider the fundamental influences of human-induced changes at scales ranging from local to global in triggering, promoting, and sustaining plant invasions and discuss how these changes could alter future invasion trajectories.", "generated_text": "Invasive plants pose significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. This review explores the factors contributing to the success of invasive plants in their non-native habitats. We examine the role of functional traits, such as rapid growth rates and high reproductive output, in conferring competitive advantages to invasive species. Additionally, we investigate how biotic interactions, including reduced herbivory and pathogen pressure in novel environments, facilitate invasion success. The concept of ecosystem invasibility is discussed, highlighting how disturbance and resource availability influence community susceptibility to invasion. We also consider the importance of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptations in enabling invasive plants to thrive across diverse environmental conditions. By synthesizing recent research on invasive plant ecology, this review provides insights into the complex mechanisms underlying invasion success and offers implications for management strategies and future research directions.", "label": 1}
