{"grounding": "The plant hormone auxin is certainly the most studied developmental regulator in plants. The many functions of auxin during development, from the embryo to the root and shoot construction, are mediated by an ever-growing collection of molecular regulators, with an overwhelming degree of both ubiquity and complexity that we are still far from fully understanding and that biological experiments alone cannot grasp. In this review, we discuss how bioinformatics and computational modeling approaches have helped in recent years to explore this complexity and to push the frontiers of our understanding of auxin biology. We focus on how analysis of massive amounts of genomic data and construction of computational models to simulate auxin-regulated processes at different scales have complemented wet experiments to increase the understanding of how auxin acts in the nucleus to regulate transcription and how auxin movement between cells regulates development at the tissular scale.", "generated_text": "Auxin, a crucial plant hormone, orchestrates numerous developmental processes and adaptive responses. This review explores the intersection of auxin biology and computational approaches, highlighting how bioinformatics and modeling have revolutionized our understanding of auxin signaling and transport. We discuss recent advances in decoding auxin-responsive gene networks, predicting auxin distribution patterns, and simulating auxin-mediated developmental processes. The integration of large-scale genomic data with computational models has provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of auxin pathways and their role in plant diversification. Furthermore, we examine how synthetic biology approaches, guided by in silico predictions, are enabling the engineering of novel auxin-based tools and systems. This synthesis of auxin biology and computational science not only enhances our fundamental knowledge but also opens new avenues for crop improvement and biotechnological applications.", "label": 1}
