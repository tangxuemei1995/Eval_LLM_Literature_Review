{"grounding": "Living structures constantly interact with the biotic and abiotic environment by sensing and responding via specialized functional parts. In other words, biological bodies embody highly functional machines and actuators. What are the signatures of engineering mechanisms in biology? In this review, we connect the dots in the literature to seek engineering principles in plant structures. We identify three thematic motifs\u2014bilayer actuator, slender-bodied functional surface, and self-similarity\u2014and provide an overview of their structure\u2013function relationships. Unlike human-engineered machines and actuators, biological counterparts may appear suboptimal in design, loosely complying with physical theories or engineering principles. We postulate what factors may influence the evolution of functional morphology and anatomy to dissect and comprehend better the why behind the biological forms.", "generated_text": "This review explores the engineering principles underlying plant forms and functions, emphasizing the intricate relationship between structure and function in botanical systems. We examine key biomechanical concepts such as bilayer structures, slender bodies, and self-similarity, which are prevalent in plant architecture and contribute to their remarkable adaptability and efficiency. The study highlights how these engineering themes have shaped plant evolution and design, enabling them to overcome environmental challenges and optimize resource utilization. By analyzing the mechanical properties and functional adaptations of various plant structures, we demonstrate the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding plant biology. This synthesis of engineering and botanical perspectives provides valuable insights into biological design principles and their potential applications in biomimetic technologies.", "label": 1}
