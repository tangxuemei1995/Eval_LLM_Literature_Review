{"grounding": "Optogenetics is a technique employing natural or genetically engineered photoreceptors in transgene organisms to manipulate biological activities with light. Light can be turned on or off, and adjusting its intensity and duration allows optogenetic fine-tuning of cellular processes in a noninvasive and spatiotemporally resolved manner. Since the introduction of Channelrhodopsin-2 and phytochrome-based switches nearly 20 years ago, optogenetic tools have been applied in a variety of model organisms with enormous success, but rarely in plants. For a long time, the dependence of plant growth on light and the absence of retinal, the rhodopsin chromophore, prevented the establishment of plant optogenetics until recent progress overcame these difficulties. We summarize the recent results of work in the field to control plant growth and cellular motion via green light\u2013gated ion channels and present successful applications to light-control gene expression with single or combined photoswitches in plants. Furthermore, we highlight the technical requirements and options for future plant optogenetic research.", "generated_text": "Optogenetics, a revolutionary technique combining optics and genetics, has emerged as a powerful tool in plant biology research. This review explores the application of optogenetic methods in plants, focusing on the utilization of photoreceptors, rhodopsins, biosensors, and optoswitches. We discuss the development of light-sensitive proteins and their integration into plant systems to control cellular processes with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. The review highlights recent advances in engineering plant photoreceptors and rhodopsins for optogenetic applications, as well as the design of novel biosensors for real-time monitoring of cellular events. Additionally, we examine the use of optoswitches to regulate gene expression and protein activity in plants. The potential of optogenetics in elucidating complex plant signaling networks, studying developmental processes, and improving crop traits is addressed. Finally, we consider future directions and challenges in expanding the optogenetic toolkit for plant research and biotechnology applications.", "label": 1}
