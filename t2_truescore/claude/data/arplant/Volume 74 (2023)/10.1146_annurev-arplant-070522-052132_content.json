{"grounding": "Proteins are workhorses in the cell; they form stable and more often dynamic, transient protein\u2013protein interactions, assemblies, and networks and have an intimate interplay with DNA and RNA. These network interactions underlie fundamental biological processes and play essential roles in cellular function. The proximity-dependent biotinylation labeling approach combined with mass spectrometry (PL-MS) has recently emerged as a powerful technique to dissect the complex cellular network at the molecular level. In PL-MS, by fusing a genetically encoded proximity-labeling (PL) enzyme to a protein or a localization signal peptide, the enzyme is targeted to a protein complex of interest or to an organelle, allowing labeling of proximity proteins within a zoom radius. These biotinylated proteins can then be captured by streptavidin beads and identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. Recently engineered PL enzymes such as TurboID have a much-improved enzymatic activity, enabling spatiotemporal mapping with a dramatically increased signal-to-noise ratio. PL-MS has revolutionized the way we perform proteomics by overcoming several hurdles imposed by traditional technology, such as biochemical fractionation and affinity purification mass spectrometry. In this review, we focus on biotin ligase\u2013based PL-MS applications that have been, or are likely to be, adopted by the plant field. We discuss the experimental designs and review the different choices for engineered biotin ligases, enrichment, and quantification strategies. Lastly, we review the validation and discuss future perspectives.", "generated_text": "Proximity labeling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleotide interactions, and subcellular proteomes in plants. This technique allows for the identification of spatially and temporally proximate molecules within living cells, providing valuable insights into cellular organization and function. Recent advancements in proximity labeling methods have enabled researchers to investigate cell type-specific proteomes and quantify protein interactions with unprecedented resolution. This review summarizes the current state of proximity labeling in plant biology, highlighting its applications in elucidating protein complexes, mapping organelle proteomes, and uncovering dynamic protein associations. We discuss various proximity labeling approaches, including BioID, APEX, and TurboID, and their adaptations for use in plant systems. Furthermore, we explore the integration of proximity labeling with other cutting-edge technologies, such as single-cell proteomics and in situ protein analysis. The challenges and limitations of proximity labeling in plants are addressed, along with potential solutions and future directions. As this technique continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize our understanding of plant cellular biology and provide new avenues for crop improvement and biotechnological applications.", "label": 1}
