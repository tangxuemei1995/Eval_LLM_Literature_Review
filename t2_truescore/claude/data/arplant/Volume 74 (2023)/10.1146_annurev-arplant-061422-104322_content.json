{"grounding": "Despite the numerous advances made in our understanding of the physiology and molecular genetics of salinity tolerance, there have been relatively few applications of these to improve the salt tolerance of crops. The most significant advances have historically utilized intraspecific variation, introgression of traits from close crop wild relatives, or, less frequently, introgression from more distant relatives. Advanced lines often fail due to difficulties in the introgression or tracking of traits or due to yield penalties associated with the alleles in nonsaline environments. However, the greatest limitation is that salinity is not a primary trait for breeders. We must close the gap between research and delivery, especially for farmers who have precious few alternatives. These efforts should include a reassessment of old techniques such as grafting current crops with salt-tolerant hybrid rootstocks. Alternatively, future crops can be produced via domestication of salt-tolerant wild species\u2014an approach that is now feasible in our lifetime.", "generated_text": "As global food security faces increasing challenges from soil salinization, the development of salt-tolerant crops has become a critical research priority. This review examines recent advances in enhancing salinity tolerance in major crop species, focusing on three key approaches: traditional breeding, genetic modification, and neodomestication of crop wild relatives. We evaluate the progress made in identifying and incorporating salt tolerance traits, highlighting successful examples and persistent obstacles. The potential of emerging technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and high-throughput phenotyping, in accelerating the development of salt-tolerant varieties is discussed. Additionally, we address the complexities of translating laboratory successes to field-level improvements in crop yield under saline conditions. This comprehensive analysis underscores the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to deliver salt-tolerant crops that can meet the growing global demand for food in increasingly challenging environments.", "label": 0}
