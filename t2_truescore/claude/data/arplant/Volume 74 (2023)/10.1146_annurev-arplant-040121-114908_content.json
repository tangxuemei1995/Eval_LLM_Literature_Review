{"grounding": "Plant volatiles comprise thousands of molecules from multiple metabolic pathways, distinguished by sufficient vapor pressure to evaporate into the headspace under normal environmental conditions. Many are implicated as ecological signals, but what is the evidence\u2014and how do they work? Volatiles diffuse, are carried by wind, and may be taken up by other organisms or degrade with exposure to atmospheric ozone, radicals, and UV light; visual signals such as color are not subject to these complications (but require a line of sight). Distantly related plants\u2014and nonplants\u2014produce many of the same volatiles, yet specific compounds and blends may be distinct. Here, I present a quantitative review of the literature on plant volatiles as ecological signals, illustrating a field that has focused on developing ideas as much as reporting primary data. I discuss advantages and constraints, review recent advances, and propose considerations for primary studies to elucidate particular functions of plant volatiles.", "generated_text": "Plant volatiles play crucial roles in ecological signaling, yet our understanding of their spatiotemporal dynamics and environmental influences remains limited. This review synthesizes current knowledge on where, when, and why plant volatiles mediate ecological interactions. We explore the spatial distributions of volatile signals, from leaf-level emissions to landscape-scale patterns, and examine their temporal dynamics across diurnal, seasonal, and evolutionary timescales. The interplay between plant volatiles and environmental factors, including wind, temperature, and atmospheric chemistry, is critically assessed. We highlight how advancements in analytical techniques and modeling approaches have enhanced our ability to track volatile signals in complex ecosystems. However, significant research gaps persist, particularly in understanding the long-range effects of volatiles and their interactions with changing climates. This review underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches combining plant biology, atmospheric science, and ecology to fully elucidate the multifaceted nature of plant volatile-mediated ecological signaling.", "label": 1}
