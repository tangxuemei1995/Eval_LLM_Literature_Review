{"grounding": "Photoperiod-measuring mechanisms allow organisms to anticipate seasonal changes to align reproduction and growth with appropriate times of the year. This review provides historical and modern context to studies of plant photoperiodism. We describe how studies of photoperiodic flowering in plants led to the first theoretical models of photoperiod-measuring mechanisms in any organism. We discuss how more recent molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis and rice have revisited these concepts. We then discuss how photoperiod transcriptomics provides new lessons about photoperiodic gene regulatory networks and the discovery of noncanonical photoperiod-measuring systems housed in metabolic networks of plants. This leads to an examination of nonflowering developmental processes controlled by photoperiod, including metabolism and growth. Finally, we highlight the importance of understanding photoperiodism in the context of climate change, delving into the rapid latitudinal migration of plant species and the potential role of photoperiod-measuring systems in generating photic barriers during migration.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in plant photoperiodism research have unveiled novel mechanisms underlying the perception and measurement of day length. This review explores emerging concepts that challenge the traditional external coincidence model, highlighting the role of metabolic processes in daylength measurement. We discuss the discovery of noncanonical photoperiod measurement systems that operate independently of the circadian clock, providing plants with additional flexibility in responding to environmental cues. Furthermore, we examine the intriguing connection between photosynthesis and photoperiodic responses, shedding light on how plants integrate light signals with their metabolic status. These findings not only expand our understanding of plant adaptation to seasonal changes but also offer potential applications in crop improvement and climate change mitigation strategies. As we unravel the complexities of plant photoperiodism, new horizons emerge for both basic research and practical applications in agriculture and environmental science.", "label": 1}
