{"grounding": "Recurring patterns are an integral part of life on Earth. Through evolution or breeding, plants have acquired systems that coordinate with the cyclic patterns driven by Earth's movement through space. The biosystem responses to these physical rhythms result in biological cycles of daily and seasonal activity that feed back into the physical cycles. Signaling networks to coordinate growth and molecular activities with these persistent cycles have been integrated into plant biochemistry. The plant circadian clock is the coordinator of this complex, multiscale, temporal schedule. However, we have detailed knowledge of the circadian clock components and functions in only a few species under controlled conditions. We are just beginning to understand how the clock functions in real-world conditions. This review examines what we know about the circadian clock in diverse plant species, the challenges with extrapolating data from controlled environments, and the need to anticipate how plants will respond to climate change.", "generated_text": "Circadian rhythms play a crucial role in organisms' adaptation to their environment, but the impact of rapidly changing climatic conditions on these internal clocks remains poorly understood. This review explores the intersection of circadian rhythms and environmental adaptation in the context of climate change. We examine how alterations in temperature, light cycles, and other environmental cues affect signaling networks that regulate circadian rhythms across diverse species. Recent findings suggest that disruptions to these rhythms may have far-reaching consequences for organismal fitness, population dynamics, and ecosystem functioning. We discuss the potential for circadian plasticity as a mechanism for coping with environmental change and highlight the need for integrative research approaches. Understanding the complex interplay between circadian systems and changing environments is essential for predicting and mitigating the ecological impacts of climate change on biological timekeeping mechanisms.", "label": 1}
