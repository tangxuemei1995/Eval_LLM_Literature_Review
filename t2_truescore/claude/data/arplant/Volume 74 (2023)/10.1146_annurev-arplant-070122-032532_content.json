{"grounding": "Chloroplasts are the defining plant organelles with responsibility for photosynthesis and other vital functions. To deliver these functions, they possess a complex proteome comprising thousands of largely nucleus-encoded proteins. Composition of the proteome is controlled by diverse processes affecting protein translocation and degradation\u2014our focus here. Most chloroplast proteins are imported from the cytosol via multiprotein translocons in the outer and inner envelope membranes (the TOC and TIC complexes, respectively), or via one of several noncanonical pathways, and then sorted by different systems to organellar subcompartments. Chloroplast proteolysis is equally complex, involving the concerted action of internal proteases of prokaryotic origin and the nucleocytosolic ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS). The UPS degrades unimported proteins in the cytosol and chloroplast-resident proteins via chloroplast-associated protein degradation (CHLORAD). The latter targets the TOC apparatus to regulate protein import, as well as numerous internal proteins directly, to reconfigure chloroplast functions in response to developmental and environmental signals.", "generated_text": "Chloroplasts, essential organelles in plant cells, rely on a complex proteostasis network to maintain their function and adapt to environmental changes. This review explores the intricate processes involved in chloroplast proteostasis, focusing on protein import, sorting, ubiquitination, and proteolysis. We discuss the mechanisms of protein translocation across chloroplast membranes, highlighting the role of translocons and chaperones in facilitating efficient import. The review also examines the sorting of proteins to various chloroplast compartments and the importance of targeting signals. Furthermore, we analyze the emerging role of ubiquitination in chloroplast protein quality control and its interplay with proteolysis. The diverse proteolytic systems within chloroplasts, including stromal and thylakoid-associated proteases, are examined in detail. Understanding these interconnected processes is crucial for unraveling chloroplast function and developing strategies to enhance plant productivity and stress tolerance.", "label": 1}
