{"grounding": "Mutation is the source of all heritable diversity, the essential material of evolution and breeding. While mutation rates are often regarded as constant, variability in mutation rates has been observed at nearly every level\u2014varying across mutation types, genome locations, gene functions, epigenomic contexts, environmental conditions, genotypes, and species. This mutation rate variation arises from differential rates of DNA damage, repair, and transposable element activation and insertion that together produce what is measured by DNA mutation rates. We review historical and recent investigations into the causes and consequences of mutation rate variability in plants by focusing on the mechanisms shaping this variation. Emerging mechanistic models point to the evolvability of mutation rate variation across genomes via mechanisms that target DNA repair, shaping the diversification of plants at phenotypic and genomic scales.", "generated_text": "Mutation rate variability in plant genomes is a critical factor influencing plant evolution and adaptation. This review explores the underlying causes of this variability, focusing on DNA repair mechanisms, chromatin structure, and their interactions. We examine how differences in DNA repair efficiency across plant species and genomic regions contribute to mutation rate heterogeneity. The role of chromatin organization in modulating DNA accessibility and repair processes is also discussed, highlighting its impact on mutation rates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental factors and plant-specific genomic features, such as polyploidy and transposable elements, influence mutation rates. Understanding these causes of mutation rate variability provides insights into plant genome evolution, adaptation to changing environments, and the potential for crop improvement through targeted manipulation of mutation rates in breeding programs.", "label": 1}
