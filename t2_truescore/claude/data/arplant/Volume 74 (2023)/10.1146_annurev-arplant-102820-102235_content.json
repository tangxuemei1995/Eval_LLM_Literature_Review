{"grounding": "Temperature is a key environmental cue that influences the distribution and behavior of plants globally. Understanding how plants sense temperature and integrate this information into their development is important to determine how plants adapt to climate change and to apply this knowledge to the breeding of climate-resilient crops. The mechanisms of temperature perception in eukaryotes are only just beginning to be understood, with multiple molecular phenomena with inherent temperature dependencies, such as RNA melting, phytochrome dark reversion, and protein phase change, being exploited by nature to create thermosensory signaling networks. Here, we review recent progress in understanding how temperature sensing in four major pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana occurs: vernalization, cold stress, thermomorphogenesis, and heat stress. We discuss outstanding questions in the field and the importance of these mechanisms in the context of breeding climate-resilient crops.", "generated_text": "Plants, as sessile organisms, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense and respond to temperature fluctuations. This review explores the current understanding of temperature sensing in plants, focusing on Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. We discuss the molecular basis of thermosensors and their roles in mediating plant responses to both heat and cold stress. The review highlights key thermosensory pathways involved in plant adaptation and thermomorphogenesis, including the regulation of gene expression, protein stability, and cellular signaling cascades. Recent advances in identifying novel temperature-responsive elements and their integration into broader stress response networks are examined. Understanding these intricate temperature sensing mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to enhance crop resilience in the face of climate change and extreme weather events.", "label": 1}
