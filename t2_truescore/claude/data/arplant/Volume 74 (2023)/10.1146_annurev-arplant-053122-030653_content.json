{"grounding": "There is intense interest in using genome editing technologies to domesticate wild plants, or accelerate the improvement of weakly domesticated crops, in de novo domestication. Here, we discuss promising genetic strategies, with a focus on plant development. Importantly, genome editing releases us from dependence on random mutagenesis or intraspecific diversity, allowing us to draw solutions more broadly from diversity. However, sparse understanding of the complex genetics of diversity limits innovation. Beyond genetics, we urge the ethical use of indigenous knowledge, indigenous plants, and ethnobotany. De novo domestication still requires conventional breeding by phenotypic selection, especially in the development of crops for diverse environments and cultures. Indeed, uniting genome editing with selective breeding could facilitate faster and better outcomes than either technology alone. Domestication is complex and incompletely understood, involving changes to many aspects of plant biology and human culture. Success in de novo domestication requires careful attention to history and collaboration across traditional boundaries.", "generated_text": "De novo domestication using genome editing presents a promising avenue for rapidly developing climate-resilient crops. This review explores the potential and challenges of this approach, integrating insights from plant developmental genetics, ethnobotany, and climate change research. We examine how CRISPR-Cas9 and other genome editing tools can be used to introduce domestication traits into wild plant species, potentially accelerating the creation of new crop varieties. The paper discusses key targets for genetic modification, including yield, nutritional content, and stress tolerance. We also consider the ecological and ethical implications of de novo domestication, as well as potential barriers to adoption. By synthesizing current research and identifying knowledge gaps, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the power and perils of de novo domestication in the context of global food security and environmental change.", "label": 1}
