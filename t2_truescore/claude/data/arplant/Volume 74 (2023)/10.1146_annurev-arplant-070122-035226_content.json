{"grounding": "Plant cells accumulate small RNA molecules that regulate plant development, genome stability, and environmental responses. These small RNAs fall into three major classes based on their function and mechanisms of biogenesis\u2014microRNAs, heterochromatic small interfering RNAs, and secondary small interfering RNAs\u2014plus several other less well-characterized categories. Biogenesis of each small RNA class requires a pathway of factors, some specific to each pathway and others involved in multiple pathways. Diverse sequenced plant genomes, along with rapid developments in sequencing, imaging, and genetic transformation techniques, have enabled significant progress in understanding the biogenesis, functions, and evolution of plant small RNAs, including those that had been poorly characterized because they were absent or had low representation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we review recent findings about plant small RNAs and discuss our current understanding of their biogenesis mechanisms, targets, modes of action, mobility, and functions in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including economically important crops.", "generated_text": "Small RNAs play crucial roles in plant development and stress responses through gene regulation. This review explores the biogenesis, regulatory mechanisms, and functions of three major classes of plant small RNAs: microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). We discuss the distinct pathways involved in their production, including the roles of key enzymes such as Dicer-like proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The review highlights the diverse regulatory functions of these small RNAs in gene silencing, chromatin modification, and defense against pathogens. Special attention is given to mobile siRNAs, which can move between cells and tissues, facilitating long-distance signaling and systemic regulation. We also examine the involvement of small RNAs in various aspects of plant development, including organ formation, flowering time control, and stress responses. Understanding these complex regulatory networks is crucial for advancing our knowledge of plant biology and developing novel strategies for crop improvement.", "label": 1}
