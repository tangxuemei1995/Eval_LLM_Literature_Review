{"grounding": "The establishment, maintenance, and removal of epigenetic modifications provide an additional layer of regulation, beyond genetically encoded factors, by which plants can control developmental processes and adapt to the environment. Epigenetic inheritance, while historically referring to information not encoded in the DNA sequence that is inherited between generations, can also refer to epigenetic modifications that are maintained within an individual but are reset between generations. Both types of epigenetic inheritance occur in plants, and the functions and mechanisms distinguishing the two are of great interest to the field. Here, we discuss examples of epigenetic dynamics and maintenance during selected stages of growth and development and their functional consequences. Epigenetic states are also dynamic in response to stress, with consequences for transposable element regulation. How epigenetic resetting between generations occurs during normal development and in response to stress is an emerging area of research.", "generated_text": "Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in plant development and stress responses. This review explores the intricate mechanisms of epigenetic control, focusing on histone modifications and DNA methylation, and their impact on gene expression and transposable element activity. We examine how these epigenetic marks are established, maintained, and dynamically altered during various stages of plant development, from seed germination to flowering. Additionally, we discuss the emerging concept of epigenetic memory, particularly in the context of heat stress responses. The capacity for plants to retain epigenetic information across generations and its potential implications for adaptive responses to environmental challenges are evaluated. Understanding these epigenetic processes provides valuable insights into plant plasticity and resilience, with implications for crop improvement and adaptation to changing climates.", "label": 1}
