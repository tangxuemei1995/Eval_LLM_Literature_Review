{"grounding": "The aboveground parts of terrestrial plants are colonized by a variety of microbes that collectively constitute the phyllosphere microbiota. Decades of pioneering work using individual phyllosphere microbes, including commensals and pathogens, have provided foundational knowledge about how individual microbes adapt to the phyllosphere environment and their role in providing biological control against pathogens. Recent studies have revealed a more complete repertoire of phyllosphere microbiota across plant taxa and how plants respond to and regulate the level and composition of phyllosphere microbiota. Importantly, the development of several gnotobiotic systems is allowing causative and mechanistic studies to determine the contributions of microbiota to phyllosphere health and productivity. New insights into how the phyllosphere carries out key biological processes, including photosynthesis, biomass accumulation, reproduction, and defense against biotic and abiotic insults, in either the presence or absence of a normal microbiota could unleash novel plant- and microbiota-based technologies to improve agriculturally relevant traits of crop plants.", "generated_text": "The phyllosphere microbiome, comprising microorganisms inhabiting plant aerial surfaces, plays a crucial role in plant health and ecosystem functioning. This review explores the complex interactions between phyllosphere microbiota and their host plants, drawing parallels with the gut microbiome in animals. We examine the diversity of epiphytes and endophytes, their colonization strategies, and their impact on plant immunity. The concept of dysbiosis in the phyllosphere is discussed, highlighting its potential consequences for plant health and productivity. Furthermore, we investigate the factors influencing phyllosphere community composition, including environmental conditions, plant genotype, and anthropogenic activities. The phytobiome approach, which considers the plant and its associated microorganisms as a holistic system, is presented as a promising framework for understanding and manipulating plant-microbe interactions. This review underscores the importance of phyllosphere microbiome research in developing sustainable agricultural practices and enhancing plant resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses.", "label": 1}
