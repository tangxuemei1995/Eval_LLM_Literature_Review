{"grounding": "Plant hormones are a group of small signaling molecules produced by plants at very low concentrations that have the ability to move and function at distal sites. Hormone homeostasis is critical to balance plant growth and development and is regulated at multiple levels, including hormone biosynthesis, catabolism, perception, and transduction. In addition, plants move hormones over short and long distances to regulate various developmental processes and responses to environmental factors. Transporters coordinate these movements, resulting in hormone maxima, gradients, and cellular and subcellular sinks. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of most of the characterized plant hormone transporters with respect to biochemical, physiological, and developmental activities. We further discuss the subcellular localizations of transporters, their substrate specificities, and the need for multiple transporters for the same hormone in the context of plant growth and development.", "generated_text": "Plant hormones, or phytohormones, are essential signaling molecules that regulate various aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. This review explores the intricate mechanisms of hormone transport and localization, which are crucial for maintaining hormone homeostasis and facilitating their functions. We examine the latest findings on the transport mechanisms of key phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). The role of specific transporters and their regulation in hormone distribution is discussed, highlighting the importance of spatial and temporal control in hormone signaling. Understanding these transport processes provides valuable insights into plant hormone action and offers potential targets for improving crop productivity and stress tolerance in agriculture.", "label": 1}
