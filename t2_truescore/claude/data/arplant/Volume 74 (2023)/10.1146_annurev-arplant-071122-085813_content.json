{"grounding": "Since the discovery of the first ribonucleic acid (RNA) modifications in transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), scientists have been on a quest to decipher the identities and functions of RNA modifications in biological systems. The last decade has seen monumental growth in the number of studies that have characterized and assessed the functionalities of RNA modifications in the field of plant biology. Owing to these studies, we now categorize RNA modifications based on their chemical nature and the RNA on which they are found, as well as the array of proteins that are involved in the processes that add, read, and remove them from an RNA molecule. Beyond their identity, another key piece of the puzzle is the functional significance of the various types of RNA modifications. Here, we shed light on recent studies that help establish our current understanding of the diversity of RNA modifications found in plant transcriptomes and the functions they play at both the molecular (e.g., RNA stability, translation, and transport) and organismal (e.g., stress response and development) levels. Finally, we consider the key research questions related to plant gene expression and biology in general and highlight developments in various technologies that are driving our insights forward in this research area.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cellular processes in plants. This review explores the diversity and functions of RNA modifications in plants, focusing on mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA modifications. We discuss the most prevalent modifications, including N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and their impact on plant development and stress responses. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed the widespread occurrence of these modifications across plant transcriptomes. We examine the functional diversity of RNA modifications, highlighting their roles in mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and alternative splicing. Additionally, we address the involvement of RNA modifications in plant stress responses, including abiotic and biotic stresses. The review also covers the enzymes responsible for writing, reading, and erasing these modifications, as well as their evolutionary conservation across plant species. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps and propose future research directions to further elucidate the complex interplay between RNA modifications and plant physiology. Understanding these modifications will provide valuable insights into plant adaptation mechanisms and potentially lead to novel strategies for crop improvement.", "label": 1}
