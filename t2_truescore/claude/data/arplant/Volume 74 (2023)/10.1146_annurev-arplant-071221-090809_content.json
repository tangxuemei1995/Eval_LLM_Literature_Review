{"grounding": "Similar traits and functions commonly evolve in nature. Here, we explore patterns of replicated evolution across the plant kingdom and discuss the processes responsible for such patterns. We begin this review by defining replicated evolution and the theoretical, genetic, and ecological concepts that help explain it. We then focus our attention on empirical cases of replicated evolution at the phenotypic and genotypic levels. We find that replication at the ecotype level is common, but evidence for repeated ecological speciation is surprisingly sparse. On the other hand, the replicated evolution of ecological strategies and physiological mechanisms across similar biomes appears to be pervasive. We conclude by highlighting where future efforts can help us bridge the understanding of replicated evolution across different levels of biological organization. Earth's landscape is diverse but also repeats itself. Organisms seem to have followed suit.", "generated_text": "Replicated evolution, encompassing both convergent and parallel adaptations, is a fascinating phenomenon observed in plant species across diverse environments. This review explores the mechanisms driving replicated evolution in plants, focusing on the interplay between adaptive pressures and genetic constraints. We examine case studies of convergent and parallel evolution in various plant lineages, highlighting their roles in speciation and adaptation to similar ecological niches. The paper discusses the molecular basis of replicated traits, including the contribution of gene duplication, regulatory changes, and horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, we analyze the evolutionary constraints that shape these repeated patterns and their implications for understanding plant diversity and predicting future adaptations. This synthesis provides insights into the predictability of evolution and the factors influencing the repeatability of adaptive solutions in the plant kingdom.", "label": 0}
