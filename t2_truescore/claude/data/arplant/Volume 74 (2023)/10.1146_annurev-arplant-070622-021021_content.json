{"grounding": "My research career started with an ambition to work out how genes are regulated in plants. I tried out various experimental systems\u2014artichoke tissue culture in Edinburgh; soybean root nodules in Montreal; soybean hypocotyls in Athens, Georgia; and cereal aleurones in Cambridge\u2014but eventually I discovered plant viruses. Viral satellite RNAs were my first interest, but I then explored transgenic and natural disease resistance and was led by curiosity into topics beyond virology, including RNA silencing, epigenetics, and more recently, genome evolution. On the way, I have learned about approaches to research, finding tractable systems, and taking academic research into the real world. I have always tried to consider the broader significance of our work, and my current projects address the definition of epigenetics, the arms race concept of disease resistance, and Darwin's abominable mystery.", "generated_text": "This review explores the multifaceted role of RNA in biological systems, focusing on its significance in gene expression, plant virus interactions, and disease resistance mechanisms. We examine the evolutionary implications of RNA-based processes and their potential applications in agricultural technology. The paper discusses recent advancements in our understanding of RNA's role in plant-pathogen interactions and how this knowledge can be harnessed to develop novel strategies for crop protection. Additionally, we consider the broader evolutionary context of RNA's functions, from its hypothesized role in the origin of life to its current importance in cellular processes. The review concludes with an autobiographical perspective on the author's journey in RNA research, highlighting key discoveries and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 0}
