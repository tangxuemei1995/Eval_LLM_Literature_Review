{"grounding": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) genes encode ion channels with demonstrated roles in electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling. The expansion of the GLR family along the lineage of land plants, culminating in the appearance of a multiclade system among flowering plants, has been a topic of interest since their discovery nearly 25 years ago. GLRs are involved in many physiological processes, from wound signaling to transcriptional regulation to sexual reproduction. Emerging evidence supports the notion that their fundamental functions are conserved among different groups of plants as well. In this review, we update the physiological and genetic evidence for GLRs, establishing their role in signaling and cell\u2013cell communication. Special emphasis is given to the recent discussion of GLRs\u2019 atomic structures. Along with functional assays, a structural view of GLRs\u2019 molecular organization presents a window for novel hypotheses regarding the molecular mechanisms underpinning signaling associated with the ionic fluxes that GLRs regulate. Newly uncovered transcriptional regulations associated with GLRs\u2014which propose the involvement of genes from all clades ofArabidopsis thaliana in ways not previously observed\u2014are discussed in the context of the broader impacts of GLR activity. We posit that the functions of GLRs in plant biology are probably much broader than anticipated, but describing their widespread involvement will only be possible with (a) a comprehensive understanding of the channel's properties at the molecular and structural levels, including protein\u2013protein interactions, and (b) the design of new genetic approaches to explore stress and pathogen responses where precise transcriptional control may result in more precise testable hypotheses to overcome their apparent functional redundancies.", "generated_text": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) ion channels have emerged as crucial components in plant signaling and physiology, bridging the gap between structural elements and signaling pathways. This review explores the multifaceted roles and mechanisms of GLRs in plants, highlighting their importance in excitability, cell-cell communication, and various signaling cascades. GLRs, which share structural similarities with their animal counterparts, are involved in calcium transport and signaling, contributing to the generation and propagation of action potentials in plants. These ion channels respond to a diverse array of amino acids and other ligands, including glutathione, thereby integrating multiple environmental and physiological cues. Recent advances in structural biology and electrophysiology have provided insights into the gating mechanisms and ion selectivity of plant GLRs, revealing both conserved features and unique adaptations compared to animal glutamate receptors. The review discusses the involvement of GLRs in long-distance electrical signaling, which mediates rapid systemic responses to various stimuli, including biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, we examine the role of GLRs in amino acid signaling and their potential contributions to plant nutrition and development. The complex interplay between GLRs and other signaling components, such as calcium-dependent protein kinases and transcription factors, is also addressed. Understanding the functions and mechanisms of plant GLRs not only enhances our knowledge of plant signaling networks but also offers potential applications in crop improvement and stress tolerance.", "label": 1}
