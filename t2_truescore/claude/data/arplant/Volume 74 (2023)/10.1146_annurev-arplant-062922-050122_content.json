{"grounding": "Plants\u2019 ability to chemically modify core structures of specialized metabolites is the main reason why the plant kingdom contains such a wide and rich array of diverse compounds. One of the most important types of chemical modifications of small molecules is the addition of an acyl moiety to produce esters and amides. Large-scale phylogenomics analyses have shown that the enzymes that perform acyl transfer reactions on the myriad small molecules synthesized by plants belong to only a few gene families. This review is focused on describing the biochemistry, evolutionary origins, and chemical ecology implications of one of these families\u2014the BAHD acyltransferases. The growth of advanced metabolomic studies coupled with next-generation sequencing of diverse plant species has confirmed that the BAHD family plays critical roles in modifying nearly all known classes of specialized metabolites. The current and future outlook for research on BAHDs includes expanding their roles in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.", "generated_text": "The BAHD acyltransferase gene family plays a crucial role in plant metabolism, catalyzing the transfer of acyl groups to diverse acceptor molecules. This review explores the expanding functions of BAHD enzymes, focusing on their involvement in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, particularly hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCTs). We discuss the evolutionary significance of BAHD enzymes in land plant adaptation and their contributions to the production of various secondary metabolites, including acylsugars, esters, and amides. Recent advances in understanding BAHD enzyme structure-function relationships and their regulation in different plant species are highlighted. Additionally, we examine the potential applications of BAHD acyltransferases in metabolic engineering and crop improvement. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of BAHD enzymes in plant biology and their potential for biotechnological applications, paving the way for future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
