{"grounding": "\ncis-Regulatory elements encode the genomic blueprints that ensure the proper spatiotemporal patterning of gene expression necessary for appropriate development and responses to the environment. Accumulating evidence implicates changes to gene expression as a major source of phenotypic novelty in eukaryotes, including acute phenotypes such as disease and cancer in mammals. Moreover, genetic and epigenetic variation affecting cis-regulatory sequences over longer evolutionary timescales has become a recurring theme in studies of morphological divergence and local adaptation. Here, we discuss the functions of and methods used to identify various classes of cis-regulatory elements, as well as their role in plant development and response to the environment. We highlight opportunities to exploit cis-regulatory variants underlying plant development and environmental responses for crop improvement efforts. Although a comprehensive understanding of cis-regulatory mechanisms in plants has lagged behind that in animals, we showcase several breakthrough findings that have profoundly influenced plant biology and shaped the overall understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes.", "generated_text": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a crucial role in plant development, adaptation, and evolution by orchestrating gene expression in response to various environmental and developmental cues. This review explores the intricate interplay between CREs, chromatin structure, and transcription factors in regulating plant gene expression. We discuss how CREs contribute to developmental processes, such as organ formation and cell differentiation, by modulating spatiotemporal gene expression patterns. Furthermore, we examine the role of CREs in plant adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses, highlighting their importance in stress response mechanisms. The review also delves into the evolutionary significance of CREs, exploring how changes in these regulatory regions contribute to phenotypic diversity and speciation. Finally, we address recent advances in high-throughput technologies and computational approaches that have enhanced our understanding of CRE function and evolution in plants, paving the way for future research and potential applications in crop improvement.", "label": 1}
