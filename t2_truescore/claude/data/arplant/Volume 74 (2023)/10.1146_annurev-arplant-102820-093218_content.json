{"grounding": "SWITCH deficient SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) class chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to facilitate access of proteins to the genomic DNA for transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Uniquely, SWI/SNF CRCs can both slide the histone octamer along the DNA or eject it from the DNA. Given their ability to change the chromatin status quo, SWI/SNF remodelers are critical for cell fate reprogramming with pioneer and other transcription factors, for responses to environmental challenges, and for disease prevention. Recent cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry approaches have uncovered different subtypes of SWI/SNF complexes with unique properties and functions. At the same time, tethering or rapid depletion and inactivation of SWI/SNF have provided novel insight into SWI/SNF requirements for enhancer activity and into balancing chromatin compaction and accessibility in concert with Polycomb complexes. Given their importance, SWI/SNF recruitment to genomic locations by transcription factors and their biochemical activity is tightly controlled. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of SWI/SNF CRCs in animals and plants and discusses the multiple nuclear and biological roles of SWI/SNF CRCs and how SWI/SNF activity is altered by complex subunit composition, posttranslational modifications, and the chromatin context to support proper development and response to extrinsic cues.", "generated_text": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cellular processes across eukaryotes. This review explores the current understanding of SWI/SNF ATPases and their impact on nucleosome positioning, chromatin structure, and transcriptional regulation. We discuss the mechanisms by which these complexes interact with and remodel nucleosomes, facilitating access for transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. The diverse subunit compositions of SWI/SNF complexes and their tissue-specific functions are examined, highlighting their importance in development and cellular differentiation. Additionally, we address the role of SWI/SNF remodelers in mediating cellular responses to various stimuli, including environmental stress and signaling pathways. Recent advances in structural biology and genomic approaches have provided new insights into the molecular details of SWI/SNF activity and their genome-wide binding patterns. We also consider the implications of SWI/SNF dysfunction in human diseases, particularly in cancer, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these complexes. This comprehensive review underscores the fundamental importance of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers in maintaining genomic plasticity and cellular homeostasis.", "label": 1}
