{"grounding": "My scholarly career has centered around articulating and testing a model of legitimacy-based law and governance. In recent decades, that model has achieved considerable success in shaping the way legal authority is understood and exercised. At the same time the legitimacy of legal, political, and social institutions and authorities has declined, raising questions about the future viability of a legitimacy-based model. In this review, I discuss the ascension and potential decline of legitimacy-based governance and outline alternative models of authority that may emerge in the twenty-first century. Three issues are addressed: whether there are ways to reinvigorate legitimacy-based law and governance; whether social norms, moral values, or ideologies are viable alternative forms of authority; and whether it is better to accept that no single form of authority works best in all situations and theories should focus on identifying the contingencies under which different forms of authority are most desirable.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the evolving concept of legitimacy in legal authority within the context of the twenty-first century. Drawing on autobiographical experiences and contemporary research, we examine the interplay between legitimacy, trust, and confidence in legal institutions. The study investigates how normative alignment between citizens and legal authorities influences compliance, cooperation, and engagement with the law. We argue that traditional notions of legitimacy are being challenged by rapid societal changes, technological advancements, and shifting public expectations. Our findings suggest that fostering legitimacy in the modern era requires a nuanced approach that addresses both procedural justice and outcome-based evaluations. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for enhancing legitimacy in legal systems, emphasizing the importance of transparency, accountability, and responsive governance in maintaining public trust and ensuring the effectiveness of legal institutions in an increasingly complex world.", "label": 0}
