{"grounding": "In this review, we explore the impact of technology on US and UK law firms, focusing in particular on the recent machine learning wave of artificial intelligence. Technology has not so far ushered the end of law firms as we know them. Adoption of artificial intelligence/machine learning is in its early stages in the sector, and its impact has been constrained by the scope of use cases for which it is so far well-suited. Technology is nevertheless transforming law firms, in the sense of leading to material changes to their current forms, in the following novel ways: (a) deployment not only in the back office but in the front office, affecting lawyers\u2019 core tasks of advising clients; (b) opportunities for lawyers to pursue alternative career paths with different skill sets across the profession; and (c) emerging options for law firms to adopt business models creating value from nonhuman capital and nonlegal human capital.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), on law firms and the legal profession. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent literature and case studies, we investigate the extent to which technological advancements are transforming legal practices. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where technology adoption varies significantly across firms, practice areas, and jurisdictions. While AI and other technologies have streamlined certain legal tasks, such as document review and contract analysis, their integration into core legal work remains limited. The concept of organizational complementarity emerges as a crucial factor in successful technology implementation, highlighting the need for firms to adapt their structures and processes alongside technological adoption. This research contributes to the ongoing debate about the future of the legal profession and provides insights for law firms seeking to navigate the evolving technological landscape.", "label": 1}
