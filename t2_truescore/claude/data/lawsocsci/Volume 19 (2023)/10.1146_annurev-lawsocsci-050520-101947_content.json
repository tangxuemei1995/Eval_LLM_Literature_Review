{"grounding": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many complexities involved in using data and advanced technologies to help resolve public health emergencies. These complexities highlight the need to embrace a broader framework of data governance with three foundational questions: (a) who decides about data flows, (b) on what basis, and (c) with what accountability and oversight. These questions can accommodate the issues that have arisen in the literature regarding new types of data harms. However, these questions also foreground important issues of power, authority, and legitimacy. Data governance can provide an organizing normative framework to address emerging data themes including access to data, collective decision making, data intermediaries, data sovereignty, design and digital infrastructure, regulatory technologies, the rule of law, and social trust and license. The pandemic experience with contact tracing apps, in particular, showed the many unresolved governance challenges.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted critical gaps in data governance frameworks worldwide, particularly in the context of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for public health interventions. This paper examines the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid deployment of AI-driven technologies, such as contact tracing apps, during the global health crisis. We analyze the tension between data-driven decision-making and individual privacy concerns, emphasizing the importance of trust and transparency in public health initiatives. The study explores the concept of 'privacy by design' as a potential solution to address data governance shortcomings. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust, adaptable data governance structures that can effectively balance public health imperatives with personal privacy protections in an increasingly data-centric world. We propose recommendations for policymakers and technologists to bridge the data governance gap and enhance preparedness for future pandemics.", "label": 1}
