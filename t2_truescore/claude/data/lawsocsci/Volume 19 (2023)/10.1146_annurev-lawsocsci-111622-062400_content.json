{"grounding": "This review examines the historical and contemporary factors driving immigrant worker precarity and the central role of race in achieving worker justice. We build from the framework of racial capitalism and historicize the legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession, which have cemented an exclusionary economic system in the United States and globally. We consider how racism and colonial legacies create migrant displacement and shape the experiences of immigrant workers. We also detail how racism permeates the immigration bureaucracy, driving migrant worker precarity. The traditional labor movement has played an important role in closing this gap, but increasingly so have worker centers and the immigrant rights movement as a whole. These partnerships have had to navigate coalitional tensions as they build new strategies for realizing immigrant worker rights.", "generated_text": "This study examines the critical role of race in shaping the experiences of low-wage immigrant workers in the United States. By centering race in our analysis, we illuminate the intersections of racial discrimination, immigration status, and labor exploitation. Drawing on qualitative interviews and ethnographic observations, we explore how racialized perceptions and structural racism impact immigrants' access to employment, working conditions, and ability to assert their rights. Our findings reveal that racial hierarchies within immigrant communities and broader society significantly influence labor market outcomes and workplace dynamics. We argue that addressing racial injustice is crucial for improving the lives of low-wage immigrant workers and achieving equitable labor practices. This research contributes to ongoing discussions on immigration, labor rights, and racial justice, offering insights for policymakers and advocates working towards a more inclusive and fair labor market.", "label": 1}
