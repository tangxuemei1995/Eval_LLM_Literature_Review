{"grounding": "This review addresses three questions surrounding authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China. First, what is legality, and does it exist in China's Leninist single-party state? Scholars who characterize the system as order maintenance find the absence of legality. Those employing dual-state and instrumentalist views of law find partial legality. Scholars promoting the notion of bare legality find complete legality. Second, does authoritarian legality strengthen regime legitimacy? Scholars agree that the state seeks legitimation through its embrace of authoritarian legality. Empirical research tests this claim. Third, is China in transition from plan to market, and what is the role of law in state capitalism? The teleology of the transition paradigm overlooks illiberal underpinnings of property rights and factor markets. Answers to these questions help explain regime resilience, economic growth, economic crisis, and inequality in China. Both the institution of the dual state and the perpetuation of plan elements reinforce state power.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationship between authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China, focusing on the interplay between the rule of law, property rights, and market dynamics. Drawing on the concept of the dual state, we analyze how China's legal system simultaneously supports and constrains economic development. Our research investigates the role of land and labor markets in shaping China's unique form of state capitalism. We argue that while China has made significant strides in establishing a legal framework to support market-oriented reforms, the state retains considerable control over key economic resources and institutions. This tension between legal predictability and state intervention creates a distinctive model of authoritarian legality that underpins China's economic success. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the compatibility of authoritarian governance with market-driven economic growth and offer insights into the future trajectory of China's political economy.", "label": 1}
