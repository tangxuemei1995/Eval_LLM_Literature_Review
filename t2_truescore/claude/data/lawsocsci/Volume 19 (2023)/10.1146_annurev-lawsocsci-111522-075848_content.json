{"grounding": "A significant body of social science research is now working with the concept of refeudalization\u2014as well as related terms such as neo-feudalism and neo-medievalism\u2014to analyze a variety of contemporary developments. The social science scholars who use these terms challenge an oversimplified modernization model that regards power relations such as serfdom, vassalage, suzerainty, and fiefdom as merely historical relics. The refeudalization process has significant legal dimensions, which this review outlines to draw out the central implications of the concept of refeudalization for an adequate understanding of current developments in law, society, and politics. Topics covered include the changing relationship between public and private law; the privatization of public authority and responsibilities; the territorial unbundling of sovereignty and the tendency toward multiple, overlapping authorities and jurisdictions; the contractualization of groups and political units as well as individuals; and the changing relationship between sovereignty and political representation.", "generated_text": "This article explores the concept of refeudalization in the context of contemporary legal systems, examining the shift from the rule of law to ties of allegiance. Drawing on theories of sovereignty, democracy, and representation, the study investigates how the increasing contractualization of legal relationships mirrors feudal structures. The research analyzes the erosion of traditional democratic institutions and the rise of private power centers that challenge state authority. By examining case studies and legal precedents, the article demonstrates how refeudalization manifests in various aspects of modern governance, including corporate influence on legislation and the privatization of public services. The findings suggest that this trend threatens the foundations of democratic societies and the principle of equality before the law. The article concludes by proposing potential strategies to counteract refeudalization and reinforce the rule of law in contemporary legal systems.", "label": 0}
