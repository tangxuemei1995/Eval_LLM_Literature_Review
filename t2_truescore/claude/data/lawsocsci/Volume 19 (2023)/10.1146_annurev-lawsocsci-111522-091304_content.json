{"grounding": "International agreements on Intellectual Property (IP) have proven to be a good example to study global lawmaking. Beginning by looking at the 1990s Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and into the negotiation and implementation of regional and national trade agreements, this article reflects on the intricate relationship between international IP agreements and public health. The comprehensive analysis of these international rules and their effect provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping health policies. Building upon the IP case, we categorize existing scholarship on global lawmaking into three methodological approaches: (a) methodological internationalism, (b) methodological nationalism, and (c) the interplay between domestic and international factors. We close with a call for researchers to advocate and integrate into their methods a co-constitutive approach that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements.", "generated_text": "This article examines the methodological challenges in studying global lawmaking, focusing on the intersection of intellectual property rights and international health emergencies. Drawing on case studies from recent global health crises, we analyze the complex interplay between national and international legal frameworks. Our research highlights the limitations of methodological nationalism in understanding the dynamics of global law formation. We argue that a more nuanced approach is necessary to capture the multifaceted nature of international agreements and their impact on global health governance. The study reveals the importance of considering diverse stakeholders, power dynamics, and institutional structures in shaping global lawmaking processes. Our findings contribute to the development of more effective methodological tools for analyzing the creation and implementation of global legal norms, particularly in the context of intellectual property rights and public health emergencies.", "label": 1}
