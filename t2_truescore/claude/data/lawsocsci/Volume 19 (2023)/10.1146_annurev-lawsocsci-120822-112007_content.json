{"grounding": "This article offers a comprehensive overview of the academic literature concerning mandatory employment arbitration and existing empirical evidence. Proponents of mandatory employment arbitration contend mandatory arbitration provides access to justice to those excluded from the traditional civil litigation system. Conversely, opponents of mandatory employment arbitration assert that it is a coercive system that disproportionately benefits employers and disadvantages employees. Although these entrenched perceptions of mandatory employment arbitration are not new, an expanding body of recent empirical research provides fresh insights. The empirical literature reveals lower employee success rates and financial awards, longer case resolution times, and evidence of a repeat player effect in arbitration relative to civil litigation and, as a whole, tends to support arguments made by opponents of the forum. This article reviews the literature on the major debates surrounding employment arbitration and corresponding empirical evidence.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of mandatory employment arbitration on access to justice and dispute resolution in the workplace. Drawing on extensive legal and empirical research, we analyze the prevalence, effectiveness, and fairness of arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Our findings reveal significant disparities in outcomes between arbitration and litigation, with employees generally faring worse in arbitration proceedings. We also explore the implications of mandatory arbitration on employees' rights, particularly in cases involving discrimination and harassment. The research highlights concerns about the power imbalance between employers and employees in arbitration settings, as well as potential limitations on class actions. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing debate surrounding employment law reform and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, offering insights for policymakers, legal practitioners, and human resource professionals.", "label": 1}
