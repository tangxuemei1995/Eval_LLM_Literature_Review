{"grounding": "Feminists have long demonstrated the invisibility of women's reproductive labor, performed in bearing and raising children, maintaining households, and socially sustaining male labor. Every wave of feminist struggle from the late nineteenth century onward has actively queried the inequalities that characterize women's performance of such work, variously referred to as unpaid domestic and care work, domestic labor, or care work. Robust traditions of scholarship on women's unpaid work animate various disciplines, often spilling into political struggles for adequate recognition of this work. As the pandemic has rendered visible once again the reproductive labor of women the world over, this article offers an overview of social reproduction theory, feminist legal theorizations of reproductive labor, and how we might recuperate a rich tradition of theorizing on social reproduction to develop a materialist approach to law's regulation of reproductive labor across the marriage-market spectrum with a view to social and economic justice.", "generated_text": "This article examines the concept of social reproduction through the lens of legal realism and materialist feminism, exploring how laws shape and perpetuate unpaid domestic work and care. Drawing on law and political economy frameworks, it analyzes the legal structures that govern social reproduction, including labor laws, family policies, and welfare systems. The study highlights the often-invisible role of unpaid work in sustaining economic systems and social order. By investigating the legal mechanisms that reinforce gendered divisions of labor and undervalue care work, the article reveals the interconnections between law, economics, and social reproduction. It argues that recognizing and valuing social reproduction in legal frameworks is crucial for addressing gender inequalities and creating more equitable societies. The findings contribute to ongoing debates about the nature of work, care, and social justice in contemporary legal and economic systems.", "label": 0}
