{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a salient but polarizing issue of recent times. Actors around the world are engaged in building a governance regime around it. What exactly the \u201cit\u201d is that is being governed, how, by who, and why\u2014these are all less clear. In this review, we attempt to shine some light on those questions, considering literature on AI, the governance of computing, and regulation and governance more broadly. We take critical stock of the different modalities of the global governance of AI that have been emerging, such as ethical councils, industry governance, contracts and licensing, standards, international agreements, and domestic legislation with extraterritorial impact. Considering these, we examine selected rationales and tensions that underpin them, drawing attention to the interests and ideas driving these different modalities. As these regimes become clearer and more stable, we urge those engaging with or studying the global governance of AI to constantly ask the important question of all global governance regimes: Who benefits?", "generated_text": "This paper examines the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and global governance, exploring the modalities, rationales, and tensions that arise in this rapidly evolving field. As AI technologies become increasingly prevalent in various sectors, their impact on global governance structures and processes demands critical analysis. The study investigates the current landscape of AI regulation, focusing on algorithmic governance and machine learning applications in international decision-making. It identifies key rationales for global AI governance, including ethical considerations, cross-border data flows, and the need for standardized regulatory frameworks. The research also highlights tensions between national sovereignty, technological innovation, and global cooperation in AI governance. By synthesizing existing literature and analyzing emerging trends, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on how to effectively govern AI on a global scale while balancing competing interests and addressing potential risks and benefits.", "label": 1}
