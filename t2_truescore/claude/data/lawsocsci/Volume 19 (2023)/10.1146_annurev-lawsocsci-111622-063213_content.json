{"grounding": "To address issues of bias and discrimination in many areas of social life, scientists have developed a variety of strategies to debias people's minds and reduce discrimination and the disparities that stem from it. A large body of research has documented, however, that debias trainings have short-lived effects on changing patterns of thinking (i.e., they last less than 24 hours) and minimal effects on behaviors. In this article, I argue that such limited effects of one-time trainings are to be expected, given the segregated and stratified social structure we live in that was created by historic and contemporary laws and policies. After explaining the mechanisms through which laws and policies create biased people, I then explain how laws and policies can instead be used as levers to create long-lasting changes in biases.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the potential of laws and policies as tools for debiasing social cognition and improving intergroup relations. Drawing on research from social psychology, cognitive science, and legal studies, we examine how legislative and policy interventions can shape implicit biases, reduce segregation, and foster more equitable social environments. We review evidence on the effectiveness of various approaches, including affirmative action policies, integration initiatives, and anti-discrimination laws. Our analysis suggests that well-designed legal frameworks can serve as powerful social interventions, influencing cognitive processes and behavioral patterns at both individual and societal levels. However, we also highlight the complexities and potential unintended consequences of such interventions. This interdisciplinary perspective offers insights for policymakers and researchers seeking to leverage legal mechanisms to cultivate more equal minds and promote positive intergroup dynamics in diverse societies.", "label": 1}
