{"grounding": "Medical aid in dying (MAID) has been a productive target for social scientific inquiry at the intersections of law and medicine over the past two decades. Insofar as MAID crystallizes and reflects personal and cultural understandings of key concepts such as individualism, dependency, dignity, and care, it is a rich site for social scientific theorizing. This article reviews and assesses the contributions of social scientific perspectives to research on MAID. We propose that social scientific research on MAID offers four distinctive contributions: its descriptive (rather than normative) orientation, its focus on cultural meanings, its insights into processes of knowledge production, and its comparative lens. The article's major sections describe (a) attitudes toward MAID, (b) MAID-related social movements, (c) legalization approaches, and (d) lived experiences of MAID in permissive jurisdictions. We conclude by reflecting on how MAID scholarship can inform social inquiry into other areas in which law and medicine converge.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the evolving landscape of medical aid in dying (MAID), examining its intersection with medicine, law, and culture. As assisted suicide and euthanasia gain traction in various jurisdictions, the right-to-die movement continues to challenge traditional notions of death and dying. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and case studies, we analyze the ethical, legal, and social implications of MAID. The study highlights the complex interplay between medical advancements, changing societal attitudes, and legal frameworks. We investigate the role of social movements in shaping public discourse and policy decisions surrounding end-of-life choices. Our findings reveal a growing acceptance of MAID, while also uncovering persistent concerns regarding safeguards, vulnerable populations, and the potential impact on the medical profession. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on end-of-life care and individual autonomy in the face of terminal illness.", "label": 1}
