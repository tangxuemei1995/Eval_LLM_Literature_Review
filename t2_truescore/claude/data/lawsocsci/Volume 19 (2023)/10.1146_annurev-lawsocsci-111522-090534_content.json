{"grounding": "Research on vaccines in the law and social sciences skews heavily toward an instrumentalist approach to knowledge in service of vaccine promotion. Overcoming hesitancy and promoting vaccine acceptance have been major goals, but successful levers for behavioral change remain elusive. Research with constructivist approaches to vaccines from feminist sociology and anthropology has uncovered ethnographic richness to describe how vaccine debates illuminate inequalities in parenting and re-entrench patterns of racism and colonialism. There is considerable potential in science and technology studies approaches that take seriously the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics, though there are considerable methodological challenges for these research designs. This review charts the lopsided bibliography of law and social science research on vaccines, asking why scholars rarely move away from instrumentalist conceptions of law in the service of public health and, when they do, explaining what theoretical tools enable it.", "generated_text": "This article explores the intersection of vaccines, public health, and sociolegal studies through an interdisciplinary lens. Drawing on ethnographic research and science and technology studies, it examines how vaccines are conceptualized beyond their traditional role as legal tools for public health. The study investigates the complex social, cultural, and political dynamics that shape vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and policy implementation. By analyzing diverse stakeholder perspectives, including healthcare providers, policymakers, and community members, the research reveals the multifaceted nature of vaccine discourse and its implications for public health strategies. The findings highlight the importance of considering broader societal factors in vaccine-related decision-making and policy development. This interdisciplinary approach offers valuable insights for enhancing vaccine communication, addressing hesitancy, and developing more effective public health interventions that account for the diverse sociolegal contexts in which vaccines operate.", "label": 0}
