{"grounding": "Recent technological advances allow for the collection of massive data in the study of complex phenomena over time and/or space in various fields. Many of these data involve sequences of high-dimensional or non-Euclidean measurements, where change-point analysis is a crucial early step in understanding the data. Segmentation, or offline change-point analysis, divides data into homogeneous temporal or spatial segments, making subsequent analysis easier; its online counterpart detects changes in sequentially observed data, allowing for real-time anomaly detection. This article reviews a nonparametric change-point analysis framework that utilizes graphs representing the similarity between observations. This framework can be applied to data as long as a reasonable dissimilarity distance among the observations can be defined. Thus, this framework can be applied to a wide range of applications, from high-dimensional data to non-Euclidean data, such as imaging data or network data. In addition, analytic formulas can be derived to control the false discoveries, making them easy off-the-shelf data analysis tools.", "generated_text": "This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach for change-point analysis in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data settings. We propose a nonparametric method that leverages graph-based tests and scan statistics to detect structural changes in complex data structures, including network data. Our approach is particularly effective in scenarios where traditional parametric methods fail due to the non-Euclidean nature of the data or high dimensionality. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the tail probability of the proposed test statistic, providing rigorous guarantees for its performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and power of our method across various data types and change-point scenarios. Additionally, we apply our technique to real-world network data, showcasing its practical utility in detecting significant structural shifts. This work contributes to the growing field of nonparametric change-point detection, offering a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data structures.", "label": 1}
