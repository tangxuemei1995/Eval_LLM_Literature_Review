{"grounding": "The Cox model is now 50 years old. The seminal paper of Sir David Cox has had an immeasurable impact on the analysis of censored survival data, with applications in many different disciplines. This work has also stimulated much additional research in diverse areas and led to important theoretical and practical advances. These include semiparametric models, nonparametric efficiency, and partial likelihood. In addition to quickly becoming the go-to method for estimating covariate effects, Cox regression has been extended to a vast number of complex data structures, to all of which the central idea of sampling from the set of individuals at risk at time t can be applied. In this article, we review the Cox paper and the evolution of the ideas surrounding it. We then highlight its extensions to competing risks, with attention to models based on cause-specific hazards, and to hazards associated with the subdistribution or cumulative incidence function. We discuss their relative merits and domains of application. The analysis of recurrent events is another major topic of discussion, including an introduction to martingales and complete intensity models as well as the more practical marginal rate models. We include several worked examples to illustrate the main ideas.", "generated_text": "The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced by Sir David Cox in 1972, has profoundly impacted survival analysis and biostatistics over the past five decades. This review examines the model's evolution, applications, and extensions since its inception. We explore key developments, including the incorporation of time-dependent covariates, competing risks analysis, and recurrent event modeling. The paper discusses the model's theoretical underpinnings, focusing on partial likelihood estimation and the assumption of independent censoring. We highlight the Cox model's versatility in handling complex survival data and its adaptation to various research contexts. The review also addresses challenges and limitations, such as the proportional hazards assumption and the interpretation of results in the presence of competing risks. Furthermore, we examine the model's integration with modern statistical techniques and its role in the era of big data and precision medicine. This comprehensive overview underscores the Cox model's enduring significance and its continued relevance in contemporary biomedical research and beyond.", "label": 1}
