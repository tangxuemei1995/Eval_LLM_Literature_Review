{"grounding": "Over the past few years, interest has increased in models defined on positive and negative integers. Several application areas lead to data that are differences between positive integers. Some important examples are price changes measured discretely in financial applications, pre- and posttreatment measurements of discrete outcomes in clinical trials, the difference in the number of goals in sports events, and differencing of count-valued time series. This review aims at bringing together a wide range of models that have appeared in the literature in recent decades. We provide an extensive review on discrete distributions defined for integer data and then consider univariate and multivariate time-series models, including the class of autoregressive models, stochastic processes, and ARCH-GARCH\u2013 (autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic\u2013generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic\u2013) type models.", "generated_text": "This paper explores models for integer-valued data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models. We review key concepts in discrete probability theory and introduce thinning operators as a fundamental tool for constructing integer-valued processes. The Skellam distribution, a discrete probability distribution of the difference between two independent Poisson random variables, is examined in detail. We discuss its properties, parameter estimation, and applications in various fields. Furthermore, we present several time-series models specifically designed for integer-valued data, including integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) and integer-valued moving average (INMA) models. The paper concludes by highlighting recent developments in the field and suggesting potential areas for future research in modeling integer-valued phenomena.", "label": 1}
