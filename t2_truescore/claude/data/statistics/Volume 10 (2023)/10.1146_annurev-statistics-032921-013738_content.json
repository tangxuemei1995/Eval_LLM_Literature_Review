{"grounding": "We expose the statistical foundations of deep learning with the goal of facilitating conversation between the deep learning and statistics communities. We highlight core themes at the intersection; summarize key neural models, such as feedforward neural networks, sequential neural networks, and neural latent variable models; and link these ideas to their roots in probability and statistics. We also highlight research directions in deep learning where there are opportunities for statistical contributions.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a concise overview of deep learning from a statistical standpoint. We explore the fundamental concepts of neural networks and their applications in pattern recognition tasks. The discussion encompasses key optimization techniques employed in training deep learning models. By examining the statistical underpinnings of these methods, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional statistical approaches and modern deep learning paradigms.", "label": 1}
