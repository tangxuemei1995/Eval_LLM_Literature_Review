{"grounding": "For real-valued parameters, significance tests can be motivated as three-decision methods, in which we either assert the sign of the parameter above or below a specified null value, or say nothing either way. Tukey viewed this as a \u201csensible formulation\u201d of tests, unlike the widely taught null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) system that is today's default. We review the three-decision framework, collecting the substantial literature on how other statistical tools can be usefully motivated in this way. These tools include close Bayesian analogs of frequentist power calculations, p-values, confidence intervals, and multiple testing corrections. We also show how three-decision arguments can straightforwardly resolve some well-known difficulties in the interpretation and criticism of testing results. Explicit results are shown for simple conjugate analyses, but the methods discussed apply generally to real-valued parameters.", "generated_text": "This paper introduces a novel approach to statistical inference called the Three-Decision Method, which offers a more nuanced alternative to traditional significance testing. By incorporating a third decision option of 'inconclusive' alongside the conventional 'reject' and 'fail to reject' outcomes, this method addresses longstanding criticisms of binary hypothesis testing. The approach is grounded in decision theory and provides a framework for balancing Type I and Type II errors while explicitly acknowledging uncertainty. We demonstrate how this method can be applied to various statistical scenarios, including multiple testing and sensitivity analysis. The Three-Decision Method not only enhances the interpretability of results but also aligns more closely with the realities of scientific research, where conclusive evidence may not always be attainable. This formulation represents a significant advancement in statistical methodology, offering researchers a more flexible and informative tool for drawing inferences from data.", "label": 1}
