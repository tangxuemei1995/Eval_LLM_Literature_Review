{"grounding": "In the era of precision medicine, time-to-event outcomes such as time to death or progression are routinely collected, along with high-throughput covariates. These high-dimensional data defy classical survival regression models, which are either infeasible to fit or likely to incur low predictability due to overfitting. To overcome this, recent emphasis has been placed on developing novel approaches for feature selection and survival prognostication. In this article, we review various cutting-edge methods that handle survival outcome data with high-dimensional predictors, highlighting recent innovations in machine learning approaches for survival prediction. We cover the statistical intuitions and principles behind these methods and conclude with extensions to more complex settings, where competing events are observed. We exemplify these methods with applications to the Boston Lung Cancer Survival Cohort study, one of the largest cancer epidemiology cohorts investigating the complex mechanisms of lung cancer.", "generated_text": "High-dimensional survival analysis has emerged as a crucial tool in precision medicine and data science, addressing the challenges of analyzing complex, large-scale datasets with time-to-event outcomes. This review explores cutting-edge methodologies and applications in this rapidly evolving field. We discuss advanced feature screening techniques for identifying relevant predictors in high-dimensional settings, as well as machine learning approaches, including artificial neural networks, for improved prediction accuracy. The integration of statistical inference methods with these novel techniques is examined, highlighting the importance of interpretability and uncertainty quantification. We showcase applications in various domains, such as cancer genomics and clinical trials, demonstrating the potential of high-dimensional survival analysis to enhance personalized treatment strategies and risk prediction. Finally, we outline future research directions and challenges in this interdisciplinary field.", "label": 1}
