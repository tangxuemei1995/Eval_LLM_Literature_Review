{"grounding": "Several major global challenges, including climate change and water scarcity, warrant a scientific approach to generating solutions. Developing high quality and robust capacity in (bio)statistics is key to ensuring sound scientific solutions to these challenges, so collaboration between academic and research institutes should be high on university agendas. To strengthen capacity in the developing world, South\u2013North partnerships should be a priority. The ideas and examples of statistical capacity-building presented in this article are the result of several monthly online discussions between a mixedgroup of authors having international experience and formal links with Hasselt University in Belgium. The discussion focuses on statistical capacity-building through education (teaching), research, and societal impact. We have adopted an example-based approach, and in view of the background of the authors, the examples refer mainly to biostatistical capacity-building. Although many universities worldwide have already initiated university collaborations for development, we hope and believe that our ideas and concrete examples can serve as inspiration to further strengthen South\u2013North partnerships on statistical capacity-building.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the critical need for sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa, with a focus on biostatistics. Despite the growing demand for statistical expertise in health-related research, many African countries face significant challenges in developing and retaining skilled biostatisticians. We analyze the current state of biostatistical education and training in Africa, identifying key barriers such as limited resources, brain drain, and inadequate infrastructure. The study proposes a comprehensive framework for sustainable capacity-building, emphasizing the importance of South-North collaborations, investment in human capital, and the establishment of robust consulting services. We argue that a multifaceted approach, combining education, research opportunities, and practical experience, is essential for creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of biostatistical expertise in Africa. By addressing these challenges, African nations can enhance their ability to conduct high-quality health research, inform evidence-based policies, and ultimately improve public health outcomes across the continent.", "label": 0}
