{"grounding": "Clustering is the task of automatically gathering observations into homogeneous groups, where the number of groups is unknown. Through its basis in a statistical modeling framework, model-based clustering provides a principled and reproducible approach to clustering. In contrast to heuristic approaches, model-based clustering allows for robust approaches to parameter estimation and objective inference on the number of clusters, while providing a clustering solution that accounts for uncertainty in cluster membership. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the theory underpinning model-based clustering, to outline associated inferential approaches, and to highlight recent methodological developments that facilitate the use of model-based clustering for a broad array of data types. Since its emergence six decades ago, the literature on model-based clustering has grown rapidly, and as such, this review provides only a selection of the bibliography in this dynamic and impactful field.", "generated_text": "Model-based clustering is a powerful statistical approach for identifying underlying structures in complex datasets. This method employs mixture models to represent heterogeneous populations, utilizing the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. By incorporating probabilistic frameworks, model-based clustering offers advantages over traditional clustering techniques, including the ability to handle uncertainty and determine the optimal number of clusters. Bayesian inference further enhances the approach by allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and providing a natural framework for model selection. Recent advancements in software implementations have made model-based clustering more accessible to researchers across various disciplines. This paper reviews the theoretical foundations of model-based clustering, discusses its applications in diverse fields, and explores current challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving area of statistical learning.", "label": 1}
