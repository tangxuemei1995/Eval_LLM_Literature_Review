{"grounding": "This article reviews recent progress in high-dimensional bootstrap. We first review high-dimensional central limit theorems for distributions of sample mean vectors over the rectangles, bootstrap consistency results in high dimensions, and key techniques used to establish those results. We then review selected applications of high-dimensional bootstrap: construction of simultaneous confidence sets for high-dimensional vector parameters, multiple hypothesis testing via step-down, postselection inference, intersection bounds for partially identified parameters, and inference on best policies in policy evaluation. Finally, we also comment on a couple of future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study explores bootstrap methods for high-dimensional data analysis, focusing on empirical and multiplier bootstrap techniques. We investigate their applications in multiple testing scenarios and simultaneous inference. The research examines the theoretical foundations of high-dimensional central limit theorems and their implications for bootstrap validity. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in addressing challenges associated with high-dimensional data, particularly in controlling family-wise error rates and constructing confidence regions. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on robust statistical inference in high-dimensional settings, offering insights for practitioners dealing with complex datasets.", "label": 1}
