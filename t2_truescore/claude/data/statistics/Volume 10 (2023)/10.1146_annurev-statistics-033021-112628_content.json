{"grounding": "Deep neural network models have become ubiquitous in recent years and have been applied to nearly all areas of science, engineering, and industry. These models are particularly useful for data that have strong dependencies in space (e.g., images) and time (e.g., sequences). Indeed, deep models have also been extensively used by the statistical community to model spatial and spatiotemporal data through, for example, the use of multilevel Bayesian hierarchical models and deep Gaussian processes. In this review, we first present an overview of traditional statistical and machine learning perspectives for modeling spatial and spatiotemporal data, and then focus on a variety of hybrid models that have recently been developed for latent process, data, and parameter specifications. These hybrid models integrate statistical modeling ideas with deep neural network models in order to take advantage of the strengths of each modeling paradigm. We conclude by giving an overview of computational technologies that have proven useful for these hybrid models, and with a brief discussion on future research directions.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the integration of statistical methods with deep learning techniques for analyzing spatial and spatiotemporal data. We present a comprehensive framework that combines Bayesian hierarchical models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep Gaussian processes, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and reinforcement learning to address complex spatial and temporal dependencies. Our approach leverages the strengths of both statistical and deep learning paradigms, enabling more accurate predictions and insights from diverse datasets. We introduce novel warping techniques to handle non-stationary spatial processes and demonstrate their effectiveness in improving model performance. The proposed methodology is evaluated on various real-world applications, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, and climate modeling. Results show significant improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. This research contributes to the growing field of statistical deep learning and provides valuable tools for researchers and practitioners working with spatial and spatiotemporal data across multiple domains.", "label": 0}
