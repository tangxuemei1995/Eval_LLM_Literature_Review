{"grounding": "Rich data generating mechanisms are ubiquitous in this age of information and require complex statistical models to draw meaningful inference. While Bayesian analysis has seen enormous development in the last 30 years, benefitting from the impetus given by the successful application of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, the combination of big data and complex models conspire to produce significant challenges for the traditional MCMC algorithms. We review modern algorithmic developments addressing the latter and compare their performance using numerical experiments.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews recent advancements in approximate methods for Bayesian computation, focusing on techniques that address computational challenges in large-scale inference. We examine Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), Bayesian synthetic likelihood, coresets, divide-and-conquer strategies, and subsampling approaches within Markov chain Monte Carlo frameworks. These methods offer scalable solutions for complex probabilistic models and big data scenarios, balancing computational efficiency with inferential accuracy. We discuss their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and comparative advantages, providing insights into their applicability across various domains in statistical inference and machine learning.", "label": 1}
