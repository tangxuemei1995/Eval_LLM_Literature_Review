{"grounding": "Dependent survival data arise in many contexts. One context is clustered survival data, where survival data are collected on clusters such as families or medical centers. Dependent survival data also arise when multiple survival times are recorded for each individual. Frailty models are one common approach to handle such data. In frailty models, the dependence is expressed in terms of a random effect, called the frailty. Frailty models have been used with both the Cox proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time model. This article reviews recent developments in the area of frailty models in a variety of settings. In each setting we provide a detailed model description, assumptions, available estimation methods, and R packages.", "generated_text": "This review examines recent advancements in shared frailty methods for analyzing complex survival data. We explore applications in various scenarios, including clustered data, competing events, and recurrent events. The paper discusses extensions to traditional models such as Cox regression and accelerated failure time models, incorporating shared frailty components to account for within-cluster correlations. We also investigate novel approaches like regression trees and random survival forests adapted for frailty modeling. The review highlights the benefits of these methods in capturing heterogeneity and improving prediction accuracy in survival analysis. Furthermore, we address computational challenges and available software implementations. This comprehensive overview provides researchers with valuable insights into the current state of shared frailty methods and their potential for handling intricate survival data structures.", "label": 1}
