{"grounding": "I consider the development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, from late-1980s Gibbs sampling to present-day gradient-based methods and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes. In parallel, I show how these ideas have been implemented in successive generations of statistical software for Bayesian inference. These software packages have been instrumental in popularizing applied Bayesian modeling across a wide variety of scientific domains. They provide an invaluable service to applied statisticians in hiding the complexities of MCMC from the user while providing a convenient modeling language and tools to summarize the output from a Bayesian model. As research into new MCMC methods remains very active, it is likely that future generations of software will incorporate new methods to improve the user experience.", "generated_text": "This paper presents an overview of simulation-based Bayesian analysis techniques, focusing on recent advancements in computational methods and software tools. We explore the evolution of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including Gibbs sampling and its variants, and discuss their applications in complex graphical models. The study examines the emergence of newer approaches such as Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) and Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs). We compare popular software packages like BUGS, JAGS, and Stan, highlighting their strengths and limitations in various Bayesian inference scenarios. The paper also addresses the challenges of scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional problems, proposing potential directions for future research in simulation-based Bayesian computation.", "label": 1}
