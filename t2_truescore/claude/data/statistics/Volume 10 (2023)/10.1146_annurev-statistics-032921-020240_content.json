{"grounding": "Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation are closely related tasks, with the former concerning in-sample goodness (or lack) of fit and the latter addressing predictive performance out-of-sample. We review the ubiquitous setting in which forecasts are cast in the form of quantiles or quantile-bounded prediction intervals. We distinguish unconditional calibration, which corresponds to classical coverage criteria, from the stronger notion of conditional calibration, as can be visualized in quantile reliability diagrams. Consistent scoring functions\u2014including, but not limited to, the widely used asymmetricpiecewise linear score or pinball loss\u2014provide for comparative assessment and ranking, and link to the coefficient of determination and skill scores. We illustrate the use of these tools on Engel's food expenditure data, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating and diagnosing quantile regression models, with a focus on forecast performance. We introduce novel diagnostic tools, including calibration tests, coverage plots, and reliability diagrams specifically adapted for quantile forecasts. The study also explores the use of Murphy diagrams to assess the comparative performance of different quantile models. We develop a set of tailored scoring functions that capture the unique characteristics of quantile predictions. Through extensive simulations and real-world case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these diagnostic techniques in identifying model misspecification, assessing forecast reliability, and guiding model selection. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers working with quantile regression models across various fields, including economics, finance, and environmental sciences.", "label": 1}
