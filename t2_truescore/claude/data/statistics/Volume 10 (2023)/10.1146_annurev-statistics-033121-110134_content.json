{"grounding": "By linking conceptual theories with observed data, generative models can support reasoning in complex situations. They have come to play a central role both within and beyond statistics, providing the basis for power analysis in molecular biology, theory building in particle physics, and resource allocation in epidemiology, for example. We introduce the probabilistic and computational concepts underlying modern generative models and then analyze how they can be used to inform experimental design, iterative model refinement, goodness-of-fit evaluation, and agent based simulation. We emphasize a modular view of generative mechanisms and discuss how they can be flexibly recombined in new problem contexts. We provide practical illustrations throughout, and code for reproducing all examples is available at \nhttps://github.com/krisrs1128/generative_review\n. Finally, we observe how research in generative models is currently split across several islands of activity, and we highlight opportunities lying at disciplinary intersections.", "generated_text": "Generative models have emerged as powerful tools across diverse disciplines, offering a unified framework for simulation, decision-making, and experimental design. This review synthesizes recent advancements in generative modeling, emphasizing their applications in agent-based models and particle filtering techniques. We explore the interdisciplinary nature of these models, highlighting their role in bridging theoretical concepts with empirical observations. The paper discusses key challenges in model evaluation and goodness-of-fit assessment, proposing novel approaches to enhance the reliability and interpretability of generative models. Furthermore, we examine the integration of generative models with machine learning algorithms, showcasing their potential in improving predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. This comprehensive analysis provides researchers and practitioners with insights into the current state of generative modeling and its future directions, emphasizing its transformative impact on scientific inquiry and decision-making processes.", "label": 1}
