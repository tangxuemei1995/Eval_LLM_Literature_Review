{"grounding": "When assessing causal effects, determining the target population to which the results are intended to generalize is a critical decision. Randomized and observational studies each have strengths and limitations for estimating causal effects in a target population. Estimates from randomized data may have internal validity but are often not representative of the target population. Observational data may better reflect the target population, and hence be more likely to have external validity, but are subject to potential bias due to unmeasured confounding. While much of the causal inference literature has focused on addressing internal validity bias, both internal and external validity are necessary for unbiased estimates in a target population. This article presents a framework for addressing external validity bias, including a synthesis of approaches for generalizability and transportability, and the assumptions they require, as well as tests for the heterogeneity of treatment effects and differences between study and target populations.", "generated_text": "This review examines the concepts of generalizability and transportability in causal inference, addressing their importance in establishing external validity of research findings. We explore the theoretical foundations and methodological approaches for assessing and enhancing the generalizability of treatment effects across diverse populations and settings. The paper discusses the challenges posed by treatment effect heterogeneity and the role of covariate distributions in transportability analysis. We review recent advancements in statistical methods for generalizing causal effects, including techniques for integrating data from multiple sources and leveraging domain expertise. Additionally, we consider the implications of generalizability and transportability for policy decisions and evidence-based practice. The review concludes by identifying key research gaps and future directions for improving the external validity of causal estimates in various fields, including epidemiology, economics, and social sciences.", "label": 1}
