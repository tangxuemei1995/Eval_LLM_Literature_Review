{"grounding": "Exoplanets can be detected with various observational techniques. Among them, radial velocity (RV) has the key advantages of revealing the architecture of planetary systems and measuring planetary mass and orbital eccentricities. RV observations are poised to play a key role in the detection and characterization of Earth twins. However, the detection of such small planets is not yet possible due to very complex, temporally correlated instrumental and astrophysical stochastic signals. Furthermore, exploring the large parameter space of RV models exhaustively and efficiently presents difficulties. In this review, we frame RV data analysis as a problem of detection and parameter estimation in unevenly sampled, multivariate time series. The objective of this review is two-fold: to introduce the motivation, methodological challenges, and numerical challenges of RV data analysis to nonspecialists, and to unify the existing advanced approaches in order to identify areas for improvement.", "generated_text": "Detecting exoplanets using radial velocity measurements presents unique challenges in statistical analysis due to the complex nature of the data. This study explores advanced statistical methods for improving exoplanet detection accuracy in the presence of correlated noise, uneven sampling, and model misspecification. We develop a multivariate time series approach that accounts for these issues while incorporating model comparison techniques to evaluate competing hypotheses. Our method addresses the limitations of traditional approaches by explicitly modeling correlated noise structures and handling irregularly sampled data. We apply our framework to both simulated and real radial velocity datasets, demonstrating improved sensitivity and reduced false positive rates compared to existing methods. Our findings highlight the importance of robust statistical techniques in exoplanet detection and provide a foundation for future advancements in the field.", "label": 1}
