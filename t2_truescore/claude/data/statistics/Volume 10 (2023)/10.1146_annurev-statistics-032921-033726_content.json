{"grounding": "Modern studies from a variety of fields record multiple functional observations according to either multivariate, longitudinal, spatial, or time series designs. We refer to such data as second-generation functional data because their analysis\u2014unlike typical functional data analysis, which assumes independence of the functions\u2014accounts for the complex dependence between the functional observations and requires more advanced methods. In this article, we provide an overview of the techniques for analyzing second-generation functional data with a focus on highlighting the key methodological intricacies that stem from the need for modeling complex dependence, compared with independent functional data. For each of the four types of second-generation functional data presented\u2014multivariate functional data, longitudinal functional data, functional time series and spatially functional data\u2014we discuss how the widely popular functional principal component analysis can be extended to these settings to define, identify main directions of variation, and describe dependence among the functions. In addition to modeling, we also discuss prediction, statistical inference, and application to clustering. We close by discussing future directions in this area.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the emerging field of second-generation functional data, which extends traditional functional data analysis to more complex data structures. We review recent advancements in functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and its applications to spatial, longitudinal, and time series functional data. The study examines how FPCA can be adapted to handle multivariate functional data, providing a unified framework for analyzing multiple related functions simultaneously. We discuss novel methodologies for addressing the challenges posed by these complex data types, including spatial correlation, temporal dependencies, and high-dimensional relationships. The paper also highlights the importance of efficient computational algorithms and software implementations for handling large-scale second-generation functional datasets. Finally, we present several case studies demonstrating the practical applications of these methods in various scientific domains, such as environmental monitoring, neuroimaging, and financial forecasting, showcasing the potential of second-generation functional data analysis in advancing our understanding of complex systems.", "label": 1}
