{"grounding": "Surrogate markers are often used in clinical trials settings when obtaining a final outcome to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment requires a long wait, is expensive to obtain, or both. Formal definitions of surrogate marker quality resulting from a large variety of estimation approaches have been proposed over the years. I review this work, with a particular focus on approaches that use the causal inference paradigm, as these conceptualize a good marker as one in the causal pathway between the treatment and outcome. I also focus on efforts to evaluate the risk of a surrogate paradox, a damaging situation where the surrogate is positively associated with the outcome, and the causal effect of the treatment on the surrogate is in a helpful direction, but the ultimate causal effect of the treatment on the outcome is harmful. I then review some recent work in robust surrogate marker estimation and conclude with a discussion and suggestions for future research.", "generated_text": "Surrogate endpoints have become increasingly important in clinical trials, offering potential time and cost savings. This review examines the concept of surrogate markers and their application in medical research. We discuss the Prentice criteria, a fundamental framework for validating surrogate endpoints, and explore more recent developments in causal inference methodologies. The paper addresses the challenges of establishing causal associations between surrogate markers and clinical outcomes, emphasizing the importance of causal effectiveness in surrogate endpoint evaluation. We introduce the concept of principal stratification as a tool for assessing surrogacy and highlight the potential pitfalls, including the surrogate paradox. The review concludes by discussing the implications of these methodologies for clinical trial design and interpretation, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when using surrogate endpoints to guide treatment decisions and regulatory approvals.", "label": 1}
