{"grounding": "The value of research data has grown as the emphasis on research transparency and data-intensive research has increased. Data sharing is now required by funders and publishers and is becoming a disciplinary expectation in many fields. However, practices promoting data reusability and research transparency are poorly understood, making it difficult for statisticians and other researchers to reframe study methods to facilitate data sharing. This article reviews the larger landscape of open research and describes contextual information that data reusers need to understand, evaluate, and appropriately analyze shared data. The article connects data reusability to statistical thinking by considering the impact of the type and quality of shared research artifacts on the capacity to reproduce or replicate studies and examining quality evaluation frameworks to understand the nature of data errors and how they can be mitigated prior to sharing. Actions statisticians can take to update their research approaches for their own and collaborative investigations are suggested.", "generated_text": "In the era of open science, data reusability and research transparency have become paramount concerns. This paper explores the critical role of statistics in advancing these objectives. We examine how statistical methods can enhance data quality, facilitate data sharing, and promote reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. Through a comprehensive review of current practices and emerging trends, we identify key statistical approaches that support data reuse across disciplines. Our analysis reveals that robust statistical frameworks not only improve the reliability of shared data but also enable more effective integration of diverse datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how statistical techniques can be leveraged to assess and ensure the transparency of research processes. By highlighting the intersection of statistics with open science principles, this study provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and data managers seeking to maximize the impact and credibility of scientific endeavors in an increasingly data-driven world.", "label": 1}
