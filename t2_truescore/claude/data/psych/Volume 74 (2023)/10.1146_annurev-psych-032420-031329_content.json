{"grounding": "Conspiracy theories are abundant in social and political discourse, with serious consequences for individuals, groups, and societies. However, psychological scientists have started paying close attention to them only in the past 20 years. We review the spectacular progress that has since been made and some of the limitations of research so far, and we consider the prospects for further progress. To this end, we take a step back to analyze the defining features that make conspiracy theories different in kind from other beliefs and different in degree from each other. We consider how these features determine the adoption, consequences, and transmission of belief in conspiracy theories, even though their role as causal or moderating variables has seldom been examined. We therefore advocate for a research agenda in the study of conspiracy theories that starts\u2014as is routine in fields such as virology and toxicology\u2014with a robust descriptive analysis of the ontology of the entity at its center.", "generated_text": "Conspiracy theories have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, yet a clear consensus on their definition remains elusive. This paper proposes a comprehensive definitional approach to conspiracy theories, examining their key characteristics, correlates, consequences, and modes of communication. By synthesizing existing literature and empirical evidence, we identify common elements that distinguish conspiracy theories from other forms of belief. We explore psychological, social, and political factors that predict conspiracy belief, as well as the potential consequences for individuals and society. Additionally, we analyze the role of various communication channels, including social media and traditional news outlets, in the spread and reinforcement of conspiracy theories. This integrative approach aims to provide a foundation for future research and interventions addressing the complex phenomenon of conspiracy theories in contemporary discourse.", "label": 1}
