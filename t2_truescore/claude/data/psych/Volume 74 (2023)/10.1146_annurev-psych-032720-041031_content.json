{"grounding": "Objects are the core meaningful elements in our visual environment. Classic theories of object vision focus upon object recognition and are elegant and simple. Some of their proposals still stand, yet the simplicity is gone. Recent evolutions in behavioral paradigms, neuroscientific methods, and computational modeling have allowed vision scientists to uncover the complexity of the multidimensional representational space that underlies object vision. We review these findings and propose that the key to understanding this complexity is to relate object vision to the full repertoire of behavioral goals that underlie human behavior, running far beyond object recognition. There might be no such thing as core object recognition, and if it exists, then its importance is more limited than traditionally thought.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex mechanisms underlying human object vision by examining the relationship between object representations in the visual cortex and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). We analyze behavioral data and neural activity patterns to compare human object recognition with DCNN performance. Our findings reveal striking similarities between hierarchical representations in the human visual system and those in DCNNs, suggesting shared computational principles. However, we also identify key differences, particularly in the processing of complex scenes and atypical viewpoints. These insights contribute to our understanding of how the brain processes visual information and may inform the development of more human-like artificial vision systems. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging DCNNs as models for studying human object recognition and visual perception.", "label": 0}
