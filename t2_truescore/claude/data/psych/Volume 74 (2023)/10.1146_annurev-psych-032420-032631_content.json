{"grounding": "Culture and personality are two central topics in psychology. Individuals are culturally influenced influencers of culture, yet the research linking culture and personality has been limited and fragmentary. We integrate the literatures on culture and personality with recent advances in socioecology and genetics to formulate the Socioecological-Genetic Framework of Culture and Personality. Our framework not only delineates the mutual constitution of culture and personality but also sheds light on (a) the roots of culture and personality, (b) how socioecological changes partly explain temporal trends in culture and personality, and (c) how genes and culture/socioecology interact to influence personality (i.e., nature \u00d7 nurture interactions). By spotlighting the roles of socioecology and genetics, our integrative framework advances the understanding of culture and personality.", "generated_text": "This paper proposes a comprehensive socioecological-genetic framework to elucidate the intricate relationships between culture and personality. By integrating insights from cultural psychology, behavioral genetics, and evolutionary biology, we explore the roots, trends, and interplay of cultural and personality factors. Our framework posits that both culture and personality are shaped by complex interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental influences, including socioecological factors. We examine how cultural change and personality change are interconnected, influenced by both genetic and environmental forces. The nature-nurture debate is revisited through the lens of gene-environment interactions, highlighting the dynamic interplay between genetic factors and cultural contexts in shaping individual differences. This integrative approach offers new perspectives on the co-evolution of culture and personality, providing a foundation for future interdisciplinary research in this field.", "label": 1}
