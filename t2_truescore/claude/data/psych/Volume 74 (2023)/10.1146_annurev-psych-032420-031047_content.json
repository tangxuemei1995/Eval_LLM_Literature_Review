{"grounding": "Self-compassion refers to being supportive toward oneself when experiencing suffering or pain\u2014be it caused by personal mistakes and inadequacies or external life challenges. This review presents my theoretical model of self-compassion as comprised of six different elements: increased self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness as well as reduced self-judgment, isolation, and overidentification. It discusses the methodology of self-compassion research and reviews the increasingly large number of empirical studies that indicate self-compassion is a productive way of approaching distressing thoughts and emotions that engenders mental and physical well-being. It also reviews research that dispels common myths about self-compassion (e.g., that it is weak, selfish, self-indulgent or undermines motivation). Interventions designed to increase self-compassion, such as compassion-focused therapy and mindful self-compassion, are discussed. Finally, the review considers problematic issues in the field, such as the differential effects fallacy, and considers limitations and future research directions in the field of self-compassion research.", "generated_text": "Self-compassion, a construct rooted in Buddhist psychology, has gained significant attention in psychological research and clinical practice. This comprehensive review explores the theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, empirical findings, and interventional applications of self-compassion. Drawing from a diverse body of literature, we examine the three core components of self-compassion: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. The review synthesizes quantitative and qualitative research methodologies employed in studying self-compassion and its relationship to various psychological outcomes. Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates the positive associations between self-compassion and well-being, resilience, and adaptive coping strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the development and efficacy of self-compassion-based interventions across different populations and clinical settings. This review highlights the potential of self-compassion as a valuable tool for enhancing psychological health and offers directions for future research and practical applications in therapeutic contexts.", "label": 1}
