{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires guidance not only by sensations that are available immediately but also by relevant mental contents carried forward through working memory. Therefore, selective-attention functions that modulate the contents of working memory to guide behavior (inside-out) are just as important as those operating on sensory signals to generate internal contents (outside-in). We review the burgeoning literature on selective attention in the inside-out direction and underscore its functional, flexible, and future-focused nature. We discuss in turn the purpose (why), targets (what), sources (when), and mechanisms (how) of selective attention inside working memory, using visual working memory as a model. We show how the study of internal selective attention brings new insights concerning the core cognitive processes of attention and working memory and how considering selective attention and working memory together paves the way for a rich and integrated understanding of how mind serves behavior.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between working memory, selective attention, and behavioral outcomes in visual processing and action. We investigate how working memory serves as a crucial mediator between anticipatory processes and task execution. Through a series of experiments combining neuroimaging and behavioral measures, we demonstrate that working memory actively shapes attentional deployment, influencing both perceptual and motor processes. Our findings reveal that expectations stored in working memory guide selective attention, enhancing the processing of task-relevant information while suppressing distractors. Furthermore, we show that this memory-guided attention mechanism facilitates the preparation and execution of goal-directed actions. These results highlight the dynamic interplay between internal representations and external stimuli, suggesting that working memory acts as a bridge between past experiences and future behaviors. This research provides new insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior and has implications for understanding attention-related disorders.", "label": 1}
