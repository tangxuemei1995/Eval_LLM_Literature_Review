{"grounding": "Self-continuity is the subjective sense of connection between one's past and present selves (past\u2013present self-continuity), between one's present and future selves (present\u2013future self-continuity), or among one's past, present, and future selves (global self-continuity). We consider the motivational character of the three forms of self-continuity, their regulatory properties, and the internal or external factors that consolidate them. We also review their consequences for attitudes and judgments or decisions, motivation, intentions and behavior, and psychological and physical health. We further detail the psychological and behavioral benefits of self-discontinuity (i.e., a sense of disconnect among temporal selves). We next turn to the brain regions that are activated synchronously with self-continuity. We consider developmental perspectives on self-continuity, discuss collective self-continuity (along with its consequences and regulatory properties), and elaborate on cultural differences in self-continuity. This inaugural Annual Reviews chapter demonstrates the breadth, excitement, and sense of synergy among self-continuity researchers and points to promising research directions.", "generated_text": "Self-continuity, the perception of oneself as persisting through time, plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes, behavior, and psychological health. This review synthesizes recent findings on self-continuity across diverse cultural contexts, emphasizing its impact on individual and collective selves. Research indicates that a strong sense of self-continuity is associated with enhanced well-being, more consistent decision-making, and greater resilience in the face of adversity. However, cultural variations in the conceptualization and expression of self-continuity have been observed, with some societies placing greater emphasis on collective continuity. The interplay between personal and collective self-continuity is explored, revealing complex dynamics that influence social identity and group behavior. This review also highlights the potential applications of self-continuity research in clinical psychology, organizational behavior, and cultural studies, offering insights for future investigations and practical interventions aimed at promoting psychological health and social cohesion.", "label": 1}
