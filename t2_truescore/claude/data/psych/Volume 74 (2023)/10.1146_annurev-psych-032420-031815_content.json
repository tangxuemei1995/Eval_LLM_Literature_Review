{"grounding": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) research investigates changes in the evaluation of a stimulus after co-occurrence with an affective stimulus. To explain the motivation behind this research, this review begins with an overview of the history of EC research, followed by a summary of the state of the art with respect to three key questions. First, how should EC procedures be used to influence evaluation? We provide a guide based on evidence concerning the functional properties of EC effects. Second, how does the EC effect occur? We discuss the possible mediating cognitive processes and their automaticity. Third, are EC effects ubiquitous outside the lab? We discuss the evidence for the external validity of EC research. We conclude that the most important open questions pertain to the relevance of EC to everyday life and to the level of control that characterizes the processes that mediate the EC effect after people notice the stimulus co-occurrence.", "generated_text": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) has been a central topic in attitude research for decades. This review examines the historical development, current state, and future directions of EC research. We discuss the shift from associative to propositional accounts of EC and the ongoing debate surrounding underlying mechanisms. The paper highlights key findings on moderators and boundary conditions of EC effects, including attention, awareness, and individual differences. We critically evaluate methodological advances and challenges in EC research, emphasizing the need for improved measurement techniques and increased external validity. Recent developments in applied settings, such as advertising and health behavior, are explored. Finally, we identify promising avenues for future research, including investigations of EC in real-world contexts, integration with neuroscientific approaches, and potential applications in interventions for attitude change. This comprehensive review provides a foundation for understanding the complexities of EC and its significance in attitude formation and change.", "label": 1}
