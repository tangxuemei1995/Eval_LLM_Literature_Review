{"grounding": "The workplace elicits a wide range of emotions and, likewise, emotions change our experience of the workplace. This article reviews the scientific field of emotion in organizations, drawing from classic theories and cutting-edge advances to integrate a disparate body of research. The review is organized around the definition of emotion as an unfolding sequence of processes: We interpret the world around us for its subjective meaning, which results in emotional experience. Emotional experience, in turn, has consequences for behaviors, attitudes, and cognition. Emotional experience also elicits expressive cues that can be recognized by others. Each process in the emotion sequence can be regulated. Processes can also iterate until emotion is shared throughout workgroups and even entire organizations. A distinct body of organizationally relevant research exists for each process, and emotional intelligence refers to effectiveness across all. Differences across culture and gender, future research directions, and practical implications are discussed.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews the current state of research on emotion in organizational settings, synthesizing theoretical frameworks and empirical findings. We examine the role of emotions in workplace dynamics, exploring their impact on decision-making, leadership, and interpersonal relationships. The social function of emotions in organizational contexts is discussed, highlighting their influence on team cohesion, conflict resolution, and organizational culture. We also investigate the concept of emotional intelligence and its relevance to workplace performance and well-being. The review identifies key gaps in the literature and proposes future research directions, including the need for more longitudinal studies and cross-cultural comparisons. By integrating diverse perspectives on emotion in organizations, this paper contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of affective processes in the workplace and their implications for organizational behavior and management practices.", "label": 1}
