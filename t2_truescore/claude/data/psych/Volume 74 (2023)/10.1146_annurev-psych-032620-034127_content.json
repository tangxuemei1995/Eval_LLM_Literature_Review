{"grounding": "The restorative function of sleep is shaped by its duration, timing, continuity, subjective quality, and efficiency. Current sleep recommendations specify only nocturnal duration and have been largely derived from sleep self-reports that can be imprecise and miss relevant details. Sleep duration, preferred timing, and ability to withstand sleep deprivation are heritable traits whose expression may change with age and affect the optimal sleep prescription for an individual. Prevailing societal norms and circumstances related to work and relationships interact to influence sleep opportunity and quality. The value of allocating time for sleep is revealed by the impact of its restriction on behavior, functional brain imaging, sleep macrostructure, and late-life cognition. Augmentation of sleep slow oscillations and spindles have been proposed for enhancing sleep quality, but they inconsistently achieve their goal. Crafting bespoke sleep recommendations could benefit from large-scale, longitudinal collection of objective sleep data integrated with behavioral and self-reported data.", "generated_text": "Sleep plays a crucial role in cognitive function, yet its importance is often underestimated. This review examines the relationship between sleep and cognition, focusing on memory consolidation and attention. We explore the structure of sleep, including its various stages and their specific contributions to cognitive processes. The effects of age on sleep patterns and subsequent cognitive performance are also discussed. Additionally, we investigate strategies for sleep optimization to enhance cognitive abilities across different age groups. Our findings suggest that adequate sleep duration and quality are essential for optimal cognitive function, with particular emphasis on memory formation and attentional processes. Furthermore, age-related changes in sleep architecture may contribute to cognitive decline in older adults. We conclude by proposing evidence-based recommendations for improving sleep habits to support cognitive health throughout the lifespan.", "label": 1}
