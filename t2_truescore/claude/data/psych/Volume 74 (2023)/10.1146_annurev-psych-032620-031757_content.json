{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the fields of psychosocial and integrative oncology, highlighting common psychological reactions to being diagnosed with and treated for cancer, including distress, anxiety, depression, fear of cancer recurrence and caregiver burden, as well as symptoms of fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance. Patterns of symptomatology across the disease continuum are also discussed. Interventions targeted at treating these symptoms are reviewed, including acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, mind-body therapies, and meaning-based approaches designed for people with advanced stages of disease, including psychedelic therapy. Common methodological issues and shortcomings of the evidence base are summarized with design recommendations, and a discussion of trends in future research including pragmatic research design, digital health interventions, and implementation science completes the article.", "generated_text": "This review explores the evolving field of psychosocial and integrative oncology, examining interventions across the cancer disease trajectory. We analyze the efficacy of various approaches, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, mindfulness practices, and mind-body therapies in addressing anxiety, depression, and distress in cancer patients. The integration of these interventions with conventional cancer care is discussed, highlighting their potential to improve quality of life and treatment outcomes. Emerging research on psychedelic-assisted therapy in oncology is also examined. The review emphasizes the importance of tailoring interventions to individual patient needs and disease stages, and calls for further research to establish evidence-based guidelines for implementing psychosocial and integrative approaches in comprehensive cancer care. This holistic approach aims to address the complex psychological and emotional challenges faced by cancer patients throughout their journey.", "label": 1}
