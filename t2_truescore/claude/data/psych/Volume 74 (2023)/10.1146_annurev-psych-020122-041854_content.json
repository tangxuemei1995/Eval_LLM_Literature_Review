{"grounding": "Exposure to adversity (e.g., poverty, bereavement) is a robust predictor of disruptions in psychological functioning. However, people vary greatly in their responses to adversity; some experience severe long-term disruptions, others experience minimal disruptions or even improvements. We refer to the latter outcomes\u2014faring better than expected given adversity\u2014as psychological resilience. Understanding what processes explain resilience has critical theoretical and practical implications. Yet, psychology's understanding of resilience is incomplete, for two reasons: (a) We lack conceptual clarity, and (b) two major approaches to resilience\u2014the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach\u2014have limitations and are relatively isolated from one another. To address these two obstacles,we first discuss conceptual questions about resilience. Next, we offer an integrative affect-regulation framework that capitalizes on complementary strengths of both approaches. This framework advances our understanding of resilience by integrating existing findings, highlighting gaps in knowledge, and guiding future research.", "generated_text": "This paper proposes an affect-regulation framework for understanding psychological resilience. Drawing on extensive literature from stress and coping, emotion regulation, and psychological health domains, we argue that resilience is fundamentally rooted in an individual's capacity to regulate affect in the face of adversity. The framework integrates key findings on adaptive emotion regulation strategies, stress reactivity, and positive affect maintenance. We posit that resilient individuals exhibit flexible deployment of regulation strategies, efficient down-regulation of negative affect, and preservation of positive emotional states during challenging circumstances. The model also considers the role of individual differences, contextual factors, and developmental processes in shaping resilience. By conceptualizing resilience through the lens of affect regulation, this framework offers new insights for interventions aimed at enhancing psychological health and adaptability in the face of life's inevitable stressors.", "label": 1}
