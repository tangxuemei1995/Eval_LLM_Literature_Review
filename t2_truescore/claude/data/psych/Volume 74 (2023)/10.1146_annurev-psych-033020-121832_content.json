{"grounding": "This review focuses on conceptual and empirical research on determinants of social cognitive aging. We present an integrated model [the social cognitive resource (SCoRe) framework] to organize the literature and describe how social cognitive resilience is determined jointly by capacity and motivational resources. We discuss how neurobiological aging, driven by genetic and environmental influences, is associated with broader sensory, neural, and physiological changes that are direct determinants of capacity as well as indirect determinants of motivation via their influence on expectation of loss versus reward and cognitive effort valuation. Research is reviewed that shows how contextual factors, such as relationship status, familiarity, and practice, are fundamental to understanding the availability of both types of resource. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of social cognitive change in late adulthood for everyday social functioning and with recommendations for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex interplay of factors influencing social cognitive aging, focusing on the determinants of resilience and risk. We examine how social resources, contextual factors, motivation, and cognitive effort contribute to individual differences in social cognitive outcomes among older adults. Using a multi-method approach combining laboratory tasks and ecologically valid assessments, we explore the relative importance of these factors in predicting social cognitive performance across various real-world scenarios. Results reveal that social resources and motivation play crucial roles in maintaining social cognitive abilities, while contextual factors moderate their effects. Cognitive effort emerges as a key mediator between motivation and performance. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple determinants in understanding social cognitive aging and suggest potential interventions to promote resilience and mitigate risk factors in later life.", "label": 0}
