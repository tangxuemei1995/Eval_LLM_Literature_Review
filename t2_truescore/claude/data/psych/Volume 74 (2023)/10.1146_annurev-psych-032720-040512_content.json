{"grounding": "Color is a pervasive feature of our psychological experience, having a role in many aspects of human mind and behavior such as basic vision, scene perception, object recognition, aesthetics, and communication. Understanding how humans encode, perceive, talk about, and use color has been a major interdisciplinary effort. Here, we present the current state of knowledge on how color perception and cognition develop. We cover the development of various aspects of the psychological experience of color, ranging from low-level color vision to perceptual mechanisms such as color constancy to phenomena such as color naming and color preference. We also identify neurodiversity in the development of color perception and cognition and implications for clinical and educational contexts. We discuss the theoretical implications of the research for understanding mature color perception and cognition, for identifying the principles of perceptual and cognitive development, and for fostering a broader debate in the psychological sciences.", "generated_text": "This review examines the development of color perception and cognition from infancy through childhood. We explore how the ability to discriminate and categorize colors emerges and evolves, integrating findings from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science. The paper traces the maturation of color vision mechanisms in infants, highlighting key milestones in perceptual development. We then discuss the acquisition of color concepts and language, examining how children learn to associate color terms with perceptual experiences. The role of cultural and linguistic factors in shaping color cognition is also addressed. Additionally, we review studies on the impact of color on cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and learning throughout development. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex interplay between perceptual, cognitive, and environmental factors in the ontogeny of color processing, offering implications for educational practices and developmental theories.", "label": 1}
