{"grounding": "Pride is a self-conscious emotion, comprised of two distinct facets known as authentic and hubristic pride, and associated with a cross-culturally recognized nonverbal expression. Authentic pride involves feelings of accomplishment and confidence and promotes prosocial behaviors, whereas hubristic pride involves feelings of arrogance and conceit and promotes antisociality. Each facet of pride, we argue, contributes to a distinct means of attaining social rank: Authentic pride seems to promote prestige\u2014a rank based on earned respect\u2014whereas hubristic pride seems to promote dominance\u2014a rank based on aggression and coercion. Both prestige and dominance are effective routes to power and influence in human groups, so both facets of pride are likely to be functional adaptations. Overall, the reviewed research suggests that pride is likely to be a human universal, critical for social relationships and rank attainment across human societies.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the pivotal role of pride in social rank attainment, examining its influence on both prestige-based and dominance-based status hierarchies. Drawing on extensive research in social psychology and evolutionary biology, we propose that pride serves as a fundamental emotional mechanism facilitating the acquisition and maintenance of social status. Our analysis reveals that authentic pride promotes behaviors associated with prestige, such as skill development and prosociality, while hubristic pride drives dominance-seeking behaviors. We argue that pride's dual nature allows individuals to navigate complex social environments and adapt their status-seeking strategies accordingly. Furthermore, we discuss how cultural factors shape the expression and perception of pride in different societies. This integrative review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding pride's function in human social hierarchies and offers implications for future research on status dynamics and self-conscious emotions.", "label": 1}
