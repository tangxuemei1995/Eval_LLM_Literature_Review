{"grounding": "Cancer diagnosis and treatment constitute profoundly stressful experiences involving unique and common challenges that generate uncertainty, fear, and emotional distress. Individuals with cancer must cope with multiple stressors, from the point of diagnosis through surgical and adjuvant treatments and into survivorship, that require substantial psychological and physiological adaptation. This can take a toll on quality of life and well-being and may also promote cellular and molecular changes that can exacerbate physical symptoms and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis, thereby contributing to negative long-term health outcomes. Since modifying responses tostressors might improve psychological and physiological adaptation, quality of life, and clinical health outcomes, several randomized controlled trials have tested interventions that aim to facilitate stress management. We review evidence for the effects of stress management interventions on psychological and physiological adaptation and health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors and summarize emerging research in the field to address unanswered questions.", "generated_text": "Cancer patients and survivors face numerous stressors that can significantly impact their psychological and physiological well-being. This review examines the efficacy of stress management interventions in facilitating adaptation and improving health outcomes among cancer populations. We synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating various stress management techniques, with a focus on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches. Results indicate that structured stress management interventions, particularly those incorporating CBT principles, can effectively reduce cancer-related distress, improve coping skills, and enhance overall quality of life. Additionally, these interventions demonstrate potential in modulating physiological responses, including immune function and neuroendocrine regulation. The review highlights the importance of tailoring interventions to address specific cancer-related stressors and individual patient needs. Future research directions and implications for clinical practice in oncology settings are discussed, emphasizing the integration of stress management strategies into comprehensive cancer care.", "label": 1}
