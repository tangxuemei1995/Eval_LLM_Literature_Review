{"grounding": "African trypanosomes are bloodstream protozoan parasites that infect mammals including humans, where they cause sleeping sickness. Long-lasting infection is required to favor parasite transmission between hosts. Therefore, trypanosomes have developed strategies to continuously escape innate and adaptive responses of the immune system, while also preventing premature death of the host. The pathology linked to infection mainly results from inflammation and includes anemia and brain dysfunction in addition to loss of specificity and memory of the antibody response. The serum of humans contains an efficient trypanolytic factor, the membrane pore-forming protein apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). In the two human-infective trypanosomes, specific parasite resistance factors inhibit APOL1 activity. In turn, many African individuals express APOL1 variants that counteract these resistance factors, enabling them to avoid sleeping sickness. However, these variants are associated with chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of virus-induced inflammation such as coronavirus disease 2019. Vaccination perspectives are discussed.", "generated_text": "African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, remains a significant health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. This review explores the complex pathogenesis of the disease, focusing on the intricate interplay between African trypanosomes and host immune responses. We examine the parasites' remarkable ability to evade host defenses through antigenic variation, particularly the role of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) in this process. The review also discusses the host's innate immune mechanisms, including the trypanolytic factor apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). Interestingly, APOL1 variants that confer resistance to trypanosomiasis are associated with increased risk of kidney disease in affected populations. By elucidating these molecular interactions and their consequences, this review aims to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for managing both African trypanosomiasis and related kidney disorders.", "label": 1}
