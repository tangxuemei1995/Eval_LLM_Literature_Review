{"grounding": "Among human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-associated disorders, celiac disease has an immunopathogenesis that is particularly well understood. The condition is characterized by hypersensitivity to cereal gluten proteins, and the disease lesion is localized in the gut. Still, the diagnosis can be made by detection of highly disease-specific autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 in the blood. We now have mechanistic insights into how the disease-predisposing HLA-DQ molecules, via presentation of posttranslationally modified gluten peptides, are connected to the generation of these autoantibodies. This review presents our current understanding of the immunobiology of this common disorder that is positioned in the border zone between food hypersensitivity and autoimmunity.", "generated_text": "Celiac disease is a complex autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. This review explores the immunobiology and pathogenesis of celiac disease, focusing on the interplay between genetic factors, particularly HLA-DQ2/DQ8, and environmental triggers. We discuss the crucial roles of both innate and adaptive immune responses, including the activation of gluten-specific T cells and the production of autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2. The review also examines the involvement of B cells in disease progression and the potential for novel therapeutic approaches targeting key immunological pathways. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing improved diagnostic tools and targeted treatments for celiac disease.", "label": 1}
