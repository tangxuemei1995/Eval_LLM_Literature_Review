{"grounding": "Molecular monitoring of tumor-derived alterations has an established role in the surveillance of leukemias, and emerging nucleic acid sequencing technologies are likely to similarly transform the clinical management of lymphomas. Lymphomas are well suited for molecular surveillance due to relatively high cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA concentrations, high somatic mutational burden, and the existence of stereotyped variants enabling focused interrogation of recurrently altered regions. Here, we review the clinical scenarios and key technologies applicable for the molecular monitoring of lymphomas, summarizing current evidence in the literature regarding molecular subtyping and classification, evaluation of treatment response, the surveillance of active cellular therapies, and emerging clinical trial strategies.", "generated_text": "Molecular monitoring of lymphomas has emerged as a crucial tool in assessing treatment response and detecting measurable residual disease. This review explores the application of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis and next-generation sequencing techniques in lymphoma management. These non-invasive approaches offer superior sensitivity compared to conventional imaging methods, enabling early detection of relapse and guiding personalized treatment decisions. We discuss the current landscape of ctDNA-based assays, their clinical utility in various lymphoma subtypes, and their potential to revolutionize response assessment criteria. Additionally, we highlight the challenges and future directions in standardizing molecular monitoring techniques for widespread clinical implementation, emphasizing the need for prospective studies to validate their prognostic value in lymphoma care.", "label": 1}
