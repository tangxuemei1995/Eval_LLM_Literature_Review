{"grounding": "Reprogrammed metabolism is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC cells are geared toward rapid proliferation, requiring nutrients and the removal of cellular waste in nutrient-poor environments. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs), the primary cell of origin for CRCs, must adapt their metabolism along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to the unique features of their complex microenvironment that include interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, stromal cells, commensal microbes, and dietary components. Emerging evidence implicates modifiable risk factors related to the environment, such as diet, as important in CRC pathogenesis. Here, we focus on describing the metabolism of ISCs, diets that influence CRC initiation, CRC genetics and metabolism, and the tumor microenvironment. The mechanistic links between environmental factors, metabolic adaptations, and the tumor microenvironment in enhancing or supporting CRC tumorigenesis are becoming better understood. Thus, greater knowledge of CRC metabolism holds promise for improved prevention and treatment.", "generated_text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with increasing evidence suggesting a strong link between metabolism and CRC development. This review explores the complex interplay between metabolic processes, diet, and the gut microbiome in CRC pathogenesis. We examine how alterations in cellular metabolism, including dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism, contribute to tumor growth and progression. The impact of dietary factors on CRC risk is discussed, highlighting the role of specific nutrients and dietary patterns in modulating cancer-related metabolic pathways. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the gut microbiome on CRC development through its effects on host metabolism and immune responses. Understanding these metabolic interactions provides valuable insights into potential prevention strategies and targeted therapeutic approaches for CRC, emphasizing the importance of personalized nutrition and microbiome modulation in cancer management.", "label": 1}
