{"grounding": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) features a prominent stromal microenvironment with remarkable cellular and spatial heterogeneity that meaningfully impacts disease biology and treatment resistance. Recent advances in tissue imaging capabilities, single-cell analytics, and disease modeling have shed light on organizing principles that shape the stromal complexity of PDAC tumors. These insights into the functional and spatial dependencies that coordinate cancer cell biology and the relationships that exist between cells and extracellular matrix components present in tumors are expected to unveil therapeutic vulnerabilities. We review recent advances in the field and discuss current understandings of mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment shapes PDAC pathogenesis and therapy resistance.", "generated_text": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by its complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This review explores the intricate interplay between pancreatic cancer cells and the surrounding stroma, focusing on the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts, immune cells, and extracellular matrix components in disease progression and therapeutic resistance. We discuss how the dense, fibrotic stroma acts as a physical and biochemical barrier, impeding drug delivery and promoting immunosuppression. Recent advances in tumor immunology and stromal targeting strategies are examined, highlighting potential avenues for improving treatment outcomes. Understanding the dynamic interactions within the pancreatic TME is crucial for developing more effective therapies and overcoming the challenges posed by this aggressive cancer.", "label": 1}
