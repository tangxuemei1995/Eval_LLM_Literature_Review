{"grounding": "Tumor cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can function as mediators of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment. EVs contain a host of bioactive cargo, including membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins, in addition to noncoding RNAs, other RNA types, and double-stranded DNA fragments. These shed vesicles may deposit paracrine information and can also be taken up by stromal cells, causing the recipient cells to undergo phenotypic changes that profoundly impact diverse facets of cancer progression. For example, this unique form of cellular cross talk helps condition the premetastatic niche, facilitates evasion of the immune response, and promotes invasive and metastatic activity. These findings, coupled with those demonstrating that the number and content of EVs produced by tumors can vary depending on their tumor of origin, disease stage, or response to therapy, have raised the exciting possibility that EVs can be used for risk stratification, diagnostic, and even prognostic purposes. We summarize recent developments and the current knowledge of EV cargoes, their impact on disease progression, and implementation of EV-based liquid biopsies as tumor biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, have emerged as crucial mediators of intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment. This review explores the multifaceted roles of tumor-derived EVs in modulating the behavior of various cell types, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. We discuss the diverse EV cargoes, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, and their impact on recipient cells. The review highlights how EVs influence cell migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis through the transfer of bioactive molecules. Additionally, we examine the potential of EVs as liquid biopsies for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The complex interplay between tumor-derived EVs and the surrounding stromal cells is analyzed, revealing novel insights into tumor progression and potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the intricate functions of EVs in the tumor microenvironment may pave the way for innovative cancer treatment strategies and improved diagnostic tools.", "label": 1}
