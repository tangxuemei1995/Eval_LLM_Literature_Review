{"grounding": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging virus from the Flaviviridae family that is transmitted to humans by mosquito vectors and represents an important health problem. Infections in pregnant women are of major concern because of potential devastating consequences during pregnancy and have been associated with microcephaly in newborns. ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis. We discuss recent reports on the mechanisms used by ZIKV to replicate efficiently, and we highlight potential new areas of research for the development of therapeutic approaches.", "generated_text": "This review explores the pathogenesis of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, focusing on its cellular tropism, interactions with the host ubiquitin system, and mechanisms of immune response antagonism. ZIKV, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has gained global attention due to its association with severe neurological complications. We discuss the virus's ability to infect various cell types, particularly neural progenitor cells, and its impact on fetal development. The role of ubiquitin in ZIKV replication and the virus's manipulation of host ubiquitination processes are examined, with special emphasis on the interaction between ZIKV and TRIM7, a member of the tripartite motif protein family. Additionally, we analyze ZIKV's strategies for evading host immune responses, including interference with interferon signaling pathways. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutic interventions and preventive strategies against ZIKV infection.", "label": 1}
