{"grounding": "Metastatic dissemination has lethal consequences for cancer patients. Accruing evidence supports the hypothesis that tumor cells can migrate and metastasize as clusters of cells while maintaining contacts with one another. Collective metastasis enables tumor cells to colonize secondary sites more efficiently, resist cell death, and evade the immune system. On the other hand, tumor cell clusters face unique challenges for dissemination particularly during systemic dissemination. Here, we review recent progress toward understanding how tumor cell clusters overcome these disadvantages as well as mechanisms they utilize to gain advantages throughout the metastatic process. We consider useful models for studying collective metastasis and reflect on how the study of collective metastasis suggests new opportunities for eradicating and preventing metastatic disease.", "generated_text": "Recent studies have unveiled the critical role of tumor cell clusters in orchestrating collective migration and metastasis. This review explores the mechanisms underlying collective metastasis, focusing on polyclonal seeding and the formation of circulating tumor cell clusters. We examine how these clusters facilitate enhanced survival, colonization, and metastatic potential compared to single tumor cells. The review also delves into the complex signaling networks that govern collective migration, highlighting the importance of cell-cell adhesion and communication within clusters. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical implications of these findings, including potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers. Understanding the intricacies of collective metastasis may pave the way for novel strategies to combat cancer progression and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
