{"grounding": "Tuft cells are found in tissues with distinct stem cell compartments, tissue architecture, and luminal exposures but converge on a shared transcriptional program, including expression of taste transduction signaling pathways. Here, we summarize seminal and recent findings on tuft cells, focusing on major categories of function\u2014instigation of type 2 cytokine responses, orchestration of antimicrobial responses, and emerging roles in tissue repair\u2014and describe tuft cell\u2013derived molecules used to affect these functional programs. We review what is known about the development of tuft cells from epithelial progenitors under homeostatic conditions and during disease. Finally, we discuss evidence that immature, or nascent, tuft cells with potential for diverse functions are driven toward dominant effector programs by tissue- or perturbation-specific contextual cues, which may result in heterogeneous mature tuft cell phenotypes both within and between tissues.", "generated_text": "Tuft cells, a conserved epithelial cell lineage, play crucial roles in various tissues, particularly in type II taste transduction and immune regulation. This review explores the context- and tissue-specific programming of tuft cells, highlighting their diverse functions across different organ systems. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying tuft cell development and activation, focusing on key signaling pathways involving IL-25, acetylcholine, and cysteinyl leukotrienes. The review also discusses the importance of tuft cells in mucociliary clearance and their contribution to type 2 immunity. By synthesizing recent findings, we provide insights into the plasticity and adaptability of tuft cells in response to environmental cues and tissue-specific demands. Understanding the multifaceted nature of tuft cells may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for various epithelial-related disorders and immune-mediated diseases.", "label": 1}
