{"grounding": "The continental crust in the overriding plate of the India-Asia collision zone in southern Tibet is characterized by an overthickened layer of felsic composition with an underlying granulite-eclogite layer. A large data set indicates that this crust experienced magmatism from 245 to 10 Ma, as recorded by the Gangdese Batholith. Magmatism was punctuated by flare-ups at 185\u2212170, 90\u221275, and 55\u221245 Ma caused by a combination of external and internal factors. The growth of this crust starts with a period dominated by fractional crystallization and the formation of voluminous (ultra)mafic arc cumulates in the lower crust during subduction, followed by their melting during late-subduction and collision, due to changes in convergence rate. This combined accumulation-melting process resulted in the vertical stratification and density sorting of the Gangdese crust. Comparisons with other similarly thickened collision zones suggests that this is a general process that leads to the stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records the time-integrated development of the world's thickest crust, reaching greater than 50 km at 55\u201345 Ma and greater than 70 km after 32 Ma.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records three magmatic flare-ups in response to distinct drivers; the last one at 55\u221245 Ma marks the arrival of India.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMagmatism was first dominated by fractional crystallization (accumulation) followed by crustal melting: the accumulation-melting process.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tAccumulation-melting in other collision zones provides a general process for vertical stratification and stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Gangdese Batholith in southern Tibet provides a unique window into continental crustal growth processes within a magmatic arc setting. This study investigates the temporal and spatial evolution of the batholith to elucidate the mechanisms of crustal stratification and growth in collision zones. Integrating field observations, geochemical analyses, and geochronological data, we reveal a complex history of magmatism spanning from the Late Triassic to the early Miocene. Our results indicate that the batholith formed through multiple pulses of magma emplacement, with distinct compositional trends reflecting changes in tectonic regime and source characteristics. Early stages of arc development are characterized by more mafic compositions, gradually evolving towards more felsic signatures as crustal thickening progressed. Isotopic data suggest a significant contribution from juvenile mantle-derived melts, particularly during the early stages, with increasing crustal assimilation over time. Crustal stratification is evidenced by vertical variations in geochemical and isotopic signatures, indicating a transition from lower crustal melting to upper crustal contamination. The collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates markedly influenced the magmatic evolution, triggering a shift in magma sources and emplacement styles. This study highlights the importance of long-lived magmatic arcs in continental crustal growth and provides insights into the complex interplay between tectonic processes, magma generation, and crustal evolution in collision zones.", "label": 1}
