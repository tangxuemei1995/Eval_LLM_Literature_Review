{"grounding": "Planets are expected to conclude their growth through a series of giant impacts: energetic, global events that significantly alter planetary composition and evolution. Computer models and theory have elucidated the diverse outcomes of giant impacts in detail, improving our ability to interpret collision conditions from observations of their remnants. However, many open questions remain, as even the formation of the Moon\u2014a widely suspected giant-impact product for which we have the most information\u2014is still debated. We review giant-impact theory, the diverse nature of giant-impact outcomes, and the governing physical processes. We discuss the importance of computer simulations, informed by experiments, for accurately modeling the impact process. Finally, we outline how the application of probability theory and computational advancements can assist in inferring collision histories from observations, and we identify promising opportunities for advancing giant-impact theory in the future.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGiant impacts exhibit diverse possible outcomes leading to changes in planetary mass, composition, and thermal history depending on the conditions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tImprovements to computer simulation methodologies and new laboratory experiments provide critical insights into the detailed outcomes of giant impacts.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWhen colliding planets are similar in size, they can merge or escape one another with roughly equal probability, but with different effects on their resulting masses, densities, and orbits.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDifferent sequences of giant impacts can produce similar planets, encouraging the use of probability theory to evaluate distinct formation hypothesis.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Giant impacts play a crucial role in the final stages of planet formation, shaping the physical and chemical properties of terrestrial planets. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of these catastrophic events and their implications for planetary evolution. We examine the latest numerical simulations and theoretical models that describe the mechanics of giant impacts, including their frequency, energy scales, and outcomes. The review highlights the importance of these collisions in determining planetary mass, rotation rates, and the formation of satellite systems. We discuss how giant impacts influence the distribution of elements within planets, potentially explaining observed compositional variations in the inner Solar System. The role of these events in atmospheric loss and volatile delivery is also explored, with implications for the development of habitable conditions on rocky planets. Furthermore, we consider how giant impacts may contribute to the diversity of exoplanetary systems observed to date. By integrating findings from various disciplines, including planetary science, geophysics, and astronomy, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding giant impacts in planet formation and identifies key areas for future research.", "label": 1}
