{"grounding": "Upon exhumation and cooling, contrasting compressibilities and thermal expansivities induce differential strains (volume mismatches) between a host crystal and its inclusions. These strains can be quantified in situ using Raman spectroscopy or X-ray diffraction. Knowing equations of state and elastic properties of minerals, elastic thermobarometry inverts measured strains to calculate the pressure-temperature conditions under which the stress state was uniform in the host and inclusion. These are commonly interpreted to represent the conditions of inclusion entrapment. Modeling and experiments quantify corrections for inclusion shape, proximity to surfaces, and (most importantly) crystal-axis anisotropy, and they permit accurate application of the more common elastic thermobarometers. New research is exploring the conditions of crystal growth, reaction overstepping, and the magnitudes of differential stresses, as well as inelastic resetting of inclusion and host strain, and potential new thermobarometers for lower-symmetry minerals.", "generated_text": "Elastic thermobarometry is an emerging technique in metamorphic petrology that utilizes the residual elastic strain preserved in mineral inclusions to determine pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions of rock formation. This method combines principles of elastic deformation with Raman spectroscopy to measure shifts in vibrational modes of trapped inclusions. Unlike traditional thermobarometry, which relies on chemical equilibrium, elastic thermobarometry can provide insights into P-T conditions even when chemical re-equilibration has occurred. The technique exploits the contrast in elastic properties between host and inclusion minerals, allowing for the reconstruction of entrapment conditions. However, challenges arise from the interplay of elastic, viscous, and plastic deformation processes during exhumation. This review explores the theoretical foundations, applications, and limitations of elastic thermobarometry, highlighting its potential to revolutionize our understanding of metamorphic histories in various geological settings.", "label": 1}
