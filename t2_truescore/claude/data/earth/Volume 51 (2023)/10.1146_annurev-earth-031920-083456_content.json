{"grounding": "As atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations rise and climate change becomes more destructive, geoengineering has become a subject of serious consideration. By reflecting a fraction of incoming sunlight, solar geoengineering could cool the planet quickly, but with uncertain effects on regional climatology, particularly hydrological patterns. Here, we review recent work on projected hydrologic outcomes of solar geoengineering, in the context of a robust literature on hydrological responses to climate change. While most approaches to solar geoengineering are expected to weaken the global hydrologic cycle, regional effects will vary based on implementation method and strategy. The literature on the hydrologic outcomes and impacts of geoengineering demonstrates that its implications for human welfare will depend on assumptions about underlying social conditions and objectives of intervention as well as the social lens through which projected effects are interpreted. We conclude with suggestions to reduce decision-relevant uncertainties in this novel field of Earth science inquiry.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe expected hydrological effects of reducing insolation are among the most uncertain and consequential impacts of solar geoengineering (SG).\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tTheoretical frameworks from broader climate science can help explain SG's effects on global precipitation, relative humidity, and other aspects of hydroclimate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe state of the knowledge on hydrological impacts of SG is unevenly concentrated among regions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tProjected hydrological impacts from SG are scenario dependent and difficult to characterize as either harmful or beneficial.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Solar geoengineering, a proposed climate intervention strategy to mitigate global warming, has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However, its potential impacts on the hydrological cycle remain poorly understood. This study investigates the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering through a comprehensive analysis of climate model simulations and observational data. We focus on the effects of solar radiation modification on global and regional precipitation patterns, evaporation rates, and overall water availability. Our results indicate that while solar geoengineering may effectively reduce global mean temperature, it could lead to significant alterations in the hydrologic cycle. We find that solar radiation modification techniques tend to decrease global precipitation, particularly in tropical regions, and may exacerbate existing water stress in arid and semi-arid areas. Furthermore, changes in atmospheric circulation patterns induced by solar geoengineering could result in shifts in monsoon systems and extreme precipitation events. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar geoengineering, climate change, and the hydrological cycle, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of potential trade-offs and unintended consequences. Our study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to climate intervention strategies, taking into account not only temperature reduction but also the broader impacts on Earth's water systems and their implications for global water security.", "label": 1}
