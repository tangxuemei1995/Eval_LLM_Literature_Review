{"grounding": "Terrestrial plants have transformed Earth's surface environments by altering water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. Studying vegetation-climate interaction in deep time has necessarily relied on modern-plant analogs to represent paleo-ecosystems\u2014as methods for reconstructing paleo- and, in particular, extinct-plant function were lacking. This approach is potentially compromised given that plant physiology has evolved through time, and some paleo-plants have no clear modern analog. Advancements in the quantitative reconstruction of whole-plant function provide new opportunities to replace modern-plant analogs and capture age-specific vegetation-climate interactions. Here, we review recent investigations of paleo-plant performance through the integration of fossil and geologic data with process-based ecosystem- to Earth system\u2013scale models to explore how early vascular plants responded to and influenced climate. First, we present an argument for characterizing extinct plants in terms of ecological and evolutionary theory to provide a framework for advancing reconstructed vegetation-climate interactions in deep time. We discuss the novel mechanistic understanding provided by applying these approaches to plants of the late Paleozoic ever-wet tropics and at higher latitudes. Finally, we discuss preliminary applications to paleo-plants in a state-of-the-art Earth system model to highlight the potential implications of different plant functional strategies on our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFor hundreds of millions of years, plants have been a keystone in maintaining the status of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and climate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tExtinct plants have functioned differently across time, limiting our understanding of how processes on Earth interact to produce climate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tNew methods, reviewed here, allow quantitative reconstruction of extinct-plant function based on the fossil record.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIntegrating extinct plants into ecosystem and climate models will expand our understanding of vegetation's role in past environmental change.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The evolution of plants has profoundly influenced Earth's environment throughout geological time, particularly during the late Paleozoic era. This study presents a comprehensive systems approach to understanding the complex interactions between plant functional traits, ecosystem dynamics, and global climate patterns in deep time. By integrating plant functional strategies, ecosystem modeling, and Earth system modeling, we investigate the transformative impact of vegetation on the planet's biogeochemical cycles and climate. Our analysis focuses on key plant innovations, such as the development of deep root systems, lignified tissues, and complex vascular structures, which emerged during the late Paleozoic. These adaptations not only enhanced plant survival and colonization of terrestrial environments but also significantly altered atmospheric composition, hydrological cycles, and soil formation processes. Through the application of advanced Earth system models, we simulate the feedbacks between vegetation and climate, revealing the critical role of plant-driven changes in albedo, evapotranspiration, and carbon sequestration. Our findings demonstrate that the diversification of plant functional traits and strategies during this period led to increased primary productivity, enhanced weathering rates, and substantial modifications to global biogeochemical cycles. This research provides new insights into the co-evolution of plants and Earth's environment, highlighting the importance of vegetation-climate interactions in shaping the planet's long-term ecological and climatic trajectories. By elucidating the mechanisms through which plants transformed Earth's systems in deep time, this study contributes to our understanding of past climate changes and offers valuable perspectives for predicting future ecosystem responses to global environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
