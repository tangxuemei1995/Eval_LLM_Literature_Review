{"grounding": "Future sea-level rise poses an existential threat for many river deltas, yet quantifying the effect of sea-level changes on these coastal landforms remains a challenge. Sea-level changes have been slow compared to other coastal processes during the instrumental record, such that our knowledge comes primarily from models, experiments, and the geologic record. Here we review the current state of science on river delta response to sea-level change, including models and observations from the Holocene until 2300 CE. We report on improvements in the detection and modeling of past and future regional sea-level change, including a better understanding of the underlying processes and sources of uncertainty. We also see significant improvements in morphodynamic delta models. Still, substantial uncertainties remain, notably on present and future subsidence rates in and near deltas. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern sea-level rise also remain elusive, posing major challenges to model validation.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThere are large differences in the initiation time and subsequent delta progradation during the Holocene, likely from different sea-level and sediment supply histories.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tModern deltas are larger and will face faster sea-level rise than during their Holocene growth, making them susceptible to forced transgression.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tRegional sea-level projections have been much improved in the past decade and now also isolate dominant sources of uncertainty, such as the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tVertical land motion in deltas can be the dominant source of relative sea-level change and the dominant source of uncertainty; limited observations complicate projections.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tRiver deltas globally might lose 5% (\u223c35,000 km2) of their surface area by 2100 and 50% by 2300 due to relative sea-level rise under a high-emission scenario.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "River deltas are dynamic coastal systems that play a crucial role in global ecosystems and human settlements. However, these vulnerable landscapes are increasingly threatened by accelerating sea-level rise due to climate change. This study synthesizes recent research on the complex interactions between river deltas and sea-level rise, focusing on geomorphological processes, sedimentary geology, and shoreline dynamics. We review the latest findings on delta formation, evolution, and response to changing environmental conditions, emphasizing the importance of sediment supply, subsidence, and hydrodynamic forces. Our analysis reveals that while some deltas demonstrate resilience through natural adaptation mechanisms, many are experiencing significant land loss, saltwater intrusion, and habitat degradation. We examine case studies from various global delta systems, highlighting the diverse range of impacts and adaptation strategies employed. The research also explores the implications of sea-level rise on delta-dependent human populations, including the potential for forced migrations and economic disruptions. Furthermore, we discuss emerging approaches in delta management, such as nature-based solutions and integrated coastal zone management, which aim to enhance delta resilience in the face of rising seas. This comprehensive review underscores the urgent need for interdisciplinary research and adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of sea-level rise on river deltas and their associated coastal communities. The findings presented here contribute to a better understanding of delta-sea level interactions and provide valuable insights for policymakers and coastal managers working to protect these vital ecosystems in an era of rapid environmental change.", "label": 1}
