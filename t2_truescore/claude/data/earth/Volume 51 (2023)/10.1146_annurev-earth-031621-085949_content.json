{"grounding": "Carbonate minerals contain stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen with different masses whose abundances and bond arrangement are governed by thermodynamics. The clumped isotopic value \u0394i is a measure of the temperature-dependent preference of heavy C and O isotopes to clump, or bond with or near each other, rather than with light isotopes in the carbonate phase. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry uses \u0394i values measured by mass spectrometry (\u039447, \u039448) or laser spectroscopy (\u0394638) to reconstruct mineral growth temperature in surface and subsurface environments independent of parent water isotopic composition. Two decades of analytical and theoretical development have produced a mature temperature proxy that can estimate carbonate formation temperatures from 0.5 to 1,100\u00b0C, with up to 1\u20132\u00b0C external precision (2 standard error of the mean). Alteration of primary environmental temperatures by fluid-mediated and solid-state reactions and/or \u0394i values that reflect nonequilibrium isotopic fractionations reveal diagenetic history and/or mineralization processes. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has contributed significantly to geological and biological sciences, and it is poised to advance understanding of Earth's climate system, crustal processes, and growth environments of carbonate minerals.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tClumped heavy isotopes in carbonate minerals record robust temperatures and fluid compositions of ancient Earth surface and subsurface environments.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMature analytical methods enable carbonate clumped \u039447, \u039448, and \u0394638 measurements to address diverse questions in geological and biological sciences.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThese methods are poised to advance marine and terrestrial paleoenvironment and paleoclimate, tectonics, deformation, hydrothermal, and mineralization studies.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has emerged as a powerful tool in geochemistry, revolutionizing our understanding of Earth's past climates and environments. This review explores the latest advancements and challenges in this rapidly evolving field. Clumped isotope thermometry is based on the temperature-dependent formation of rare isotopologues in carbonate minerals, particularly the 13C-18O bond. Recent developments have significantly improved analytical precision and reduced sample size requirements, expanding the technique's applicability to a wider range of geological and environmental studies. We discuss the current state of calibration efforts, addressing discrepancies between different laboratories and carbonate materials. The review also examines innovative applications in paleoclimatology, diagenesis, and biomineralization, highlighting how clumped isotopes provide unique insights into past temperatures and fluid compositions. Furthermore, we explore the integration of clumped isotope data with other proxies and numerical models, enhancing our ability to reconstruct complex paleoenvironmental conditions. Challenges remain in understanding the effects of kinetic fractionation, solid-state reordering, and other non-equilibrium processes on clumped isotope signatures. Looking ahead, we identify promising research directions, including the development of new analytical techniques, expansion into non-carbonate minerals, and the potential for high-resolution time series reconstructions. This review underscores the transformative impact of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry on geochemistry and its continuing potential to unlock new dimensions in Earth science research.", "label": 1}
