{"grounding": "Our understanding of Earth's rock-hosted subsurface biosphere has advanced over the past two decades through the collection and analysis of fluids and rocks from aquifers within the continental and oceanic crust. Improvements in cell extraction, cell sorting, DNA sequencing, and techniques for detecting cell distributions and activity have revealed how the combination of lithology, permeability, and fluid mixing processes controls the diversity and heterogeneous distribution of microbial communities in fractured rock systems. However, the functions of most organisms, and the rates of their activity and growth, remain largely unknown. To mechanistically understand what physiochemical and hydrological factors control the rock-hosted biosphere, future studies are needed to characterize the physiology of microorganisms adapted to mineral-associated growth under energy- and nutrient-limited conditions. Experiments should be designed to detect synergistic interactions between microorganisms, and between microorganisms and minerals, at highly variable turnover rates.", "generated_text": "The rock-hosted biosphere represents a vast and largely unexplored frontier in microbial ecology. This review synthesizes current knowledge on endolithic communities and their role in shaping the Earth's crust. We examine the diverse metabolic strategies employed by microorganisms in these extreme environments, with a focus on chemolithoautotrophy. The significance of rock fractures as conduits for nutrient and energy flow is discussed, highlighting their importance in sustaining microbial activity in the deep subsurface. We explore recent advances in understanding the extent and diversity of life in crustal ecosystems, from shallow aquifers to deep continental and oceanic settings. The potential implications of rock-hosted microbial activity on global biogeochemical cycles and the evolution of life on Earth are also considered. This review underscores the need for further research to fully comprehend the ecological and geochemical impacts of the rock-hosted biosphere.", "label": 1}
