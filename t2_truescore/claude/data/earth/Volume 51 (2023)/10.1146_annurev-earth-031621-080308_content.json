{"grounding": "Volcanic eruptions are driven by bubbles that form when volatile species exsolve from magma. The conditions under which bubbles form depend mainly on magma composition, volatile concentration, presence of crystals, and magma decompression rate. These are all predicated on the mechanism by which volatiles exsolve from the melt to form bubbles. We critically review the known or inferred mechanisms of bubble formation in magmas: homogeneous nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation on crystal surfaces, and spontaneous phase separation (spinodal decomposition). We propose a general approach for calculating bubble nucleation rates as the sum of the contributions from homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, suggesting that nucleation may not be limited to a single mechanism prior to eruption. We identify three major challenges in which further experimental, analytical, and theoretical work is required to permit the development of a general model for bubble formation under natural eruption conditions.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe review the mechanisms of bubble formation in magma and summarize the conditions under which the various mechanisms are understood to operate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tBubble formation mechanisms may evolve throughout magma ascent as conditions change such that bubbles may form simultaneously and sequentially via more than one mechanism.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tContributions from both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation on multiphase crystal phases can be captured via a single equation.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFuture work should focus on constraining macroscopic surface tension, characterizing the microphysics, and developing a general framework for modeling bubble formation, via all mechanisms, over natural magma ascent pathways.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Bubble formation in magma plays a crucial role in volcanic eruptions, influencing eruptive styles and intensities. This study investigates the mechanisms of bubble nucleation and growth in magmatic systems, focusing on the interplay between volatile content, pressure changes, and magma composition. We examine the process of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, as well as the potential for spinodal decomposition in supersaturated magmas. Through a combination of experimental approaches and theoretical modeling, we explore the dynamics of bubble formation across a range of magmatic conditions. Our results indicate that the rate of bubble nucleation is strongly dependent on the degree of supersaturation and the presence of nucleation sites. We observe that rapid decompression can lead to explosive bubble growth, while slower ascent rates promote coalescence and bubble ripening. The study also reveals the importance of magma rheology in controlling bubble size distribution and ascent velocities. Furthermore, we identify critical thresholds for volatile content and decompression rates that trigger transitions between effusive and explosive eruption styles. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of bubble dynamics in magmatic systems and have significant implications for improving volcanic hazard assessments and eruption forecasting models.", "label": 1}
