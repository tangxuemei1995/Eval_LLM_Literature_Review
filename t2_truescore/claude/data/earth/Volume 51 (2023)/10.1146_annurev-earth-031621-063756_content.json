{"grounding": "The strength of lithospheric plates is a central component of plate tectonics, governed by brittle processes in the shallow portion of the plate and ductile behavior in the deeper portion. We review experimental constraints on ductile deformation of olivine, the main mineral in the upper mantle and thus the lithosphere. Olivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (GBS), and diffusion-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (diffusion creep). Deformation in most of the lithosphere is dominated by GBS, except in shear zones\u2014in which diffusion creep dominates\u2014and in the brittle-ductile transition\u2014in which low-temperature plasticity may dominate. We find that observations from naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of the experimentally constrained olivine flow laws to geological conditions but that geophysical observations predict a weaker lithosphere. The causes of this discrepancy are unresolved but likely reside in the uncertainty surrounding processes in the brittle-ductile transition, at which the lithosphere is strongest.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDuctile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is constrained by experimental data for olivine.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tOlivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, and diffusion creep.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tObservations of naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of olivine flow laws from experimental conditions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tExperiments predict stronger lithosphere than geophysical observations, likely due to gaps in constraints on deformation in the brittle-ductile transition.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle plays a crucial role in shaping Earth's tectonic processes and the evolution of its surface. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of the deformation mechanisms and ductile flow behavior of the lithospheric mantle, with a focus on olivine, the dominant mineral in this region. We examine the interplay between various deformation mechanisms, including dislocation creep, diffusion creep, and grain boundary sliding, and their dependence on temperature, pressure, and stress conditions. The review highlights the importance of microstructural evolution, grain size distribution, and the presence of secondary phases in controlling the rheological behavior of the lithospheric mantle. We discuss the implications of these findings for large-scale geodynamic processes, such as plate tectonics, mantle convection, and lithospheric deformation. Additionally, we explore the role of water content and melt fraction in modifying the plasticity of olivine and other mantle minerals. The integration of experimental data, theoretical models, and field observations provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex ductile deformation processes occurring within the Earth's lithospheric mantle, offering new insights into the dynamics of our planet's interior.", "label": 1}
