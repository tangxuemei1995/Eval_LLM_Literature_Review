{"grounding": "The current rapid increase in atmospheric CO2, linked to the massive use of fossil fuels, will have major consequences for our climate and for living organisms. To understand what is happening today, it is informative to look at the past. The evolution of the carbon cycle, coupled with that of the past climate system and the other coupled elemental cycles, is explored in the field, in the laboratory, and with the help of numerical modeling. The objective of numerical modeling is to be able to provide a quantification of the processes at work on our planet. Of course, we must remain aware that a numerical model, however complex, will never include all the relevant processes, impacts, and consequences because nature is complex and not all the processes are known. This makes models uncertain. We are still at the beginning of the exploration of the deep-time Earth. In the present contribution, we review some crucial events in coupled Earth-climate-biosphere evolution over the past 540 million years, focusing on the models that have been developed and what their results suggest. For most of these events, the causes are complex and we are not able to conclusively pinpoint all causal relationships and feedbacks in the Earth system. This remains a largely open scientific field.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe era of the pioneers of geological carbon cycle modeling is coming to an end with the recent development of numerical models simulating the physics of the processes, including climate and the role of vegetation, while taking into account spatialization.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tNumerical models now allow us to address increasingly complex processes, which suggests the possibility of simulating the complete carbon balance of objects as complex as a mountain range.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWhile most of the processes simulated by models are physical-chemical processes in which the role of living organisms is taken into account in a very simple way, via a limited number of parameters, models of the carbon cycle in deep time coupled with increasingly complex ecological models are emerging and are profoundly modifying our understanding of the evolution of our planet's surface.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Phanerozoic eon, spanning approximately 541 million years, has witnessed significant fluctuations in Earth's carbon cycle and climate. This review synthesizes insights from various modeling approaches to elucidate the evolution of carbon sources and sinks throughout this extensive period. We examine how different models, ranging from simple box models to complex Earth system models, have contributed to our understanding of long-term carbon cycle dynamics. The models consistently highlight the critical role of silicate weathering as a primary carbon sink and its feedback mechanisms in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels over geological timescales. They also emphasize the importance of volcanic and metamorphic degassing as major carbon sources, with variations in these processes linked to tectonic activity and paleogeography. Our analysis reveals that models have been instrumental in quantifying the relative contributions of organic carbon burial, carbonate deposition, and weathering to the overall carbon budget. Furthermore, we discuss how models have helped to explain major climatic events and carbon cycle perturbations, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events. The integration of proxy data with modeling results has improved our ability to constrain past atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global temperature trends. However, significant uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the parameterization of biological processes and their evolution over deep time. We identify key areas where model improvements are needed, including better representation of land plants' influence on weathering rates, more accurate reconstructions of paleogeography, and enhanced coupling between the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical cycles. This review underscores the value of modeling approaches in unraveling the complex interplay between the carbon cycle and climate over the Phanerozoic, while also highlighting the ongoing challenges in accurately reconstructing Earth's distant past.", "label": 1}
