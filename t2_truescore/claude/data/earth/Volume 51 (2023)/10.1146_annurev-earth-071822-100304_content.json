{"grounding": "Large seismogenic faults consist of approximately meter-thick fault cores surrounded by hundreds-of-meters-thick damage zones. Earthquakes are generated by rupture propagation and slip within fault cores and dissipate the stored elastic strain energy in fracture and frictional processes in the fault zone and in radiated seismic waves. Understanding this energy partitioning is fundamental in earthquake mechanics to explain fault dynamic weakening and causative rupture processes operating over different spatial and temporal scales. The energy dissipated in the earthquake rupture propagation along a fault is called fracture energy or breakdown work. Here we review fracture energy estimates from seismological, modeling, geological, and experimental studies and show that fracture energy scales with fault slip. We conclude that although material-dependent constant fracture energies are important at the microscale for fracturing grains of the fault zone, they are negligible with respect to the macroscale processes governing rupture propagation on natural faults.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEarthquake ruptures propagate on geological faults and dissipate energy in fracture and frictional processes from micro- (less than a millimeter) to macroscale (centimeters to kilometers).\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe energy dissipated in earthquake rupture propagation is called fracture energy (G) or breakdown work (W\nb) and scales with coseismic slip.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFor earthquake ruptures in natural faults, the estimates of G and W\nb are consistent with a macroscale description of causative processes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe energy budget of an earthquake remains controversial, and contributions from different disciplines are required to unravel this issue.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Understanding the energy budget of earthquakes is crucial for comprehending fault mechanics and seismic hazard assessment. This study investigates the relationship between fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquake ruptures, focusing on their roles in dynamic weakening processes and overall rupture dynamics. We analyze a comprehensive dataset of well-documented earthquakes, combining seismological observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations to quantify these energy components across various tectonic settings and fault zone structures. Our results reveal a complex interplay between fracture energy and breakdown work, influenced by factors such as fault roughness, thermal pressurization, and off-fault damage. We find that the ratio of fracture energy to breakdown work varies systematically with earthquake magnitude and fault maturity, suggesting a scale-dependent evolution of energy partitioning during rupture propagation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating realistic fault zone structures in rupture models significantly impacts the estimated energy budget, highlighting the importance of considering geological complexity in earthquake simulations. These findings provide new insights into the physical mechanisms governing earthquake ruptures and have important implications for improving seismic hazard models. Our work underscores the need for integrating multidisciplinary approaches to better constrain the energy dissipation processes during earthquakes and enhance our understanding of fault zone dynamics.", "label": 1}
