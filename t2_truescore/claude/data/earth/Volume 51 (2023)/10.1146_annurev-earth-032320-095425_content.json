{"grounding": "An oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals. The early Earth had an anoxic atmosphere, and understanding the rise and maintenance of high O2 levels is critical for investigating what drove our own evolution and for assessing the likely habitability of exoplanets. A growing number of techniques aim to reproduce changes in O2 levels over the Phanerozoic Eon (the past 539 million years). We assess these methods and attempt to draw the reliable techniques together to form a consensus Phanerozoic O2 curve. We conclude that O2 probably made up around 5\u201310% of the atmosphere during the Cambrian and rose in pulses to \u223c15\u201320% in the Devonian, reaching a further peak of greater than 25% in the Permo-Carboniferous before declining toward the present day. Evolutionary radiations in the Cambrian and Ordovician appear consistent with an oxygen driver, and the Devonian \u201cAge of the Fishes\u201d coincides with oxygen rising above 15% atm.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tAn oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals such as humans.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe review the methods for reconstructing past variation in oxygen levels over the past 539 million years (the Phanerozoic Eon).\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe produce a consensus plot of the most likely evolution of atmospheric oxygen levels.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEvolutionary radiations in the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Devonian periods may be linked to rises in oxygen concentration.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen levels throughout the Phanerozoic eon has been a subject of intense scientific inquiry due to its profound implications for the development of complex life on Earth. This study revisits and refines our understanding of oxygen dynamics during this crucial period, integrating recent advancements in geochemistry, paleontology, and Earth system modeling. By analyzing multiple proxy records, including carbon and sulfur isotopes, trace element distributions, and fossil evidence, we present a comprehensive reconstruction of atmospheric O2 concentrations over the past 541 million years. Our findings reveal significant fluctuations in oxygen levels, with notable peaks during the Carboniferous-Permian and Cretaceous periods, and relative lows in the early Triassic and Jurassic. These variations are closely linked to major events in Earth's history, such as the evolution of land plants, mass extinctions, and changes in global climate. Furthermore, we explore the intricate feedbacks between oxygen availability, the carbon cycle, and the evolution of animal life, providing new insights into the co-evolution of Earth's biosphere and atmosphere. This revised understanding of Phanerozoic oxygen dynamics offers critical context for interpreting the fossil record and elucidating the environmental factors that have shaped the trajectory of life on our planet.", "label": 1}
