{"grounding": "Uncertainty about sea-level rise is dominated by uncertainty about iceberg calving, mass loss from glaciers or ice sheets by fracturing. Review of the rapidly growing calving literature leads to a few overarching hypotheses. Almost all calving occurs near or just downglacier of a location where ice flows into an environment more favorable for calving, so the calving rate is controlled primarily by flow to the ice margin rather than by fracturing. Calving can be classified into five regimes, which tend to be persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations in flow velocity, ice characteristics, or environmental forcing; these regimes can be studied instrumentally. Sufficiently large perturbations may cause sometimes-rapid transitions between regimes or between calving and noncalving behavior, during which fracturing may control the rate of calving. Regime transitions underlie the largest uncertainties in sea-level rise projections, but with few, important exceptions, have not been observed instrumentally. This is especially true of the most important regime transitions for sea-level rise. Process-based models informed by studies of ongoing calving, and assimilation of deep-time paleoclimatic data, may help reduce uncertainties about regime transitions. Failure to include calving accurately in predictive models could lead to large underestimates of warming-induced sea-level rise.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIceberg calving, the breakage of ice from glaciers and ice sheets, affects sea level and many other environmental issues.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tModern rates of iceberg calving usually are controlled by the rate of ice flow past restraining points, not by the brittle calving processes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCalving can be classified into five regimes, which are persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tTransitions between calving regimes are especially important, and with warming might cause faster sea-level rise than generally projected.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Iceberg calving, the process by which ice breaks off from glaciers and ice shelves, plays a crucial role in ice-sheet stability and global sea-level rise. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of calving regimes and transitions, focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. We examine the complex interplay of factors influencing calving, including ice thickness, surface melt, ocean forcing, and basal topography. Recent observations and modeling studies have revealed distinct calving regimes, ranging from small-scale, frequent events to large, episodic collapses. These regimes are governed by the balance between driving forces and resistive stresses within the ice. We discuss how transitions between calving regimes can lead to rapid ice loss and potential tipping points in ice-sheet stability. The review highlights the importance of ice shelves in buttressing upstream ice flow and the consequences of their disintegration for overall ice-sheet mass balance. We also explore the challenges in accurately representing calving processes in ice-sheet models and the implications for projections of future sea-level rise. Recent technological advancements, including high-resolution satellite imagery and autonomous underwater vehicles, have greatly improved our ability to monitor and quantify calving events. However, significant uncertainties remain regarding the long-term evolution of calving rates under different climate scenarios. This review underscores the critical need for continued research into iceberg calving mechanisms to enhance our ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of ice-sheet mass loss on global sea levels.", "label": 1}
