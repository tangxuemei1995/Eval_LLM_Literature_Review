{"grounding": "The early to mid-Paleoproterozoic Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) is ostensibly the largest magnitude (approximately +5 to +30\u2030), longest duration (ca. 130\u2013250 million years) positive carbon isotope excursion measured in carbonate rocks in Earth history. The LJE has been attributed to large nutrient fluxes, an increase in the size of the biosphere, a reorganization of the global carbon cycle, and oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, significant debate remains about its genesis, synchroneity, global-versus-local extent, and role in atmospheric oxygenation. Here we review existing models and mechanisms suggested for the LJE and analyze a compilation of \u223c9,400 \u03b413Ccarb and associated contextual data. These data call into question the interpretation of the LJE as a globally synchronous carbon isotope excursion and suggest that any model for the LJE must account for both the absence of a clearly defined initiation and termination of the excursion and a facies-dependent expression of 13C-enrichment.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) continues to challenge current understandings of the carbon cycle.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tUnderstanding this excursion is critical for reconstructing biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric oxygenation through Earth history.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSome evidence indicates local rather than global changes in \u03b413CDIC and raises the possibility of asynchronous, local excursions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tResolving whether the LJE was globally synchronous or asynchronous is essential for discriminating between different models.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Carbon Isotope Excursion (LJCIE) represents a significant perturbation in the global carbon cycle during the Paleoproterozoic era, closely associated with the Great Oxidation Event. This study critically examines the LJCIE, synthesizing recent geological, geochemical, and isotopic data to provide a comprehensive understanding of its causes, duration, and global implications. We review evidence from sedimentary sequences worldwide, focusing on \u03b413C values in carbonate rocks, to reconstruct the temporal and spatial extent of the excursion. Our analysis suggests that the LJCIE lasted approximately 160-250 million years, with peak \u03b413C values reaching +8\u2030 to +12\u2030. We propose a multi-stage model for the excursion, involving enhanced organic carbon burial, methane cycling, and carbonate weathering. The study also explores the relationship between the LJCIE and contemporaneous environmental changes, including atmospheric oxygenation and the evolution of early eukaryotes. By deconstructing the LJCIE, we provide new insights into Precambrian Earth system dynamics and highlight the interconnectedness of biogeochemical cycles during this critical period in Earth's history.", "label": 1}
