{"grounding": "Landscapes receive water from precipitation and then transport, store, mix, and release it, both downward to streams and upward to vegetation. How they do this shapes floods, droughts, biogeochemical cycles, contaminant transport, and the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Because many of the key processes occur invisibly in the subsurface, our conceptualization of them has often relied heavily on physical intuition. In recent decades, however, much of this intuition has been overthrown by field observations and emerging measurement methods, particularly involving isotopic tracers. Here we summarize key surprises that have transformed our understanding of hydrological processes at the scale of hillslopes and drainage basins. These surprises have forced a shift in perspective from process conceptualizations that are relatively static, homogeneous, linear, and stationary to ones that are predominantly dynamic, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and nonstationary.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSurprising observations and novel measurements are transforming our understanding of the hydrological functioning of landscapes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEven during storm peaks, streamflow is composed mostly of water that has been stored in the landscape for weeks, months, or years.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tStreamflow and tree water uptake often originate from different subsurface storages and from different seasons\u2019 precipitation.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tStream networks dynamically extend and retract as the landscape wets and dries, and many stream reaches lose flow into underlying aquifers.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "This study explores unexpected findings in the hydrological functioning of landscapes, focusing on the interplay between hydrology, ecohydrology, and catchment processes. We employed a multi-faceted approach, combining field observations, isotope tracing techniques, and advanced modeling to investigate water movement and storage across various spatial scales, from hillslopes to entire catchments. Our results revealed several surprising patterns that challenge conventional understanding of runoff generation and water cycling in ecosystems. Notably, we found that subsurface flow paths were more complex and spatially variable than previously thought, with significant implications for both water quantity and quality. Isotope data indicated that vegetation played a more substantial role in modulating catchment hydrology than expected, particularly during drought conditions. Furthermore, our analysis uncovered previously unrecognized temporal dynamics in hillslope-stream connectivity, which have important consequences for predicting flood responses and managing water resources. These instructive surprises highlight the need for a paradigm shift in hydrological conceptualization and modeling approaches. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating ecohydrological processes and embracing the inherent complexity of landscape-scale water cycling to improve our understanding and management of water resources in a changing environment.", "label": 0}
