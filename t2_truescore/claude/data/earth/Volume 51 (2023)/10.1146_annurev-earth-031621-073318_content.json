{"grounding": "For the first time, from early 2019 to the end of 2022, Mars\u2019 shallow and deep interiors have been explored by seismology with the InSight mission. Thanks to the performances of its seismometers and the quality of their robotic installation on the ground, 1,319 seismic events have been detected, including about 90 marsquakes at teleseismic distances, with Mw from 2.5 to 4.7 and at least 6 impacts, the largest ones with craters larger than 130 m. A large fraction of these marsquakes occur in Cerberus Fossae, demonstrating active regional tectonics. Records of pressure-induced seismic noise and signals from the penetration of a heat flow probe have provided subsurface models below the lander. Deeper direct and secondary body wave phase travel time, receiver function, and surface wave analysis have provided the first interior models of Mars, including crustal thickness and crustal layering, mantle structure, thermal lithospheric thickness, and core radius and state.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWith InSight's SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure of Mars) experiment and for the first time in planetary exploration, Mars\u2019 internal structure and seismicity are constrained.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMore than 1,300 seismic events and seismic noise records enable the first comparative seismology studies together with Earth and lunar seismic data.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tInversion of seismic travel times and waveforms provided the first interior model of another terrestrial planet, down to the core.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSeveral impacts were also seismically recorded with their craters imaged from orbit, providing the first data on impact dynamic on Mars.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Mars seismology has emerged as a crucial tool for understanding the Red Planet's interior structure and geological activity. The InSight mission, which landed on Mars in 2018, has provided unprecedented data on Martian seismic activity through its highly sensitive seismometer. This abstract summarizes recent advancements in Mars seismology, focusing on marsquakes, impacts, and their implications for the planet's interior structure. Seismic events on Mars, primarily originating from the tectonically active Cerberus Fossae region, have been recorded and analyzed, revealing valuable information about the planet's crust, mantle, and core. Marsquakes, ranging from low to moderate magnitudes, have been detected and characterized, providing insights into the planet's current stress state and potential for ongoing geological processes. Additionally, seismic signals from meteorite impacts have been identified, offering a unique opportunity to study both the planet's interior and its impact flux. The analysis of seismic wave propagation through the Martian interior has led to refined models of the planet's layered structure, including estimates of crustal thickness, mantle composition, and core size. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of Mars' formation, evolution, and potential for past or present habitability. As more data is collected and analyzed, Mars seismology continues to play a pivotal role in unraveling the mysteries of the Red Planet's internal dynamics and geological history.", "label": 1}
