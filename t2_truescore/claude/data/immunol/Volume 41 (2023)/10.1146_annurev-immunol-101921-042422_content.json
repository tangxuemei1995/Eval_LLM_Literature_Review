{"grounding": "Autoreactive B cells and interferons are central players in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. The partial success of drugs targeting these pathways, however, supports heterogeneity in upstream mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent insights from genetic and immune monitoring studies of patients that are refining our understanding of these basic mechanisms. Among them, novel mutations in genes affecting intrinsic B cell activation or clearance of interferogenic nucleic acids have been described. Mitochondria have emerged as relevant inducers and/or amplifiers of SLE pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms that include disruption of organelle integrity or compartmentalization, defective metabolism, and failure of quality control measures. These result in extra- or intracellular release of interferogenic nucleic acids as well as in innate and/or adaptive immune cell activation. A variety of classic and novel SLE autoantibody specificities have been found to recapitulate genetic alterations associated with monogenic lupus or to trigger interferogenic amplification loops. Finally, atypical B cells and novel extrafollicular T helper cell subsets have been proposed to contribute to the generation of SLE autoantibodies. Overall, these novel insights provide opportunities to deepen the immunophenotypic surveillance of patients and open the door to patient stratification and personalized, rational approaches to therapy.", "generated_text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens. While interferon (IFN) signaling has long been recognized as a central player in SLE pathogenesis, recent research has uncovered additional mechanisms contributing to disease progression. This review explores the multifaceted nature of SLE pathogenesis, focusing on the interplay between interferon signaling, aberrant cell death processes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extrafollicular B cell responses. We discuss how dysregulated cell death, particularly in the context of impaired clearance of apoptotic debris, leads to the accumulation of nuclear antigens and subsequent autoantibody production. Furthermore, we examine the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in promoting oxidative stress and inflammation, exacerbating the autoimmune response. The review also highlights the importance of extrafollicular B cell activation in the rapid production of pathogenic autoantibodies. By integrating these diverse pathways, we provide a comprehensive overview of SLE pathogenesis, emphasizing the need for targeted therapeutic approaches that address multiple aspects of the disease process beyond interferon signaling alone.", "label": 1}
