{"grounding": "The presence of granulated lymphocytes in the human uterine mucosa, known as decidua during pregnancy, or endometrium otherwise, was first noted in the nineteenth century, but it was not until 1990 that these cells were identified as a type of natural killer (NK) cell. From the outset, uterine NK (uNK) cells were found to be less cytotoxic than their circulating counterparts, peripheral NK (pNK) cells. Recently, unbiased approaches have defined three subpopulations of uNK cells, all of which cluster separately from pNK cells. Here, we review the history of research into uNK cells, including their ability to interact with placental extravillous trophoblast cells and their potential role in regulating placental implantation. We go on to review more recent advances that focus on uNK cell development and heterogeneity and their potential to defend against infection and to mediate memory effects. Finally, we consider how a better understanding of these cells could be leveraged in the future to improve outcomes of pregnancy for mothers and babies.", "generated_text": "Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial component of the innate immune system, playing a significant role in reproductive processes within the human uterine mucosa. This review explores the unique characteristics and functions of uterine NK (uNK) cells, focusing on their interactions with trophoblasts and their presence in the decidua during pregnancy. uNK cells exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional properties compared to peripheral blood NK cells, contributing to successful implantation, placentation, and fetal development. We examine the mechanisms by which uNK cells regulate trophoblast invasion, spiral artery remodeling, and immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface. Additionally, we discuss the potential implications of uNK cell dysfunction in reproductive disorders and pregnancy complications. Understanding the complex interplay between uNK cells and other cellular components of the uterine microenvironment is essential for advancing our knowledge of reproductive immunology and developing targeted therapies for fertility-related issues.", "label": 1}
