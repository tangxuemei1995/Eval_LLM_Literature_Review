{"grounding": "Myeloid cells are a significant proportion of leukocytes within tissues, comprising granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. With the identification of various myeloid cells that perform separate but complementary functions during homeostasis and disease, our understanding of tissue myeloid cells has evolved significantly. Exciting findings from transcriptomics profiling and fate-mapping mouse models have facilitated the identification of their developmental origins, maturation, and tissue-specific specializations. This review highlights the current understanding of tissue myeloid cells and the contributing factors of functional heterogeneity to better comprehend the complex and dynamic immune interactions within the healthy or inflamed tissue. Specifically, we discuss the new understanding of the contributions of granulocyte-monocyte progenitor\u2013derived phagocytes to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity as well as the impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function. Lastly, we explore the developing paradigm of myeloid cell heterogeneity during inflammation and disease.", "generated_text": "Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) are crucial precursors of myeloid cells, including monocytes and neutrophils. This review explores the origin, heterogeneity, and tissue-specific adaptations of GMP-derived myeloid cells. We examine recent fate-mapping studies that have shed light on the developmental trajectories of these cells, from their bone marrow origins to their diverse tissue-resident forms. The role of niche-specific factors in shaping myeloid cell phenotypes and functions is discussed, highlighting the remarkable plasticity of these cells. We also address the concept of tissue reprogramming, where local environmental cues can dramatically alter the characteristics of infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils. Understanding these processes is essential for unraveling the complexities of tissue-specific immune responses and developing targeted therapeutic strategies for various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.", "label": 1}
