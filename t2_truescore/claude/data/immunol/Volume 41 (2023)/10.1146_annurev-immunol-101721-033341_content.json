{"grounding": "Our defenses against infection rely on the ability of the immune system to distinguish invading pathogens from self. This task is exceptionally challenging, if not seemingly impossible, in the case of retroviruses that have integrated almost seamlessly into the host. This review examines the limits of innate and adaptive immune responses elicited by endogenous retroviruses and other retroelements, the targets of immune recognition, and the consequences for host health and disease. Contrary to theoretical expectation, endogenous retroelements retain substantial immunogenicity, which manifests most profoundly when their epigenetic repression is compromised, contributing to autoinflammatory and autoimmune disease and age-related inflammation. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that regulated immune reactivity to endogenous retroelements is integral to immune system development and function, underpinning cancer immunosurveillance, resistance to infection, and responses to the microbiota. Elucidation of the interaction points with endogenous retroelements will therefore deepen our understanding of immune system function and contribution to disease.", "generated_text": "Endogenous retroelements, including endogenous retroviruses, represent a significant portion of the human genome and pose a unique challenge to the immune system. This review explores the complex interplay between these ancient viral remnants and host immunity. We examine how endogenous retroelements can trigger innate immune responses, particularly through interferon signaling pathways, while simultaneously evading complete elimination. The role of adaptive immunity in controlling retroelement expression is discussed, highlighting the delicate balance between tolerance and autoimmunity. Recent findings suggest that some endogenous retroelements may have been co-opted for beneficial functions in host defense. Understanding these intricate relationships is crucial for unraveling the evolutionary history of the human genome and may provide insights into autoimmune disorders, cancer, and novel therapeutic approaches. This review synthesizes current knowledge and identifies key areas for future research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
