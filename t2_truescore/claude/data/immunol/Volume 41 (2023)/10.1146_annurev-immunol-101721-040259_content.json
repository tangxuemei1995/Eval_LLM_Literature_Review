{"grounding": "Modulation of the immune system is an important therapeutic strategy in a wide range of diseases, and is fundamental to the development of vaccines. However, optimally safe and effective immunotherapy requires precision in the delivery of stimulatory cues to the right cells at the right place and time, to avoid toxic overstimulation in healthy tissues or incorrect programming of the immune response. To this end, biomaterials are being developed to control the location, dose, and timing of vaccines and immunotherapies. Here we discuss fundamental concepts of how biomaterials are used to enhance immune modulation, and evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of how biomaterials-mediated immune engineering can impact the development of new therapeutics. We focus on immunological mechanisms of action and in vivo modulation of the immune system, and we also discuss challenges to be overcome to speed translation of these technologies to the clinic.", "generated_text": "The field of biomaterials-mediated immune engineering has emerged as a promising approach to enhance immunotherapy and vaccine efficacy. This review explores recent advancements in the design and application of biomaterials for modulating immune responses. We discuss the role of nanoparticles as vaccine adjuvants, highlighting their ability to improve antigen delivery and presentation. The review also examines the use of biomaterials in creating artificial lymphoid organs and engineering the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-cancer immune responses. Furthermore, we analyze the potential of biomaterials in developing personalized immunotherapies and overcoming immune tolerance. The integration of biomaterials with emerging technologies, such as gene editing and artificial intelligence, is explored as a means to further advance the field. Finally, we address the challenges and future directions in translating biomaterials-based immunoengineering strategies from bench to bedside.", "label": 1}
