{"grounding": "The innate immune system detects pathogens via germline-encoded receptors that bind to conserved pathogen ligands called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Here we consider an additional strategy of pathogen sensing called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI involves detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors, also called effectors. Pathogens produce effectors to manipulate hosts to create a replicative niche and/or block host immunity. Unlike PAMPs, effectors are often diverse and rapidly evolving and can thus be unsuitable targets for direct detection by germline-encoded receptors. Effectors are instead often sensed indirectly via detection of their virulence activities. ETI is a viable strategy for pathogen sensing and is used across diverse phyla, including plants, but the molecular mechanisms of ETI are complex compared to simple receptor/ligand-based PAMP detection. Here we survey the mechanisms and functions of ETI, with a particular focus on emerging insights from animal studies. We suggest that many examples of ETI may remain to be discovered, hiding in plain sight throughout immunology.", "generated_text": "Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is a crucial component of plant innate immunity, representing a sophisticated defense mechanism against pathogenic invaders. This review explores the intricate interplay between ETI and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the context of plant-pathogen interactions. We discuss how ETI evolved as a secondary line of defense, complementing PAMP-triggered immunity, and its role in recognizing pathogen virulence factors. The concept of guard immunity is examined, highlighting how plants monitor the integrity of their own cellular components to detect pathogen interference. We also delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying ETI activation, including the recognition of effectors by plant resistance proteins and the subsequent signaling cascades. Furthermore, we address the evolutionary arms race between plants and pathogens, emphasizing the dynamic nature of ETI and its implications for crop protection strategies. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex world of plant immunity and its potential applications in agriculture.", "label": 1}
