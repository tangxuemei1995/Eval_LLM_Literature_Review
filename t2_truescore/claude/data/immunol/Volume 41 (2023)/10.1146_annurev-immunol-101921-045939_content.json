{"grounding": "Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a key cytokine regulating the development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death of T cells. In CD4+ T cells, TGF-\u03b2 maintains the quiescence and controls the activation of naive T cells. While inhibiting the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells. TGF-\u03b2 is required for the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells and the development of regulatory T cells. TGF-\u03b2 is crucial in the differentiation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells and their retention in the tissue, whereas it suppresses effector T cell function. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 also regulates the generation or function of natural killer T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes. Here I highlight the major findings and recent advances in our understanding of TGF-\u03b2 regulation of T cells and provide a personal perspective of the field.", "generated_text": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) plays a crucial role in regulating various T cell subsets, including CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. This review explores the multifaceted effects of TGF-\u03b2 on T cell quiescence, activation, differentiation, and function. We discuss how TGF-\u03b2 influences the balance between effector and regulatory T cell populations, modulates the development and maintenance of tissue-resident T cells, and impacts the innate-like functions of ILCs and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Furthermore, we examine the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-\u03b2 signaling in different T cell subsets and its implications for immune homeostasis and disease. Understanding the complex interplay between TGF-\u03b2 and T cells provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune disorders, cancer immunotherapy, and infectious diseases.", "label": 1}
