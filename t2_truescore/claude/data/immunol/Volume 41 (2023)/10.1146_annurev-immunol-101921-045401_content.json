{"grounding": "Characterization of RNA modifications has identified their distribution features and molecular functions. Dynamic changes in RNA modification on various forms of RNA are essential for the development and function of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the value of innovative RNA modification profiling technologies to uncover the function of these diverse, dynamic RNA modifications in various immune cells within healthy and diseased contexts. Further, we explore our current understanding of the mechanisms whereby aberrant RNA modifications modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment and point out outstanding research questions.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), play crucial roles in shaping the epitranscriptome and regulating immune responses. This review explores the impact of RNA modifications on antiviral and antitumor immunity, focusing on their functions in immune cell development, activation, and effector mechanisms. We discuss how m6A and other modifications influence the tumor microenvironment and modulate immune cell interactions. Understanding these epitranscriptomic changes provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for enhancing immune responses against viral infections and cancer. The emerging field of RNA modification in immunology offers promising avenues for developing novel immunomodulatory strategies and improving existing immunotherapies.", "label": 1}
