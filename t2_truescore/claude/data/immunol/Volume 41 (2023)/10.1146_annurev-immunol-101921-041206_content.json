{"grounding": "Type 2 immunity mediates protective responses to helminths and pathological responses to allergens, but it also has broad roles in the maintenance of tissue integrity, including wound repair. Type 2 cytokines are known to promote fibrosis, an overzealous repair response, but their contribution to healthy wound repair is less well understood. This review discusses the evidence that the canonical type 2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, are integral to the tissue repair process through two main pathways. First, essential for the progression of effective tissue repair, IL-4 and IL-13 suppress the initial inflammatory response to injury. Second, these cytokines regulate how the extracellular matrix is modified, broken down, and rebuilt for effective repair. IL-4 and/or IL-13 amplifies multiple aspects of the tissue repair response, but many of these pathways are highly redundant and can be induced by other signals. Therefore, the exact contribution of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling remains difficult to unravel.", "generated_text": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key cytokines in type 2 immune responses, playing crucial roles in wound repair and tissue regeneration. This review explores the multifaceted functions of IL-4 and IL-13 in regulating inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and tissue repair processes. We discuss their involvement in the orchestration of immune responses to tissue injury and helminth infections, highlighting the evolutionary significance of these pathways. The review examines the cellular sources of IL-4 and IL-13, their signaling mechanisms, and downstream effects on various cell types involved in wound healing. Additionally, we analyze the potential therapeutic applications of modulating IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in chronic wounds, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions characterized by dysregulated tissue repair. Understanding the intricate roles of these cytokines in wound repair may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for promoting optimal tissue regeneration and preventing excessive scarring.", "label": 1}
