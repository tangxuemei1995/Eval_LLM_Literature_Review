{"grounding": "T cells and natural killer (NK) cells have complementary roles in tumor immunity, and dual T cell and NK cell attack thus offers opportunities to deepen the impact of immunotherapy. Recent work has also shown that NK cells play an important role in recruiting dendritic cells to tumors and thus enhance induction of CD8 T cell responses, while IL-2 secreted by T cells activates NK cells. Targeting of immune evasion mechanisms from the activating NKG2D receptor and its MICA and MICB ligands on tumor cells offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, T cells and NK cells share several important inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance T cell\u2013 and NK cell\u2013mediated immunity. These inhibitory receptor-ligand systems include CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E. We also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies based on inhibitory and activating cytokines that profoundly impact the function of both lymphocyte populations within tumors.", "generated_text": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in oncology, with T cells and natural killer (NK) cells playing crucial roles in tumor elimination. This review explores innovative strategies for designing immunotherapies that effectively engage both T cells and NK cells to enhance anti-tumor responses. We discuss recent advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and NK cell-based treatments, highlighting their synergistic potential. The review examines novel approaches to overcome immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and improve cell persistence and functionality. Additionally, we analyze combination therapies that leverage the distinct mechanisms of T cells and NK cells to achieve more robust and durable clinical outcomes. By integrating these cell types, researchers aim to develop more potent and versatile cancer immunotherapies, potentially revolutionizing treatment options for various malignancies.", "label": 1}
