{"grounding": "Immunity to infection has been extensively studied in humans and mice bearing naturally occurring or experimentally introduced germline mutations. Mouse studies are sometimes neglected by human immunologists, on the basis that mice are not humans and the infections studied are experimental and not natural. Conversely, human studies are sometimes neglected by mouse immunologists, on the basis of the uncontrolled conditions of study and small numbers of patients. However, both sides would agree that the infectious phenotypes of patients with inborn errors of immunity often differ from those of the corresponding mutant mice. Why is that? We argue that this important question is best addressed by revisiting and reinterpreting the findings of both mouse and human studies from a genetic perspective. Greater caution is required for reverse-genetics studies than for forward-genetics studies, but genetic analysis is sufficiently strong to define the studies likely to stand the test of time. Genetically robust mouse and human studies can provide invaluable complementary insights into the mechanisms of immunity to infection common and specific to these two species.", "generated_text": "The study of infectious diseases and immunodeficiency has long relied on both mouse models and human genetic studies. This review explores the convergence of mouse and human immunology through the lens of genetics, focusing on genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases and inborn errors of immunity. We examine how advances in genetic technologies have enabled the identification of key immune pathways and susceptibility factors in both species. By comparing and contrasting findings from mouse models and human genetic studies, we highlight the complementary nature of these approaches in elucidating the complex interplay between host genetics and pathogen interactions. We discuss the challenges and limitations of translating mouse immunology findings to human disease, as well as the potential of reverse genetics to validate human discoveries in mouse models. Finally, we propose strategies for integrating mouse and human genetic data to accelerate the development of targeted therapies for infectious diseases and immunodeficiencies, emphasizing the importance of a unified approach in advancing our understanding of immune system function and dysfunction.", "label": 1}
