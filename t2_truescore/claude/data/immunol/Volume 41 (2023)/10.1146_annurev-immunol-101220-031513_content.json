{"grounding": "Over the last decade, immunometabolism has emerged as a novel interdisciplinary field of research and yielded significant fundamental insights into the regulation of immune responses. Multiple classical approaches to interrogate immunometabolism, including bulk metabolic profiling and analysis of metabolic regulator expression, paved the way to appreciating the physiological complexity of immunometabolic regulation in vivo. Studying immunometabolism at the systems level raised the need to transition towards the next-generation technology for metabolic profiling and analysis. Spatially resolved metabolic imaging and computational algorithms for multi-modal data integration are new approaches to connecting metabolism and immunity. In this review, we discuss recent studies that highlight the complex physiological interplay between immune responses and metabolism and give an overview of technological developments that bear the promise of capturing this complexity most directly and comprehensively.", "generated_text": "Systems immunology approaches have revolutionized our understanding of the complex interplay between the immune system and metabolism. This review explores the integration of computational biology, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metabolic imaging techniques to unravel the intricacies of immunometabolism. We discuss how these cutting-edge methodologies have enabled researchers to map metabolic networks, identify key regulatory pathways, and elucidate the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells during various physiological and pathological states. The application of machine learning algorithms and multi-omics data integration has provided unprecedented insights into the metabolic signatures of immune cell subsets and their functional states. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of these systems-level approaches in developing novel therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated diseases and cancer immunotherapy. This comprehensive overview underscores the transformative impact of systems immunology on our understanding of metabolic regulation in immune responses.", "label": 1}
