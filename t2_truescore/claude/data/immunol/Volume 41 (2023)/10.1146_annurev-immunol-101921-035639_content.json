{"grounding": "The complement system is an ancient collection of proteolytic cascades with well-described roles in regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. With the convergence of a revolution in complement-directed clinical therapeutics, the discovery of specific complement-associated targetable pathways in the central nervous system, and the development of integrated multi-omic technologies that have all emerged over the last 15 years, precision therapeutic targeting in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases and processes appears to be within reach. As a sensor of tissue distress, the complement system protects the brain from microbial challenge as well as the accumulation of dead and/or damaged molecules and cells. Additional more recently discovered diverse functions of complement make it of paramount importance to design complement-directed neurotherapeutics such that the beneficial roles in neurodevelopment, adult neural plasticity, and neuroprotective functions of the complement system are retained.", "generated_text": "The complement system, traditionally associated with innate immunity, has emerged as a crucial player in brain function and pathology. This review explores the multifaceted roles of complement proteins, particularly C1q, in the central nervous system. We discuss their involvement in neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation, highlighting the complex interplay between complement components and microglia. The review examines the critical role of complement in synaptic pruning during development and its potential dysregulation in neurodegenerative disorders, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease. We analyze recent findings that shed light on the dual nature of complement activation in the brain, emphasizing its importance in maintaining homeostasis and its potential contribution to neuroinflammatory processes. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the intricate balance of complement function in the brain and its implications for therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders.", "label": 1}
