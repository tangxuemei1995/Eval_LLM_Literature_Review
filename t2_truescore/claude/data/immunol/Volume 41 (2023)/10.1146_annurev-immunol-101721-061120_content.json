{"grounding": "A large body of evidence generated in the last two and a half years addresses the roles of T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and following vaccination. Infection or vaccination induces multi-epitope CD4 and CD8 T cell responses with polyfunctionality. Early T cell responses have been associated with mild COVID-19 outcomes. In concert with animal model data, these results suggest that while antibody responses are key to prevent infection, T cell responses may also play valuable roles in reducing disease severity and controlling infection. T cell memory after vaccination is sustained for at least six months. While neutralizing antibody responses are impacted by SARS-CoV-2 variants, most CD4 and CD8 T cell responses are preserved. This review highlights the extensive progress made, and the data and knowledge gaps that remain, in our understanding of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines.", "generated_text": "This study investigates T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the context of COVID-19 infection and vaccination. We examined T cell reactivity against various viral epitopes in patients with different disease severities and vaccinated individuals. Our findings reveal that T cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and are largely preserved across multiple variants. We observed that individuals with severe COVID-19 exhibited impaired T cell functionality compared to those with mild disease. Vaccination induced robust and durable T cell responses, which were effective against emerging variants. Additionally, we identified key epitopes that elicit strong T cell responses, providing valuable insights for future vaccine development. Our results highlight the importance of T cell immunity in COVID-19 and suggest that current vaccines offer protection against severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants through T cell-mediated mechanisms.", "label": 0}
