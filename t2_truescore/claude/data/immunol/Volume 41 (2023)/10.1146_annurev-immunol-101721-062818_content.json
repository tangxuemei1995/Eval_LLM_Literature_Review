{"grounding": "The epithelial tissues that line our body, such as the skin and gut, have remarkable regenerative prowess and continually renew throughout our lifetimes. Owing to their barrier function, these tissues have also evolved sophisticated repair mechanisms to swiftly heal and limit the penetration of harmful agents following injury. Researchers now appreciate that epithelial regeneration and repair are not autonomous processes but rely on a dynamic cross talk with immunity. A wealth of clinical and experimental data point to the functional coupling of reparative and inflammatory responses as two sides of the same coin. Here we bring to the fore the immunological signals that underlie homeostatic epithelial regeneration and restitution following damage. We review our current understanding of how immune cells contribute to distinct phases of repair. When unchecked, immune-mediated repair programs are co-opted to fuel epithelial pathologies such as cancer, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, understanding the reparative functions of immunity may advance therapeutic innovation in regenerative medicine and epithelial inflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between the immune system and epithelial tissues plays a crucial role in tissue regeneration and repair. This review explores the complex mechanisms underlying immune-epithelial cross talk and its implications for inflammatory diseases and tissue homeostasis. We examine how various immune cell populations, including macrophages, T cells, and innate lymphoid cells, interact with epithelial stem cells to orchestrate regenerative processes. The role of cytokines, growth factors, and other signaling molecules in mediating this communication is discussed. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the local microenvironment and extracellular matrix in shaping immune responses and epithelial cell behavior. Understanding these interactions provides valuable insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for enhancing tissue repair and treating inflammatory disorders. This review synthesizes recent advances in the field and identifies key areas for future research to further elucidate the complex relationship between immunity and epithelial regeneration.", "label": 1}
