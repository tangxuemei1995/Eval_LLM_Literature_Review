{"grounding": "As an important sensor in the innate immune system, NLRP3 detects exogenous pathogenic invasions and endogenous cellular damage and responds by forming the NLRP3 inflammasome, a supramolecular complex that activates caspase-1. The three major components of the NLRP3 inflammasome are NLRP3, which captures the danger signals and recruits downstream molecules; caspase-1, which elicits maturation of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and processing of gasdermin D to mediate cytokine release and pyroptosis; and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), which functions as a bridge connecting NLRP3 and caspase-1. In this article, we review the structural information that has been obtained on the NLRP3 inflammasome and its components or subcomplexes, with special focus on the inactive NLRP3 cage, the active NLRP3-NEK7 (NIMA-related kinase 7)-ASC inflammasome disk, and the PYD-PYD and CARD-CARD homotypic filamentous scaffolds of the inflammasome. We further implicate structure-derived mechanisms for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "generated_text": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system, playing a key role in the inflammatory response. This review explores the structural mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical studies have provided unprecedented insights into the intricate molecular interactions involved in this process. We discuss the conformational changes of NLRP3 upon activation, the formation of ASC filaments, and the recruitment and activation of caspase-1. The review highlights the importance of protein-protein interactions, oligomerization, and structural rearrangements in the formation of the active inflammasome complex. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies for inflammatory disorders and may provide new avenues for modulating innate immune responses. We also address the remaining questions and future directions in elucidating the complete structural basis of NLRP3 inflammasome function.", "label": 1}
