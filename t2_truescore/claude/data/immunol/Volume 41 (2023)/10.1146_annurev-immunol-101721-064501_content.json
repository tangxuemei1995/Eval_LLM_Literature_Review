{"grounding": "There is a dramatic remodeling of the T cell compartment during aging. The most notorious changes are the reduction of the naive T cell pool and the accumulation of memory-like T cells. Memory-like T cells in older people acquire a phenotype of terminally differentiated cells, lose the expression of costimulatory molecules, and acquire properties of senescent cells. In this review, we focus on the different subsets of age-associated T cells that accumulate during aging. These subsets include extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer properties, exhausted T cells with altered cytokine production, and regulatory T cells that gain proinflammatory features. Importantly, all of these subsets lose their lymph node homing capacity and migrate preferentially to nonlymphoid tissues, where they contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of highly differentiated T cell subsets in age-related tissue deterioration. As the immune system ages, a process known as immunosenescence occurs, characterized by thymic involution and accumulation of senescent T cells. We examined the phenotypic and functional changes in T cell populations across different age groups and tissues. Our findings reveal an increase in terminally differentiated T cells with age, particularly in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. These cells exhibit reduced proliferative capacity, altered cytokine profiles, and enhanced pro-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the accumulation of these T cell subsets and markers of tissue inflammation and dysfunction. Our results suggest that extremely differentiated T cells contribute significantly to the chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging, potentially driving tissue deterioration and age-related pathologies.", "label": 1}
