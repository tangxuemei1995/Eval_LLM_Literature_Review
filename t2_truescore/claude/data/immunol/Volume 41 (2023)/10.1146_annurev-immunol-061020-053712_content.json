{"grounding": "The evolution of IgE in mammals added an extra layer of immune protection at body surfaces to provide a rapid and local response against antigens from the environment. The IgE immune response employs potent expulsive and inflammatory forces against local antigen provocation, at the risk of damaging host tissues and causing allergic disease. Two well-known IgE receptors, the high-affinity Fc\u03b5RI and low-affinity CD23, mediate the activities of IgE. Unlike other known antibody receptors, CD23 also regulates IgE expression, maintaining IgE homeostasis. This mechanism evolved by adapting the function of the complement receptor CD21. Recent insights into the dynamic character of IgE structure, its resultant capacity for allosteric modulation, and the potential for ligand-induced dissociation have revealed previously unappreciated mechanisms for regulation of IgE and IgE complexes. We describe recent research, highlighting structural studies of the IgE network of proteins to analyze the uniquely versatile activities of IgE and anti-IgE biologics.", "generated_text": "This review explores the structural and functional aspects of immunoglobulin E (IgE), its receptors Fc\u03b5RI and CD23, and anti-IgE biologics in the context of allergic responses. We examine the unique structural features of IgE that contribute to its high-affinity binding to Fc\u03b5RI and the lower-affinity interaction with CD23. The allosteric mechanisms governing these interactions are discussed, highlighting their role in modulating IgE-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, we analyze the protein structures and mechanisms of action of anti-IgE biologics, such as omalizumab, which have revolutionized the treatment of allergic diseases. By inhibiting IgE binding to its receptors, these therapeutics effectively suppress allergic cascades. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the molecular basis of IgE-mediated allergic reactions and the rational design of novel anti-allergy treatments targeting the IgE-receptor axis.", "label": 1}
