{"grounding": "Market interest rates reflect the preferences of market participants. When market participants are missing, the average discount rate in the population may therefore differ from the market rate. Missing current market participants, such as constrained borrowers, tends to imply an average discount rate that is above the market rate, whereas missing future market participants, such as future generations, tends to imply an average rate below the market rate. Nonetheless, a government with the ability to transfer wealth intratemporally across agents will generally wish to use the market interest rate as a guide to policy. One robust argument for the use of a lower social discount rate is intrapersonal: Future selves discount the past, whereas current selves discount the future. Legacy utility may also justify a low social discount rate.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of missing participants and markets on the social discount rate, focusing on borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates these factors into a comprehensive model of social discounting. Our analysis reveals that incomplete markets and the exclusion of future generations from current decision-making processes significantly affect the appropriate social discount rate. We find that altruistic motives and the desire to leave a legacy partially mitigate the effects of missing markets, but borrowing constraints continue to play a crucial role. The study demonstrates that accounting for these factors leads to a lower social discount rate than traditionally assumed, with important implications for long-term policy decisions, particularly in areas such as climate change mitigation and infrastructure investment.", "label": 0}
