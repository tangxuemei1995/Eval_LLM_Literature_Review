{"grounding": "Most Western countries use a single discount rate to evaluate public investments and policies. This ignores the differential cost of risk, in a world where most risk markets exhibit surprisingly large prices of risk. The current discounting guidelines generate a misallocation of capital that entails a large welfare cost. We claim that the well-established asset pricing literature provides a strong normative justification in favor of risk-adjusting discount rates. More specifically, project-specific discount rates should be increasing in the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. This will favor projects whose net benefit materializes preferentially in low-income states, thereby recognizing their insurance benefit ex ante. The intuition is simple, the welfare benefit of the reform is large, and the methodology only requires evaluators to estimate an income elasticity on top of what is required in the current approach. It is time to fix our public discounting systems.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the current state of public discounting systems and proposes reforms to enhance their effectiveness in policy decision-making. We analyze the shortcomings of existing approaches to discounting, risk adjustment, and carbon pricing in cost-benefit analysis. Our research synthesizes insights from economics, environmental science, and public policy to develop a more robust framework for evaluating long-term public investments. We argue that current discounting practices often undervalue future benefits and risks, particularly in the context of climate change mitigation. The paper presents a novel approach that integrates dynamic risk assessment and adaptive carbon pricing mechanisms into traditional discounting models. Our findings suggest that adopting this refined methodology could significantly improve the accuracy and fairness of public project evaluations, leading to more sustainable and equitable policy outcomes across generations.", "label": 0}
