{"grounding": "After two decades of low initial public offering (IPO) activity and a number of regulatory changes, the number of IPOs of both operating companies and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) boomed in the United States in 2021 before collapsing in 2022. In recent years, surging valuations have resulted in many private companies achieving \u201cunicorn\u201d status, a valuation of $1 billion or more, partly fueled by investments from mutual funds. Many of the unicorns that have gone public have done so with dual-class share structures. We compare three alternative mechanisms for going public, including traditional IPOs, mergers with SPACs, and direct listings. The most common exit for successful venture capital\u2013backed companies, however, continues to be by merging with a larger company.", "generated_text": "This study examines recent developments in initial public offerings (IPOs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) as alternative paths to going public. We analyze trends in unicorn valuations, confidential filing practices, and the rise of direct listings. The research explores the increasing popularity of SPACs as a means for private companies to access public markets, highlighting their advantages and potential risks. Additionally, we investigate the prevalence of dual-class share structures in recent IPOs and their impact on corporate governance. Our findings reveal shifting preferences among companies and investors, regulatory changes affecting the IPO landscape, and the evolving dynamics between traditional IPOs and emerging alternatives. This study contributes to the understanding of contemporary capital markets and provides insights for companies considering various options for going public.", "label": 1}
