{"grounding": "Open-end mutual funds offer investors same-day liquidity while holding assets that in some cases take several days to sell. This liquidity transformation creates a potentially destabilizing first-mover advantage: When asset prices fall, investors who exit a fund earlier may pass the liquidation costs generated by their share redemptions to investors who remain in the fund. This incentive becomes particularly acute in periods of market stress, and it can amplify fire-sale spillover losses to other market participants. Swing pricing is a liquidity management tool that targets this first-mover advantage. It allows a fund to adjust or \u201cswing\u201d its net asset value in response to large flows out of or into a mutual fund. This article discusses the industry and regulatory context for swing pricing, and it reviews theory and empirical evidence on the design and effectiveness of swing pricing. The article concludes with directions for further research.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the effectiveness of swing pricing as a tool for managing liquidity risks in mutual funds. We develop a theoretical model that captures the trade-offs between protecting existing shareholders and maintaining fund attractiveness. Using a comprehensive dataset of European mutual funds, we empirically test the model's predictions. Our findings suggest that swing pricing significantly reduces the likelihood of fire sales during periods of market stress and mitigates the first-mover advantage in redemptions. We observe that funds employing swing pricing exhibit lower flow-performance sensitivity and experience less severe outflows during market downturns. Additionally, we find evidence of improved fund performance and reduced liquidity-driven trading costs. Our results contribute to the ongoing debate on mutual fund liquidity management and provide valuable insights for regulators and fund managers considering the implementation of swing pricing mechanisms.", "label": 1}
