{"grounding": "This review revisits the literature on fiscal capacity using modern tools from asset pricing. We find that properly accounting for aggregate risk substantially reduces fiscal capacity. In this environment, the gap between the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate is not a sufficient statistic for fiscal capacity. To borrow at the risk-free rate when aggregate growth is risky, governments need to ask taxpayers to insure bondholders against aggregate risk, but governments in advanced economies tend to insure taxpayers against aggregate risk. We use this asset pricing perspective to review alternative mechanisms to boost fiscal capacity that have been explored in the literature.", "generated_text": "This paper examines fiscal capacity through an asset pricing lens, offering novel insights into the relationship between fiscal policy, term structure, and debt maturity. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates the concept of convenience yield into the analysis of government debt management. Our model demonstrates how fiscal capacity influences the term structure of interest rates and optimal debt maturity choices. Empirical evidence from a panel of advanced economies supports our theoretical predictions, showing that countries with higher fiscal capacity exhibit lower term premia and tend to issue longer-term debt. These findings have important implications for policymakers, highlighting the role of fiscal strength in shaping debt management strategies and market perceptions of sovereign risk.", "label": 0}
