{"grounding": "This survey discusses the state of the art in research in racetrack and lottery investment markets. Market efficiency and the pricing of various wagers are studied along with new developments since the Thaler & Ziemba (1988) review. The weak form inefficient market pricing approach using stochastic programming optimization models changed racetrack betting from handicapping to a financial market allowing professional syndicates to operate as hedge funds. Topics discussed include arbitrage and risk arbitrage, syndicates, betting exchange rebates, behavioral biases, and fundamental and mispricing information in racetrack and lottery markets. Similar models can be used to successfully trade stock market anomalies. \nSupplemental Materials\n are included online.", "generated_text": "This study revisits pari-mutuel betting markets, focusing on racetracks and lotteries. We examine the efficiency of racetrack betting markets and explore the persistent favorite-longshot bias. Using stochastic programming optimization models, we analyze betting strategies and their implications for market efficiency. Our research extends to lottery markets, investigating similarities and differences with racetrack betting. We find that while both markets exhibit some inefficiencies, they differ in their underlying mechanisms and participant behaviors. The study contributes to the understanding of decision-making under uncertainty in these unique financial markets and provides insights into potential arbitrage opportunities. Our findings have implications for regulators, market participants, and researchers in the field of behavioral finance.", "label": 1}
