{"grounding": "Discounting of deferred impacts of government policies is a long-established practice that has been the target of substantial litigation and continued philosophical debate. Legal challenges to the social rate of discount have resulted in general acceptance of the principle of discounting at a nonzero rate for both monetary and nonmonetary impacts. Courts have displayed a general familiarity with discounting and often require transparent justification for the selection of the discount rate based on established scientific principles. The philosophical issues are more wide-ranging and include whether nonmonetary impacts should be discounted, the use of the opportunity cost of capital or the social rate of time preference, the time frame that is pertinent for setting the discount rate, and determination of whose preferences should have standing. Intergenerational issues are particularly challenging, raising questions regarding which generation's preferences should be recognized, the potential for dynamic inconsistencies arising from preferential discount rates, and intertemporal inequities. Benefit-cost analyses that include appropriate recognition of benefits and costs for future generations serve a constructive function in providing a mechanism for recognizing future effects on social welfare.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the legal and philosophical foundations of the social discount rate, a crucial parameter in benefit-cost analysis for long-term public projects and policies. We explore the intertemporal and intergenerational implications of discounting, analyzing how different discount rates affect the valuation of future costs and benefits. The study reviews key legal precedents and philosophical arguments surrounding the choice of an appropriate social rate of discount, considering ethical concerns about intergenerational equity and the time preferences of society. We investigate the tension between economic efficiency and moral obligations to future generations, discussing various approaches to reconciling these competing interests. The paper also evaluates the practical challenges of implementing different discounting methodologies in policy-making and judicial contexts. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced and context-specific approach to social discounting, one that balances economic considerations with ethical imperatives and accounts for the unique characteristics of long-term public investments and environmental policies.", "label": 1}
