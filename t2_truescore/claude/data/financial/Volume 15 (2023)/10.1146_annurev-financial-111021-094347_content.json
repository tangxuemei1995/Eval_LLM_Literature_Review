{"grounding": "Is shareholder interest in corporate social responsibility driven by pecuniary motives (abnormal rates of return) or nonpecuniary ones (willingness to sacrifice returns to address various firm externalities)? To answer this question, we summarize the literature by focusing on seven tests: (a) costs of capital, (b) performance of portfolios, (c) ownership by types of institutions, (d) surveys and experiments, (e) managerial motives, (f) shareholder proposals, and (g) firm inclusion in responsibility indices. These tests predominantly indicate that shareholders are driven by nonpecuniary motives. To stimulate further research on welfare implications for global warming, we assess whether estimates of the foregone returns for shareholders willing to reduce carbon emissions (or \u201cgreeniums\u201d), along with the wealth pledged to firms that become sustainable, are consistent with the growth of aggregate investments in the decarbonization sector.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolving landscape of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the context of sustainable finance and corporate decarbonization efforts. We analyze the impact of externalities on corporate decision-making and the emergence of responsible shareholder mandates. The research investigates the growing phenomenon of 'greeniums' - premium valuations for environmentally responsible companies - and their influence on corporate behavior. Our findings suggest that CSR initiatives, particularly those focused on decarbonization, are increasingly driven by market forces and shareholder expectations. We observe a shift towards more sustainable business practices, with companies internalizing previously overlooked externalities. This study contributes to the understanding of how CSR is reshaping corporate strategies and financial markets, highlighting the complex interplay between environmental concerns, shareholder activism, and corporate performance in the era of sustainable finance.", "label": 1}
