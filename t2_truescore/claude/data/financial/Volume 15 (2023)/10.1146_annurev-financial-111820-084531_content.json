{"grounding": "Governments allocate a large share of real and financial capital globally, and their choices of discount rates for project and policy evaluation have a first-order effect on social welfare. The importance of adopting a principles-based approach to selecting discount rates has new urgency in light of the very long horizons over which the benefits and costs of policies to address climate change are being evaluated. The four articles in this theme provide an interpretive overview of the literature on many of the theoretical, practical, legal, and philosophical considerations for discount rate selection by governments. This introduction summarizes the main points of each article and highlights some of the common threads that emerge. These include the importance of using risk-adjusted rates, the problems that arise when discount rates are chosen to be artificially low, and the large disconnect between common government practices and the principles of financial economics.", "generated_text": "This paper introduces the ARFE theme on the social discount rate, a crucial concept in government valuation and public investment decision-making. The social discount rate plays a pivotal role in assessing long-term projects, particularly those with intergenerational impacts such as climate change mitigation. We explore the theoretical foundations and practical applications of the social discount rate, highlighting its significance in determining the cost of carbon and evaluating intergenerational trade-offs. The paper examines various approaches to estimating the social discount rate, including the social opportunity cost and social time preference methods. Additionally, we discuss the ethical considerations and challenges associated with choosing an appropriate discount rate for public policy analysis. This introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the social discount rate's implications for sustainable development and intergenerational equity in public investment decisions.", "label": 1}
