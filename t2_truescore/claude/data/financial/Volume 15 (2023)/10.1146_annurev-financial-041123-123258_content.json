{"grounding": "The principles of financial economics provide equally important insights into the optimal choice of discount rates for both public and private sector decision-makers. However, most governments largely ignore those principles, taking their cost of capital for most purposes as their borrowing rate. This article reviews the arguments often made in support of status quo discounting practices, along with the counterarguments to them. Governments have a choice between several methodologies for risk adjustment, and the practical and conceptual reasons that favor a fair value approach are recapped. The limitations of a financial economics approach become apparent for decisions involving very long time horizons, such as for climate policies. For policies with long-term impacts, intergenerational concerns become paramount, projections of cash flows and discount rates become highly uncertain, and present value calculations are an intrinsically unreliable measure of value. No approach to discount rate selection can overcome those problems; alternative decision criteria need to be established. However, most government investments involve much shorter horizons, and the adoption of standard approaches to risk adjustment could significantly improve social welfare.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the application of financial economics principles to the determination of the social discount rate used in government decision-making. While financial economics provides valuable insights into market valuation and risk assessment, its direct application to social discounting faces significant limitations. We argue that the unique nature of government investments, intergenerational considerations, and the presence of market imperfections necessitate a more nuanced approach. The paper explores the tensions between fair value accounting and budgetary accounting in the public sector, highlighting the challenges in reconciling these perspectives with social welfare maximization. Furthermore, we analyze the concept of government cost of capital and its relationship to the social discount rate, emphasizing the need to consider broader societal impacts and long-term consequences. Our findings suggest that while financial economics offers important tools and frameworks, policymakers must exercise caution in their application and supplement them with ethical considerations and social welfare analysis when determining appropriate social discount rates for public projects.", "label": 1}
