{"grounding": "Unfunded public pension obligations represent the largest liability for state and local governments in the United States. As of fiscal year 2021, the total reported unfunded liabilities of these plans are $1.076 trillion. In contrast, the market value of the unfunded liability is approximately $6.501 trillion. As a result, the reported funding ratio of 82.5% falls to 43.8% under a market-based valuation. The market values reflect the fact that accrued pension promises are a form of government debt with strong statutory and contractual rights. The assumed discount rates are based on expected returns and remain elevated relative to risk-free rates, despite a decline since 2014. As a result, not only is the unfunded pension liability understated, but the yearly pension cost for newly accruing liabilities is also understated. In order to achieve high returns, pension funds have accumulated large exposure to risky assets, in particular alternative investments, which results in highly uncertain investment returns.", "generated_text": "This study examines recent trends in state and local pension funds across the United States, focusing on their financial health, policy changes, and implications for government budgets. Analyzing data from 2010 to 2020, we investigate the evolving landscape of public pensions, including funding ratios, investment strategies, and reform efforts. Our findings reveal a mixed picture, with some jurisdictions making progress in addressing unfunded liabilities while others continue to struggle. We observe a shift towards more conservative investment assumptions and increased employee contributions in many systems. Additionally, we explore the impact of demographic changes and economic factors on pension costs and government debt. This research highlights the ongoing challenges faced by state and local governments in balancing retirement promises with fiscal sustainability, and offers insights into potential policy solutions for the future of public pension systems.", "label": 0}
