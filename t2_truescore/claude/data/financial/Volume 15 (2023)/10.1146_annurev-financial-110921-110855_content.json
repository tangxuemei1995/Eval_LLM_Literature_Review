{"grounding": "The purpose of this article is to review the literature on inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives. The methodology for valuation and risk management of these securities is an application of the foreign currency extension of a standard HJM term structure model. The two \u201ccurrencies\u201d in the extended model are real and nominal prices. Currently, for their use in monetary policy, the empirical literature primarily uses these models to estimate both the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium. A literature investigating the efficiency of the inflation derivative markets and a comparison of the relevant valuation models is almost nonexistent and a fruitful area for future research.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the pricing and hedging of inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework. We develop a comprehensive model for the term structure of interest rates and break-even inflation rates, incorporating both nominal and real yield curves. Our analysis focuses on the dynamics of inflation-indexed securities and their relationship to conventional fixed-income instruments. We derive closed-form solutions for various inflation derivatives and explore the implications for risk management and portfolio optimization. The model is calibrated using market data, and its performance is evaluated through empirical tests. Our findings contribute to the understanding of inflation-linked financial products and provide practical insights for investors and policymakers in managing inflation risk.", "label": 0}
