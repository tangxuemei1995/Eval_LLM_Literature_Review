{"grounding": "From the first clinical trial by Dr. W.F. Anderson to the most recent US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics, 2017) and Zolgensma (Novartis, 2019), gene therapy has revamped thinking and practice around cancer treatment and improved survival rates for adult and pediatric patients with genetic diseases. A major challenge to advancing gene therapies for a broader array of applications lies in safely delivering nucleic acids to their intended sites of action. Peptides offer unique potential to improve nucleic acid delivery based on their versatile and tunable interactions with biomolecules and cells. Cell-penetrating peptides and intracellular targeting peptides have received particular focus due to their promise for improving the delivery of gene therapies into cells. We highlight key examples of peptide-assisted, targeted gene delivery to cancer-specific signatures involved in tumor growth and subcellular organelle\u2013targeting peptides, as well as emerging strategies to enhance peptide stability and bioavailability that will support long-term implementation.", "generated_text": "Peptide-based vectors have emerged as a promising biomolecular engineering strategy for gene delivery, offering a versatile and efficient approach to overcome cellular barriers. This review explores the design and application of intracellular targeting peptides for the delivery of various nucleic acid cargoes, including silencing RNA (siRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and oligonucleotides. We discuss the key challenges in gene delivery, such as cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and highlight how peptide-based vectors address these obstacles. Recent advancements in peptide engineering for enhanced stability, specificity, and transfection efficiency are examined. Additionally, we review the progress of peptide-based gene delivery systems in clinical trials, focusing on their potential for therapeutic applications. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the current state of peptide-based vectors and their future prospects in advancing gene therapy and nucleic acid-based treatments.", "label": 1}
