{"grounding": "Active colloids use energy input at the particle level to propel persistent motion and direct dynamic assemblies. We consider three types of colloids animated by chemical reactions, time-varying magnetic fields, and electric currents. For each type, we review the basic propulsion mechanisms at the particle level and discuss their consequences for collective behaviors in particle ensembles. These microscopic systems provide useful experimental models of nonequilibrium many-body physics in which dissipative currents break time-reversal symmetry. Freed from the constraints of thermodynamic equilibrium, active colloids assemble to form materials that move, reconfigure, heal, and adapt. Colloidal machines based on engineered particles and their assemblies provide a basis for mobile robots with increasing levels of autonomy. This review provides a conceptual framework for understanding and applying active colloids to create material systems that mimic the functions of living matter. We highlight opportunities for chemical engineers to contribute to this growing field.", "generated_text": "Active colloids represent a fascinating class of nonequilibrium systems that exhibit self-propelled motion and collective behavior. This review explores the multifaceted roles of active colloids as models for understanding fundamental principles of nonequilibrium physics, as novel materials with unique properties, and as potential microscale machines. We discuss recent advances in the design and fabrication of active colloidal particles, their propulsion mechanisms, and emergent collective phenomena in active colloidal assemblies. The review highlights how these systems serve as experimental platforms for studying active matter physics, including phase transitions, pattern formation, and self-organization. Furthermore, we examine the potential applications of active colloids in materials science, drug delivery, and microfluidics. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in the field, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of active colloidal research and its implications for diverse scientific domains.", "label": 1}
