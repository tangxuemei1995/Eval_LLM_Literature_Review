{"grounding": "Are deep eutectic solvents (DESs) a promising alternative to conventional solvents? Perhaps, but their development is hindered by a plethora of misconceptions. These are carefully analyzed here, beginning with the very meaning of DESs, which has strayed far beyond its original scope of eutectic mixtures of Lewis or Br\u00f8nsted acids and bases. Instead, a definition that is grounded on thermodynamic principles and distinguishes between eutectic and deep eutectic is encouraged, and the types of precursors that can be used to prepare DESs are reviewed. Landmark works surrounding the sustainability, stability, toxicity, and biodegradability of these solvents are also discussed, revealing piling evidence that numerous DESs reported thus far, particularly those that are choline based, lack sufficient sustainability-related traits to be considered green solvents. Finally, emerging DES applications are reviewed, emphasizing their most remarkable feature: the ability to liquefy a solid compound with a target property, allowing its use as a liquid solvent.", "generated_text": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a promising class of green solvents, attracting significant attention in various fields of chemistry and engineering. This review provides a comprehensive overview of DESs, exploring their fundamental properties, preparation methods, and diverse applications. We delve into the underlying principles of solid-liquid equilibrium and hydrogen bonding that govern DES formation, emphasizing the crucial role of melting temperature depression in eutectic mixtures. The review critically examines the advantages of DESs over conventional solvents, including their low toxicity, biodegradability, and tunable physicochemical properties. Furthermore, we discuss recent advancements in DES research, highlighting their potential in areas such as extraction, catalysis, and materials synthesis. By addressing common misconceptions and providing clarity on key concepts, this review aims to demystify DESs and encourage their wider adoption in sustainable chemical processes.", "label": 1}
