{"grounding": "Oxidative stress is an important and pervasive physical stress encountered by all kingdoms of life, including bacteria. In this review, we briefly describe the nature of oxidative stress, highlight well-characterized protein-based sensors (transcription factors) of reactive oxygen species that serve as standards for molecular sensors in oxidative stress, and describe molecular studies that have explored the potential of direct RNA sensitivity to oxidative stress. Finally, we describe the gaps in knowledge of RNA sensors\u2014particularly regarding the chemical modification of RNA nucleobases. RNA sensors are poised to emerge as an essential layer of understanding and regulating dynamic biological pathways in oxidative stress responses in bacteria and, thus, also represent an important frontier of synthetic biology.", "generated_text": "Oxidative stress poses a significant challenge to bacterial survival, necessitating rapid and efficient stress response mechanisms. This review explores the emerging role of RNAs as sensors of oxidative stress in bacteria. We discuss how specific RNA structures and sequences can directly detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and trigger protective responses. The mechanisms of RNA oxidation and its impact on gene expression are examined, highlighting the potential for RNA-based sensors in synthetic biology applications. We also consider the evolutionary implications of RNA-mediated stress sensing and its integration with other bacterial stress response pathways. This research provides insights into the complex interplay between RNA biology and oxidative stress, offering new perspectives on bacterial adaptation and potential targets for antimicrobial strategies.", "label": 1}
