{"grounding": "Drying drops of colloidal dispersions have attracted attention from researchers since the nineteenth century. The multiscale nature of the problem involving physics at different scales, namely colloidal and interfacial phenomena as well as heat, mass, and momentum transport processes, combined with the seemingly simple yet nontrivial shape of the drops makes drying drop problems rich and interesting. The scope of such studies widens as the physical and chemical nature of dispersed entities in the drop vary and as evaporation occurs in more complex configurations. This review summarizes past and contemporary developments in the field, emphasizing the physicochemical and hydrodynamical principles that govern the processes occurring within a drying drop and the resulting variety of patterns generated on the substrate.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intricate dynamics of drying colloidal dispersions in sessile drops. We examine the complex interplay between evaporative patterns, evaporation-driven flows, and particle interactions that govern the final deposit morphology. The study encompasses various aspects of drying in complex fluids and configurations, highlighting the influence of substrate properties, environmental conditions, and particle characteristics on the drying process. We discuss recent advances in understanding and controlling the coffee-ring effect, as well as strategies for achieving uniform deposits. The review also addresses the challenges and opportunities in applying these insights to practical applications, such as inkjet printing and biosensing. By synthesizing current knowledge, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the field and identify promising directions for future research.", "label": 1}
