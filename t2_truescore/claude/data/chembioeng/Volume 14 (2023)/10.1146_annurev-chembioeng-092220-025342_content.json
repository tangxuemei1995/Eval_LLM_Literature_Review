{"grounding": "Thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures are important in many fields of science and engineering. However, experimental data are scarce in this field, so prediction methods are vital. Different types of physical prediction methods are available, ranging from molecular models over equations of state to models of excess properties. These well-established methods are currently being complemented by new methods from the field of machine learning (ML). This review focuses on the rapidly developing interface between these two approaches and gives a structured overview of how physical modeling and ML can be combined to yield hybrid models. We illustrate the different options with examples from recent research and give an outlook on future developments.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of machine learning techniques with traditional physical models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of thermodynamic modeling for fluid mixtures. By combining data-driven approaches with established thermodynamic principles, we develop a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of both methodologies. The proposed framework incorporates machine learning algorithms to capture complex non-linear relationships and physical constraints to ensure consistency with fundamental laws. We demonstrate the model's performance on various fluid mixture systems, comparing results with conventional equation of state models. Our findings indicate that this hybrid approach significantly improves predictive capabilities while maintaining physical interpretability. This research contributes to the advancement of thermodynamic modeling techniques and offers potential applications in process design, optimization, and simulation across multiple industries.", "label": 0}
