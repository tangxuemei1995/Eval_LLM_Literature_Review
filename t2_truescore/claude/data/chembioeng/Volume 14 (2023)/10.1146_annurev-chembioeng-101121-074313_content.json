{"grounding": "In the past two decades, we have witnessed a rapid emergence of new and powerful photochemical and photocatalytic synthetic methods. Although these methods have been used mostly on a small scale, there is a growing need for efficient scale-up of photochemistry in the chemical industry. This review summarizes and contextualizes the advancements made in the past decade regarding the scale-up of photo-mediated synthetic transformations. Simple scale-up concepts and important fundamental photochemical laws have been provided along with a discussion concerning suitable reactor designs that should facilitate scale-up of this challenging class of organic reactions.", "generated_text": "This review explores strategies for scaling up photochemical reactions from laboratory to industrial production. We examine two primary approaches: numbering up and sizing up. Numbering up involves replicating small-scale reactors, while sizing up entails increasing reactor dimensions. The advantages and challenges of each method are discussed, with emphasis on maintaining reaction efficiency and product quality. Flow chemistry is highlighted as a promising technique for photochemical scale-up, offering improved light penetration and heat transfer. We also address key considerations in reactor design, light source selection, and process optimization. This comprehensive analysis aims to guide researchers and industry professionals in developing efficient, large-scale photochemical processes.", "label": 1}
