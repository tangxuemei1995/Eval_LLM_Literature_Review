{"grounding": "There is growing interest in identifying antibodies that protect against infectious diseases, especially for high-risk individuals and pathogens for which no vaccine is yet available. However, pathogens that manifest as opportunistic or latent infections express complex arrays of virulence-associated proteins and are adept at avoiding immune responses. Some pathogens have developed strategies to selectively destroy antibodies, whereas others create decoy epitopes that trick the host immune system into generating antibodies that are at best nonprotective and at worst enhance pathogenesis. Antibody engineering strategies can thwart these efforts by accessing conserved neutralizing epitopes, generating Fc domains that resist capture or degradation and even accessing pathogens hidden inside cells. Design of pathogen-resistant antibodies can enhance protection and guide development of vaccine immunogens against these complex pathogens. Here, we discuss general strategies for design of antibodies resistant to specific pathogen defense mechanisms.", "generated_text": "Passive immunization with antibodies offers a powerful approach to combat pathogens, complementing traditional vaccines. However, many pathogens have evolved sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms, challenging the efficacy of conventional antibody therapies. This review explores recent advances in antibody engineering to outsmart these evasive pathogens. We discuss innovative strategies such as Fc engineering to enhance effector functions, bispecific antibodies targeting multiple epitopes simultaneously, and antibody-drug conjugates for precise delivery of therapeutic payloads. These approaches show promise in overcoming immune evasion tactics and improving the potency of passive immunization. Additionally, we examine how these engineered antibodies can be leveraged to develop more effective vaccines. By harnessing the potential of antibody engineering, researchers are paving the way for next-generation therapies capable of outmaneuvering even the most elusive pathogens.", "label": 1}
