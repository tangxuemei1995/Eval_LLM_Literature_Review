{"grounding": "Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) continue to experience chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which drives the persistence of latent HIV and prevalence of clinical comorbidities. Elucidating the mechanisms that lead to suboptimal immunity is necessary for developing therapeutics that improve the quality of life of PLWH. Although previous studies have found associations between gut dysbiosis and immune dysfunction, the cellular/molecular cascades implicated in the manifestation of aberrant immune responses downstream of microbial perturbations in PLWH are incompletely understood. Recent literature has highlighted that two abundant metabolite families, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), play a crucial role in shaping immunity. These metabolites can be produced and/or modified by bacterial species that make up the gut microbiota and may serve as the causal link between changes to the gut microbiome, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction in PLWH. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the role of the microbiome on HIV acquisition and latent HIV persistence despite ART. Further, we describe cellular/molecular cascades downstream of SCFAs and BAs that drive innate or adaptive immune responses responsible for promoting latent HIV persistence in PLWH. This knowledge can be used to advance HIV cure efforts.", "generated_text": "The human microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating immune homeostasis and inflammation, with potential implications for HIV persistence. This review explores the intricate relationships between the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and their impact on immune function and viral persistence in HIV-infected individuals. We examine how dysbiosis in the gut microbiome contributes to chronic immune activation and inflammation, which are hallmarks of HIV infection. The production of SCFAs by commensal bacteria is discussed, highlighting their immunomodulatory effects and potential to mitigate HIV-associated inflammation. Additionally, we investigate the role of bile acids in shaping the microbiome and influencing immune responses. The review also addresses how alterations in microbial metabolites may contribute to HIV persistence by affecting T cell function and viral reservoir dynamics. Understanding these complex interactions provides insights into novel therapeutic approaches for managing HIV-related immune dysfunction and reducing viral persistence. By targeting the microbiome, SCFAs, and bile acid metabolism, future interventions may offer promising strategies to improve immune function, reduce inflammation, and potentially impact HIV cure efforts.", "label": 1}
