{"grounding": "The mammalian gastrointestinal tract (GIT) hosts a diverse and highly active microbiota composed of bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses. Studies of the GIT microbiota date back more than a century, although modern techniques, including mouse models, sequencing technology, and novel therapeutics in humans, have been foundational to our understanding of the roles of commensal microbes in health and disease. Here, we review the impacts of the GIT microbiota on viral infection, both within the GIT and systemically. GIT-associated microbes and their metabolites alter the course of viral infection through a variety of mechanisms, including direct interactions with virions, alteration of the GIT landscape, and extensive regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Mechanistic understanding of the full breadth of interactions between the GIT microbiota and the host is still lacking in many ways but will be vital for the development of novel therapeutics for viral and nonviral diseases alike.", "generated_text": "The complex interplay between the human microbiota and viral infections has emerged as a critical area of research in recent years. This review explores the multifaceted impact of the microbiota on viral pathogenesis, immune responses, and disease outcomes. We examine how commensal bacteria and their metabolites modulate host antiviral defenses, particularly through the regulation of interferon signaling pathways. Additionally, we discuss the role of the virome in shaping the broader microbiome and its implications for human health. The review highlights recent advances in understanding how alterations in microbial communities can influence susceptibility to viral infections and the severity of associated diseases. Furthermore, we explore potential therapeutic strategies that leverage microbiota manipulation to enhance antiviral immunity and improve clinical outcomes. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of considering the microbiota in the context of viral infections and opens new avenues for innovative treatment approaches.", "label": 1}
