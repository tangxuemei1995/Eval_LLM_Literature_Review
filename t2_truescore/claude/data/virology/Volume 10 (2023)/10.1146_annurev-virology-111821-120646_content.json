{"grounding": "Protein synthesis by the ribosome is the final stage of biological information transfer and represents an irreversible commitment to gene expression. Accurate translation of messenger RNA is therefore essential to all life, and spontaneous errors by the translational machinery are highly infrequent (\u223c1/100,000 codons). Programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121PRF) is a mechanism in which the elongating ribosome is induced at high frequency to slip backward by one nucleotide at a defined position and to continue translation in the new reading frame. This is exploited as a translational regulation strategy by hundreds of RNA viruses, which rely on \u22121PRF during genome translation to control the stoichiometry of viral proteins. While early investigations of \u22121PRF focused on virological and biochemical aspects, the application of X-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and the advent of deep sequencing and single-molecule approaches have revealed unexpected structural diversity and mechanistic complexity. Molecular players from several model systems have now been characterized in detail, both in isolation and, more recently, in the context of the elongating ribosome. Here we provide a summary of recent advances and discuss to what extent a general model for \u22121PRF remains a useful way of thinking.", "generated_text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a crucial mechanism employed by many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, to regulate gene expression and maximize their coding capacity. This review synthesizes recent structural and functional insights into viral PRF, focusing on the interplay between ribosomes, mRNA secondary structures, and trans-acting factors. High-resolution cryo-EM structures have revealed the intricate molecular interactions that occur during frameshifting, particularly the role of RNA pseudoknots in creating mechanical tension on the mRNA. We discuss how these structures, combined with single-molecule studies, have enhanced our understanding of the kinetics and energetics of the frameshifting process. Additionally, we explore the potential of targeting PRF as an antiviral strategy, highlighting recent advances in small molecule inhibitors and RNA-based therapeutics. The conservation of PRF across diverse viral families underscores its importance as a regulatory mechanism and its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral target. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on viral PRF and outlines future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
