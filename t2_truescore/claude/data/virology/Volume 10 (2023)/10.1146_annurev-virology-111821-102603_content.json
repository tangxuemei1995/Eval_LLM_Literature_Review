{"grounding": "The nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs), also known as the order Mononegavirales, have a genome consisting of a single strand of negative-sense RNA. Integral to the nsNSV replication cycle is the viral polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing the viral genome, to produce an array of capped and polyadenylated messenger RNAs, and replicating it to produce new genomes. To perform the different steps that are necessary for these processes, the nsNSV polymerases undergo a series of coordinated conformational transitions. While much is still to be learned regarding the intersection of nsNSV polymerase dynamics, structure, and function, recently published polymerase structures, combined with a history of biochemical and molecular biology studies, have provided new insights into how nsNSV polymerases function as dynamic machines. In this review, we consider each of the steps involved in nsNSV transcription and replication and suggest how these relate to solved polymerase structures.", "generated_text": "This review explores the structural and mechanistic aspects of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) from nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses within the order Mononegavirales. We focus on recent advancements in understanding the RdRps of paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, pneumoviruses, and rhabdoviruses. Through comparative analysis of high-resolution structures and biochemical studies, we elucidate the conserved and unique features of these viral polymerases. The review highlights the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying RNA synthesis, including initiation, elongation, and termination processes. We also discuss the interactions between RdRps and other viral proteins, as well as host factors that modulate polymerase activity. Understanding these structures and mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted antiviral therapies and provides insights into the evolutionary relationships among Mononegavirales. This comprehensive overview serves as a foundation for future research on negative-strand RNA virus polymerases and their potential as therapeutic targets.", "label": 0}
