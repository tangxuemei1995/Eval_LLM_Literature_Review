{"grounding": "Negative-stranded RNA viruses are a large group of viruses that encode their genomes in RNA across multiple segments in an orientation antisense to messenger RNA. Their members infect broad ranges of hosts, and there are a number of notable human pathogens. Here, we examine the development of reverse genetic systems as applied to these virus families, emphasizing conserved approaches illustrated by some of the prominent members that cause significant human disease. We also describe the utility of their genetic systems in the development of reporter strains of the viruses and some biological insights made possible by their use. To conclude the review, we highlight some possible future uses of reporter viruses that not only will increase our basic understanding of how these viruses replicate and cause disease but also could inform the development of new approaches to therapeutically intervene.", "generated_text": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses pose significant threats to human health, with influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) being notable examples. This review explores the genetic systems of these viruses and highlights the development and applications of reporter strains. Fluorescent and bioluminescent strains have revolutionized our understanding of viral replication, pathogenesis, and host-pathogen interactions. These engineered viruses enable real-time tracking of infection dynamics, assessment of antiviral efficacy, and high-throughput screening for novel therapeutics. We discuss the challenges and strategies in generating stable reporter strains while maintaining viral fitness. Additionally, we examine how these tools have advanced our knowledge of virus-host interactions and their potential in vaccine development. This review underscores the importance of reporter strains in advancing both basic and translational research on segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses.", "label": 1}
