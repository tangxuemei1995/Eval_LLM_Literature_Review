{"grounding": "N- and O-glycans are both important constituents of viral envelope glycoproteins. O-linked glycosylation can be initiated by any of 20 different human polypeptide O-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases, resulting in an important functional O-glycan heterogeneity. O-glycans are organized as solitary glycans or in clusters of multiple glycans forming mucin-like domains. They are functional both in the viral life cycle and in viral colonization of their host. Negatively charged O-glycans are crucial for the interactions between glycosaminoglycan-binding viruses and their host. A novel mechanism, based on controlled electrostatic repulsion, explains how such viruses solve the conflict between optimized viral attachment to target cells and efficient egress of progeny virus. Conserved solitary O-glycans appear important for viral uptake in target cells by contributing to viral envelope fusion. Dual roles of viral O-glycans in the host B cell immune response, either epitope blocking or epitope promoting, may be exploitable for vaccine development. Finally, specific virus-induced O-glycans may be involved in viremic spread.", "generated_text": "O-linked glycosylation plays a crucial role in the structure and function of viral envelope proteins. This review explores the significance of mucin-like domains and their interactions with host cell receptors, focusing on heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. We examine how O-linked glycans contribute to viral attachment, entry, and egress processes. The structural characteristics of these glycans and their impact on virion stability and immune evasion are discussed. Furthermore, we analyze the potential of O-linked glycans as targets for vaccine development and antiviral therapies. Recent advances in glycobiology techniques have provided new insights into the complex interplay between viral glycoproteins and host cell factors. Understanding the structure and role of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins is essential for developing effective strategies to combat viral infections and improve vaccine design.", "label": 1}
