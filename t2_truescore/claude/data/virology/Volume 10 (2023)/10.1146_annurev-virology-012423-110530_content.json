{"grounding": "The global rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and the waning efficacy of antibiotics urge consideration of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Phage therapy is a classic approach where bacteriophages (bacteria-specific viruses) are used against bacterial infections, with many recent successes in personalized medicine treatment of intractable infections. However, a perpetual challenge for developing generalized phage therapy is the expectation that viruses will exert selection for target bacteria to deploy defenses against virus attack, causing evolution of phage resistance during patient treatment. Here we review the two main complementary strategies for mitigating bacterial resistance in phage therapy: minimizing the ability for bacterial populations to evolve phage resistance and driving (steering) evolution of phage-resistant bacteria toward clinically favorable outcomes. We discuss future research directions that might further address the phage-resistance problem, to foster widespread development and deployment of therapeutic phage strategies that outsmart evolved bacterial resistance in clinical settings.", "generated_text": "The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has sparked renewed interest in phage therapy as an alternative treatment. However, the rapid evolution of phage-resistant bacteria poses a significant challenge to this approach. This study explores innovative strategies to develop phage therapy that can overcome bacterial resistance mechanisms. By leveraging evolutionary trade-offs, we designed a novel phage cocktail that targets multiple bacterial receptors simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces the emergence of phage-resistant strains while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, we investigated the potential of engineered phages to exploit fitness costs associated with resistance development. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we show that these strategies can effectively combat bacterial infections, even in cases where conventional antibiotics fail. This research provides valuable insights into the development of sustainable phage therapy solutions that can address the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.", "label": 1}
