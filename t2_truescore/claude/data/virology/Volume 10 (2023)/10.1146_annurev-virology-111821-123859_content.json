{"grounding": "Humans have battled viruses for millennia. However, directly linking the symptomatology of disease outbreaks to specific viral pathogens was not possible until the twentieth century. With the advent of the genomic era and the development of advanced protocols for isolation, sequencing, and analysis of ancient nucleic acids from diverse human remains, the identification and characterization of ancient viruses became feasible. Recent studies have provided invaluable information about past epidemics and made it possible to examine assumptions and inferences on the origin and evolution of certain viral families. In parallel, the study of ancient viruses also uncovered their importance in the evolution of the human lineage and their key roles in shaping major events in human history. In this review, we describe the strategies used for the study of ancient viruses, along with their limitations, and provide a detailed account of what past viral infections have revealed about human history.", "generated_text": "Paleovirology, the study of ancient viral genomes, has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding human history and past epidemics. This review explores the latest advancements in ancient DNA (aDNA) extraction and sequencing techniques, which have enabled researchers to recover and analyze viral genetic material from archaeological remains. By examining ancient viruses preserved in human tissues, bones, and dental calculus, scientists can reconstruct historical epidemics, track viral evolution, and gain insights into past human-pathogen interactions. The integration of paleogenomics with historical records and archaeological evidence provides a multidisciplinary approach to unraveling the complex relationship between viruses and human populations throughout history. This research not only sheds light on past epidemics but also offers valuable insights into the long-term coevolution of viruses and humans, potentially informing our understanding of modern viral diseases and their impact on human societies.", "label": 1}
