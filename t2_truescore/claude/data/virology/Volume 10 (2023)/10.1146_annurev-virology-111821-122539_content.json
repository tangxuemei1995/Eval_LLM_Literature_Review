{"grounding": "The large genetic and structural divergences between plants and fungi may hinder the transmission of viruses between these two kingdoms to some extent. However, recent accumulating evidence from virus phylogenetic analyses and the discovery of naturally occurring virus cross-infection suggest the occurrence of past and current transmissions of viruses between plants and plant-associated fungi. Moreover, artificial virus inoculation experiments showed that diverse plant viruses can multiply in fungi and vice versa. Thus, virus cross-infection between plants and fungi may play an important role in the spread, emergence, and evolution of both plant and fungal viruses and facilitate the interaction between them. In this review, we summarize current knowledge related to cross-kingdom virus infection in plants and fungi and further discuss the relevance of this new virological topic in the context of understanding virus spread and transmission in nature as well as developing control strategies for crop plant diseases.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the intriguing phenomenon of cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses, exploring their potential for extracellular transfer and biocontrol applications. We examine the mechanisms of virus transmission across plant and fungal hosts, focusing on the molecular and cellular factors that facilitate these interactions. Our research reveals novel pathways for virus-virus interactions and identifies key proteins involved in cross-kingdom infection. We demonstrate that certain plant viruses can successfully infect fungal species, and vice versa, challenging traditional host-specificity paradigms. These findings have significant implications for understanding virus evolution, ecological dynamics, and the development of innovative biocontrol strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the potential risks and benefits of harnessing these cross-kingdom interactions for agricultural and biotechnological applications, providing a comprehensive framework for future research in this emerging field.", "label": 0}
