{"grounding": "Bacteriophages are enigmatic entities that defy definition. Classically, they are specialist viruses that exclusively parasitize bacterial hosts. Yet this definition becomes limiting when we consider their ubiquity in the body coupled with their vast capacity to directly interact with the mammalian host. While phages certainly do not infect nor replicate within mammalian cells, they do interact with and gain unfettered access to the eukaryotic cell structure. With the growing appreciation for the human virome, coupled with our increased application of phages to patients within clinical settings, the potential impact of phage-mammalian interactions is progressively recognized. In this review, we provide a detailed mechanistic overview of how phages interact with the mammalian cell surface, the processes through which said phages are internalized by the cell, and the intracellular processing and fate of the phages. We then summarize the current state-of-the-field with respect to phage-mammalian interactions and their associations with health and disease states.", "generated_text": "Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, are ubiquitous in the environment and play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities. However, their interactions with mammalian cells remain poorly understood. This review explores the intricate processes by which mammalian cells internalize, traffic, and respond to bacteriophages. We examine the mechanisms of phage endocytosis, intracellular trafficking pathways, and the potential impacts on cellular functions. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of phage-mammalian cell interactions on innate immunity and inflammation, highlighting the emerging concept of the 'virome' in human health. Understanding these processes is essential for elucidating the complex relationships between bacteriophages, their bacterial hosts, and mammalian cells in various physiological and pathological contexts. This knowledge may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches and shed light on the broader ecological significance of bacteriophages in mammalian biology.", "label": 1}
