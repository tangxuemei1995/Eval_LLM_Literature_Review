{"grounding": "Phase separation of viral biopolymers is a key factor in the formation of cytoplasmic viral inclusions, known as sites of virus replication and assembly. This review describes the mechanisms and factors that affect phase separation in viral replication and identifies potential areas for future research. Drawing inspiration from studies on cellular RNA-rich condensates, we compare the hierarchical coassembly of ribosomal RNAs and proteins in the nucleolus to the coordinated coassembly of viral RNAs and proteins taking place within viral factories in viruses containing segmented RNA genomes. We highlight the common characteristics of biomolecular condensates in viral replication and how this new understanding is reshaping our views of virus assembly mechanisms. Such studies have the potential to uncover unexplored antiviral strategies targeting these phase-separated states.", "generated_text": "Biomolecular condensates have emerged as crucial players in cellular organization and function. This review explores the intersection of viral biology and phase transitions, focusing on how viruses exploit and manipulate condensates during their life cycles. We examine the formation of viral factories and viroplasms, with particular emphasis on segmented RNA viruses like rotaviruses. These structures serve as hubs for viral replication and assembly, highlighting the importance of phase separation in viral propagation. By analyzing the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-induced condensate formation, we gain insights into both viral strategies and fundamental principles of biomolecular condensation. This understanding not only advances our knowledge of virus-host interactions but also opens new avenues for antiviral therapies targeting phase transition processes.", "label": 1}
