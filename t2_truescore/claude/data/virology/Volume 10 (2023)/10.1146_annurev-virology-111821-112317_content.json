{"grounding": "Enteric viruses display intricate adaptations to the host mucosal immune system to successfully reproduce in the gastrointestinal tract and cause maladies ranging from gastroenteritis to life-threatening disease upon extraintestinal dissemination. However, many viral infections are asymptomatic, and their presence in the gut is associated with an altered immune landscape that can be beneficial or adverse in certain contexts. Genetic variation in the host and environmental factors including the bacterial microbiota influence how the immune system responds to infections in a remarkably viral strain\u2013specific manner. This immune response, in turn, determines whether a given virus establishes acute versus chronic infection, which may have long-lasting consequences such as susceptibility to inflammatory disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interaction between enteric viruses and the immune system that underlie the impact of these ubiquitous infectious agents on our health.", "generated_text": "Enteric viruses, key components of the human virome, play a crucial role in modulating host immune responses within the intestinal environment. This review explores the complex interactions between enteric viruses, particularly norovirus, and the host immune system. We examine the mechanisms by which these viruses evade immune detection, manipulate innate and adaptive immune responses, and establish persistent infections. The impact of enteric viruses on intestinal homeostasis and their potential contribution to gastrointestinal disorders are discussed. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in understanding the immunomodulatory effects of the enteric virome as a whole, emphasizing its influence on both local and systemic immunity. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the intricate relationship between enteric viruses and host immunity, offering potential avenues for therapeutic interventions and vaccine development strategies against these prevalent pathogens.", "label": 1}
