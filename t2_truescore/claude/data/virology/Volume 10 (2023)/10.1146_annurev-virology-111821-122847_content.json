{"grounding": "Plant viruses of the genus Tobamovirus cause significant economic losses in various crops. The emergence of new tobamoviruses such as the tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) poses a major threat to global agriculture. Upon infection, plants mount a complex immune response to restrict virus replication and spread, involving a multilayered defense system that includes defense hormones, RNA silencing, and immune receptors. To counter these defenses, tobamoviruses have evolved various strategies to evade or suppress the different immune pathways. Understanding the interactions between tobamoviruses and the plant immune pathways is crucial for the development of effective control measures and genetic resistance to these viruses. In this review, we discuss past and current knowledge of the intricate relationship between tobamoviruses and host immunity. We use this knowledge to understand the emergence of ToBRFV and discuss potential approaches for the development of new resistance strategies to cope with emerging tobamoviruses.", "generated_text": "Tobamoviruses, exemplified by the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), continue to challenge plant immunity systems worldwide. This review explores the intricate interplay between tobamoviruses and plant defense mechanisms, focusing on pattern-triggered immunity, resistance genes, RNA silencing, and salicylic acid-mediated responses. We examine how these viruses evolve to overcome host defenses and discuss the latest breakthroughs in understanding plant-tobamovirus interactions. Special attention is given to the emerging threat of ToBRFV and its impact on global agriculture. By synthesizing recent findings, we highlight potential strategies for developing durable resistance against tobamoviruses in economically important crops. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the ongoing arms race between tobamoviruses and plant immunity, paving the way for innovative approaches in crop protection and viral disease management.", "label": 1}
