{"grounding": "Understanding the factors that shape viral evolution is critical for developing effective antiviral strategies, accurately predicting viral evolution, and preventing pandemics. One fundamental determinant of viral evolution is the interplay between viral protein biophysics and the host machineries that regulate protein folding and quality control. Most adaptive mutations in viruses are biophysically deleterious, resulting in a viral protein product with folding defects. In cells, protein folding is assisted by a dynamic system of chaperones and quality control processes known as the proteostasis network. Host proteostasis networks can determine the fates of viral proteins with biophysical defects, either by assisting with folding or by targeting them for degradation. In this review, we discuss and analyze new discoveries revealing that host proteostasis factors can profoundly shape the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins. We also discuss the many opportunities for research progress proffered by the proteostasis perspective on viral evolution and adaptation.", "generated_text": "Viral evolution is a complex process influenced by various host factors, including proteostasis networks. This review explores how host protein folding biophysics, stress responses, and quality control mechanisms shape viral adaptation. We examine the role of chaperones in facilitating viral protein folding and assembly, as well as their impact on viral replication and pathogenesis. The interplay between viral proteins and host proteostasis machinery is discussed, highlighting how viruses manipulate these systems to promote their survival and propagation. Additionally, we investigate how proteostasis networks contribute to viral resistance against drugs and immune responses. Understanding these interactions provides insights into viral evolution and adaptation strategies, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches. By elucidating the intricate relationship between viral evolution and host proteostasis, this review aims to advance our comprehension of viral pathogenesis and inform future antiviral strategies.", "label": 1}
