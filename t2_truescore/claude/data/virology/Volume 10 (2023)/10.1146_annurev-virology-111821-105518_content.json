{"grounding": "Nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids across the intact nuclear envelope is an exceptional vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic translocation resulting in the delivery of herpesvirus capsids into the cytosol. Budding of the (nucleo)capsid at and scission from the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC) resulting in a transiently enveloped virus particle in the perinuclear space followed by fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The dimeric NEC oligomerizes into a honeycomb-shaped coat underlining the INM to induce membrane curvature and scission. Mutational analyses complemented structural data defining functionally important regions. Questions remain, including where and when the NEC is formed and how membrane curvature is mediated, vesicle formation is regulated, and directionality is secured. The composition of the primary enveloped virion and the machinery mediating fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM is still debated. While NEC-mediated budding apparently follows a highly conserved mechanism, species and/or cell type\u2013specific differences complicate understanding of later steps.", "generated_text": "Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies virus, employ a unique nuclear egress mechanism to escape the host cell nucleus. This process involves the formation of a nuclear egress complex (NEC) and the generation of primary enveloped virions (PEVs). While significant progress has been made in understanding this intricate process, many aspects remain elusive. This review synthesizes current knowledge on herpesvirus nuclear egress, focusing on the structure and function of the NEC, the mechanisms of PEV formation, and the subsequent nuclear membrane fusion events. We highlight recent advances in structural biology and live-cell imaging techniques that have provided unprecedented insights into these processes. Additionally, we discuss the remaining gaps in our understanding, including the precise molecular mechanisms of membrane deformation and scission, as well as the regulation of NEC assembly and disassembly. Elucidating these unknowns will be crucial for developing novel antiviral strategies targeting herpesvirus nuclear egress.", "label": 1}
