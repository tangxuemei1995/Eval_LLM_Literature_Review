{"grounding": "Host defense against viral pathogens is an essential function for all living organisms. In cell-intrinsic innate immunity, dedicated sensor proteins recognize molecular signatures of infection and communicate to downstream adaptor or effector proteins to activate immune defense. Remarkably, recent evidence demonstrates that much of the core machinery of innate immunity is shared across eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains of life. Here, we review a pioneering example of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity: the animal cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase\u2013stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway and its ancestor in bacteria, CBASS (cyclic nucleotide-based antiphage signaling system) antiphage defense. We discuss the unique mechanism by which animal cGLRs (cGAS-like receptors) and bacterial CD-NTases (cGAS/dinucleotide-cyclase in Vibrio (DncV)-like nucleotidyltransferases) in these pathways link pathogen detection with immune activation using nucleotide second messenger signals. Comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we highlight emerging questions in the field and examine evolutionary pressures that may have shaped the origins of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense.", "generated_text": "The discovery of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream effector stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has revolutionized our understanding of innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA. This review explores the evolutionary origins and mechanistic similarities between the eukaryotic cGAS-STING pathway and its prokaryotic counterpart, the cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS). We examine the structural and functional conservation of key components, including cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) and nucleotide second messengers, across diverse organisms. The comparative analysis reveals striking parallels in the detection of foreign nucleic acids, signal transduction, and effector activation between these ancient and modern immune systems. By tracing the evolutionary trajectory from CBASS to cGAS-STING, we gain insights into the fundamental principles governing nucleotide-based immune signaling and its critical role in antiviral defense. This comprehensive overview highlights the remarkable conservation of innate immune strategies and their potential implications for developing novel therapeutic approaches against viral infections.", "label": 0}
