{"grounding": "There are at least 21 families of enveloped viruses that infect mammals, and many contain members of high concern for global human health. All enveloped viruses have a dedicated fusion protein or fusion complex that enacts the critical genome-releasing membrane fusion event that is essential before viral replication within the host cell interior can begin. Because all enveloped viruses enter cells by fusion, it behooves us to know how viral fusion proteins function. Viral fusion proteins are also major targets of neutralizing antibodies, and hence they serve as key vaccine immunogens. Here we review current concepts about viral membrane fusion proteins focusing on how they are triggered, structural intermediates between pre- and postfusion forms, and their interplay with the lipid bilayers they engage. We also discuss cellular and therapeutic interventions that thwart virus-cell membrane fusion.", "generated_text": "Viral membrane fusion is a critical step in the infection process of enveloped viruses. This review explores the intricate interplay between viral fusion proteins and host cell membranes, focusing on the three classes of viral fusion proteins: I, II, and III. We examine the structural and functional characteristics of these proteins, their conformational changes during fusion, and the formation of trimers-of-hairpins. The energetics of the fusion process is discussed, highlighting the role of fusion peptides and loops in initiating membrane destabilization. We also investigate the dynamics of lipid rearrangement during fusion and the impact of fusion restriction factors on viral entry. Understanding these molecular mechanisms provides valuable insights into viral pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for antiviral interventions.", "label": 1}
