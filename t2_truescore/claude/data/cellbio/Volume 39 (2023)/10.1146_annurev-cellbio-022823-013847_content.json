{"grounding": "Cells must tightly regulate their gene expression programs and yet rapidly respond to acute biochemical and biophysical cues within their environment. This information is transmitted to the nucleus through various signaling cascades, culminating in the activation or repression of target genes. Transcription factors (TFs) are key mediators of these signals, binding to specific regulatory elements within chromatin. While live-cell imaging has conclusively proven that TF\u2013chromatin interactions are highly dynamic, how such transient interactions can have long-term impacts on developmental trajectories and disease progression is still largely unclear. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the dynamic nature of TF functions, starting with a historical overview of early live-cell experiments. We highlight key factors that govern TF dynamics and how TF dynamics, in turn, affect downstream transcriptional bursting. Finally, we conclude with open challenges and emerging technologies that will further our understanding of transcriptional regulation.", "generated_text": "Transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in gene regulation, yet their dynamic behavior within living cells remains poorly understood. Recent advances in single-molecule tracking techniques have revolutionized our ability to observe TF dynamics in real-time, providing unprecedented insights into their search mechanisms, binding kinetics, and interactions with chromatin. This review synthesizes the latest findings on TF dynamics at the single-molecule level, highlighting their implications for transcriptional bursting and genome organization. We discuss how TFs navigate the complex nuclear environment, engage with target sites, and contribute to the formation of transcriptional hubs. Furthermore, we explore the interplay between TF dynamics and chromatin structure, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation. By integrating these single-molecule observations with broader genomic and cellular contexts, we present a comprehensive view of TF function and its impact on gene regulation.", "label": 1}
