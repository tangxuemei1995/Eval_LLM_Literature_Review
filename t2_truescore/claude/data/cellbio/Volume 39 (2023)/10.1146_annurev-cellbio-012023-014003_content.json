{"grounding": "Our understanding of cell and developmental biology has been greatly aided by a focus on a small number of model organisms. However, we are now in an era where techniques to investigate gene function can be applied across phyla, allowing scientists to explore the diversity and flexibility of developmental mechanisms and gain a deeper understanding of life. Researchers comparing the eyeless cave-adapted Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, with its river-dwelling counterpart are revealing how the development of the eyes, pigment, brain, cranium, blood, and digestive system evolves as animals adapt to new environments. Breakthroughs in our understanding of the genetic and developmental basis of regressive and constructive trait evolution have come from A. mexicanus research. They include understanding the types of mutations that alter traits, which cellular and developmental processes they affect, and how they lead to pleiotropy. We review recent progress in the field and highlight areas for future investigations that include evolution of sex differentiation, neural crest development, and metabolic regulation of embryogenesis.", "generated_text": "The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a powerful model system in cell and developmental biology, offering unique insights into evolutionary processes. This species exists in two distinct morphs: a surface-dwelling form and multiple cave-dwelling populations. The cave-dwelling morphs have undergone remarkable adaptations, including eye degeneration and pigment loss, in response to their dark, nutrient-poor environment. This review explores the significance of A. mexicanus in evo-devo research, highlighting its contributions to our understanding of developmental plasticity, genetic basis of trait evolution, and the interplay between genetics and environment. We discuss key studies that have utilized this species to investigate eye development, pigmentation, and metabolic adaptations. The Mexican tetra's ability to produce viable hybrids between surface and cave morphs further enhances its value as a model organism. This review underscores the importance of A. mexicanus in advancing our knowledge of evolutionary developmental biology and its potential for future discoveries.", "label": 1}
