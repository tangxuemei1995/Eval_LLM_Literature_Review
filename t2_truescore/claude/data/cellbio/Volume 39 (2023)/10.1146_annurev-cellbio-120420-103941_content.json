{"grounding": "Cell-cell communication is critical for the development and function of multicellular organisms. A crucial means by which cells communicate with one another is physical interactions between receptors on one cell and their ligands on a neighboring cell. Trans ligand:receptor interactions activate the receptor, ultimately leading to changes in the fate of the receptor-expressing cells. Such trans signaling is known to be critical for the functions of cells in the nervous and immune systems, among others. Historically, trans interactions are the primary conceptual framework for understanding cell-cell communication. However, cells often coexpress many receptors and ligands, and a subset of these has been reported to interact in cis and profoundly impact cell functions. Cis interactions likely constitute a fundamental, understudied regulatory mechanism in cell biology. Here, I discuss how cis interactions between membrane receptors and ligands regulate immune cell functions, and I also highlight outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "Membrane receptors and their ligands play crucial roles in cellular communication and signaling. While trans interactions between receptors and ligands on adjacent cells are well-studied, cis interactions occurring within the same membrane have gained increasing attention. This review explores the emerging field of cis interactions between membrane receptors and ligands, highlighting their significance in modulating cellular responses. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying cis interactions, their impact on receptor activation and signaling pathways, and their potential to fine-tune cellular responses. Recent studies revealing the prevalence of cis interactions across various receptor-ligand systems are examined, along with their implications for cell biology and disease. Furthermore, we address the challenges in studying cis interactions and propose future directions for research in this rapidly evolving field. Understanding cis interactions provides valuable insights into the complexity of membrane receptor function and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
