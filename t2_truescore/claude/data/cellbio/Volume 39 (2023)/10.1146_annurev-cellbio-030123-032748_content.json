{"grounding": "Microtubules are essential dynamic polymers composed of \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin heterodimers. They support intracellular trafficking, cell division, cellular motility, and other essential cellular processes. In many species, both \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin are encoded by multiple genes with distinct expression profiles and functionality. Microtubules are further diversified through abundant posttranslational modifications, which are added and removed by a suite of enzymes to form complex, stereotyped cellular arrays. The genetic and chemical diversity of tubulin constitute a tubulin code that regulates intrinsic microtubule properties and is read by cellular effectors, such as molecular motors and microtubule-associated proteins, to provide spatial and temporal specificity to microtubules in cells. In this review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding tubulin code literature and highlight limitations and opportunities for the field. As complex microtubule arrays underlie essential physiological processes, a better understanding of how cells employ the tubulin code has important implications for human disease ranging from cancer to neurological disorders.", "generated_text": "The tubulin code, a complex system of tubulin isoforms and posttranslational modifications, plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule function and dynamics. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the tubulin code and its implications for health and disease. We discuss the diverse array of tubulin isoforms and their tissue-specific expression patterns, as well as the various posttranslational modifications, including detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation. These modifications collectively contribute to the functional diversity of microtubules, influencing cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal development. Furthermore, we examine how dysregulation of the tubulin code can lead to various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Understanding the intricate interplay between tubulin isoforms, posttranslational modifications, and microtubule-associated proteins provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for treating microtubule-related diseases.", "label": 1}
