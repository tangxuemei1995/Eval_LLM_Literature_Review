{"grounding": "Multicellular organisms generate tissues of diverse shapes and functions from cells and extracellular matrices. Their adhesion molecules mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which not only play crucial roles in maintaining tissue integrity but also serve as key regulators of tissue morphogenesis. Cells constantly probe their environment to make decisions: They integrate chemical and mechanical information from the environment via diffusible ligand- or adhesion-based signaling to decide whether to release specific signaling molecules or enzymes, to divide or differentiate, to move away or stay, or even whether to live or die. These decisions in turn modify their environment, including the chemical nature and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. Tissue morphology is the physical manifestation of the remodeling of cells and matrices by their historical biochemical and biophysical landscapes. We review our understanding of matrix and adhesion molecules in tissue morphogenesis, with an emphasis on key physical interactions that drive morphogenesis.", "generated_text": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process involving dynamic interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). This review explores the crucial roles of cell adhesion molecules, particularly integrins and cadherins, in mediating these interactions and driving tissue formation. We examine how interfacial tension, generated by differential adhesion and cortical contractility, influences cell behavior and tissue architecture. The ECM, especially the basement membrane, is discussed as a key regulator of cellular organization and differentiation. We highlight recent advances in understanding the bidirectional communication between cells and the matrix, including mechanotransduction pathways and matrix remodeling. Furthermore, we address how these cell-matrix interactions contribute to the emergence of tissue-scale properties and pattern formation during development. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying tissue morphogenesis and their implications for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.", "label": 1}
