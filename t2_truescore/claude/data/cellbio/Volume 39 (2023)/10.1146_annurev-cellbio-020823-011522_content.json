{"grounding": "Intercellular signaling molecules, known as morphogens, act at a long range in developing tissues to provide spatial information and control properties such as cell fate and tissue growth. The production, transport, and removal of morphogens shape their concentration profiles in time and space. Downstream signaling cascades and gene regulatory networks within cells then convert the spatiotemporal morphogen profiles into distinct cellular responses. Current challenges are to understand the diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying morphogen gradient formation, as well as the logic of downstream regulatory circuits involved in morphogen interpretation. This knowledge, combining experimental and theoretical results, is essential to understand emerging properties of morphogen-controlled systems, such as robustness and scaling.", "generated_text": "Morphogens play a crucial role in tissue development during embryogenesis by establishing concentration gradients that regulate gene expression patterns. This review explores the mechanisms by which morphogens control tissue development through their interactions with gene regulatory networks. We examine the diffusion-based models of morphogen gradient formation and discuss recent advances in understanding how these gradients are interpreted by cells to generate precise spatial patterns. The review also highlights the importance of feedback loops and cross-talk between different morphogen pathways in fine-tuning developmental processes. Finally, we consider the implications of morphogen-mediated tissue development for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications.", "label": 1}
