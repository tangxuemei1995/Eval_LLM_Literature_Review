{"grounding": "The uterine lining (endometrium) regenerates repeatedly over the life span as part of its normal physiology. Substantial portions of the endometrium are shed during childbirth (parturition) and, in some species, menstruation, but the tissue is rapidly rebuilt without scarring, rendering it a powerful model of regeneration in mammals. Nonetheless, following some assaults, including medical procedures and infections, the endometrium fails to regenerate and instead forms scars that may interfere with normal endometrial function and contribute to infertility. Thus, the endometrium provides an exceptional platform to answer a central question of regenerative medicine: Why do some systems regenerate while others scar? Here, we review our current understanding of diverse endometrial disruption events in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents, and the associated mechanisms of regenerative success and failure. Elucidating the determinants of these disparate repair processes promises insights into fundamental mechanisms of mammalian regeneration with substantial implications for reproductive health.", "generated_text": "The endometrium exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity, undergoing cyclical remodeling during menstruation and extensive tissue repair following pregnancy and parturition. This review explores the mechanisms underlying endometrial regeneration and fibrosis, with a focus on stem cell populations and their role in tissue homeostasis. We examine the interplay between various cellular and molecular factors that contribute to successful endometrial repair and discuss how dysregulation of these processes can lead to pathological conditions such as Asherman syndrome and intrauterine adhesions. Recent advances in understanding the role of endometrial stem cells in regeneration are highlighted, along with potential therapeutic approaches for treating endometrial disorders. Additionally, we consider the implications of these findings for improving reproductive outcomes and developing novel strategies for endometrial regeneration in clinical settings.", "label": 1}
