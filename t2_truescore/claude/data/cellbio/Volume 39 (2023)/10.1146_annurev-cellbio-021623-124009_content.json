{"grounding": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) decode messenger RNA codons to peptides at the ribosome. The nuclear genome contains many tRNA genes for each amino acid and even each anticodon. Recent evidence indicates that expression of these tRNAs in neurons is regulated, and they are not functionally redundant. When specific tRNA genes are nonfunctional, this results in an imbalance between codon demand and tRNA availability. Furthermore, tRNAs are spliced, processed, and posttranscriptionally modified. Defects in these processes lead to neurological disorders. Finally, mutations in the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) also lead to disease. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs cause syndromic disorders, while dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs lead to peripheral neuropathy, again due to an imbalance between tRNA supply and codon demand. While it is clear that disrupting tRNA biology often leads to neurological disease, additional research is needed to understand the sensitivity of neurons to these changes.", "generated_text": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a crucial role in protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have revealed that dysregulation of tRNA metabolism is implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. This review explores the multifaceted involvement of tRNAs in neurological diseases, focusing on aberrations in tRNA biogenesis, modifications, and aminoacylation. We discuss the impact of mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, tRNA splicing defects, and alterations in tRNA-modifying enzymes on neuronal function. Additionally, we examine the role of angiogenin-mediated tRNA cleavage and its connection to the integrated stress response in neurodegenerative processes. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the pathogenesis of neurological disorders and opens avenues for potential therapeutic interventions targeting tRNA-related pathways. This comprehensive analysis highlights the emerging significance of tRNA dysregulation in neurological diseases and its implications for future research and treatment strategies.", "label": 1}
