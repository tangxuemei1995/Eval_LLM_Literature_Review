{"grounding": "Animal tissues are made up of multiple cell types that are increasingly well-characterized, yet our understanding of the core principles that govern tissue organization is still incomplete. This is in part because many observable tissue characteristics, such as cellular composition and spatial patterns, are emergent properties, and as such, they cannot be explained through the knowledge of individual cells alone. Here we propose a complex systems theory perspective to address this fundamental gap in our understanding of tissue biology. We introduce the concept of cell categories, which is based on cell relations rather than cell identity. Based on these notions we then discuss common principles of tissue modularity, introducing compositional, structural, and functional tissue modules. Cell diversity and cell relations provide a basis for a new perspective on the underlying principles of tissue organization in health and disease.", "generated_text": "The traditional paradigm of tissue biology, centered on cell types as fundamental units, is being challenged by emerging evidence. This review explores a new perspective that emphasizes the importance of cell relations and tissue modules in understanding tissue organization. We examine how cells dynamically interact within their microenvironment, forming functional units that transcend rigid cell type classifications. The concept of tissue modules is introduced as a more flexible framework for comprehending tissue structure and function. We discuss how this paradigm shift impacts our understanding of tissue evolution, development, and self-organization. By integrating insights from various disciplines, including molecular biology, systems biology, and evolutionary developmental biology, we propose a more holistic approach to tissue biology. This new paradigm has significant implications for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and our overall understanding of biological complexity.", "label": 1}
