{"grounding": "Toll signaling plays a crucial role in pathogen defense throughout the animal kingdom. It was discovered, however, for its function in dorsoventral (DV) axis formation in Drosophila. In all other insects studied so far, but not outside the insects, Toll is also required for DV patterning. However, in insects more distantly related to Drosophila, Toll's patterning role is frequently reduced and substituted by an expanded influence of BMP signaling, the pathway implicated in DV axis formation in all major metazoan lineages. This suggests that Toll was integrated into an ancestral BMP-based patterning system at the base of the insects or during insect evolution. The observation that Toll signaling has an immune function in the extraembryonic serosa, an early differentiating tissue of most insect embryos, suggests a scenario of how Toll was co-opted from an ancestral immune function for its new role in axis formation.", "generated_text": "The Toll signaling pathway, originally identified for its role in insect immunity, has undergone neofunctionalization in various insect lineages to regulate dorsoventral patterning during embryogenesis. This study investigates the evolutionary trajectory of Toll signaling across diverse insect orders, including Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus, as well as non-insect hexapods. We examine the pathway's involvement in embryonic patterning, germ layer formation, and the development of extraembryonic tissues. Our findings reveal a complex pattern of functional diversification, with Toll signaling playing crucial roles in mesoderm specification, serosa formation, and the production of serosal and blastodermal cuticles. This research provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of embryonic patterning and highlights the plasticity of signaling pathways in adapting to new developmental functions across insect lineages.", "label": 1}
