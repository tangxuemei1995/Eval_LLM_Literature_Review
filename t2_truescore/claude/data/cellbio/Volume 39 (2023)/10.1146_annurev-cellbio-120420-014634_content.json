{"grounding": "The life of eukaryotic cells requires the transport of lipids between membranes, which are separated by the aqueous environment of the cytosol. Vesicle-mediated traffic along the secretory and endocytic pathways and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) cooperate in this transport. Until recently, known LTPs were shown to carry one or a few lipids at a time and were thought to mediate transport by shuttle-like mechanisms. Over the last few years, a new family of LTPs has been discovered that is defined by a repeating \u03b2-groove (RBG) rod-like structure with a hydrophobic channel running along their entire length. This structure and the localization of these proteins at membrane contact sites suggest a bridge-like mechanism of lipid transport. Mutations in some of these proteins result in neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. Here we review the known properties and well-established or putative physiological roles of these proteins, and we highlight the many questions that remain open about their functions.", "generated_text": "RBG motif Bridge-Like Lipid Transport Proteins (BLTPs) are a recently discovered family of proteins that play crucial roles in intracellular lipid transport and membrane dynamics. This review focuses on the structural and functional aspects of key BLTP members, including VPS13, ATG2, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164. These proteins share a conserved RBG motif and exhibit elongated structures that facilitate lipid transfer between organelles. We discuss the latest findings on their molecular mechanisms, subcellular localizations, and physiological functions in various cellular processes, such as autophagy, lipid droplet formation, and synaptic vesicle recycling. Additionally, we highlight the emerging connections between BLTP dysfunction and human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Finally, we address open questions and future research directions in the field, emphasizing the potential of BLTPs as therapeutic targets for lipid-related pathologies.", "label": 1}
