{"grounding": "The All of Us Research Program's Data and Research Center (DRC) was established to help acquire, curate, and provide access to one of the world's largest and most diverse datasets for precision medicine research. Already, over 500,000 participants are enrolled in All of Us, 80% of whom are underrepresented in biomedical research, and data are being analyzed by a community of over 2,300 researchers. The DRC created this thriving data ecosystem by collaborating with engaged participants, innovative program partners, and empowered researchers. In this review, we first describe how the DRC is organized to meet the needs of this broad group of stakeholders. We then outline guiding principles, common challenges, and innovative approaches used to build the All of Us data ecosystem. Finally, we share lessons learned to help others navigate important decisions and trade-offs in building a modern biomedical data platform.", "generated_text": "The All of Us Research Program aims to revolutionize precision medicine by creating a diverse and comprehensive data ecosystem. This paper describes the development of the All of Us Data and Research Center, which provides a secure, scalable, and sustainable platform for biomedical research. The center integrates diverse data types, including electronic health records, genomic information, and participant-provided data, while prioritizing data privacy and security. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and innovative data management strategies, the ecosystem supports a wide range of research queries and analysis tools. The program's emphasis on participant diversity and engagement ensures that traditionally underrepresented populations are included in medical research. This groundbreaking initiative promises to accelerate scientific discoveries, improve health outcomes, and advance personalized medicine for all communities.", "label": 0}
