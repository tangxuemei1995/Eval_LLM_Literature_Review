{"grounding": "Despite monumental advances in molecular technology to generate genome sequence data at scale, there is still a considerable proportion of heritability in most complex diseases that remains unexplained. Because many of the discoveries have been single-nucleotide variants with small to moderate effects on disease, the functional implication of many of the variants is still unknown and, thus, we have limited new drug targets and therapeutics. We, and many others, posit that one primary factor that has limited our ability to identify novel drug targets from genome-wide association studies may be due to gene interactions (epistasis), gene\u2013environment interactions, network/pathway effects, or multiomic relationships. We propose that many of these complex models explain much of the underlying genetic architecture of complex disease. In this review, we discuss the evidence from multiple research avenues, ranging from pairs of alleles to multiomic integration studies and pharmacogenomics, that supports the need for further investigation of gene interactions (or epistasis) in genetic and genomic studies of human disease. Our goal is to catalog the mounting evidence for epistasis in genetic studies and the connections between genetic interactions and human health and disease that could enable precision medicine of the future.", "generated_text": "The study of gene interactions, or epistasis, has gained significant traction in human disease research, with mounting evidence supporting its crucial role in understanding complex genetic architectures. This review synthesizes recent findings on epistatic effects in various human diseases, highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions beyond additive models. We explore how advances in multiomics technologies and analytical methods have facilitated the detection and characterization of epistatic interactions. The integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data has revealed intricate networks of genetic interactions that contribute to disease susceptibility and progression. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of epistasis for precision medicine, emphasizing how knowledge of gene interactions can inform more accurate risk prediction models and tailored therapeutic strategies. As the field progresses, challenges in statistical power and interpretation of high-dimensional data persist. Nevertheless, the growing body of evidence underscores the potential of epistasis research to revolutionize our understanding of human disease etiology and pave the way for more effective personalized interventions.", "label": 1}
