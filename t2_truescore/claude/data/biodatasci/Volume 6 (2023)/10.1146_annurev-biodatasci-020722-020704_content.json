{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and other data-driven technologies hold great promise to transform healthcare and confer the predictive power essential to precision medicine. However, the existing biomedical data, which are a vital resource and foundation for developing medical AI models, do not reflect the diversity of the human population. The low representation in biomedical data has become a significant health risk for non-European populations, and the growing application of AI opens a new pathway for this health risk to manifest and amplify. Here we review the current status of biomedical data inequality and present a conceptual framework for understanding its impacts on machine learning. We also discuss the recent advances in algorithmic interventions for mitigating health disparities arising from biomedical data inequality. Finally, we briefly discuss the newly identified disparity in data quality among ethnic groups and its potential impacts on machine learning.", "generated_text": "The unequal representation of diverse populations in biomedical datasets poses a significant challenge to the development of equitable artificial intelligence (AI) systems in healthcare. This paper explores the implications of data inequality on AI-driven health interventions and proposes innovative strategies to mitigate its effects. We examine the concept of subpopulation shift and its impact on model performance across different ethnic groups. The potential of transfer learning techniques to address data scarcity in underrepresented populations is investigated. Additionally, we discuss the development of multiethnic machine learning approaches that can effectively leverage limited data from minority groups. Our findings highlight the importance of collaborative data sharing initiatives and the need for targeted data collection efforts to enhance health equity. We conclude by outlining a roadmap for future research aimed at creating more inclusive and generalizable AI models in biomedicine.", "label": 1}
