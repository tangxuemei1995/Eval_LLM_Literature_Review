{"grounding": "Since the first publication a decade ago describing the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the context of cancer, over 200 datasets and thousands of scRNA-seq studies have been published in cancer biology. scRNA-seq technologies have been applied across dozens of cancer types and a diverse array of study designs to improve our understanding of tumor biology, the tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic responses, and scRNA-seq is on the verge of being used to improve decision-making in the clinic. Computational methodologies and analytical pipelines are key in facilitating scRNA-seq research. Numerous computational methods utilizing the most advanced tools in data science have been developed to extract meaningful insights. Here, we review the advancements in cancer biology gained by scRNA-seq and discuss the computational challenges of the technology that are specific to cancer research.", "generated_text": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of human cancers by providing unprecedented resolution of cellular heterogeneity within tumors. This powerful technology enables the comprehensive profiling of gene expression at the individual cell level, revealing intricate details of the tumor microenvironment and cellular interactions. By applying scRNA-seq to cancer research, scientists have uncovered novel cell populations, identified potential therapeutic targets, and gained insights into tumor evolution and drug resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, scRNA-seq has proven invaluable in studying the complex interplay between cancer cells and the immune system, facilitating the development of more effective immunotherapies. This review explores the applications of scRNA-seq in cancer research, highlighting its potential to advance personalized medicine and improve patient outcomes through a deeper understanding of tumor biology and therapeutic responses.", "label": 1}
