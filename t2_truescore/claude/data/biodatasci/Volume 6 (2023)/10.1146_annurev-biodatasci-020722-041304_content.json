{"grounding": "Viruses evolve to evade prior immunity, causing significant disease burden. Vaccine effectiveness deteriorates as pathogens mutate, requiring redesign. This is a problem that has grown worse due to population increase, global travel, and farming practices. Thus, there is significant interest in developing broad-spectrum vaccines that mitigate disease severity and ideally inhibit disease transmission without requiring frequent updates. Even in cases where vaccines against rapidly mutating pathogens have been somewhat effective, such as seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), designing vaccines that provide broad-spectrum immunity against routinely observed viral variation remains a desirable but not yet achieved goal. This review highlights the key theoretical advances in understanding the interplay between polymorphism and vaccine efficacy, challenges in designing broad-spectrum vaccines, and technology advances and possible avenues forward. We also discuss data-driven approaches for monitoring vaccine efficacy and predicting viral escape from vaccine-induced protection. In each case, we consider illustrative examples in vaccine development from influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)\u2014three examples of highly prevalent rapidly mutating viruses with distinct phylogenetics and unique histories of vaccine technology development.", "generated_text": "Rapidly mutating viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV, pose significant challenges to vaccine development due to their ability to evade immune responses. This review examines recent progress and ongoing challenges in designing broad-spectrum vaccines against these pathogens. We discuss the potential of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) as a key strategy for achieving universal protection. The review highlights innovative approaches, including structure-based vaccine design, germline-targeting immunogens, and novel adjuvants, which aim to elicit broad-spectrum immunity. Additionally, we explore the use of cutting-edge technologies, such as mRNA platforms and nanoparticle-based delivery systems, in enhancing vaccine efficacy. While significant strides have been made, particularly in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 research, major hurdles remain in developing truly universal vaccines. The review concludes by outlining future directions and emphasizing the importance of continued collaborative efforts in addressing this critical global health challenge.", "label": 1}
