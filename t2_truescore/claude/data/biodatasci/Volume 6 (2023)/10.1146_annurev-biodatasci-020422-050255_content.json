{"grounding": "Advances in single-cell proteomics technologies have resulted in high-dimensional datasets comprising millions of cells that are capable of answering key questions about biology and disease. The advent of these technologies has prompted the development of computational tools to process and visualize the complex data. In this review, we outline the steps of single-cell and spatial proteomics analysis pipelines. In addition to describing available methods, we highlight benchmarking studies that have identified advantages and pitfalls of the currently available computational toolkits. As these technologies continue to advance, robust analysis tools should be developed in tandem to take full advantage of the potential biological insights provided by these data.", "generated_text": "Single-cell proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. This review explores computational methods for analyzing single-cell proteomic data, focusing on mass cytometry and spatial proteomics techniques. We discuss state-of-the-art approaches for data preprocessing, normalization, and quality control. Advanced clustering algorithms and trajectory inference methods are examined for their ability to reveal cell populations and developmental processes. Additionally, we highlight computational strategies for integrating proteomic data with other single-cell omics modalities. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in computational single-cell proteomics, emphasizing the need for scalable and interpretable methods to handle increasingly complex datasets.", "label": 1}
