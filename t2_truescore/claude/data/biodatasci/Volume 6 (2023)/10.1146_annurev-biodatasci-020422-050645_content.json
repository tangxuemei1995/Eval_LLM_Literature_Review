{"grounding": "Single-cell RNA sequencing methods have led to improved understanding of the heterogeneity and transcriptomic states present in complex biological systems. Recently, the development of novel single-cell technologies for assaying additional modalities, specifically genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial data, allows for unprecedented insight into cellular biology. While certain technologies collect multiple measurements from the same cells simultaneously, even when modalities are separately assayed in different cells, we can apply novel computational methods to integrate these data. The application of computational integration methods to multimodal paired and unpaired data results in rich information about the identities of the cells present and the interactions between different levels of biology, such as between genetic variation and transcription. In this review, we both discuss the single-cell technologies for measuring these modalities and describe and characterize a variety of computational integration methods for combining the resulting data to leverage multimodal information toward greater biological insight.", "generated_text": "Single-cell multiomics has emerged as a powerful approach to comprehensively profile individual cells at multiple molecular levels. This rapidly evolving field integrates various next-generation sequencing technologies to simultaneously measure multiple modalities, such as genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics, within single cells. The integration of these diverse data types provides unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, regulatory networks, and dynamic processes. However, the analysis of multimodal single-cell data presents significant computational challenges, requiring advanced algorithms and statistical methods for data integration, normalization, and interpretation. This review explores recent developments in single-cell multiomics technologies, computational approaches for data integration and analysis, and their applications in understanding complex biological systems. We discuss current limitations and future directions, highlighting the potential of single-cell multiomics to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease mechanisms.", "label": 1}
