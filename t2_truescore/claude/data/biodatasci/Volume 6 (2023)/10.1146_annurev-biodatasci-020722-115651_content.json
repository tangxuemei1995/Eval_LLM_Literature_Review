{"grounding": "Following the widespread use of deep learning for genomics, deep generative modeling is also becoming a viable methodology for the broad field. Deep generative models (DGMs) can learn the complex structure of genomic data and allow researchers to generate novel genomic instances that retain the real characteristics of the original dataset. Aside from data generation, DGMs can also be used for dimensionality reduction by mapping the data space to a latent space, as well as for prediction tasks via exploitation of this learned mapping or supervised/semi-supervised DGM designs. In this review, we briefly introduce generative modeling and two currently prevailing architectures, we present conceptual applications along with notable examples in functional and evolutionary genomics, and we provide our perspective on potential challenges and future directions.", "generated_text": "Deep generative models, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have emerged as powerful tools in functional and evolutionary genomics. This review explores their applications in deciphering complex genetic patterns, predicting functional elements, and modeling evolutionary processes. We discuss how VAEs can efficiently compress high-dimensional genomic data and infer latent representations, enabling the discovery of novel genetic variants and regulatory elements. GANs are examined for their ability to generate realistic genomic sequences and simulate evolutionary scenarios. The integration of these models with traditional genomic analyses is highlighted, showcasing their potential to enhance our understanding of gene function, regulatory networks, and evolutionary dynamics. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in applying deep generative models to genomic research.", "label": 1}
