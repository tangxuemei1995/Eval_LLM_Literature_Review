{"grounding": "Breast cancer risk is highly variable within the population and current research is leading the shift toward personalized medicine. By accurately assessing an individual woman's risk, we can reduce the risk of over/undertreatment by preventing unnecessary procedures or by elevating screening procedures. Breast density measured from conventional mammography has been established as one of the most dominant risk factors for breast cancer; however, it is currently limited by its ability to characterize more complex breast parenchymal patterns that have been shown to provide additional information to strengthen cancer risk models. Molecular factors ranging from high penetrance, or high likelihood that a mutation will show signs and symptoms of the disease, to combinations of gene mutations with low penetrance have shown promise for augmenting risk assessment. Although imaging biomarkers and molecular biomarkers have both individually demonstrated improved performance in risk assessment, few studies have evaluated them together. This review aims to highlight the current state of the art in breast cancer risk assessment using imaging and genetic biomarkers.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the integration of molecular and radiomic features for improved risk assessment in breast cancer. We combine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores with radiomic features extracted from mammographic images to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model. A cohort of 1,500 breast cancer patients and 1,500 healthy controls underwent genetic testing and mammography. Radiomic features were extracted using advanced image analysis techniques, while genetic data was used to calculate polygenic risk scores. Machine learning algorithms were employed to integrate these diverse data types and create a unified risk prediction model. The combined model demonstrated superior performance compared to models based on genetic or radiomic features alone, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85. Our findings suggest that the integration of molecular and radiomic features can significantly enhance breast cancer risk assessment, potentially leading to more personalized screening and prevention strategies.", "label": 0}
