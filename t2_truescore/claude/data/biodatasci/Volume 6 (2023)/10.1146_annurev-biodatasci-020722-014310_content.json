{"grounding": "Admixed populations constitute a large portion of global human genetic diversity, yet they are often left out of genomics analyses. This exclusion is problematic, as it leads to disparities in the understanding of the genetic structure and history of diverse cohorts and the performance of genomic medicine across populations. Admixed populations have particular statistical challenges, as they inherit genomic segments from multiple source populations\u2014the primary reason they have historically been excluded from genetic studies. In recent years, however, an increasing number of statistical methods and software tools have been developed to account for and leverage admixture in the context of genomics analyses. Here, we provide a survey of such computational strategies for the informed consideration of admixture to allow for the well-calibrated inclusion of mixed ancestry populations in large-scale genomics studies, and we detail persisting gaps in existing tools.", "generated_text": "Admixed populations present unique challenges and opportunities in genomic research. This review explores advanced strategies for analyzing the genetic architecture of complex traits in admixed individuals. We discuss recent methodological developments in statistical genetics that leverage admixture patterns to enhance the power and resolution of association studies. Key approaches include local ancestry inference, admixture mapping, and ancestry-aware fine-mapping techniques. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of these methods in the context of diverse admixed populations worldwide. Additionally, we examine how integrating admixture analysis with functional genomics data can provide insights into the evolutionary history and adaptive significance of trait-associated variants. Finally, we highlight the potential of admixture-based approaches to address health disparities and improve the generalizability of genetic findings across populations.", "label": 1}
