{"grounding": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that can regulate all steps of gene expression (induction, transcription, and translation). Several virus families, primarily double-stranded DNA viruses, encode small RNAs (sRNAs), including miRNAs. These virus-derived miRNAs (v-miRNAs) help the virus evade the host's innate and adaptive immune system and maintain an environment of chronic latent infection. In this review, the functions of the sRNA-mediated virus\u2013host interactions are highlighted, delineating their implication in chronic stress, inflammation, immunopathology, and disease. We provide insights into the latest viral RNA\u2013based research\u2014in silico approaches for functional characterization of v-miRNAs and other RNA types. The latest research can assist toward the identification of therapeutic targets to combat viral infections.", "generated_text": "This review explores the role of virus-derived small RNAs and microRNAs in health and disease, with a focus on virally encoded microRNAs (v-miRNAs). We discuss the biogenesis and functions of these regulatory molecules, particularly in the context of Epstein-Barr virus infection. The application of bioinformatics approaches in identifying and characterizing v-miRNAs is examined, highlighting the importance of viral RNA bioinformatics resources in advancing our understanding of these molecules. We also investigate the potential implications of v-miRNAs in viral pathogenesis, host-virus interactions, and their prospective use as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of small RNAs and v-miRNAs in viral infections and their impact on human health.", "label": 1}
