{"grounding": "Alternative splicing is pivotal to the regulation of gene expression and protein diversity in eukaryotic cells. The detection of alternative splicing events requires specific omics technologies. Although short-read RNA sequencing has successfully supported a plethora of investigations on alternative splicing, the emerging technologies of long-read RNA sequencing and top-down mass spectrometry open new opportunities to identify alternative splicing and protein isoforms with less ambiguity. Here, we summarize improvements in short-read RNA sequencing for alternative splicing analysis, including percent splicing index estimation and differential analysis. We also review the computational methods used in top-down proteomics analysis regarding proteoform identification, including the construction of databases of protein isoforms and statistical analyses of search results. While many improvements in sequencing and computational methods will result from emerging technologies, there should be future endeavors to increase the effectiveness, integration, and proteome coverage of alternative splicing events.", "generated_text": "Alternative splicing plays a crucial role in expanding protein diversity and regulating gene expression. This review explores the current methodologies and challenges in identifying splice variants and protein isoforms using transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. We discuss the advantages and limitations of short-read and long-read RNA sequencing technologies for detecting alternative splicing events and reconstructing full-length transcripts. Additionally, we examine the application of top-down mass spectrometry in characterizing proteoforms and its integration with transcriptomic data. The review highlights recent advancements in bioinformatics tools and algorithms for improved splice variant detection and isoform quantification. Furthermore, we address the challenges in correlating transcriptomic and proteomic data to provide a comprehensive understanding of gene expression and protein diversity. This integrative approach offers valuable insights into the complex landscape of alternative splicing and its impact on cellular function and disease mechanisms.", "label": 1}
