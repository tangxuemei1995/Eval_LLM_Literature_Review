{"grounding": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revolutionized our understanding of common genetic variation and its impact on common human disease and traits. Developed and adopted in the mid-2000s, GWAS led to searchable genotype\u2013phenotype catalogs and genome-wide datasets available for further data mining and analysis for the eventual development of translational applications. The GWAS revolution was swift and specific, including almost exclusively populations of European descent, to the neglect of the majority of the world's genetic diversity. In this narrative review, we recount the GWAS landscape of the early years that established a genotype\u2013phenotype catalog that is now universally understood to be inadequate for a complete understanding of complex human genetics. We then describe approaches taken to augment the genotype\u2013phenotype catalog, including the study populations, collaborative consortia, and study design approaches aimed to generalize and then ultimately discover genome-wide associations in non-European descent populations. The collaborations and data resources established in the efforts to diversify genomic findings undoubtedly provide the foundations of the next chapters of genetic association studies with the advent of budget-friendly whole-genome sequencing.", "generated_text": "Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare strategies to individual genetic profiles, but its effectiveness relies heavily on the diversity of genetic data used in research. This review explores the critical importance of including diverse ancestry groups in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the implications for identifying disease susceptibility variants. We examine how the current underrepresentation of non-European populations in genetic research limits the generalizability of findings and potentially exacerbates health disparities. The paper discusses strategies to increase diversity in cohorts and consortia, highlighting successful initiatives and ongoing challenges. We also analyze the impact of diverse genetic data on the development and application of polygenic risk scores, emphasizing their potential to improve disease prediction across populations. By synthesizing recent literature, we demonstrate that enhancing diversity in genetic studies is crucial for advancing precision medicine, ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes, and uncovering novel genetic associations that may be ancestry-specific or shared across populations.", "label": 1}
