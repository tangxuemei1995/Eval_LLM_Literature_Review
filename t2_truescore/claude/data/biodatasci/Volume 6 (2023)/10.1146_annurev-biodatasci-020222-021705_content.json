{"grounding": "SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is silent or benign in most infected individuals, but causes hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia in about 10% of cases. We review studies of the human genetics of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on both rare and common variants. Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified more than 20 common loci robustly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia with modest effect sizes, some implicating genes expressed in the lungs or leukocytes. The most robust association, on chromosome 3, concerns a haplotype inherited from Neanderthals. Sequencing studies focusing on rare variants with a strong effect have been particularly successful, identifying inborn errors of type I interferon (IFN) immunity in 1\u20135% of unvaccinated patients with critical pneumonia, and their autoimmune phenocopy, autoantibodies against type I IFN, in another 15\u201320% of cases. Our growing understanding of the impact of human genetic variation on immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is enabling health systems to improve protection for individuals and populations.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to understand the genetic factors influencing disease severity. This study investigates the contributions of rare and common genetic variants to COVID-19 pneumonia susceptibility and progression. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a large cohort of COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, comparing them to asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and healthy controls. Our analysis revealed several novel loci associated with increased risk of severe disease, including genes involved in innate immunity and interferon signaling pathways. Additionally, we identified rare loss-of-function variants in genes related to type I interferon responses, suggesting a potential role for inborn errors of immunity in COVID-19 severity. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture of COVID-19 susceptibility and may inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies and personalized risk assessment tools for managing the ongoing pandemic.", "label": 1}
