{"grounding": "The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey of statistical challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, from neuroimaging techniques to large-scale neuroimaging studies and statistical learning methods. We briefly review eight popular neuroimaging techniques and their potential applications in neuroscience research and clinical translation. We delineate four themes of neuroimaging data and review major image processing analysis methods for processing neuroimaging data at the individual level. We briefly review four large-scale neuroimaging-related studies and a consortium on imaging genomics and discuss four themes of neuroimaging data analysis at the population level. We review nine major population-based statistical analysis methods and their associated statistical challenges and present recent progress in statistical methodology to address these challenges.", "generated_text": "This research explores advanced statistical learning methods for analyzing neuroimaging data, with a focus on applications in neuroscience and clinical studies. We investigate causal pathway analysis to uncover relationships between brain structure, function, and behavior. The study addresses challenges in handling heterogeneity within neuroimaging datasets and develops novel image processing techniques to enhance data quality. We examine various neuroimaging modalities and their integration to provide comprehensive insights into brain function. Population-based statistical analyses are employed to identify patterns and biomarkers across large cohorts. Additionally, we propose innovative study designs to optimize data collection and improve the reliability of neuroimaging research. Our findings contribute to the advancement of neuroimaging data analysis methods and their practical applications in understanding brain function and disorders.", "label": 0}
