{"grounding": "Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental delay that affects at least 1 in 44 children. Like many neurological disorder phenotypes, the diagnostic features are observable, can be tracked over time, and can be managed or even eliminated through proper therapy and treatments. However, there are major bottlenecks in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and longitudinal tracking pipelines for autism and related neurodevelopmental delays, creating an opportunity for novel data science solutions to augment and transform existing workflows and provide increased access to services for affected families. Several efforts previously conducted by a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress toward improved digital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review the literature on digital health methods for autism behavior quantification and beneficial therapies using data science. We describe both case\u2013control studies and classification systems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and therapeutics that integrate machine learning models of autism-related behaviors, including the factors that must be addressed for translational use. Finally, we describe ongoing challenges and potential opportunities for the field of autism data science. Given the heterogeneous nature of autism and the complexities of the relevant behaviors, this review contains insights that are relevant to neurological behavior analysis and digital psychiatry more broadly.", "generated_text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by diverse behavioral and cognitive phenotypes. Recent advancements in data science and machine learning (ML) offer promising avenues for enhancing our understanding and management of ASD. This review synthesizes current research on the application of data science and ML techniques in autism phenotyping, diagnosis, and intervention. We explore the potential of digital phenotyping, which leverages smartphone and wearable technology to capture real-time behavioral data, providing unprecedented insights into ASD manifestations. The review also examines the role of ML algorithms in improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting treatment outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging field of digital psychiatry and its implications for personalized interventions in ASD. Crowdsourcing initiatives are highlighted as valuable tools for collecting large-scale, diverse datasets crucial for robust ML model development. Despite the significant progress, challenges remain in data standardization, privacy concerns, and clinical integration. We conclude by proposing a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical considerations, and the development of interpretable ML models to advance the field of computational autism research.", "label": 0}
