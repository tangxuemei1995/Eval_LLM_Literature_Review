{"grounding": "Understanding the noncoding part of the genome, which encodes gene regulation, is necessary to identify genetic mechanisms of disease and translate findings from genome-wide association studies into actionable results for treatments and personalized care. Here we provide an overview of the computational analysis of noncoding regions, starting from gene-regulatory mechanisms and their representation in data. Deep learning methods, when applied to these data, highlight important regulatory sequence elements and predict the functional effects of genetic variants. These and other algorithms are used to predict damaging sequence variants. Finally, we introduce rare-variant association tests that incorporate functional annotations and predictions in order to increase interpretability and statistical power.", "generated_text": "Deciphering the functional significance of noncoding DNA sequences remains a critical challenge in genomics. This review explores recent advances in identifying and characterizing functional elements and variants within noncoding regions. We discuss the integration of high-throughput experimental techniques, computational approaches, and machine learning algorithms to predict enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, and other regulatory elements. The application of deep learning models to interpret noncoding sequence patterns and their impact on gene regulation is examined. We also highlight the importance of these methods in understanding rare variants and their potential contributions to complex traits and diseases, as revealed by whole genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies. Finally, we consider future directions for improving variant effect prediction in noncoding regions.", "label": 1}
