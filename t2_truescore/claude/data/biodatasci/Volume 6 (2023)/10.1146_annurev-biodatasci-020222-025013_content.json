{"grounding": "Drug development is a wide scientific field that faces many challenges these days. Among them are extremely high development costs, long development times, and a small number of new drugs that are approved each year. New and innovative technologies are needed to solve these problems that make the drug discovery process of small molecules more time and cost efficient, and that allow previously undruggable receptor classes to be targeted, such as protein\u2013protein interactions. Structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs) have become a leading contender in this context. In this review, we give an introduction to the foundations of SBVSs and survey their progress in the past few years with a focus on ultralarge virtual screenings (ULVSs). We outline key principles of SBVSs, recent success stories, new screening techniques, available deep learning\u2013based docking methods, and promising future research directions. ULVSs have an enormous potential for the development of new small-molecule drugs and are already starting to transform early-stage drug discovery.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches have revolutionized drug discovery processes. This review explores the latest developments in molecular docking, machine learning, and deep learning techniques applied to virtual screening of ultralarge chemical libraries. We discuss the integration of GPU acceleration to enhance computational efficiency and throughput, enabling the screening of billions of compounds. The application of free energy simulations to improve the accuracy of binding affinity predictions is also examined. Furthermore, we highlight the synergistic combination of structure-based methods with ligand-based approaches, resulting in more robust and reliable hit identification. The review also addresses challenges in handling big data generated from ultralarge screenings and the potential of artificial intelligence in optimizing screening workflows. These cutting-edge methodologies are poised to significantly accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, potentially reducing costs and time-to-market for new therapeutic agents.", "label": 0}
