{"grounding": "Prenatal screening using sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA has transformed obstetric care over the past decade and significantly reduced the number of invasive diagnostic procedures like amniocentesis for genetic disorders. Nonetheless, emergency care remains the only option for complications like preeclampsia and preterm birth, two of the most prevalent obstetrical syndromes. Advances in noninvasive prenatal testing expand the scope of precision medicine in obstetric care. In this review, we discuss advances, challenges, and possibilities toward the goal of providing proactive, personalized prenatal care. The highlighted advances focus mainly on cell-free nucleic acids; however, we also review research that uses signals from metabolomics, proteomics, intact cells, and the microbiome. We discuss ethical challenges in providing care. Finally, we look to future possibilities, including redefining disease taxonomy and moving from biomarker correlation to biological causation.", "generated_text": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has revolutionized prenatal care by utilizing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) from maternal blood. This review explores recent advances, challenges, and future possibilities in NIPT. We discuss the evolution of liquid biopsy techniques for detecting fetal genetic abnormalities and their integration into clinical practice. The article examines the improved accuracy and expanded scope of NIPT, including the detection of microdeletions, single-gene disorders, and fetal fraction estimation. We address current limitations, such as false-positive results and confined placental mosaicism. Additionally, we explore emerging applications of cfRNA analysis for monitoring fetal development and predicting pregnancy-related complications. The potential of combining genomic and transcriptomic approaches to enhance NIPT's diagnostic capabilities is also considered. Finally, we highlight ethical considerations and the need for genetic counseling in the era of increasingly comprehensive prenatal screening.", "label": 1}
