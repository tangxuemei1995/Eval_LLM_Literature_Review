{"grounding": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid of the plant Cannabis sativa L. CBD is increasingly being explored as an alternative to conventional therapies to treat health disorders in dogs and cats. Mechanisms of action of CBD have been investigated mostly in rodents and in vitro and include modulation of CB1, CB2, 5-HT, GPR, and opioid receptors. In companion animals, CBD appears to have good bioavailability and safety profile with few side effects at physiological doses. Some dog studies have found CBD to improve clinical signs associated with osteoarthritis, pruritus, and epilepsy. However, further studies are needed to conclude a therapeutic action of CBD for each of these conditions, as well as for decreasing anxiety and aggression in dogs and cats. Herein, we summarize the available scientific evidence associated with the mechanisms of action of CBD, including pharmacokinetics, safety, regulation, and efficacy in ameliorating various health conditions in dogs and cats.", "generated_text": "This review examines the scientific validation of cannabidiol (CBD) for managing various diseases in dogs and cats. We analyze recent studies on CBD's pharmacokinetics, anxiolytic effects, anti-inflammatory properties, and potential applications in veterinary medicine. The research highlights CBD's promising role in treating epilepsy and anxiety-related disorders in companion animals. However, the regulatory landscape surrounding CBD use in veterinary practice remains complex and evolving. While preliminary findings suggest CBD's efficacy in reducing inflammation and seizure frequency, more extensive clinical trials are needed to establish optimal dosing regimens and long-term safety profiles. This review also addresses the challenges in standardizing CBD products for veterinary use and the importance of veterinarian education on cannabinoid therapies. Overall, the growing body of evidence supports CBD's potential as a therapeutic agent in veterinary medicine, warranting further investigation and regulatory consideration.", "label": 1}
