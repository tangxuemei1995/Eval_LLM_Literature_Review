{"grounding": "Deleterious mutations decrease reproductive fitness and are ubiquitous in genomes. Given that many organisms face ongoing threats of extinction, there is interest in elucidating the impact of deleterious variation on extinction risk and optimizing management strategies accounting for such mutations. Quantifying deleterious variation and understanding the effects of population history on deleterious variation are complex endeavors because we do not know the strength of selection acting on each mutation. Further, the effect of demographic history on deleterious mutations depends on the strength of selection against the mutation and the degree of dominance. Here we clarify how deleterious variation can be quantified and studied in natural populations. We then discuss how different demographic factors, such as small population size, nonequilibrium population size changes, inbreeding, and gene flow, affect deleterious variation. Lastly, we provide guidance on studying deleterious variation in nonmodel populations of conservation concern.", "generated_text": "Deleterious mutations pose a significant threat to the long-term survival of natural populations, particularly those of conservation concern. This study investigates the accumulation and impact of deleterious variation in small and fragmented populations, utilizing advanced genomic techniques and simulation models. We examine the interplay between genetic drift, selection, and inbreeding depression across various demographic scenarios. Our findings reveal that the genetic load increases more rapidly in populations with reduced effective size, potentially accelerating extinction risk. Furthermore, we demonstrate that purging of deleterious alleles is less efficient in small populations, exacerbating the effects of inbreeding depression. These results have important implications for conservation genetics, highlighting the need for management strategies that maintain genetic diversity and minimize the accumulation of harmful mutations in endangered species.", "label": 1}
