{"grounding": "Homeostatic control and reproductive functions of humans are regulated at the molecular levels largely by peptide hormones secreted from endocrine and/or neuroendocrine cells in the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Homologs of those hormones and their receptors function similarly in many vertebrate species distantly related to humans, but the evolutionary history of the endocrine system involving those factors has been obscured by the scarcity of genome DNA sequence information of some taxa that potentially contain their orthologs. Focusing on non-osteichthyan vertebrates, namely jawless and cartilaginous fishes, this article illustrates how investigating genome sequence information assists our understanding of the diversification of vertebrate gene repertoires in four broad themes: (a) the presence or absence of genes, (b) multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, (c) differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and (d) the evolutionary timing of gene origins.", "generated_text": "This study explores the evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors, focusing on non-osteichthyan genomes, particularly those of cartilaginous fishes and cyclostomes. By analyzing genomic data from these ancient lineages, we gain valuable insights into the origins and diversification of key hormonal systems, including leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin. Our findings reveal unexpected patterns of conservation and innovation in hormone-receptor pairs across vertebrate evolution. We identify several instances of lineage-specific gene duplications and losses, shedding light on the adaptive significance of these hormonal systems in different vertebrate groups. Furthermore, our results suggest that some hormone-receptor interactions may have emerged earlier in vertebrate evolution than previously thought. This research contributes to our understanding of the molecular basis of endocrine function and provides a framework for future comparative studies of vertebrate hormonal systems.", "label": 1}
