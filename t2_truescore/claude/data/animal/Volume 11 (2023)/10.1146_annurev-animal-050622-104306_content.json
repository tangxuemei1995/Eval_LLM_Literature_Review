{"grounding": "Zoos and aquariums have evolved significantly. From their origins as enclosures for the mere entertainment of the public, these institutions have undertaken new functions responding to the biodiversity crisis and social demands. Modern zoos and aquariums have the opportunity to educate people, contribute to species conservation, and produce animal-related research. However, there is increasing criticism toward the outcomes of their actions and the holding of species in their facilities. This review offers an integrated analysis of the state of knowledge about the role that zoos and aquariums play today. It describes their performance regarding their conservation, education, and research functions, highlighting general patterns and offering future perspectives. It identifies some challenges common to all these institutions, concluding that the way they keep up with the ever-growing social and environmental expectations will be decisive hereafter.", "generated_text": "Zoos and aquariums play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, environmental education, and scientific research in an era of rapid global change. This review examines the evolving functions of these institutions, focusing on their contributions to captive breeding programs, species reintroduction efforts, and public awareness of environmental issues. We analyze the effectiveness of zoos and aquariums in promoting conservation messages and inspiring pro-environmental behaviors among visitors. Additionally, we explore the ethical considerations surrounding animal welfare in captive settings and the balance between entertainment and conservation objectives. Our findings suggest that while zoos and aquariums face challenges, they remain vital centers for ex situ conservation, research, and public engagement. We propose strategies for enhancing their impact on biodiversity preservation and environmental stewardship in the face of ongoing global environmental changes.", "label": 1}
