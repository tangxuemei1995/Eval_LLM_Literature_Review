{"grounding": "Insects constitute vital components of ecosystems. There is alarming evidence for global declines in insect species diversity, abundance, and biomass caused by anthropogenic drivers such as habitat degradation or loss, agricultural practices, climate change, and environmental pollution. This raises important concerns about human food security and ecosystem functionality and calls for more research to assess insect population trends and identify threatened species and the causes of declines to inform conservation strategies. Analysis of genetic diversity is a powerful tool to address these goals, but so far animal conservation genetics research has focused strongly on endangered vertebrates, devoting less attention to invertebrates, such as insects, that constitute most biodiversity. Insects\u2019 shorter generation times and larger population sizes likely necessitate different analytical methods and management strategies. The availability of high-quality reference genome assemblies enables population genomics to address several key issues. These include precise inference of past demographic fluctuations and recent declines, measurement of genetic load levels, delineation of evolutionarily significant units and cryptic species, and analysis of genetic adaptation to stressors. This enables identification of populations that are particularly vulnerable to future threats, considering their potential to adapt and evolve. We review the application of population genomics to insect conservation and the outlook for averting insect declines.", "generated_text": "Insect populations worldwide are experiencing alarming declines, prompting urgent conservation efforts. This review explores the application of population genomics in insect conservation, highlighting its potential to revolutionize our understanding of genetic adaptation and species vulnerability. We discuss recent advances in genome assembly techniques that have made genomic studies more accessible for non-model insect species. These tools enable researchers to investigate genetic diversity, local adaptation, and the accumulation of deleterious mutations in declining populations. We examine how genomic data can inform conservation strategies by identifying populations at risk, guiding captive breeding programs, and predicting species' responses to environmental changes. The review also addresses challenges in applying genomic approaches to insect conservation, including limited reference genomes and difficulties in sampling rare species. Finally, we propose future directions for integrating population genomics with other disciplines to enhance insect conservation efforts. By leveraging the power of genomics, conservationists can develop more effective, targeted interventions to mitigate insect declines and preserve biodiversity in the face of global environmental change.", "label": 1}
