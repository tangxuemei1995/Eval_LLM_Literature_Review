{"grounding": "For nearly a century, evolutionary biologists have observed chromosomes that cause lethality when made homozygous persisting at surprisingly high frequencies (>25%) in natural populations of many species. The evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of such detrimental mutations have been heavily debated\u2014are some lethal mutations under balancing selection? We suggest that mutation\u2013selection balance alone cannot explain lethal variation in nature and the possibility that other forces play a role. We review the potential that linked selection in particular may drive maintenance of lethal alleles through associative overdominance or linkage to beneficial mutations or by reducing effective population size. Over the past five decades, investigation into this mystery has tapered. During this time, key scientific advances have provided the ability to collect more accurate data and analyze them in new ways, making the underlying genetic bases and evolutionary forces of lethal alleles timely for study once more.", "generated_text": "Understanding the maintenance of recessive lethal variation in natural populations remains a fundamental challenge in evolutionary genetics. This study investigates the relative contributions of mutation\u2013selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in preserving lethal alleles. We employ a combination of theoretical modeling and empirical data analysis from diverse species to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this genetic paradox. Our findings suggest that while mutation\u2013selection balance plays a significant role, it alone cannot fully explain observed lethal allele frequencies. We demonstrate that heterozygote advantage, particularly in the context of supergenes, and associative overdominance due to linked selection contribute substantially to the persistence of lethal variants. Furthermore, we explore how population structure and demographic history influence these processes. This integrative approach provides new insights into the complex interplay of evolutionary forces shaping genetic diversity and has important implications for conservation genetics and the management of genetic load in populations.", "label": 1}
