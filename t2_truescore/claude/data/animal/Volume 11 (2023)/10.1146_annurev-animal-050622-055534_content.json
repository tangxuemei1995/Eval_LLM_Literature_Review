{"grounding": "Advances in DNA sequencing and other technologies have greatly facilitated the identification of genetic risk factors for inherited diseases in dogs. We review recent technological developments based on selected examples from canine disease genetics. The identification of disease-causing variants in dogs with monogenic diseases may become a widely employed diagnostic approach in clinical veterinary medicine in the not-too-distant future. Diseases with complex modes of inheritance continue to pose challenges to researchers but have also become much more tangible than in the past. In addition to strategies for identifying genetic risk factors, we provide some thoughts on the interpretation of sequence variants that are largely inspired by developments in human clinical genetics.", "generated_text": "This study investigates genetic risk factors associated with monogenic and complex diseases in Canis lupus familiaris, aiming to advance veterinary medicine and contribute to the One Health approach. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing and genome-wide association studies, we identified novel genetic variants linked to various canine disorders. Our findings provide insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, enhancing precision medicine for dogs. Moreover, the study highlights the value of canine models in understanding analogous human diseases, supporting translational research efforts. By elucidating the genetic basis of canine diseases, this research contributes to improved diagnostic tools, targeted treatments, and breeding strategies, ultimately benefiting both animal and human health within the One Health framework.", "label": 0}
