{"grounding": "Addressing important questions in animal ecology, physiology, and environmental science often requires in situ information from wild animals. This difficulty is being overcome by biologging and biotelemetry, or the use of miniaturized animal-borne sensors. Although early studies recorded only simple parameters of animal movement, advanced devices and analytical methods can now provide rich information on individual and group behavior, internal states, and the surrounding environment of free-ranging animals, especially those in marine systems. We summarize the history of technologies used to track marine animals. We then identify seven major research categories of marine biologging and biotelemetry and explain significant achievements, as well as future opportunities. Big data approaches via international collaborations will be key to tackling global environmental issues (e.g., climate change impacts), and curiosity about the secret lives of marine animals will also remain a major driver of biologging and biotelemetry studies.", "generated_text": "Biologging and biotelemetry have revolutionized our understanding of marine animal behavior and ecology. These technologies enable researchers to remotely collect high-resolution data on animal movements, physiology, and environmental conditions. This review synthesizes recent advances in biologging and biotelemetry applications for studying marine animals. We explore how these tools have enhanced our knowledge of movement ecology, field physiology, predator-prey interactions, and social behaviors in various marine species. Additionally, we discuss the role of biologging in assessing the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on marine ecosystems. The integration of biologging data with other research methods, such as environmental monitoring and genomics, is highlighted as a promising approach for comprehensive ecosystem studies. We conclude by addressing current challenges and future directions in biologging research, emphasizing the need for standardized data sharing and ethical considerations in device deployment.", "label": 1}
