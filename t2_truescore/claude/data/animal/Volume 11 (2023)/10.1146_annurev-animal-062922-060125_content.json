{"grounding": "Zoonoses are diseases and infections naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals. Over the years, zoonoses have become increasingly significant threats to global health. They form the dominant group of diseases among the emerging infectious diseases (EID) and currently account for 73% of EID. Approximately 25% of zoonoses originate in domestic animals. The etiological agents of zoonoses include different pathogens, with viruses accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly, by contact, via aerosols, through a vector, or vertically in utero. Zoonotic diseases are found in every continent except Antarctica. Numerous factors associated with the pathogen, human activities, and the environment play significant roles in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Effective response and control of zoonotic diseases call for multiple-sector involvement and collaboration according to the One Health concept.", "generated_text": "This review explores the critical role of domestic animals as potential reservoirs for zoonotic viral diseases, encompassing both emerging and endemic pathogens. The increasing frequency of zoonotic outbreaks and their potential to escalate into pandemics underscore the importance of understanding the complex interactions between humans, animals, and their shared environments. We examine various domestic species, including livestock and companion animals, as reservoir hosts for viral pathogens capable of crossing species barriers. The review highlights the significance of surveillance, early detection, and intervention strategies within the One Health framework to mitigate the risks associated with zoonotic transmission. By elucidating the mechanisms of viral persistence and adaptation in domestic animal populations, this study aims to inform evidence-based policies and practices for preventing and controlling zoonotic threats, ultimately safeguarding both animal and human health.", "label": 0}
