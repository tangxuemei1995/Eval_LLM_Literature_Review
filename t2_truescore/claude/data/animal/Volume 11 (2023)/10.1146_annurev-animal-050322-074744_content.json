{"grounding": "Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are the longest-lived rodents with a maximum life span exceeding 37 years. They exhibit a delayed aging phenotype and resistance to age-related functional decline/diseases. Specifically, they do not display increased mortality with age, maintain several physiological functions until nearly the end of their lifetime, and rarely develop cancer and Alzheimer's disease. NMRs live in a hypoxic environment in underground colonies in East Africa and are highly tolerant of hypoxia. These unique characteristics of NMRs have attracted considerable interest from zoological and biomedical researchers. This review summarizes previous studies of the ecology, hypoxia tolerance, longevity/delayed aging, and cancer resistance of NMRs and discusses possible mechanisms contributing to their healthy aging. In addition, we discuss current issues and future perspectives to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying delayed aging and resistance to age-related diseases in NMRs.", "generated_text": "The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has emerged as a fascinating model organism for studying healthy aging and longevity. This eusocial rodent exhibits exceptional resistance to cancer, remarkable longevity, and unique adaptations to its subterranean habitat. This review explores the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the naked mole-rat's extraordinary traits, including its enhanced DNA repair mechanisms, hypoxia tolerance, and social structure. We examine how these adaptations contribute to the species' extended healthspan and potential implications for human aging research. Furthermore, we discuss the role of genomic stability, oxidative stress resistance, and proteostasis in the naked mole-rat's cancer resistance and longevity. By understanding the unique biology of this species, researchers aim to uncover novel insights into the aging process and potential therapeutic targets for age-related diseases in humans.", "label": 1}
