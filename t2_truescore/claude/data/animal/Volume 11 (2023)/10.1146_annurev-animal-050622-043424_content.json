{"grounding": "Talpid moles and spotted hyenas have become the paradigms of anatomical and behavioral female masculinization. Females of many mole species develop ovotestes that produce testosterone, show external genitalia that resemble that of males, and close their vaginal orifice after every estrus, and female spotted hyenas lack an external vaginal orifice and develop a pseudoscrotum and a large pseudopenis through which they urinate, mate, and give birth. We review current knowledge about several significant aspects of the biology and evolution of these females, including (a) their specific study methods; (b) their unique anatomical features, and how these peculiarities influence certain physiological functions; and (c) the role that steroid hormones as well as genetic and environmental factors may have in urogenital system development, aggressive behavior, and social dominance. Nevertheless, both mole and hyena females are exceptionally efficient mothers, so their peculiar genitalia should not call into question their femininity.", "generated_text": "This study explores the unique biological adaptations and evolutionary processes that have led to the development of fierce female phenotypes in talpid moles and spotted hyenas. We investigate the phenomenon of female masculinization in these species, focusing on the formation of ovotestes and pseudopenises, as well as the expression of aggressive behavior. Through comparative analysis of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits, we examine the ecological and social factors driving the evolution of these characteristics. Our findings reveal striking parallels between moles and hyenas in terms of androgen exposure during fetal development and its impact on adult phenotypes. We discuss the adaptive significance of these traits in relation to competition for resources, social dominance, and reproductive success. This research contributes to our understanding of sexual dimorphism and the plasticity of mammalian sex determination systems, offering insights into the complex interplay between genetics, hormones, and environment in shaping evolutionary outcomes.", "label": 1}
