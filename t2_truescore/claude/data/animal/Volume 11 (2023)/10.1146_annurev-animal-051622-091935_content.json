{"grounding": "This article addresses the underrepresentation of Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences by challenging the exclusive use of Western scientific paradigms in research and education. Because of the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples, Indigenous perspectives have rarely been represented through empirical study, leading us to believe this is a key reason for the underrepresentation of Native people in these fields. We conducted a literature review, searching for Indigenous contributions in animal sciences and finding a handful of articles in three areas: human\u2013animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Given the interconnected paradigm of Indigenous worldviews, we suggest that the ongoing siloes of scientific disciplines and the hierarchy of methodology contribute to the dearth of Indigenous perspectives. We suggest increased support for proper tribal consultation, contextualization of the history of research in Native communities, and the creation of scholarly spaces to support these conversations.", "generated_text": "This review explores the integration of Indigenous perspectives in animal biosciences, focusing on American Indian and Native American knowledge systems. The study examines the potential contributions of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to modern animal sciences and the One Health approach. By analyzing existing literature and case studies, we highlight the unique insights Indigenous communities offer in understanding animal behavior, ecology, and sustainable management practices. The review also addresses the historical marginalization of Indigenous knowledge in scientific discourse and proposes strategies for more inclusive research methodologies. Our findings suggest that incorporating Indigenous perspectives can enhance animal welfare, conservation efforts, and human-animal relationships. This interdisciplinary approach has implications for improving animal health, ecosystem management, and community well-being, ultimately contributing to a more holistic and culturally sensitive framework in animal biosciences.", "label": 0}
