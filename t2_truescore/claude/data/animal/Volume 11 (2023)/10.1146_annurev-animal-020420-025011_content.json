{"grounding": "Over the past three decades, coronavirus (CoV) diseases have impacted humans more than any other emerging infectious disease. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), has resulted in huge economic disruptions and loss of human lives. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was found to mutate more rapidly due to sustained transmission in humans and potentially animals, resulting in variants of concern (VOCs) that threaten global human health. However, the primary difficulties are filling in the current knowledge gaps in terms of the origin and modalities of emergence for these viruses. Because many CoVs threatening human health are suspected to have a zoonotic origin, identifying the animal hosts implicated in the spillover or spillback events would be beneficial for current pandemic management and to prevent future outbreaks. In this review, wesummarize the animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission of the emerging human CoVs. Finally, we comment on potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOCs and the new SARS-CoV-2 recombinants currently under investigation.", "generated_text": "The emergence of novel human-infecting coronaviruses poses significant global health challenges. This review explores the critical role of animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission in understanding and mitigating the threat of emerging coronaviruses. We examine the latest research on animal models used to study coronavirus pathogenesis and evaluate potential therapeutics. The importance of identifying and monitoring zoonotic reservoirs is highlighted, emphasizing the need for comprehensive surveillance programs in wildlife populations. We analyze the mechanisms of cross-species transmission, including genetic recombination events that facilitate viral adaptation to new hosts. The review also discusses the significance of bat and rodent species as primary reservoirs for coronaviruses and their potential for future spillover events. By synthesizing current knowledge on these interconnected aspects, we provide insights into the complex dynamics of coronavirus emergence and propose strategies for improved preparedness and response to future outbreaks.", "label": 1}
