{"grounding": "In recent years, experiments have documented a new mechanism that leads to failures of profit maximization: the failure of contingent thinking (FCT). This article summarizes key experimental findings, clarifies what constitutes an FCT, and outlines how FCTs can be tested in other environments. Subsequently, we relate FCTs to recent theoretical work on cognitive limitations in behavioral economics. Finally, we connect FCTs to suboptimal behavior documented in applied environments.", "generated_text": "This study explores cognitive limitations in decision-making, focusing on failures of contingent thinking. Through behavioral experiments and cognitive economic analysis, we investigate violations of the sure-thing principle. Results reveal systematic deviations from rational decision-making, highlighting the impact of cognitive constraints on judgment. Our findings contribute to the understanding of human reasoning processes and have implications for economic theory and policy design.", "label": 0}
