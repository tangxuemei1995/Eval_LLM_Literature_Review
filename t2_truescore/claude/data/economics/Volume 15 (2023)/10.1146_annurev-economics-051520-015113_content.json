{"grounding": "Climate change poses an existential threat. Theoretical and empirical research suggest that carbon pricing and green R&D support are the right tools, but their implementation can be improved. Other policies, such as standards, bans, and targeted subsidies, also all have a role to play, but they have often been incoherent, and their implementation is delicate.", "generated_text": "This study examines the comprehensive portfolio of economic policies required to effectively combat climate change. It analyzes the interplay between carbon pricing, green R&D investments, carbon border adjustments, and climate finance mechanisms. The research highlights the importance of a multi-faceted approach in addressing global warming, emphasizing the need for coordinated international efforts to achieve meaningful results.", "label": 0}
