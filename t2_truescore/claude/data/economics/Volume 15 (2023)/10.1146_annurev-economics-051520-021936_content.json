{"grounding": "We attempt to provide a systemic view of the process of regulating collusion, including detection and prosecution as well as bargaining between firms and regulators via consent orders, the production of evidence, and containment measures that may be taken if collusion cannot be addressed with more direct means. In addition, we try to do justice to the peculiarities of the legal system: Modeling the courts as they are, rather than as economists think they should be, is essential for economic analysis to improve the way collusion is regulated.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the challenges of regulating collusion in the modern business landscape. We analyze the impact of the Twombly decision on antitrust litigation and explore the evolving burden of proof in collusion cases. The study investigates the effectiveness of safe tests and consent orders as regulatory tools. Additionally, we consider the emerging role of artificial intelligence in both facilitating and detecting collusive behavior. Our findings suggest a need for more adaptive regulatory approaches to address the complexities of contemporary collusion, balancing deterrence with the promotion of legitimate business practices.", "label": 0}
