{"grounding": "This article reviews economic research on business taxation, with a focus on corporate income taxation. We discuss what this research can contribute to current debates about corporate tax policy and where existing research is incomplete or inconclusive, so that clarification is needed. The issues we discuss include the incidence of the corporate income tax, its effect on investment and economic growth, the problem of international tax avoidance, and the role of corporate taxes in economic crises, including the current debate about taxes on windfall profits.\n", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex dynamics of corporate taxation, focusing on its impact on multinational companies and economic crises. We analyze tax incidence across various stakeholders and explore how corporate tax policies affect business decisions and economic stability. Our findings reveal that the burden of corporate taxation is often shifted to consumers and workers, while multinational firms employ sophisticated strategies to minimize their tax liabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the role of corporate taxation in mitigating or exacerbating economic crises, providing insights for policymakers seeking to balance fiscal needs with economic growth.", "label": 1}
