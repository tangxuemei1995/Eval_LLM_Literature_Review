{"grounding": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator and its demand system are ubiquitous in business cycles theory, macroeconomic growth and development, international trade and other general equilibrium fields; this is because the CES aggregator has many knife-edge properties that help to keep the analysis tractable in the presence of many goods and factors. However, this also makes it hard to tell which properties of CES are responsible for certain results. Furthermore, it is necessary to relax some of those properties for certain applications. In this article, I review several classes of non-CES aggregators, each of which removes some properties of CES and keeps the rest to introduce some flexibility while retaining the tractability of CES as much as possible. These classes are named after the properties of CES they keep. I explain how these classes are related to each other and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses to indicate which classes are suited for which applications.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of non-CES aggregators, exploring their applications in economic modeling beyond the commonly used constant elasticity of substitution framework. We examine various classes of aggregators, including those incorporating nonhomothetic preferences, constant returns to scale production functions, and implicitly additive forms. The study investigates the properties of these aggregators, focusing on their ability to capture gross substitutes and complements, as well as essential and inessential goods. We discuss the theoretical foundations and practical implications of each aggregator type, highlighting their strengths and limitations in modeling complex economic relationships. The paper also addresses the challenges in empirical implementation and estimation of these non-CES aggregators. By synthesizing existing literature and presenting new insights, this guided tour aims to enhance researchers' understanding and facilitate the appropriate selection of aggregators for diverse economic analyses.", "label": 0}
