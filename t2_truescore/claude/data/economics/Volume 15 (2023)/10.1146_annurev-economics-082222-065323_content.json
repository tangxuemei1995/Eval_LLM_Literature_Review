{"grounding": "This article surveys the development of nonparametric models and methods for estimation of choice models with nonlinear budget sets. The discussion focuses on the budget set regression, that is, the conditional expectation of a choice variable given the budget set. Utility maximization in a nonparametric model with general heterogeneity reduces the curse of dimensionality in this regression. Empirical results using this regression are different from maximum likelihood and give informative inference. The article also considers the information provided by kink probabilities for nonparametric utility with general heterogeneity. Instrumental variable estimation and the evidence it provides of heterogeneity in preferences are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the econometric analysis of nonlinear budget sets in consumer choice models. We develop a random utility framework to estimate preferences and welfare effects in the presence of complex budget constraints. Our approach combines bunching techniques with instrumental variables to address endogeneity concerns and identify structural parameters. We demonstrate the model's applicability using simulated data and an empirical application to labor supply decisions under progressive taxation. The results reveal significant nonlinear responses to budget set kinks and provide insights into optimal tax design. Our methodology offers a flexible tool for analyzing consumer behavior and policy impacts in various economic contexts with nonlinear incentives.", "label": 1}
