{"grounding": "International trade contributes directly to global greenhouse gas emissions, as the carbon content of high-emission products is priced differently in different countries. This phenomenon is termed carbon leakage. Thus, not putting a price on carbon is theoretically equivalent to an export subsidy, although that would be difficult to challenge in the context of multilateral trade law. Leakage can be alleviated by pricing the carbon embedded in imported products through a border carbon adjustment (BCA), be it a tax, a carbon tariff, or a regulation requiring the purchase of emissions allowances. The design of a BCA is a compromise between environmental effectiveness in preventing leakage, economic effectiveness in preserving competitiveness and ensuring acceptability, technical feasibility of the implementation, and World Trade Organization compatibility. An import-limited BCA is more effective than free emissions allowances in reducing leakage, but it does not preserve the export competitiveness of the country imposing it.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the economic rationale and potential impacts of border carbon adjustment (BCA) mechanisms in climate policy. As countries implement diverse carbon pricing strategies, concerns about carbon leakage and competitiveness have led to growing interest in BCAs. We analyze the theoretical foundations of BCAs, their compatibility with international trade rules, and their potential effectiveness in reducing global emissions. Using a computable general equilibrium model, we simulate various BCA scenarios to assess their impacts on trade flows, emissions, and economic welfare across countries. Our results suggest that while BCAs can mitigate carbon leakage to some extent, their effectiveness depends on design features and the formation of climate clubs. We find that BCAs may have distributional consequences, potentially affecting developing countries disproportionately. The paper concludes by discussing policy implications and areas for future research on optimizing BCA design.", "label": 1}
