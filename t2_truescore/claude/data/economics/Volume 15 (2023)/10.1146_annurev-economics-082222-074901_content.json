{"grounding": "Over the last two decades, the unprecedented increase in non-bank financial intermediation, particularly the rise of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, accounts for nearly half of the external financing flows to emerging markets, exceeding cross-border lending by global banks. Evidence suggests that investment fund flows enhance risk sharing across borders and provide emerging markets access to more diverse forms of financing. However, a growing body of evidence also indicates that investment funds are inherently more vulnerable to liquidity and redemption risks during periods of global financial market stress, increasing the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. Benchmark-driven investments, namely passive funds, appear particularly sensitive to global risk shocks, such as tightening US dollar funding conditions, compared to their active fund counterparts. The procyclicality of investment fund flows to emerging markets during times of global stress poses financial stability concerns, with implications for the role of macroprudential policy.", "generated_text": "This study examines the role of non-bank financial intermediation in transmitting global risk shocks to emerging markets. We focus on investment funds as key players in international capital flows and analyze their impact on emerging market vulnerabilities. Using a comprehensive dataset of fund flows and holdings, we investigate how benchmark investing and global risk perceptions influence capital allocation decisions. Our findings reveal that non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly investment funds, amplify the transmission of global risk shocks to emerging markets. We document significant tail risk spillovers and demonstrate how benchmark-driven investing can exacerbate market volatility during periods of heightened global uncertainty. The results highlight the need for policymakers to consider the growing importance of non-bank financial intermediation in assessing and mitigating emerging market vulnerabilities to global risk shocks.", "label": 0}
