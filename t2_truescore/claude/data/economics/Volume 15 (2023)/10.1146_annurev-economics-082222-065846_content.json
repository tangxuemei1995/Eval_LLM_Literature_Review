{"grounding": "The dynamic causal effect of an intervention on an outcome is of paramount interest to applied macro- and microeconomics research. However, this question has been generally approached differently by the two literatures. In making the transition from traditional time series methods to applied microeconometrics, local projections can serve as a natural bridge. Local projections can translate the familiar language of vector autoregressions and impulse responses into the language of potential outcomes and treatment effects. There are gains to be made by both literatures from greater integration of well-established methods in each. This review shows how to make these connections and points to potential areas of further research.", "generated_text": "This paper introduces local projections as a flexible and robust alternative to vector autoregressions (VARs) in applied economics research. We demonstrate how local projections can be used to estimate impulse response functions in both time series and panel data settings. The method's key advantage lies in its ability to accommodate non-linear and state-dependent relationships, making it particularly useful for analyzing complex economic dynamics. We also show how local projections can be integrated with the potential outcomes framework, allowing for causal inference in observational studies. Through empirical examples and Monte Carlo simulations, we illustrate the method's performance relative to traditional VAR approaches and highlight its applicability across various economic contexts.", "label": 1}
