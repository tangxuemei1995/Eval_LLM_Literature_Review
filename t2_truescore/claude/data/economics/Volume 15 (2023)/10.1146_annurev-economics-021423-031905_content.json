{"grounding": "This article compares early childhood enrichment programs that promote social mobility for disadvantaged children within and across generations. Instead of conducting a standard meta-analysis, we present a harmonized primary data analysis of programs that shape current policy. Our analysis is a template for rigorous syntheses and comparisons across programs. We analyze new long-run life-cycle data collected for iconic programs when participants are middle-aged and their children are in their twenties. The iconic programs are omnibus in nature and offer many services to children and their parents. We compare them with relatively low-cost, more focused home-visiting programs. Participants in programs that enrich home environments grow up with better skills, jobs, earnings, marital stability, and health, as well as reduced participation in crime. The long-run monetized gains are substantially greater than the costs of the iconic programs. A study of focused home-visiting programs that target parents enables us to isolate a crucial component of successful programs: They activate and promote the parenting skills of child caregivers. The home-visiting programs we analyze produce outcomes comparable to those of the iconic omnibus programs. National implementation of the programs with long-run follow-up that we analyze would substantially shrink the overall Black-White earnings gap in the United States.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of parenting in promoting social mobility within and across generations. Drawing on longitudinal data from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, we examine how parenting practices influence the development of crucial skills that contribute to social mobility. Our findings reveal that effective parenting strategies, such as fostering cognitive and non-cognitive skills, significantly enhance children's prospects for upward mobility. We observe that parents who actively engage in their children's education, provide emotional support, and create stimulating home environments contribute to narrowing the skills gap between advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Furthermore, our intergenerational analysis demonstrates that positive parenting practices can break cycles of inequality by equipping children with the tools necessary to overcome socioeconomic barriers. The study also highlights the importance of early intervention programs and parental support initiatives in reducing disparities in human development. These results underscore the critical role of parenting in shaping social mobility outcomes and suggest that targeted interventions to improve parenting skills could be a powerful lever for addressing persistent inequalities in society.", "label": 0}
