{"grounding": "In this article we survey recent advances in the economic theory of cultural transmission. We highlight three main themes on which the literature has made great progress in the last 10 years: the domain of traits subject to cultural transmission; the microfoundations for the technology of transmission; and feedback effects between culture, institutions, and various socioeconomic environments. We conclude by suggesting interesting areas for future research.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews recent advances in the economic theory of cultural transmission, focusing on the evolution of institutions. We examine models that explore how cultural traits and institutional norms are passed between generations and across populations. The analysis encompasses the roles of social learning, network effects, and economic incentives in shaping cultural dynamics. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding cultural transmission mechanisms for predicting institutional change and designing effective policies.", "label": 0}
