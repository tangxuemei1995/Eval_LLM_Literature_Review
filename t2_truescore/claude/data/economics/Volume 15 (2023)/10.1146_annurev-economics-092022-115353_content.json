{"grounding": "Gender differences in negotiation are seen as contributing to the persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes. We review the literature on interventions aiming to mute differences in negotiation and assess their effectiveness in reducing the gender pay gap. We present research on initiatives that aspire to increase how often and how women negotiate, as well as institutional changes that ban negotiations, ban requests for employee salary history, and improve wage transparency. Along with reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of these initiatives, we point to unintended consequences that warrant caution at implementation. The review makes clear that initial efforts to push women to negotiate more like men have shifted to alter instead the conditions of the negotiation. This shift results not only from wanting to consider policies that \u201cfix the institutions\u201d rather than \u201cfixing the women,\u201d but also from evidence that these interventions are more successful in securing pay equity.", "generated_text": "This study examines gender differences in negotiation outcomes and explores potential interventions to reduce the persistent gap. Drawing on a comprehensive review of literature and empirical data, we investigate the effectiveness of three interventions: negotiation training, banning salary history inquiries, and increasing pay transparency. Our findings suggest that while each intervention shows promise, their impact varies. Negotiation training appears to boost women's confidence and assertiveness, narrowing the gender gap in bargaining outcomes. Banning salary history inquiries helps prevent the perpetuation of past wage disparities. Pay transparency initiatives demonstrate mixed results, with some evidence of reduced gender pay gaps but potential unintended consequences. We conclude that a multi-faceted approach combining these interventions may be most effective in addressing gender disparities in negotiation outcomes. Future research should focus on long-term effects and potential synergies between interventions.", "label": 1}
