{"grounding": "We review the class of materials known as polar metals, in which polarity and metallicity coexist in the same phase. While the notion of polar metals was first invoked more than 50 years ago, their practical realization has proved challenging since the itinerant carriers required for metallicity tend to screen any polarization. Huge progress has been made in the last decade, with many mechanisms for combining polarity and metallicity proposed and the first examples, LiOsO3 and WTe2, identified experimentally. The availability of polar metallic samples has opened a new paradigm in polar metal research, with implications in the fields of topology, ferroelectricity, magnetoelectricity, spintronics, and superconductivity. Here, we review the principles and techniques that have been developed to design and engineer polar metals and describe some of their interesting properties, with a focus on the most promising directions for future work.", "generated_text": "Polar metals, materials that exhibit both metallic conductivity and polar structural distortions, have emerged as a fascinating class of compounds with unique physical properties. This review explores the fundamental principles underlying polar metals and their potential applications. We discuss the apparent contradiction between metallicity and ferroelectricity, and how it can be resolved through various mechanisms, including improper ferroelectricity. The role of perovskite structures in realizing polar metals is examined, along with the challenges in measuring and characterizing polarization in these materials. Recent advances in synthesis techniques and theoretical predictions of new polar metal candidates are highlighted. Finally, we consider the prospects of polar metals in next-generation electronic devices, spintronics, and quantum computing applications, emphasizing the need for further research to fully harness their potential.", "label": 1}
