{"grounding": "Natural wood has been used for construction, fuel, and furniture for thousands of years because of its versatility, renewability, and aesthetic appeal. However, new opportunities for wood are arising as researchers have developed ways to tune the material's optical, thermal, mechanical, and ionic transport properties by chemically and physically modifying wood's naturally porous structure and chemical composition. Such modifications can be used to produce sustainable, functional materials for various emerging applications such as automobiles, construction, energy storage, and environmental remediation. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in engineered wood for sustainable technologies, including thermal and light management, environmental remediation, nanofluidics, batteries, and structural materials with high strength-to-weight ratios. Additionally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future of wood research are discussed, providing a guideline for the further development of next-generation, sustainable wood-based materials.", "generated_text": "Engineered wood has emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to traditional building materials, offering enhanced performance and environmental benefits. This review explores recent advancements in engineered wood technologies, focusing on nanocellulose-based composites and transparent wood. We examine the production methods, mechanical properties, and potential applications of these innovative materials. The integration of nanocellulose into engineered wood products significantly improves strength, durability, and fire resistance. Transparent wood, a novel material with unique optical and thermal properties, shows potential for energy-efficient building envelopes and solar energy harvesting. We also discuss the sustainability aspects of engineered wood, including its reduced carbon footprint and potential for thermal management in buildings. The growing adoption of these technologies in construction and other industries highlights the importance of continued research and development in this field.", "label": 1}
