{"grounding": "If variety is the spice of life, then abnormal grain growth (AGG) may be the materials processing equivalent of sriracha sauce. Abnormally growing grains can be prismatic, dendritic, or practically any shape in between. When they grow at least an order of magnitude larger than their neighbors in the matrix\u2014a state we call extreme AGG\u2014we can examine the abnormal/matrix interface for clues to the underlying mechanism. Simulating AGG for various formulations of the grain boundary (GB) equation of motion, we show that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy leave a characteristic fingerprint in the abnormal/matrix boundary. Except in the case of prismatic growth, the morphological signature of most reported instances of AGG is consistent with a certain degree of GB mobility variability. Open questions remain, however, concerning the mechanism by which the corresponding growth advantage is established and maintained as the GBs of abnormal grains advance through the matrix.", "generated_text": "Extreme abnormal grain growth (EAGG) is a fascinating phenomenon in materials science that results in the formation of exceptionally large grains within a fine-grained matrix. This review explores the underlying mechanisms and microstructural outcomes of EAGG, focusing on the interplay between grain boundary energy, mobility, and Zener pinning effects. We examine how these factors contribute to the initiation and propagation of EAGG, and discuss the role of crystallographic texture, impurities, and processing conditions in influencing the final microstructure. The review also highlights recent advances in experimental techniques and computational modeling that have enhanced our understanding of EAGG. By connecting mechanisms to microstructural outcomes, this work provides valuable insights for tailoring material properties and controlling grain growth in various engineering applications, from aerospace alloys to electronic materials.", "label": 1}
