{"grounding": "Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) materials feature an exciting array of functionalities such as nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and topological spin textures (skyrmions). While NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions display two different sets of physical properties, their design strategies are deeply connected in terms of atomic-scale precision, structural customization, and electronic tunability. Despite impressive progress in studying these systems separately, a joint road map for navigating the chemical principles for NCS materials remains elusive. This review unites two subtopics of NCS systems, NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions, offering a multifaceted narrative of how to translate the often-abstract fundamentals to the targeted functionalities while inviting innovative approaches from the community. We outline the design principles central to the desired properties by exemplifying relevant examples in the field. We supplement materials chemistry with pertinent electronic structures to demonstrate the power of the fundamentals to create systems integration relevant to foreseeable societal impacts in frequency-doubling instrumentation and spin-based electronics.", "generated_text": "Noncentrosymmetric materials have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in various fields. This review explores the design principles for creating and optimizing noncentrosymmetric materials, focusing on their nonlinear optical responses, magnetic properties, and topological features. We discuss the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation of skyrmions and their topological protection in these materials. The relationship between crystal structure and electronic properties is examined, highlighting the role of symmetry breaking in enhancing desired characteristics. Additionally, we analyze the interplay between noncentrosymmetry and magnetism, and its impact on the materials' functional properties.
