{"grounding": "High-throughput data generation methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms have given rise to a new era of computational materials science by learning the relations between composition, structure, and properties and by exploiting such relations for design. However, to build these connections, materials data must be translated into a numerical form, called a representation, that can be processed by an ML model. Data sets in materials science vary in format (ranging from images to spectra), size, and fidelity. Predictive models vary in scope and properties of interest. Here, we review context-dependent strategies for constructing representations that enable the use of materials as inputs or outputs for ML models. Furthermore, we discuss how modern ML techniques can learn representations from data and transfer chemical and physical information between tasks. Finally, we outline high-impact questions that have not been fully resolved and thus require further investigation.", "generated_text": "This review explores the crucial role of material representations in machine learning applications for materials science. We examine various approaches to feature engineering, focusing on methods that capture essential characteristics of crystal structures and chemical compositions. The paper discusses traditional descriptors as well as advanced techniques, including graph-based representations and generative models. We analyze the strengths and limitations of different representation methods, considering their ability to encode complex structural and chemical information. The impact of these representations on the performance of machine learning models for predicting material properties and discovering novel materials is evaluated. Furthermore, we highlight recent developments in representation learning and their potential to revolutionize materials informatics. This comprehensive overview aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate representations for their specific materials science problems and to inspire future advancements in the field.", "label": 1}
