{"grounding": "Grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials migrate to reduce the total excess energy. It has recently been found that the factors governing migration rates of boundaries in bicrystals are insufficient to explain boundary migration in polycrystals. We first review our current understanding of the atomistic mechanisms of grain boundary migration based on simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. We then review our current understanding at the continuum scale based on simulations and observations using high-energy diffraction microscopy. We conclude that detailed comparisons of experimental observations with atomistic simulations of migration in polycrystals (rather than bicrystals) are required to better understand the mechanisms of grain boundary migration, that the driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals must include factors other than curvature, and that current simulations of grain growth are insufficient for reproducing experimental observations, possibly because of an inadequate representation of the driving force.", "generated_text": "Grain boundary migration plays a crucial role in the evolution of microstructure and properties of polycrystalline materials. This review examines recent advances in understanding the mechanisms and kinetics of grain boundary migration during grain growth in polycrystals. We discuss the influence of various factors, including temperature, impurities, and applied stress, on the mobility and migration behavior of grain boundaries. The review highlights the importance of atomistic simulations and in situ experimental techniques in elucidating the fundamental processes governing grain boundary motion. Additionally, we explore the relationship between grain boundary character and migration rates, emphasizing the role of grain boundary energy and crystallographic orientation. The implications of grain boundary migration on the overall microstructural evolution and resulting material properties are also addressed. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex nature of grain boundary migration and its significance in materials science and engineering.", "label": 1}
