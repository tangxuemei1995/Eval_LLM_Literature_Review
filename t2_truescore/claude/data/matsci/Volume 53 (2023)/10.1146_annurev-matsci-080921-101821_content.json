{"grounding": "Owing to its unique structure, morphology, and crystal quality, low-dimensional (L-D) ice has attracted increasing attention in recent years. With a size (at least in one dimension) between that of a single water molecule and a snowflake, L-D ice does not only appear as an intermediate state during the dimensional change but can also manifest extraordinary characteristics, from its molecular structures to its physical properties, which offer exciting opportunities for a better understanding and utilization of ice. In this article, we start with a brief introduction to the crystal growth, structure, and typical characterization techniques of ice and then review recent progress in the study of crystal growth, molecular structures, phase morphologies, and physical properties of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional (0-, 1-, and 2D) ice. Extraordinary behaviors of ice in low dimensions and extreme conditions are highlighted. Finally, the future outlook for the physical study and technological applications of L-D ice is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the formation, structure, and properties of low-dimensional and confined ice systems. We explore the crystal growth mechanisms and morphological characteristics of ice in restricted geometries, such as nanopores, thin films, and interfaces. Advanced characterization techniques, including spectroscopy and microscopy, are employed to analyze the unique structural features of these confined ice formations. The research reveals significant deviations in the optical and mechanical properties of low-dimensional ice compared to bulk ice. We observe altered phase transitions, enhanced proton ordering, and modified hydrogen bonding networks in these confined systems. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of ice behavior in nanoscale environments, with implications for fields such as materials science, atmospheric chemistry, and biological systems. This work provides valuable insights into the fundamental nature of water in restricted spaces and opens new avenues for manipulating ice properties through dimensional confinement.", "label": 0}
