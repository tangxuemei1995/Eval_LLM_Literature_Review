{"grounding": "Most heterogeneous catalytic processes occur between combinations of gases, liquids, and solids at elevated temperatures. They play a critical role for society in energy production, health care, a cleaner environment, industrial products, food, fuel cells, battery technologies, and photocatalysis. Dynamic gas\u2013solid catalyst reactions take place at the atomic level, with active catalyst structures forming, and often also progressively and competitively deactivating, under reaction conditions. There is increasing evidence that single atoms and small clusters of atoms can act as primary active sites in catalytic reactions. Understanding and directing the reactions at the atomic level under controlled operating conditions are crucial for the development of improved materials and processes. We review advances in dynamic in situ microscopy for directly probing heterogeneous catalysis at the atomic level in live action and real time. Benefits include new knowledge and improved management of process fundamentals for greater efficiency and sustainability.", "generated_text": "Dynamic in situ electron microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of single-atom catalysis, offering unprecedented insights into real-time chemical processes at the atomic scale. This review explores recent developments in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the ability to observe and analyze catalytic reactions as they unfold. We discuss cutting-edge techniques that enable the visualization of individual atoms during catalytic events, providing crucial information about reaction mechanisms, intermediate states, and catalyst stability. The integration of environmental chambers and advanced detectors has facilitated the study of catalysts under realistic operating conditions, bridging the gap between idealized models and practical applications. By elucidating the dynamic behavior of single-atom catalysts, these advancements are revolutionizing catalyst design and optimization, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable chemical processes across various industries.", "label": 0}
