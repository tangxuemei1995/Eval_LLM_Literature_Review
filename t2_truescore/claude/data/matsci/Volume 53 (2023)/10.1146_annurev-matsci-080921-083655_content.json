{"grounding": "The increasing consumption of nonrenewable materials urgently calls for the design and fabrication of sustainable alternatives. New generations of materials should be derived from renewable sources, processed using environmentally friendly methods, and designed considering their full life cycle, especially their end-of-life fate. Here, we review recent advances in developing sustainable polymers from biological matter (biomatter), including progress in the extraction and utilization of bioderived monomers and polymers, as well as the emergence of polymers produced directly from unprocessed biomatter (entire cells or tissues). We also discuss applications of sustainable polymers in bioplastics, biocomposites, and cementitious biomaterials, with emphasis on relating their performance to underlying fundamental mechanisms. Finally, we provide a future outlook for sustainable material development, highlighting the need for more accurate and accessible tools for assessing life-cycle impacts and socioeconomic challenges as this field advances.", "generated_text": "This review explores recent advancements in sustainable polymers derived from biological matter, addressing the growing demand for eco-friendly materials. We examine the development of biopolymers and biocomposites, focusing on their applications in various industries, including construction and packaging. The utilization of renewable resources in polymer synthesis is discussed, highlighting the potential for reducing environmental impact and fossil fuel dependence. Particular attention is given to the incorporation of biological matter in cementitious materials, showcasing innovative approaches to enhance sustainability in the built environment. The review also evaluates the challenges and opportunities associated with scaling up production and improving the performance of bio-based polymers. By synthesizing current research, this work provides insights into the future of sustainable materials and their role in promoting a circular economy.", "label": 1}
