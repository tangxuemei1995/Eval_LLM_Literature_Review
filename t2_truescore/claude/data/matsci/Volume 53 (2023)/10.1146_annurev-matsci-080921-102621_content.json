{"grounding": "Advanced experimental and numerical approaches are being developed to capture the localization of plasticity at the nanometer scale as a function of the multiscale and heterogeneous microstructure present in metallic materials. These innovative approaches promise new avenues to understand microstructural effects on mechanical properties, accelerate alloy design, and enable more accurate mechanical property prediction. This article provides an overview of emerging approaches with a focus on the localization of plasticity by crystallographic slip. New insights into the mechanisms and mechanics of strain localization are addressed. The consequences of the localization of plasticity by deformation slip for mechanical properties of metallic materials are also detailed.", "generated_text": "This review explores recent advancements in understanding plastic localization through crystallographic slip in metallic materials. We examine emerging experimental techniques, including high-resolution digital image correlation and in-situ electron microscopy, which provide unprecedented insights into slip behavior at micro- and nanoscales. Complementary numerical approaches, such as crystal plasticity finite element modeling and atomistic simulations, are discussed for their ability to predict and interpret complex slip patterns. The synergy between these experimental and computational methods has significantly enhanced our comprehension of how slip localization influences mechanical properties and overall plasticity in metals. This improved understanding is crucial for developing more accurate models of material behavior and designing materials with tailored mechanical properties.", "label": 1}
