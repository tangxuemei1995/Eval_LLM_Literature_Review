{"grounding": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have found a role in crystal morphology engineering and control by specific binding to crystal surfaces through stereo-chemical recognition. The utility of TMAs, however, has been largely limited to crystal growth from solutions. In this review, we illustrate examples where TMAs have been used to influence the growth of crystals during cooling of their melts. In solution, the crystal growth driving force is governed by solute supersaturation, which corresponds to the deviation from equilibrium. In growth from melts, however, undercooling is the important thermodynamic parameter responsible for crystallization outcomes, a key difference that can influence the manner in which TMAs affect growth kinetics, crystal morphology, nucleation, enantioselective surface recognition, and the determination of the absolute sense of polar axes. When the crystallization driving force in a melt is small and diffusion is comparatively high, TMAs can exert their influence on well-faceted single crystals with the stereochemical richness observed in solution growth. Under high supercooling, where the driving force is large, ensembles of crystals can grow radially, masking stereochemical information and requiring new optical tools for understanding the influence of TMAs on emerging crystals.", "generated_text": "This review explores the potential and limitations of tailor-made additives in melt-grown molecular crystals, a field that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. We examine the fundamental principles governing the interaction between additives and growing crystal faces during melt crystallization, focusing on their effects on spherulite formation, crystal twisting, and the emergence of chirality and polarity. The review critically assesses the current understanding of additive-induced modifications in crystal morphology, growth kinetics, and internal structure. We discuss the challenges in designing effective tailor-made additives for melt systems, including considerations of thermal stability, miscibility, and selective adsorption. The potential applications of this approach in controlling crystal properties for various industrial and technological purposes are highlighted. Additionally, we address the limitations and open questions in this field, emphasizing the need for further research to fully exploit the potential of tailor-made additives in melt crystallization processes. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the current state of the art and future directions in this promising area of crystal engineering.", "label": 1}
