{"grounding": "We take stock of the major changes in methodology for studying the impacts of international agricultural research, focusing on the period 2006\u20132020. Impact assessment of agricultural research has a long and recognized tradition. Until the mid-2000s, such assessments were dominated by a model of demand for and supply of agricultural products in partial equilibrium. The basic ideas for this approach were sketched out by Griliches more than half a century ago. We describe the implications of heightened standards of evidence for good practice in three domains of research design: causal inference, valid measurement, and statistical representativeness. We document advances in each of these domains and review recent evidence that demonstrates the lessons that can be learned from adopting these practices, emphasizing the importance of evidence at-scale, the need to consider portfolios of innovations at a national level, and the challenges of accounting for innovations that are promoted as bundles.", "generated_text": "The international agricultural research community is experiencing a paradigm shift in impact assessment, driven by demands for more rigorous evidence of research outcomes. This paper examines the emerging 'rigor revolution' in agricultural research for development, focusing on new standards for measurement, causality, and scale in impact evaluations. We analyze the drivers behind this shift, including increased donor scrutiny and the influence of methodological advances from other disciplines. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by these new standards, such as balancing scientific rigor with practical constraints in developing country contexts. We explore innovative approaches to impact assessment, including mixed-methods designs and novel data collection techniques. Finally, we consider the implications of this revolution for research organizations, policymakers, and practitioners, emphasizing the need for capacity building and adaptive learning to meet evolving expectations for evidence-based decision-making in agricultural development.", "label": 1}
