{"grounding": "Based on an extensive literature review and publicly available data, this article provides insights into the differences in prevalence, sociodemographics, contributing factors, socioeconomic consequences, health effects, and public policies related to obesity between developed and developing countries. Most importantly, it explores the relationship between obesity and life expectancy and identifies potential mechanisms through which obesity affects mortality, highlighting the differences between developed and developing countries and by gender. It also examines how the associations between obesity and life expectancy differ at the population level compared with the individual level. The evidence shows a negative association between obesity and longevity, as well as an increased risk of various diseases with the rising rates of obesity. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing countries and by gender. The article also discusses the effectiveness of various policies adopted to address obesity and provides suggestions to address obesity problems and improve health and well-being in these countries.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy across developed and developing countries. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning 195 countries from 1990 to 2020, we employ panel data analysis and machine learning techniques to examine the complex relationship between obesity rates and life expectancy. Our findings reveal significant disparities in the impact of obesity on longevity between high-income and low-income nations. While obesity consistently negatively affects life expectancy in developed countries, its influence in developing nations is more nuanced, often interacting with other socioeconomic and health factors. We observe that the obesity-mortality link is moderated by healthcare quality, nutritional transitions, and economic development stages. These results highlight the need for tailored public health interventions that consider the varying contexts of obesity's impact on life expectancy across different global regions. Our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the global obesity epidemic and its implications for population health and longevity.", "label": 1}
