{"grounding": "Agroecology is often considered as the ultimate and most comprehensive solution to the many challenges of the agricultural and food system, also referred to as the agri-food system. This review investigates to what extent agroecology can become the mainstream model for transforming agriculture toward more sustainable and resilient agri-food systems within the given economic and political context. We find that enhancing agroecology will require a fully integrated multiscale systems approach from farm to region to globe. The approach must consider relevant processes and relationships, actors and stakeholders as well as drivers, sustainability indicators, and the respective assessment methods across all scales. Giving specific attention to drivers related to economy, technology, and policy we point out that agroecology needs to be economically viable for farmers and other food system actors. In particular, new and emerging technologies related to digitalization and breeding should be given more consideration in agroecological transformation. We stress the need for an analytical and operational framework and adequate multiscale policy design and suggest six areas of needed attention to support the large-scale adoption of agroecology.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the potential of agroecology as a transformative approach to achieve sustainable agriculture and food systems. We examine the principles and practices of agroecology across multiple scales, from local initiatives to large-scale adoption. The study emphasizes the importance of multiactor approaches in implementing agroecological solutions, involving farmers, researchers, policymakers, and consumers. We analyze the role of agricultural and food policies in supporting agroecological transitions and discuss the challenges and opportunities for integrating agroecology into existing farming systems. The paper also investigates the synergies between agroecology and emerging technologies, such as precision agriculture and digital tools, in enhancing sustainability and resilience. Our findings suggest that agroecology offers a holistic framework for agricultural transformation, addressing environmental, social, and economic dimensions of food production. We conclude by proposing policy recommendations and research priorities to facilitate the widespread adoption of agroecological practices and their integration into sustainable food systems.", "label": 1}
