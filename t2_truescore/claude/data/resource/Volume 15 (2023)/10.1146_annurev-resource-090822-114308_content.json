{"grounding": "This review evaluates three micro and three macro estimation approaches to determine whether unrealistic differences exist in estimating the size of nonobserved/shadow economies. While some macro-MIMIC estimates are higher than estimates using the statistical discrepancy approach, when adjusting for double-counting, MIMIC approaches provide similar results. Macro approaches usually cover not only typical shadow economy activities, but also voluntary work, do-it-yourself activities, and classical crime activities; by nature, macro approaches will lead to higher and more accurate estimates than micro approaches. However, if certain adjustments are made, the estimated size of the shadow economy using the MIMIC approach comes close to the size of the shadow economy indicated by micro survey approaches. Hence, claims that macro approaches are unrealistically high and rely on unrealistic assumptions must be reconsidered.", "generated_text": "This study investigates whether various estimation methods yield significantly different results in measuring the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. We compare four prominent approaches: MIMIC estimation, micro survey, survey technique, and consumption-income gap. Analyzing data from multiple countries over a 20-year period, we find substantial discrepancies in shadow economy estimates across methods. The MIMIC approach consistently produces higher estimates compared to survey-based techniques, while the consumption-income gap method yields intermediate results. These differences persist even after controlling for country-specific factors and time trends. Our findings suggest that the choice of estimation method significantly influences the perceived size of shadow economies, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting and comparing results across studies. We conclude that a multi-method approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding of shadow economic activities.", "label": 1}
