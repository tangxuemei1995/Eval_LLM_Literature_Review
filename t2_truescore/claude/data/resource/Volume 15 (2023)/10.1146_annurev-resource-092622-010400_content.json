{"grounding": "Traditionally, competition law and practice serve to preserve competition, with a focus on the maximization of consumer welfare. This has been criticized as conflicting with society's overarching goal of achieving greater (environmental) sustainability. Consequently, various jurisdictions have recently reformed their laws and guidance allowing them to account for sustainability benefits in the assessment of cooperation between competitors, with potentially considerable implications for how firms can jointly develop and introduce more sustainable technologies and products. This has opened a new research frontier in the long-standing tradition of marrying the theory of industrial organization with the field of environmental and resource economics. The consideration of sustainability benefits in competition analysis also requires both the transfer and adaptation of measurement techniques. We summarize recent developments and sketch potential research opportunities.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, exploring how antitrust frameworks can accommodate and promote green initiatives. We analyze the potential for sustainability agreements among firms and their impact on market competition. The study investigates the role of firm green preferences in shaping industrial organization and competitive dynamics. We develop a theoretical model that incorporates environmental considerations into traditional competition analysis, highlighting the trade-offs between economic efficiency and sustainability goals. Our findings suggest that current antitrust policies may need to be adapted to encourage cooperative environmental efforts without compromising market competition. We propose policy recommendations to balance these objectives, emphasizing the importance of clear guidelines for sustainability agreements and the integration of environmental factors into competition assessments.", "label": 0}
