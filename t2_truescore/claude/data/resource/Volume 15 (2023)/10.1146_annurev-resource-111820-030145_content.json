{"grounding": "Having experienced low prices for about a decade, the European Union Emissions Trading System has been supplemented with the market stability reserve (MSR) that adjusts the supply of allowances to market outcomes. We critically review the literature assessing the performance of the MSR against several policy objectives. In doing so, we cover both conceptual aspects and quantitative assessments. We conclude by pointing out important policy implications and open issues for further research.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) in the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). We analyze the MSR's effectiveness in addressing allowance surplus and price volatility, considering its interaction with overlapping climate policies. Our findings suggest that while the MSR has improved market stability, challenges remain in balancing short-term price signals with long-term emissions reduction goals. We propose potential refinements to enhance the MSR's performance and overall EU ETS efficiency.", "label": 0}
