{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the recent economics literature analyzing the effect of air pollution on health outcomes. We review the common approaches to measuring and modeling air pollution exposures and the epidemiological and biological literature on health outcomes that undergird federal air regulations in the United States. The article contrasts the methods used in the epidemiology literature with the causal inference framework used in economics. In particular, we review the common sources of estimation bias in epidemiological approaches that the economics literature has sought to overcome with research designs that take advantage of natural experiments. We review new promising research designs for estimating concentration-response functions and identify areas for further research.", "generated_text": "This review examines recent advances in causal inference methodologies applied to the study of air pollution's health impacts. We explore how natural experiments, quasi-experimental designs, and novel statistical approaches have enhanced our understanding of the causal relationships between air pollutants and various health outcomes. The integration of these methods with traditional epidemiological approaches and the incorporation of findings into integrated science assessments are discussed. We highlight key studies that have leveraged these techniques to address confounding and strengthen causal claims. The review also considers the challenges and limitations of these methods, as well as their potential to inform evidence-based policy decisions aimed at mitigating the health effects of air pollution.", "label": 1}
