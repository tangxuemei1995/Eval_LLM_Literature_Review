{"grounding": "Identifying mechanisms of real-life human decision-making is central to inform effective, human-centric public policy. Here, we report larger trends and synthesize preliminary lessons from behavioral economic and neuro-economic investigations focusing on environmental values. We review the currently available evidence at different levels of granularity, from insights into how individuals value natural resources (individual level), evidence from work on group externalities, common pool resources, and social norms (social group level) to the study of incentives, policies, and their impact (institutional level). At each level, we identify viable directions for future scientific research and actionable items for policy-makers. Coupled with new technological and methodological advances, we suggest that behavioral economic and neuroeconomic insights may inform an effective strategy to optimize environmental resources. We conclude that the time is ripe for action to enrich policies with scientifically grounded insights, making an impact in the interest of current and future generations.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, and environmental values to better understand individual decision-making processes regarding common pool resources. By integrating insights from cognitive neuroscience and economic theory, we investigate how neural mechanisms and cognitive biases influence environmental value judgments and subsequent behaviors. Our research employs a combination of neuroimaging techniques and experimental economic games to examine the neural correlates of environmental decision-making. Results reveal that specific brain regions associated with reward processing and social cognition play crucial roles in shaping environmental values. Furthermore, we identify key cognitive biases that impact resource allocation decisions and propose potential interventions to promote more sustainable behaviors. These findings have important implications for environmental policy design, suggesting that incorporating behavioral and neurological factors can lead to more effective and targeted conservation strategies.", "label": 0}
