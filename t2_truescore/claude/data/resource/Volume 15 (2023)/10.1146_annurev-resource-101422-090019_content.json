{"grounding": "More than five billion metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually worldwide. Despite having multiple uses and significant potential to augment crop and livestock production, a large share of crop residues is burned, especially in Asian countries. This unsustainable practice causes tremendous air pollution and health hazards while restricting soil nutrient recycling. In this review, we examine the economic rationale for unsustainable residue management. The sustainability of residue utilization is determined by several economic factors, such as local demand for and quantity of residue production, development and dissemination of technologies to absorb excess residue, and market and policy instruments to internalize the social costs of residue burning. The intervention strategy to ensure sustainable residue management depends on public awareness of the private and societal costs of open residue burning.", "generated_text": "This study examines the economic and environmental implications of crop residue management practices, with a focus on smallholder farmers in developing countries. We analyze the drivers behind residue burning and its impacts on climate change, air quality, and soil health. The research explores alternative management strategies, including incorporation, mulching, and bioenergy production, assessing their economic viability and potential for technology adoption. Our findings reveal that while residue burning offers short-term economic benefits, it leads to significant long-term environmental costs. We identify barriers to adopting sustainable practices, such as limited access to machinery and knowledge gaps. The study proposes policy interventions and incentive mechanisms to promote environmentally friendly residue management, highlighting the need for context-specific solutions that balance economic feasibility with ecological sustainability for smallholder farmers.", "label": 0}
