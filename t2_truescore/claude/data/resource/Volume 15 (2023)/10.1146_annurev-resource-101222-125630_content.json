{"grounding": "This article reviews recent economic studies on the causal effects of temperature on labor productivity. The negative effects of extreme temperatures are widespread, and the magnitudes of the impact differ across social and economic factors. In addition to physical outputs, extreme temperatures also impair mental productivity, including cognition and learning. In utero exposure to extreme temperatures has profound effects on human development. Although the literature has detected various adaptation strategies, the conclusions are mixed. We discuss some limitations of existing studies and propose several directions for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex relationship between temperature and labor productivity across various sectors and regions. We analyze the impacts of temperature fluctuations on both physical and mental productivity, considering factors such as adaptation mechanisms and early-life exposure to different climates. Our findings reveal significant distributional effects, with certain populations and industries more vulnerable to temperature-induced productivity losses. The research also explores potential mitigation strategies and policy implications to address the challenges posed by changing temperature patterns on workforce efficiency and economic output.", "label": 1}
