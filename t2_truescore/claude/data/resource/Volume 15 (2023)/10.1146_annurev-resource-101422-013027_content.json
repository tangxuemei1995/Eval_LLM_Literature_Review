{"grounding": "Food fraud represents a serious threat to the integrity of the global agri-food marketing system and has received considerable attention by policy makers, academics, and the public at large. This review presents the conditions that enable fraudulent activity in agri-food supply chains (such as asymmetric information, imperfect certification processes, supply chain complexity, and weak monitoring and enforcement systems) and discusses recent efforts to document and deter food fraud and the growing theoretical and empirical literature on the economics of food fraud. The article concludes by identifying some gaps in the literature and provides suggestions for future research.", "generated_text": "Food fraud, encompassing adulteration and mislabeling, poses significant risks to consumer health and market integrity. This paper examines the causes, consequences, and deterrence strategies of food fraud in the context of asymmetric information and credence goods. We analyze how information asymmetry between producers and consumers creates opportunities for fraudulent practices. The study explores the economic and health impacts of food fraud, highlighting the challenges in detection and enforcement. We evaluate various deterrence strategies, including certification schemes and regulatory measures, considering their effectiveness and limitations. Our findings emphasize the need for a multi-faceted approach combining improved detection technologies, stricter penalties, and enhanced consumer awareness to combat food fraud effectively.", "label": 1}
