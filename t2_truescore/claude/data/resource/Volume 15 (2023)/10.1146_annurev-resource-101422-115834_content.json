{"grounding": "Understanding the potential effect of environmental regulation on employment is of broad interest to key stakeholders. Concerns encompass both short- and longer-term effects on workers within the regulated sector, affected communities that already suffer from a lack of employment opportunities, and net employment in the overall economy. We begin our review by presenting a neoclassical microeconomic framework demonstrating how environmental regulations might affect labor demand. We then summarize the main empirical findings from the literature, including sector-specific partial equilibrium estimates and general equilibrium approaches to identifying the employment impacts of regulations. We also briefly describe the literature on how environmental regulations affect labor supply. Finally, we discuss remaining research gaps.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the relationship between environmental regulation and labor demand, synthesizing evidence from empirical studies across various industries and countries. We review econometric analyses, case studies, and meta-analyses to assess the impact of environmental policies on employment levels and job creation. Our findings suggest a nuanced relationship, with effects varying by sector, regulation type, and timeframe. While some industries experience short-term job losses, others see employment gains through innovation and the creation of 'green jobs'. Overall, the net impact on aggregate employment appears modest, with potential for positive long-term effects through improved environmental quality and public health. We discuss policy implications and areas for future research to better understand this complex relationship.", "label": 1}
