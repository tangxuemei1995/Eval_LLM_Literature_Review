{"grounding": "Insulin action is impaired in type 2 diabetes. The functions of the hormone are an integrated product of insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and insulin clearance by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation, mostly in liver (hepatocytes) and, to a lower extent, in extrahepatic peripheral tissues. Substantial evidence indicates that genetic or acquired abnormalities of insulin secretion or action predispose to type 2 diabetes. In recent years, along with the discovery of the molecular foundation of receptor-mediated insulin clearance, such as through the membrane glycoprotein CEACAM1, a consensus has begun to emerge that reduction of insulin clearance contributes to the disease process. In this review, we consider the evidence suggesting a pathogenic role for reduced insulin clearance in insulin resistance, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and type 2 diabetes.", "generated_text": "Insulin clearance plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the development of metabolic disorders. This review examines the complex interplay between insulin clearance, insulin action, and insulin resistance across various health conditions and populations. We explore the mechanisms underlying altered insulin clearance in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its contribution to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Additionally, we investigate how age and ethnicity influence insulin clearance rates and their potential impact on metabolic health disparities. Understanding the factors affecting insulin clearance provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for managing metabolic disorders and improving overall health outcomes.", "label": 1}
