{"grounding": "Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are components of plasma membranes and an efficient fuel source and also serve as metabolic regulators through FA signaling mediated by membrane FA receptors. Impaired tissue FA uptake has been linked to major complications of obesity, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Fatty acid interactions with a membrane receptor and the initiation of signaling can modify pathways related to nutrient uptake and processing, cell proliferation or differentiation, and secretion of bioactive factors. Here, we review the major membrane receptors involved in FA uptake and FA signaling. We focus on two types of membrane receptors for long-chain FAs: CD36 and the G protein\u2013coupled FA receptors FFAR1 and FFAR4. We describe key signaling pathways and metabolic outcomes for CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 and highlight the parallels that provide insight into FA regulation of cell function.", "generated_text": "Fatty acid transport and signaling play crucial roles in various physiological processes. This review explores the mechanisms and implications of fatty acid transport and signaling, focusing on key proteins such as CD36, FFAR1, FFAR4, and caveolin. We discuss the intricate pathways involved in fatty acid uptake, intracellular trafficking, and signaling cascades. The review highlights the importance of these processes in energy metabolism, particularly \u03b2-oxidation, and their impact on tissue repair and regeneration. Furthermore, we examine the role of fatty acid signaling in modulating cellular responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic disorders. By integrating recent findings, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of fatty acid transport and signaling, emphasizing their significance in maintaining physiological homeostasis and their potential for clinical applications.", "label": 1}
