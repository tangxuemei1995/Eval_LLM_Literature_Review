{"grounding": "The endothelium is one of the largest organ systems in the body, and data continue to emerge regarding the importance of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction in vascular aging and a range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Over the last two decades and as a process intimately related to EC dysfunction, an increasing number of studies have also implicated endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) as a potentially disease-causal pathobiologic process that is involved in a multitude of differing CVDs. However, EndMT is also involved in physiologic processes (e.g., cardiac development), and transient EndMT may contribute to vascular regeneration in certain contexts. Given that EndMT involves a major alteration in the EC-specific molecular program, and that it potentially contributes to CVD pathobiology, the clinical translation opportunities are significant, but further molecular and translational research is needed to see these opportunities realized.\n", "generated_text": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a complex biological process wherein endothelial cells lose their distinctive characteristics and acquire mesenchymal-like properties. This review explores the role of EndMT in both physiological and pathological contexts, with a particular focus on cardiovascular health and disease. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT, including key signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators. The physiological importance of EndMT during embryonic development and wound healing is examined, alongside its pathological implications in various cardiovascular disorders, such as fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and valve calcification. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in understanding the potential of targeting EndMT for therapeutic interventions. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the multifaceted nature of EndMT and its significance in cardiovascular biology, paving the way for future research and potential clinical applications.", "label": 1}
