{"grounding": "Pericytes, attached to the surface of capillaries, play an important role in regulating local blood flow. Using optogenetic tools and genetically encoded reporters in conjunction with confocal and multiphoton imaging techniques, the 3D structure, anatomical organization, and physiology of pericytes have recently been the subject of detailed examination. This work has revealed novel functions of pericytes and morphological features such as tunneling nanotubes in brain and tunneling microtubes in heart. Here, we discuss the state of our current understanding of the roles of pericytes in blood flow control in brain and heart, where functions may differ due to the distinct spatiotemporal metabolic requirements of these tissues. We also outline the novel concept of electro-metabolic signaling, a universal mechanistic framework that links tissue metabolic state with blood flow regulation by pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, with capillary KATP and Kir2.1 channels as primary sensors. Finally, we present major unresolved questions and outline how they can be addressed.", "generated_text": "Pericytes, contractile cells surrounding capillaries, play a crucial role in regulating blood flow in the brain and heart. This review explores the mechanisms by which pericytes control microcirculation in these metabolically demanding organs. We examine the interplay between pericytes and neurovascular coupling in the brain, highlighting their involvement in matching blood flow to neuronal activity. The role of electro-metabolic signaling in pericyte function is discussed, emphasizing the importance of ion channels, particularly those mediating calcium and potassium fluxes. In the heart, we investigate how pericytes contribute to coronary blood flow regulation and cardiac metabolism. The review also compares and contrasts pericyte function in the brain and heart, revealing organ-specific adaptations. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. We conclude by identifying key areas for future research, including the potential for pericyte-based interventions in improving tissue perfusion and organ function.", "label": 1}
