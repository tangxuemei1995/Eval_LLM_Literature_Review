{"grounding": "Neural mechanisms of perceptual decision making have been extensively studied in experimental settings that mimic stable environments with repeating stimuli, fixed rules, and payoffs. In contrast, we live in an ever-changing environment and have varying goals and behavioral demands. To accommodate variability, our brain flexibly adjusts decision-making processes depending on context. Here, we review a growing body of research that explores the neural mechanisms underlying this flexibility. We highlight diverse forms of context dependency in decision making implemented through a variety of neural computations. Context-dependent neural activity is observed in a distributed network of brain structures, including posterior parietal, sensory, motor, and subcortical regions, as well as the prefrontal areas classically implicated in cognitive control. We propose that investigating the distributed network underlying flexible decisions is key to advancing our understanding and discuss a path forward for experimental and theoretical investigations.", "generated_text": "Flexible decision-making is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this ability remain poorly understood. This review explores the distributed neural networks involved in flexible perceptual decisions, focusing on how the brain rapidly adjusts stimulus-action mappings and decision policies during task switches. We examine recent findings from neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies that reveal the dynamic interplay between sensory, cognitive, and motor areas during flexible sensory-guided behavior. Key neural substrates, including the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and basal ganglia, are discussed in terms of their roles in updating task rules, modulating sensory processing, and implementing adaptive decision strategies. We propose a framework for understanding how these distributed networks coordinate to enable rapid adjustments in perceptual decision-making, highlighting potential targets for future research and clinical interventions in disorders characterized by inflexible behavior.", "label": 1}
