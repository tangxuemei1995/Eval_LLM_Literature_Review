{"grounding": "Polycystin subunits can form hetero- and homotetrameric ion channels in the membranes of various compartments of the cell. Homotetrameric polycystin channels are voltage- and calcium-modulated, whereas heterotetrameric versions are proposed to be ligand- or autoproteolytically regulated. Their importance is underscored by variants associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and by vital roles in fertilization and embryonic development. The diversity in polycystin assembly and subcellular distribution allows for a multitude of sensory functions by this class of channels. In this review, we highlight their recent structural and functional characterization, which has provided a molecular blueprint to investigate the conformational changes required for channel opening in response to unique stimuli. We consider each polycystin channel type individually, discussing how they contribute to sensory cell biology, as well as their impact on the physiology of various tissues.", "generated_text": "Polycystin channel complexes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common inherited disorder characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. These complexes, composed of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, belong to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and are localized to primary cilia. Recent structural and functional studies have provided insights into the gating mechanisms of polycystin channels and their interactions with other proteins. Mutations in polycystin genes disrupt channel function, leading to ciliary defects and aberrant cellular signaling. Understanding the molecular basis of polycystin channel regulation and its involvement in ciliopathies may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches in ADPKD and related disorders. This review summarizes current knowledge on polycystin channel complexes and their implications in kidney disease pathophysiology.", "label": 1}
