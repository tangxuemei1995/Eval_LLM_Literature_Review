{"grounding": "The human lung cellular portfolio, traditionally characterized by cellular morphology and individual markers, is highly diverse, with over 40 cell types and a complex branching structure highly adapted for agile airflow and gas exchange. While constant during adulthood, lung cellular content changes in response to exposure, injury, and infection. Some changes are temporary, but others are persistent, leading to structural changes and progressive lung disease. The recent advance of single-cell profiling technologies allows an unprecedented level of detail and scale to cellular measurements, leading to the rise of comprehensive cell atlas styles of reporting. In this review, we chronical the rise of cell atlases and explore their contributions to human lung biology in health and disease.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of lung biology in health and disease. This review explores the development of comprehensive lung cell atlases, focusing on their applications in pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We discuss how these atlases provide unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, disease-specific cell populations, and molecular mechanisms underlying lung pathologies. The integration of single-cell data with spatial transcriptomics and proteomics has further enhanced our ability to map cellular interactions and identify potential therapeutic targets. We highlight the challenges in data interpretation and integration across studies, as well as the future directions for leveraging lung cell atlases in personalized medicine and drug discovery for respiratory diseases.", "label": 1}
