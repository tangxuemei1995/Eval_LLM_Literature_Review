{"grounding": "Information processing imposes urgent metabolic demands on neurons, which have negligible energy stores and restricted access to fuel. Here, we discuss metabolic recruitment, the tissue-level phenomenon whereby active neurons harvest resources from their surroundings. The primary event is the neuronal release of K+ that mirrors workload. Astrocytes sense K+ in exquisite fashion thanks to their unique coexpression of NBCe1 and \u03b12\u03b22 Na+/K+ ATPase, and within seconds switch to Crabtree metabolism, involving GLUT1, aerobic glycolysis, transient suppression of mitochondrial respiration, and lactate export. The lactate surge serves as a secondary recruiter by inhibiting glucose consumption in distant cells. Additional recruiters are glutamate, nitric oxide, and ammonium, which signal over different spatiotemporal domains. The net outcome of these events is that more glucose, lactate, and oxygen are made available. Metabolic recruitment works alongside neurovascular coupling and various averaging strategies to support the inordinate dynamic range of individual neurons.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes in brain tissue, focusing on the recruitment of energy substrates during neural activity. We examine the roles of glucose, lactate, and oxygen in supporting neuronal function, with particular emphasis on the interplay between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings reveal a dynamic metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes, where astrocytes preferentially utilize glycolysis to produce lactate, which is then shuttled to neurons as an additional energy source. Neurons, in turn, exhibit a higher reliance on oxidative metabolism. We also observe that the metabolic recruitment patterns vary depending on the intensity and duration of neural activity. These results provide new insights into the metabolic flexibility of brain tissue and have implications for understanding neurodegenerative disorders and developing targeted therapeutic approaches.", "label": 0}
