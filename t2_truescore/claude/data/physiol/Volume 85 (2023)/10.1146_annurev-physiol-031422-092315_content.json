{"grounding": "Coughing is a dynamic physiological process resulting from input of vagal sensory neurons innervating the airways and perceived airway irritation. Although cough serves to protect and clear the airways, it can also be exploited by respiratory pathogens to facilitate disease transmission. Microbial components or infection-induced inflammatory mediators can directly interact with sensory nerve receptors to induce a cough response. Analysis of cough-generated aerosols and transmission studies have further demonstrated how infectious disease is spread through coughing. This review summarizes the neurophysiology of cough, cough induction by respiratory pathogens and inflammation, and cough-mediated disease transmission.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intricate relationship between infectious and inflammatory processes and cough, a common respiratory symptom. We examine how respiratory tract infections trigger cough through various pathways, including direct pathogen-induced damage and host immune responses. The role of sensory neurons in detecting irritants and initiating the cough reflex is discussed, highlighting their involvement in both acute and chronic cough. Additionally, we investigate the mechanisms of disease transmission through cough and the potential for targeted interventions. Understanding these complex interactions may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for managing cough in infectious and inflammatory respiratory conditions.", "label": 1}
