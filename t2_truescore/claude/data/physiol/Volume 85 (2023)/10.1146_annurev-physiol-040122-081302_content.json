{"grounding": "The generation of an internal body model and its continuous update is essential in sensorimotor control. Although known to rely on proprioceptive sensory feedback, the underlying mechanism that transforms this sensory feedback into a dynamic body percept remains poorly understood. However, advances in the development of genetic tools for proprioceptive circuit elements, including the sensory receptors, are beginning to offer new and unprecedented leverage to dissect the central pathways responsible for proprioceptive encoding. Simultaneously, new data derived through emerging bionic neural machine\u2013interface technologies reveal clues regarding the relative importance of kinesthetic sensory feedback and insights into the functional proprioceptive substrates that underlie natural motor behaviors.", "generated_text": "Proprioception, the sense of body position and movement, is crucial for motor control and spatial awareness. Recent advancements in genetic and bionic strategies have opened new avenues for understanding and manipulating proprioceptive systems. This review explores cutting-edge research on proprioceptive sensory neurons, muscle spindles, and Golgi tendon organs, as well as their integration in the dorsal column nuclei and somatosensory cortex. We discuss the potential of kinesthetic illusions in enhancing proprioceptive feedback and examine the development of neural machine interfaces for prosthetic limbs. These emerging technologies promise to revolutionize our approach to proprioception, offering hope for improved rehabilitation strategies and more intuitive control of artificial limbs.", "label": 1}
