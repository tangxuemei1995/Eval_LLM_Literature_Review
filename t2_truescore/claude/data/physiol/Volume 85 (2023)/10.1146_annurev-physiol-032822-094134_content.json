{"grounding": "Liver regeneration occurs in response to diverse injuries and is capable of functionally reestablishing the lost parenchyma. This phenomenon has been known since antiquity, encapsulated in the Greek myth where Prometheus was to be punished by Zeus for sharing the gift of fire with humanity by having an eagle eat his liver daily, only to have the liver regrow back, thus ensuring eternal suffering and punishment. Today, this process is actively leveraged clinically during living donor liver transplantation whereby up to a two-thirds hepatectomy (resection or removal of part of the liver) on a donor is used for transplant to a recipient. The donor liver rapidly regenerates to recover the lost parenchymal mass to form a functional tissue. This astonishing regenerative process and unique capacity of the liver are examined in further detail in this review.", "generated_text": "The mammalian liver exhibits remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity, enabling it to maintain homeostasis and regenerate following injury. This review explores the multiple facets of liver zonation, cellular heterogeneity, and regenerative capacity in both homeostatic and injury conditions. We discuss the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation and how this spatial organization contributes to organ function. The review examines the liver's response to acute and chronic injuries, highlighting the diverse cellular plasticity observed during regeneration. We analyze the roles of hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and liver progenitor cells in maintaining tissue integrity and initiating repair processes. Furthermore, we explore recent advances in understanding the signaling pathways and transcriptional networks that regulate liver regeneration. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex interplay between cellular homeostasis and regeneration in the mammalian liver, with implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for liver diseases.", "label": 1}
