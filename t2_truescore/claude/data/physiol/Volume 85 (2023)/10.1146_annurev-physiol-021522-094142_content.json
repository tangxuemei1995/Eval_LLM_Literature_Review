{"grounding": "The rhythmicity of breath is vital for normal physiology. Even so, breathing is enriched with multifunctionality. External signals constantly change breathing, stopping it when under water or deepening it during exertion. Internal cues utilize breath to express emotions such as sighs of frustration and yawns of boredom. Breathing harmonizes with other actions that use our mouth and throat, including speech, chewing, and swallowing. In addition, our perception of breathing intensity can dictate how we feel, such as during the slow breathing of calming meditation and anxiety-inducing hyperventilation. Heartbeat originates from a peripheral pacemaker in the heart, but the automation of breathing arises from neural clusters within the brainstem, enabling interaction with other brain areas and thus multifunctionality. Here, we document how the recent transformation of cellular and molecular tools has contributed to our appreciation of the diversity of neuronal types in the breathing control circuit and how they confer the multifunctionality of breathing.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in molecular tools have revolutionized our understanding of breathing control mechanisms. This review focuses on key areas transformed by these techniques, including the preB\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC), lung sensory pathways, and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Genetic manipulations and optogenetic approaches have elucidated the critical role of the preB\u00f6tC in respiratory rhythm generation. Similarly, molecular studies have refined our comprehension of lung sensory mechanisms, particularly the Hering-Breuer reflex, revealing intricate neural circuits involved in breath-by-breath regulation. The NTS, a crucial relay center for respiratory sensory information, has been further characterized through targeted molecular interventions. Additionally, the review highlights the evolving understanding of serotonin's multifaceted role in respiratory control. These molecular insights have not only deepened our knowledge of breathing physiology but also opened new avenues for therapeutic interventions in respiratory disorders.", "label": 1}
