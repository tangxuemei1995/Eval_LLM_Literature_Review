{"grounding": "Numerous trafficking and quality control pathways evolved to handle the diversity of proteins made by eukaryotic cells. However, at every step along the biosynthetic pathway, there is the potential for quality control system failure. This review focuses on the mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis. Inspired by diseases caused by misfolded proteins in the kidney (mucin 1 and uromodulin), we outline the general principles of protein biosynthesis, delineate the recognition and degradation pathways targeting misfolded proteins, and discuss the role of cargo receptors in protein trafficking and lipid homeostasis. We also discuss technical approaches including live-cell fluorescent microscopy, chemical screens to elucidate trafficking mechanisms, multiplexed single-cell CRISPR screening platforms to systematically delineate mechanisms of proteostasis, and the advancement of novel tools to degrade secretory and membrane-associated proteins. By focusing on components of trafficking that go awry, we highlight ongoing efforts to understand fundamental mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis and implications for the treatment of human proteinopathies.", "generated_text": "Protein trafficking and quality control mechanisms play crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the kidney. This review explores the intricate processes involved in protein transport through the secretory pathway, from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and beyond. We focus on the TMED family of proteins, which are essential for cargo selection and vesicle formation. The review also examines the proteome of various cellular compartments involved in trafficking and discusses how disruptions in these pathways contribute to kidney disease. Furthermore, we investigate the quality control mechanisms that ensure proper protein folding and degradation, including the role of lysosomes in maintaining cellular health. By elucidating these mechanisms, we aim to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for kidney disorders and other diseases associated with protein trafficking defects.", "label": 1}
