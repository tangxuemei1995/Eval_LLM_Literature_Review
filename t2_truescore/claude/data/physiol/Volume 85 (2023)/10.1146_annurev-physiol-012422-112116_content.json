{"grounding": "Myostatin (GDF-8) was discovered 25 years ago as a new transforming growth factor-\u03b2 family member that acts as a master regulator of skeletal muscle mass. Myostatin is made by skeletal myofibers, circulates in the blood, and acts back on myofibers to limit growth. Myostatin appears to have all of the salient properties of a chalone, which is a term proposed over a half century ago to describe hypothetical circulating, tissue-specific growth inhibitors that control tissue size. The elucidation of the molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms underlying myostatin activity suggests that myostatin functions as a negative feedback regulator of muscle mass and raises the question as to whether this type of chalone mechanism is unique to skeletal muscle or whether it also operates in other tissues.", "generated_text": "Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), is a member of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily that acts as a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. This review explores the role of myostatin as a skeletal muscle chalone, a tissue-specific growth inhibitor that helps maintain optimal tissue size. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying myostatin's function, including its synthesis, secretion, and activation from a latent complex. The review also examines myostatin's interactions with its receptors and the subsequent signaling cascades that lead to the inhibition of muscle growth. Furthermore, we highlight the potential therapeutic applications of myostatin manipulation in treating muscle wasting disorders and enhancing muscle growth in livestock. Understanding myostatin's function as a chalone provides valuable insights into the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and offers promising avenues for future research and clinical interventions.", "label": 1}
