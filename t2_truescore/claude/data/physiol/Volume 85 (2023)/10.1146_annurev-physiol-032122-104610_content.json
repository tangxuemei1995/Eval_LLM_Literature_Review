{"grounding": "Membrane contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM), or ER-PM junctions, are found in all eukaryotic cells. In excitable cells they play unique roles in organizing diverse forms of Ca2+ signaling as triggered by membrane depolarization. ER-PM junctions underlie crucial physiological processes such as excitation-contraction coupling, smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, and various forms of activity-dependent signaling and plasticity in neurons. In many cases the structure and molecular composition of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells comprise important regulatory feedback loops linking depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling at these sites to the regulation of membrane potential. Here, we describe recent findings on physiological roles and molecular composition of native ER-PM junctions in excitable cells. We focus on recent studies that provide new insights into canonical forms of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling occurring at junctional triads and dyads of striated muscle, as well as the diversity of ER-PM junctions in these cells and in smooth muscle and neurons.", "generated_text": "Endoplasmic reticulum\u2013plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions are specialized membrane contact sites that play a crucial role in Ca2+ signaling in excitable cells. This review explores the structure and function of ER-PM junctions in various cell types, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, as well as neurons. We discuss how these junctions serve as platforms for the localization and interaction of ion channels and second messenger systems, facilitating rapid and efficient Ca2+ signaling in response to depolarization. The review highlights the molecular components involved in ER-PM junction formation and maintenance, as well as the specific mechanisms by which these structures contribute to Ca2+ homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling. Furthermore, we examine the physiological significance of ER-PM junctions in cellular processes and their potential implications in pathological conditions. Understanding the intricate dynamics of ER-PM junctions provides valuable insights into the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in excitable cells and may inform future therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
