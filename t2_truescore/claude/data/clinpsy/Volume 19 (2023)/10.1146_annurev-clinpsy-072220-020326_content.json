{"grounding": "Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) children and adolescents are an increasingly visible yet highly stigmatized group. These youth experience more psychological distress than not only their cisgender, heterosexual peers but also their cisgender, sexual minority peers. In this review, we document these mental health disparities and discuss potential explanations for them using a minority stress framework. We also discuss factors that may increase and decrease TGD youth's vulnerability to psychological distress. Further, we review interventions, including gender-affirming medical care, that may improve mental health in TGD youth. We conclude by discussing limitations of current research and suggestions for the future.", "generated_text": "This study examines the mental health challenges faced by transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth. A comprehensive review of recent literature reveals that TGD children and adolescents experience higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation compared to their cisgender peers. Factors contributing to these disparities include gender dysphoria, social stigma, discrimination, and lack of access to gender-affirming care. The research highlights the importance of supportive family environments, inclusive school policies, and specialized healthcare services in promoting positive mental health outcomes for TGD youth. Findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions and policies to address the unique mental health needs of this vulnerable population.", "label": 1}
