{"grounding": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified racism as a serious threat to public health. Structural racism is a fundamental cause of inequity within interconnected institutions and the social environments in which we live and develop. This review illustrates how these ethnoracial inequities impact risk for the extended psychosis phenotype. Black and Latinx populations are more likely than White populations to report psychotic experiences in the United States due to social determining factors such as racial discrimination, food insecurity, and police violence. Unless we dismantle these discriminatory structures, the chronic stress and biological consequences of this race-based stress and trauma will impact the next generation's risk for psychosis directly, and indirectly through Black and Latina pregnant mothers. Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions show promise in improving prognosis, but coordinated care and other treatments still need to be more accessible and address the racism-specific adversities many Black and Latinx people face in their neighborhoods and social environments.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex relationship between racism and the social determinants of psychosis, focusing on how racial discrimination and structural racism contribute to the development and exacerbation of psychotic experiences. Drawing from a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the impact of various neighborhood factors, socioeconomic disparities, and experiences of discrimination on the onset and progression of psychosis among marginalized racial groups. Our findings suggest that exposure to chronic racial stress and systemic inequalities significantly increases the risk of developing psychotic symptoms, particularly in early psychosis stages. Furthermore, we investigate how structural racism embedded in healthcare systems, education, and criminal justice may perpetuate disparities in psychosis outcomes. This research highlights the urgent need for culturally sensitive interventions, policy reforms, and community-based approaches to address the social determinants of psychosis and mitigate the harmful effects of racism on mental health outcomes.", "label": 1}
