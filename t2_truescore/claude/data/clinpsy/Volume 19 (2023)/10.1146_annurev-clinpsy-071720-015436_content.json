{"grounding": "Partialing is a statistical approach researchers use with the goal of removing extraneous variance from a variable before examining its association with other variables. Controlling for confounds through analysis of covariance or multiple regression analysis and residualizing variables for use in subsequent analyses are common approaches to partialing in clinical research. Despite its intuitive appeal, partialing is fraught with undesirable consequences when predictors are correlated. After describing effects of partialing on variables, we review analytic approaches commonly used in clinical research to make inferences about the nature and effects of partialed variables. We then use two simulations to show how partialing can distort variables and their relations with other variables. Having concluded that, with rare exception, partialing is ill-advised, we offer recommendations for reducing or eliminating problematic uses of partialing. We conclude that the best alternative to partialing is to define and measure constructs so that it is not needed.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the widespread practice of partialing in psychological research, particularly its use in refining scores and inferences about psychological constructs. We argue that while partialing is often employed to enhance construct validity, it may inadvertently introduce methodological and interpretative issues. Through a comprehensive review of literature and statistical analyses, we demonstrate how residualized variables and statistical control can lead to misleading conclusions about the nature and relationships of psychological constructs. We explore the unintended consequences of semipartial effects on measurement integrity and theoretical interpretations. Our findings suggest that partialing, when applied uncritically, may constitute a questionable measurement practice that undermines rather than enhances construct validity. We propose guidelines for researchers to critically evaluate the appropriateness of partialing in their studies and offer alternative approaches to address the underlying concerns that motivate its use. This work contributes to ongoing discussions about measurement practices in psychological research and their implications for scientific rigor and reproducibility.", "label": 1}
