{"grounding": "Research conducted over the past several decades has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the immune system in neural and psychological development and function across the life span. Our goal in this review is to introduce this dynamic area of research to a psychological audience and highlight its relevance for clinical psychology. We begin by introducing the basic physiology of immune-to-brain signaling and the neuroimmune network, focusing on inflammation. Drawing from preclinical and clinical research, we then examine effects of immune activation on key psychological domains, including positive and negative valence systems, social processes, cognition, and arousal (fatigue, sleep), as well as links with psychological disorders (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia). We also consider psychosocial stress as a critical modulator of neuroimmune activity and focus on early life adversity. Finally, we highlight psychosocial and mind\u2013body interventions that influence the immune system and may promote neuroimmune resilience.", "generated_text": "Psychoneuroimmunology, an emerging interdisciplinary field, explores the intricate connections between the immune system, nervous system, and psychological processes. This review introduces the fundamental concepts of immune-to-brain communication and its relevance to clinical psychology. We examine the bidirectional relationship between psychosocial stress and inflammation, highlighting how chronic stress can dysregulate immune function and contribute to various psychological disorders. The role of inflammation in sickness behavior and its potential implications for understanding depression are discussed. Furthermore, we explore the translational aspects of psychoneuroimmunology research, emphasizing its potential to inform novel therapeutic approaches in clinical psychology. By elucidating the complex interplay between immune function, neural processes, and psychological well-being, this field offers promising avenues for developing integrated interventions that address both physical and mental health concerns.", "label": 1}
