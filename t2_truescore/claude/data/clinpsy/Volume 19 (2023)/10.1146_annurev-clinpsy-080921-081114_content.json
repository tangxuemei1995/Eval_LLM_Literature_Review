{"grounding": "For many people worldwide, supernatural beliefs and attributions\u2014those focused on God, the devil, demons, spirits, an afterlife, karma, or fate\u2014are part of everyday life. Although not widely studied in clinical psychology, these beliefs and attributions are a key part of human diversity. This article provides a broad overview of research on supernatural beliefs and attributions with special attention to their psychological relevance: They can serve as coping resources, sources of distress, psychopathology signals, moral guides, and decision-making tools. Although supernatural attributions sometimes involve dramatic experiences seen to violate natural laws, people more commonly think of supernatural entities working indirectly through natural events. A whole host of factors can lead people to make supernatural attributions, including contextual factors, specific beliefs, psychopathology, cognitive styles and personality, and social and cultural influences. Our aim is to provide clinical psychologists with an entry point into this rich, fascinating, and often overlooked literature.", "generated_text": "This study explores the prevalence and psychological underpinnings of supernatural attributions in explaining life events. Drawing from a diverse sample of 1,500 participants across various cultural and religious backgrounds, we investigate how individuals attribute causality to supernatural entities such as God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma. Using a mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and experimental manipulations, we examine the relationship between supernatural attributions and factors including religious affiliation, spiritual experiences, and cognitive biases. Results indicate that supernatural attributions are common across cultures, with significant variations in the specific entities invoked. We find that such attributions are positively correlated with spiritual struggles and anomalous experiences, and negatively associated with analytical thinking styles. This research contributes to our understanding of how supernatural beliefs shape individuals' interpretations of events and highlights the complex interplay between cognitive processes, cultural context, and spiritual experiences in forming causal attributions.", "label": 0}
