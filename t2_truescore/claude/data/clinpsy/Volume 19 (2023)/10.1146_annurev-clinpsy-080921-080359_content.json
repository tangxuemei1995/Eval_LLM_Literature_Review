{"grounding": "The number of refugees and internally displaced people in 2022 is the largest since World War II, and meta-analyses demonstrate that these people experience elevated rates of mental health problems. This review focuses on the role of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugee mental health and includes current knowledge of the prevalence of PTSD, risk factors, and apparent differences that exist between PTSD in refugee populations and PTSD in other populations. An emerging literature on understanding mechanisms of PTSD encompasses neural, cognitive, and social processes, which indicate that these factors may not function exactly as they have functioned previously in other PTSD populations. This review recognizes the numerous debates in the literature on PTSD in refugees, including those on such issues as the conceptualization of mental health and the applicability of the PTSD diagnosis across cultures, as well as the challenge of treating PTSD in low- and middle-income countries that lack mental health resources to offer standard PTSD treatments.", "generated_text": "This review examines the prevalence, mechanisms, and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among refugee populations. Refugees, who have experienced forced displacement and often traumatic events, are at heightened risk for developing PTSD. We synthesize current literature on the neurobiological and psychosocial factors contributing to PTSD in refugees, highlighting the complex interplay between pre-migration trauma, displacement stressors, and post-migration challenges. The review explores evidence-based interventions, including trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy and culturally adapted treatments, emphasizing the importance of culturally sensitive approaches in mental health care for refugees. Additionally, we discuss the barriers to accessing mental health services and the role of social support in mitigating PTSD symptoms. Our findings underscore the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches to address PTSD in refugee populations, integrating mental health care with broader resettlement support to promote long-term well-being and successful integration into host societies.", "label": 1}
