{"grounding": "Racism constitutes a significant risk to the mental health of African American children, adolescents, and emerging adults. This review evaluates recent literature examining ethnic and racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity and spirituality, and family and parenting as racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors that shape the impact of racism on youth mental health. Representative studies, purported mechanisms, and critiques of prior research are presented for each factor. Recent studies of racism and resilience revisit foundational resilience factors from prior research while reflecting new and important advances (e.g., consideration of gender, cultural context, structural racism), providing important insights for the development of prevention and intervention efforts and policy that can alleviate mental health suffering and promote health and mental health equity for African American youth.", "generated_text": "This study examines the role of racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors in promoting mental health among African American youth. Drawing from a comprehensive review of existing literature, we investigate the impact of racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity, spirituality, family dynamics, and parenting practices on psychological well-being. Our findings suggest that these factors serve as protective mechanisms against the detrimental effects of racism and discrimination on mental health outcomes. Strong racial identity and positive ethnic-racial socialization were found to be particularly influential in fostering resilience. Additionally, religiosity and spirituality emerged as significant coping resources, while supportive family environments and culturally-informed parenting strategies contributed to enhanced psychological adjustment. This research highlights the importance of culturally-specific protective factors in promoting resilience and positive mental health outcomes among African American youth facing systemic racism and discrimination.", "label": 1}
