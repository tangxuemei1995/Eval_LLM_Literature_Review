{"grounding": "While boys and men have historically been underrepresented in eating disorder research, increasing interest and research during the twenty-first century have contributed important knowledge to the field. In this article, we review the epidemiology of eating disorders and muscle dysmorphia (the pathological pursuit of muscularity) in boys and men; specific groups of men at increased risk for eating disorders; sociocultural, psychological, and biological vulnerability factors; and male-specific assessment measures. We also provide an overview of current research on eating disorder and muscle dysmorphia prevention efforts, treatment outcomes, and mortality risk in samples of boys and men. Priorities for future research are including boys and men in epidemiological studies to track changes in incidence, identifying (neuro)biological factors contributing to risk, eliminating barriers to treatment access and utilization, and refining male-specific prevention and treatment efforts.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive review examines the current state of knowledge regarding eating disorders in boys and men, an often overlooked population in eating disorder research. The study explores epidemiological trends, highlighting the increasing prevalence of eating disorders among males. It investigates unique risk factors, clinical presentations, and diagnostic challenges specific to this demographic. The review also evaluates existing intervention strategies and their effectiveness in treating male patients. Furthermore, it assesses long-term outcomes and potential barriers to seeking treatment faced by boys and men with eating disorders. By synthesizing recent findings and identifying gaps in the literature, this review aims to inform future research directions and improve clinical practices for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders in male populations.", "label": 1}
