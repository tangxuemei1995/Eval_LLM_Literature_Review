{"grounding": "Numerous studies associate childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) with adverse adjustment in the domains of mental health, social, and academic functioning. This review synthesizes this literature and highlights the critical role of child self-regulation in mediating children's adjustment outcomes. We discuss major methodological problems of the field, including failure to consider the effects of prenatal IPV exposure and the limitations of variable-oriented and cross-sectional approaches. Finally, we present a comprehensive theoretical model of the effects of IPV on children's development. This model includes three mechanistic pathways\u2014one that is unique to IPV (maternal representations) and two that are consistent with the effects of other stressors (maternal mental health and physiological functioning). In our model, the effects of these three pathways on child adjustment outcomes are mediated through parenting and child self-regulation. Future research directions and clinical implications are discussed in the context of the model.", "generated_text": "This study examines the developmental consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) on children, from prenatal exposure to adolescence. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that IPV exposure significantly impacts various aspects of child development, including cognitive, emotional, and social domains. Prenatal stress resulting from maternal IPV exposure is associated with adverse birth outcomes and altered neurodevelopment. Infants and young children exposed to IPV demonstrate disrupted attachment patterns and increased risk for behavioral problems. School-aged children exhibit academic difficulties, emotional dysregulation, and social challenges. Adolescents show higher rates of mental health issues, substance abuse, and intergenerational transmission of violence. The study highlights the need for early intervention strategies, trauma-informed care, and support systems to mitigate the long-term effects of IPV on child development. Future research directions and policy implications are discussed to address this critical public health concern.", "label": 1}
