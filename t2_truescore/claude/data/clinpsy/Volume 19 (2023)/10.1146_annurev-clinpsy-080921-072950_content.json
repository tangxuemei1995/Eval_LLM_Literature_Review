{"grounding": "This review updates and extends Gone & Trimble's (2012) prior review of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) mental health. First, it defines AI/AN populations in the USA, with an explanation of the importance of political citizenship in semisovereign Tribal Nations as primary for categorizing this population. Second, it presents an updated summary of what is known about AI/AN mental health, with careful notation of recurrent findings concerning community inequities in addiction, trauma, and suicide. Third, this article reviews key literature about AI/AN community mental health services appearing since 2010, including six randomized controlled trials of recognizable mental health treatments. Finally, it reimagines the AI/AN mental health enterprise in response to an \u201calter-Native psy-ence,\u201d which recasts prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and harnesses postcolonial meaning-making through Indigenized therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, AI/AN Tribal Nations must determine for themselves how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services for wider community benefit.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of evidence-based practice (EBP) and alter-Native psy-ence in community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The research explores the challenges of implementing Western-based EBPs within Indigenous communities and the potential of Indigenized therapies to address postcolonial anomie. Through a comprehensive literature review and qualitative interviews with mental health practitioners, the study identifies key barriers to culturally appropriate care and proposes strategies for integrating traditional healing practices with contemporary psychological approaches. Findings suggest that a hybrid model, incorporating both EBP and alter-Native psy-ence, may be most effective in addressing the unique mental health needs of AI/AN populations. The study emphasizes the importance of cultural competence, community engagement, and the recognition of historical trauma in developing and implementing mental health interventions. Recommendations are provided for policymakers and practitioners to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of community mental health services for AI/AN individuals.", "label": 1}
