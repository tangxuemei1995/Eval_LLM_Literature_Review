{"grounding": "Parental incarceration is a significant, inequitably distributed form of adversity that affects millions of US children and increases their risk for emotional and behavioral problems. An emerging body of research also indicates, however, that children exhibit resilience in the context of parental incarceration. In this article, we review evidence regarding the adverse implications of parental incarceration for children's adjustment and consider factors that account for these consequences with special attention to naturally occurring processes and interventions that may mitigate risk and contribute to positive youth development. We also offer a critical reframing of resilience research and argue that (a) scholars should adopt more contextualized approaches to the study of resilience that are sensitive to intersecting inequalities and (b) resilience research and practice should be conceptualized as important complements to, rather than substitutes for, social and institutional change. We conclude by offering social justice\u2013informed recommendations for future research and practice.", "generated_text": "This review critically examines the literature on risk and resilience among children with incarcerated parents, offering a nuanced perspective on their experiences. Drawing from an intersectional framework, we analyze how factors such as race, class, and gender intersect with parental incarceration to shape outcomes. The review challenges deficit-based approaches, highlighting the importance of recognizing children's agency and strengths. We explore various protective factors and resilience-promoting interventions, emphasizing the need for culturally responsive and trauma-informed practices. Additionally, we address the systemic barriers and social inequities that contribute to parental incarceration and its intergenerational impacts. By reframing the narrative around these children, we advocate for a social justice-oriented approach that considers broader societal contexts and promotes equitable support systems. This review concludes with recommendations for future research, policy, and practice to better serve and empower children with incarcerated parents.", "label": 1}
