{"grounding": "Acculturation and psychopathology are linked in integrated, interactional, intersectional, and dynamic ways that span different types of intercultural contact, levels of analysis, timescales, and contexts. A developmental psychopathology approach can be useful to explain why, how, and what about psychological acculturation results in later adaptation or maladaptation for acculturating youth and adults. This review applies a conceptual model of acculturation and developmental psychopathology to a widely used framework of acculturation variables producing an Integrated Process Framework of Acculturation Variables (IP-FAV). This new comprehensive framework depicts major predisposing acculturation conditions (why) as well as acculturation orientations and processes (how) that result in adaptation and maladaptation across the life span (what). The IP-FAV is unique in that it integrates both proximal and remote acculturation variables and explicates key acculturation processes to inform research, practice, and policy.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between acculturation processes and psychopathology, focusing on both proximal and remote acculturation in the context of globalization. Drawing on a comprehensive review of literature, we examine how acculturation experiences impact mental health outcomes among immigrants and refugees across different developmental stages. The research investigates the role of resilience factors in mitigating psychopathological risks associated with acculturation stress. Our findings suggest that while acculturation challenges can contribute to increased vulnerability to mental health issues, they also present opportunities for adaptive growth and resilience. The study highlights the importance of considering both proximal and remote acculturation influences in understanding and addressing psychopathology in diverse populations. These insights have significant implications for developing culturally sensitive interventions and policies to support the mental well-being of acculturating individuals in an increasingly interconnected world.", "label": 1}
