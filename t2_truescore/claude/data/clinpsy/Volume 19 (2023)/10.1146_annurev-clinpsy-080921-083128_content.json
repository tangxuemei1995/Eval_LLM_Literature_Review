{"grounding": "The use of repeated, momentary, real-world assessment methods known as the Experience Sampling Method and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has been broadly embraced over the last few decades. These methods have extended our assessment reach beyond lengthy retrospective self-reports as they can capture everyday experiences in their immediate context, including affect, behavior, symptoms, and cognitions. In this review we evaluate nine conceptual, methodological, and psychometric issues about EMA with the goal of stimulating conversation and guiding future research on these matters: the extent to which participants are actually reporting momentary experiences, respondents\u2019 interpretation of momentary questions, the use of comparison standards in responding, efforts to increase the EMA reporting period beyond the moment to longer periods within a day, training of EMA study participants, concerns about selection bias of respondents, the impact of missing EMA assessments, the reliability of momentary data, and for which purposes EMA might be considered a gold standard for assessment. Resolution of these issues should have far-reaching implications for advancing the field.", "generated_text": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Experience Sampling Method (ESM) have become increasingly popular in psychological and behavioral research. However, several pressing issues remain unaddressed in the field. This review critically evaluates key challenges in EMA implementation, including content validity, the establishment of gold standards, participant training, missingness, reliability, and selection bias. We examine current practices and propose potential solutions to enhance the robustness of EMA studies. Additionally, we explore the need for standardized comparison methods to facilitate cross-study analyses. Our findings highlight the importance of developing comprehensive guidelines for EMA design and execution, as well as the need for more rigorous validation processes. We conclude by outlining future research directions to address these challenges and improve the overall quality and reliability of EMA-based studies across various disciplines.", "label": 1}
