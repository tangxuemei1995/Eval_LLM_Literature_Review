{"grounding": "Global climate change is opening up new questions and reinvigorating old lines of inquiry in the study of international energy politics. Many policymakers and stakeholders are pushing for a clean energy transition away from the fossil fuels that have long dominated the world's energy supply. On some issues, there is considerable consensus between political scientists and other analysts, such as the basic categories of the \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d from the clean energy transition. On other issues, however, political science tends to depart significantly from other disciplines. The politics of the desired clean energy transition are highly complicated and filled with obstacles beyond those typically highlighted by either economics or physical sciences. For these reasons, energy politics associated with oil and other fossil fuels are far from over and continue to develop, even as new political dynamics associated with the clean energy transition emerge.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the evolving landscape of international energy politics in the context of climate change and the global transition to clean energy. It explores how traditional power dynamics centered on oil are being reshaped by the imperative to reduce carbon emissions and adopt renewable energy sources. The study analyzes the distributive politics of the energy transition, highlighting the emerging tensions between fossil fuel-dependent nations and those leading in clean technology development. It argues that climate change is fundamentally altering the geopolitical calculus of energy, creating new alliances, rivalries, and vulnerabilities. The research draws on case studies of key players in the global energy market to illustrate how countries are adapting their foreign policies and economic strategies to navigate this shifting terrain. The findings underscore the complex interplay between energy security, economic interests, and environmental imperatives in shaping international relations in the 21st century.", "label": 0}
