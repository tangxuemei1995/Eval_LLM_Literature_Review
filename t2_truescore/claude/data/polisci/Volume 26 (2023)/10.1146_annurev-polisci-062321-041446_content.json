{"grounding": "The concept of racist dehumanization is essential for political scientists who seek to understand the nature, scope, and consequences of white racial prejudice in the United States today. Racist dehumanization consists of a variety of processes that construct, refashion, and maintain race by coding some people as white and therefore fully human and others as other than white and therefore less than fully human. In this review, we focus on the racist dehumanization of Indigenous people and Black people, arguing that processes of dehumanization have long been implicated in both the practice of race-making and concurrent efforts to exploit and dominate racialized groups. We posit that contemporary white racial prejudice can be understood, in part, as the residue of these processes, and we conclude by describing how accounting for racist dehumanization can transform the study of white racial prejudice.", "generated_text": "This study examines the politics of racist dehumanization in the United States, focusing on the historical and contemporary manifestations of this phenomenon. Drawing on extensive literature from sociology, psychology, and political science, we analyze how dehumanizing attitudes and practices have been employed to justify and perpetuate racial inequalities. The research explores the intersections of race, prejudice, and power dynamics, with particular emphasis on the experiences of Black and Indigenous communities. We investigate the role of racial attitudes in shaping public policy and social interactions, as well as the psychological mechanisms underlying dehumanization. Our findings reveal persistent patterns of racist dehumanization across various societal domains, including education, criminal justice, and healthcare. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between racism and dehumanization, offering insights for developing more effective anti-racist strategies and policies.", "label": 1}
