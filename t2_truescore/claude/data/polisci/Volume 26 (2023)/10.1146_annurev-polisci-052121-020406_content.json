{"grounding": "We provide a unified language for studying power sharing in authoritarian regimes. Power-sharing deals entail not only sharing spoils between a ruler and challenger, but also establishing an enforcement mechanism. An arrangement does not truly share power without reallocating power to make it costly for the ruler to renege. Institutional concessions, such as delegating agenda control over policy decisions or empowering third-party enforcers, can reallocate power. However, weak institutions create a Catch-22 that inhibits credible commitment. When institutions are weak, self-enforcing power sharing is still possible if challengers have coercive means to defend their spoils. However, challengers can leverage their coercive capabilities to overthrow the ruler. This double-edged sword implies that a strategic dictator shares power only under specific conditions: challengers can credibly punish an autocratic ruler; if the ruler shares power, the challenger must willingly forgo taking harmful actions; and the ruler willingly acquiesces to diminished power and rents.", "generated_text": "This article examines the concept of authoritarian power sharing, exploring its mechanisms and strategies within the context of non-democratic regimes. Drawing on literature from authoritarian politics, civil wars, and institutional design, we analyze how autocrats navigate commitment problems and mitigate the risk of coups through power-sharing arrangements. We argue that authoritarian leaders employ various institutional tools and informal practices to distribute power among elite groups, balancing the need for loyalty with the imperative of maintaining control. The study identifies key mechanisms of power sharing, including co-optation, rotation of offices, and selective inclusion in decision-making processes. We also investigate how these strategies vary across different types of authoritarian regimes and their effectiveness in promoting regime stability. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of authoritarian governance and highlight the complex dynamics of power distribution in non-democratic settings.", "label": 1}
