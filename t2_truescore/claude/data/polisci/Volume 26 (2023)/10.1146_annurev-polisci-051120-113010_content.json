{"grounding": "There is an unexamined paradox in the history of government in the West. The so-called absolutist monarchs of Europe overwhelmingly chartered republican corporations\u2014e.g., towns, universities, and guilds whose members elected their leaders. Indeed, modern constitutional democracy is patterned after them. Yet, modern democracies themselves have overwhelmingly chartered authoritarian corporations\u2014e.g., universities and business corporations whose subjects have no vote. After this Great Inversion, corporations, which once distributed power and wealth, now concentrate them, straining constitutional democracy. Against this backdrop, this article analyzes the major types of relation maintained between states and corporations: constitutive (states charter corporations), mimetic (states and corporations recurrently copy one another's organizational features), and instrumental (each leans on the other, and sometimes captures it, to better advance its own purposes). The article then examines the special challenges that corporate economies pose to constitutional democracy and considers whether a partial reversal of the Great Inversion could reduce them.", "generated_text": "This article examines the complex relationship between democracy and the corporation from a historical perspective. Drawing on principles of republicanism and constitutionalism, it explores how corporate structures have evolved alongside democratic institutions. The study analyzes the tension between corporate power and democratic ideals, focusing on issues of inequality and representation. It investigates the concept of the enterprise foundation as a potential model for reconciling corporate interests with democratic values. The research traces the development of corporate governance and its impact on political systems, highlighting key moments of convergence and divergence. By taking a long view, the article reveals enduring patterns and challenges in balancing economic efficiency with democratic accountability. It concludes by proposing potential reforms to align corporate structures more closely with democratic principles, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of their interdependence in shaping modern societies.", "label": 1}
