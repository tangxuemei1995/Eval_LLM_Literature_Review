{"grounding": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing scholarly interest in nonviolent resistance\u2014a method of conflict in which unarmed people mobilize collective protests, strikes, and boycotts in a coordinated way. Mass movements that rely overwhelmingly on nonviolent resistance sometimes feature unarmed collective violence, fringe violence, or even organized armed action. What do we know about the effects of violent flanks on movement outcomes? This article reviews findings on the relationships between nonviolent and unarmed resistance, violence, and the outcomes of mass mobilization, as well as the directionality of these relationships. The balance of empirical evidence suggests that organized armed violence appears to reduce the chances for otherwise nonviolent movements to succeed, whereas unarmed collective violence has more ambiguous effects. The field will benefit from greater analytical precision in comparing the units of analysis, scope, intensity, and media framing of violent flank activity.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationship between nonviolent resistance movements and the occurrence of violent actions within their broader context. By analyzing historical cases and contemporary examples, we investigate the impact of violent flanks, unarmed collective violence, and riots on the effectiveness and outcomes of nonviolent protests. Our research challenges the traditional dichotomy between violent and nonviolent resistance, exploring how these seemingly contradictory approaches may interact and influence each other. We argue that the presence of violent elements can both hinder and enhance nonviolent movements, depending on various factors such as timing, scale, and public perception. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on the efficacy of nonviolent resistance and provides insights into the nuanced dynamics of social movements, offering valuable implications for activists, policymakers, and scholars in the field of conflict resolution and social change.", "label": 0}
