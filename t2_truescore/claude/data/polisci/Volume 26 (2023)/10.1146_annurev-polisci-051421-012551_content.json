{"grounding": "A growing literature explores how local environments, or contexts, affect political behavior, especially by shaping interpersonal contact with social out-groups. While many studies still draw directly on long-standing hypotheses from contact theory, this research agenda increasingly focuses on new research questions, beyond the classic social psychology literature, and new empirical cases, including from across the lower- and middle-income world. We develop a typology of forms of context and contact to aid the aggregation of findings across disparate cases and demonstrate that the mechanisms that may account for the political effects of intergroup context and contact are broader than those typically explored in psychologically oriented research. We propose future directions for research in this area, including greater focus on the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact and greater attention to how built or computer-based environments may mediate or mirror the effects of demographic contexts.", "generated_text": "This article proposes a unified framework for studying environmental effects on political behavior by integrating two distinct research traditions: context and contact theory. While contextual studies focus on how neighborhood characteristics shape political attitudes, contact theory examines the impact of interpersonal interactions. We argue that combining these approaches provides a more comprehensive understanding of environmental influences on politics. Drawing on literature from political science, sociology, and urban studies, we demonstrate how physical and social environments interact to affect political outcomes. Our framework considers factors such as ethnic diversity, economic inequality, and the built environment, highlighting their interconnected roles in shaping political behavior. By bridging the gap between context and contact research, this study offers new insights into the complex relationship between individuals' surroundings and their political attitudes, paving the way for more nuanced analyses of environmental effects on politics.", "label": 0}
