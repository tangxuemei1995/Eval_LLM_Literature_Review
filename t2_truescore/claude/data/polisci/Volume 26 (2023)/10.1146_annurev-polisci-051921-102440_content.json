{"grounding": "A recent wave of research in political science examines the past using statistical methods for causal inference and formal theory\u2014a field widely known as historical political economy (HPE). We examine the development of this field. Our survey reveals three common uses of history in HPE: understanding the past for its own sake, using history as a way to understand the present, and using history as a setting to explore theoretical conjectures. We present important work in each area and discuss trade-offs of each approach. We further identify key practical and analytical challenges for scholars of HPE, including the accessibility of data that do exist and obstacles to inference when they do not. Looking to the future, we see improved training for scholars entering the field, a heightened focus on the accumulation of knowledge, and greater attention to underexplored topics such as race, gender, ethnicity, and climate change.", "generated_text": "Historical political economy has emerged as a vibrant field at the intersection of history, economics, and political science. This article surveys the past, present, and future of this interdisciplinary approach. We trace its origins in economic history and historical institutionalism, highlighting the field's emphasis on long-term legacies and persistence of historical events. We then examine current methodological trends, including the use of natural experiments, archival research, and formal theory to establish causal relationships between historical factors and contemporary outcomes. The article also discusses key substantive areas of inquiry, such as state formation, colonialism, and economic development. Looking ahead, we identify promising avenues for future research, including the integration of micro-level historical data with macro-level outcomes and the application of machine learning techniques to historical sources. We conclude by reflecting on the field's potential to enhance our understanding of contemporary political and economic phenomena.", "label": 1}
