{"grounding": "Bureaucracy is everywhere. Unelected bureaucrats are a key link between government and citizens, between policy and implementation. Bureaucratic politics constitutes a growing share of research in political science. But the way bureaucracy is studied varies widely, permitting theoretical and empirical blind spots as well as opportunities for innovation. Scholars of American politics tend to focus on bureaucratic policy making at the national level, while comparativists often home in on local implementation by street-level bureaucrats. Data availability and professional incentives have reinforced these subfield-specific blind spots over time. We highlight these divides in three prominent research areas: the selection and retention of bureaucratic personnel, oversight of bureaucratic activities, and opportunities for influence by actors external to the bureaucracy. Our survey reveals how scholars from the American and comparative politics traditions can learn from one another.", "generated_text": "This article examines the current state of bureaucratic politics research in political science, highlighting both blind spots and opportunities for future inquiry. We review recent literature on personnel management, political appointments, bureaucratic performance, and oversight mechanisms. Our analysis reveals significant gaps in understanding the complex interplay between bureaucratic structures and political influence, particularly in areas such as lobbying and procurement processes. We argue that these blind spots hinder a comprehensive understanding of how bureaucracies shape policy outcomes and democratic accountability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a research agenda that emphasizes cross-disciplinary approaches, integrating insights from public administration, organizational theory, and political economy. By focusing on these understudied aspects of bureaucratic politics, scholars can develop more nuanced theories of governance and contribute to improving the effectiveness and accountability of public institutions.", "label": 1}
