{"grounding": "This article reviews the field of citizenship studies, with attention to the causes and consequences of policy. It summarizes key findings and points of consensus across three research domains: the determinants of citizenship policy, the consequences of citizenship policy, and the consequences of citizenship, i.e., the utility of obtaining citizenship for immigrant integration. After identifying strengths and weaknesses of each, I propose new directions in research that widen the field in terms of cases and generalizable theory while also deepening the field through serious attention to approaches that center the immigrant experience.", "generated_text": "This study examines the causes and consequences of citizenship policies in Western Europe, focusing on naturalization processes and their impact on immigration and integration. By analyzing policy variations across countries and over time, we investigate the factors influencing citizenship acquisition and its effects on immigrants' socioeconomic outcomes. Our findings reveal that more inclusive naturalization policies are associated with higher rates of citizenship acquisition and improved integration outcomes. However, we also observe significant differences in policy implementation and effectiveness across countries, highlighting the complex interplay between citizenship, immigration, and integration in Western European contexts.", "label": 0}
