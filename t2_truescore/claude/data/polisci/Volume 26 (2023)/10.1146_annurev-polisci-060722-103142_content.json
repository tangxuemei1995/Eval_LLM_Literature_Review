{"grounding": "Political scientist Hakeem Jefferson (Stanford University) facilitated a discussion about race, policing, and the state of American democracy with fellow political scientists Cathy J. Cohen (University of Chicago), Yanilda M. Gonz\u00e1lez (Harvard Kennedy School), Rebecca U. Thorpe (University of Washington), and Vesla M. Weaver (Johns Hopkins University) on May 26, 2021. The conversation occurred a year after George Perry Floyd Jr., a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Moving beyond common notions of democracy that focus primarily on voting and electoral participation, the panelists discussed how American policing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, redefine citizenship, redistribute power, and shape marginalized people's understanding of their place in society. Closing remarks addressed the potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people and how political scientists can more usefully contribute to efforts that strengthen democracy for all. This is an edited transcript of the conversation and includes a bibliography of the sources mentioned. A video of the conversation is available online at \nhttps://www.annualreviews.org/r/BeyondtheBallotBox\n.", "generated_text": "This study examines the complex relationship between democracy, policing, and racial dynamics in the United States. By analyzing historical trends and contemporary data, we explore how policing practices have both shaped and been shaped by the evolving nature of American democracy. The research investigates the tension between the ideals of multiracial democracy and the persistence of racial authoritarianism within the criminal justice system. We argue that policing serves as a critical lens through which to understand the broader challenges facing American democracy, particularly in relation to issues of identity and racial equity. Our findings suggest that reform efforts in policing are inextricably linked to the broader project of strengthening democratic institutions and practices. The study contributes to ongoing debates about the role of law enforcement in a diverse society and offers insights into potential pathways for fostering a more inclusive and equitable democracy that extends beyond traditional electoral processes.", "label": 1}
