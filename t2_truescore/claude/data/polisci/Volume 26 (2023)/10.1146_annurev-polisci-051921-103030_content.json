{"grounding": "The article reviews the recent advances in comparative political economy. It reconnects knowledge on growth regimes and welfare regimes by analyzing how growth and welfare regimes covary over both time and space. It underlines the fact that governments pursue different growth strategies to adjust to new economic environments, focusing in particular on welfare state reforms. Synthesizing the literature, we propose a definition of growth and welfare regimes that integrates different engines of growth as a way to track general trends in the evolution of capitalism. We analyze the main trends of three eras of capitalism: Fordism, neoliberal financialization, and the digitalized knowledge-based economy. We trace the various paths of change by identifying the five growth strategies governments have pursued to adapt their growth and welfare regimes to the new capitalist era. The result is not a typology of fixed types of capitalist models but a dynamic process of adjustment.", "generated_text": "This study examines the divergent trajectories of growth and welfare regimes across time and space, focusing on the transition from Fordism to financialization and the knowledge-based economy. Employing a comparative political economy approach, we analyze how different countries have adapted their welfare states to changing economic paradigms. Our research reveals that while global trends in economic development have been broadly similar, nations have pursued distinct paths in balancing growth and social protection. We investigate the role of institutional legacies, political coalitions, and policy choices in shaping these diverse outcomes. The findings suggest that despite convergence pressures, significant variations persist in how countries navigate the challenges of globalization, technological change, and demographic shifts. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between economic growth models and welfare state configurations, offering insights into the future of social policy in an era of rapid economic transformation.", "label": 1}
