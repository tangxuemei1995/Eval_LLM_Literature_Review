{"grounding": "Heterogeneity in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is increasingly being recognized as one of the principal barriers to finding efficacious targeted therapies. The advent of multiple high-throughput biological data (\u201comics\u201d), coupled with the widespread access to increased computational power, has led to the emergence of phenotyping in critical care. Phenotyping aims to use a multitude of data to identify homogenous subgroups within an otherwise heterogenous population. Increasingly, phenotyping schemas are being applied to sepsis and ARDS to increase understanding of these clinical conditions and identify potential therapies. Here we present a selective review of the biological phenotyping schemas applied to sepsis and ARDS. Further, we outline some of the challenges involved in translating these conceptual findings to bedside clinical decision-making tools.", "generated_text": "Sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are complex, heterogeneous conditions with high mortality rates in critical care settings. Recent advances in biological phenotyping have revealed distinct subphenotypes within these syndromes, offering new insights into their underlying pathophysiology. This review explores the current state of biological phenotyping in sepsis and ARDS, highlighting key subphenotypes identified through various omics approaches and their potential implications for precision medicine. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in translating these findings into clinical practice, including the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies. By leveraging biological phenotyping, clinicians and researchers may be able to improve patient outcomes and advance our understanding of these critical illnesses.", "label": 1}
