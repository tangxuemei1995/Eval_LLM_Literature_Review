{"grounding": "Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which is frequently fatal, has garnered increased attention with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. A variety of hyperinflammatory conditions associated with multiorgan system failure can be lumped under the CSS umbrella, including familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and secondary HLH associated with infections, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, in which case CSS is termed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Various classification and diagnostic CSS criteria exist and include clinical, laboratory, pathologic, and genetic features. Familial HLH results from cytolytic homozygous genetic defects in the perforin pathway employed by cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Similarly, NK cell dysfunction is often present in secondary HLH and MAS, and heterozygous mutations in familial HLH genes are frequently present. Targeting overly active lymphocytes and macrophages with etoposide and glucocorticoids is the standard for treating HLH; however, more targeted and safer anticytokine (e.g., anti-interleukin-1, -6) approaches are gaining traction as effective alternatives.", "generated_text": "Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by an excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to systemic hyperinflammation. This review explores the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of CSS, encompassing related conditions such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The dysregulated immune response in CSS results in widespread tissue damage, multi-organ failure, and potentially fatal outcomes. We discuss the complex interplay between various immune cells, particularly macrophages and T cells, and their role in perpetuating the inflammatory cascade. Additionally, we examine the diagnostic challenges, biomarkers, and current therapeutic approaches, including targeted immunomodulatory therapies. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of CSS is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes in this rapidly evolving field of immunology and critical care medicine.", "label": 1}
