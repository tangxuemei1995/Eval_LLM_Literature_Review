{"grounding": "Billions of individuals worldwide have benefited from the unprecedented large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Given the sheer number of people that have received these vaccines, it is not surprising that rare side effects are reported that were not previously detected in the phase III vaccine trials. This review addresses one rare complication called SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It occurs in approximately 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 recipients of the adenovirus vector\u2013based COVID-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca-Oxford or Johnson & Johnson. Information on VITT syndrome was disseminated quickly via social media and publications after it was first discovered. Initial observations associating VITT with specific patient populations, thrombus locations, and outcomes associated with heparin therapy have since been refined with additional clinical experience. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of VITT.", "generated_text": "The global rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been crucial in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a rare but severe adverse event, vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), has emerged as a concern. This review examines the current understanding of VITT, its proposed pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management strategies. VITT is characterized by thrombosis in atypical sites, accompanied by thrombocytopenia, occurring 4-30 days post-vaccination. The condition is associated with the production of platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4). While the incidence of VITT is low, its potential severity necessitates prompt recognition and appropriate treatment. Management typically involves avoiding heparin, administering non-heparin anticoagulants, and intravenous immunoglobulin. This review aims to provide clinicians with essential knowledge to identify and manage VITT effectively, ensuring the continued safe use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.", "label": 1}
