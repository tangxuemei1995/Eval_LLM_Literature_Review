{"grounding": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different approaches with lentiviral vector\u2013mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation. Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality.", "generated_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating genetic disorder affecting millions worldwide. This review explores diverse approaches to gene therapy for SCD, focusing on recent advancements in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene editing techniques. We examine the potential of lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition and CRISPR-based gene editing strategies in correcting the underlying genetic defect. The progress in developing autologous transplantation methods to overcome limitations of allogeneic transplants is discussed. Additionally, we analyze the efficacy and safety profiles of various gene therapy approaches in clinical trials. While challenges remain, including optimizing delivery methods and minimizing off-target effects, gene therapy shows promise in providing long-term curative options for SCD patients. This review highlights the current state of gene therapy for SCD and its potential to revolutionize treatment paradigms.", "label": 1}
