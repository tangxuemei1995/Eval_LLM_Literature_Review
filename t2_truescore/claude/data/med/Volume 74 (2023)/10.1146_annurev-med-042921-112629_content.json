{"grounding": "Polygenic scores quantify inherited risk by integrating information from many common sites of DNA variation into a single number. Rapid increases in the scale of genetic association studies and new statistical algorithms have enabled development of polygenic scores that meaningfully measure\u2014as early as birth\u2014risk of coronary artery disease. These newer-generation polygenic scores identify up to 8% of the population with triple the normal risk based on genetic variation alone, and these individuals cannot be identified on the basis of family history or clinical risk factors alone. For those identified with increased genetic risk, evidence supports risk reduction with at least two interventions, adherence to a healthy lifestyle and cholesterol-lowering therapies, that can substantially reduce risk. Alongside considerable enthusiasm for the potential of polygenic risk estimation to enable a new era of preventive clinical medicine is recognition of a need for ongoing research into how best to ensure equitable performance across diverse ancestries, how and in whom to assess the scores in clinical practice, as well as randomized trials to confirm clinical utility.", "generated_text": "Polygenic scores have emerged as a powerful tool in genomic research, offering new insights into the genetic architecture of complex diseases. This review focuses on recent advances and applications of polygenic scores in the context of coronary artery disease (CAD). We examine the development of increasingly accurate polygenic scores for CAD risk prediction, incorporating large-scale genome-wide association studies and advanced statistical methods. The integration of polygenic scores with traditional risk factors has shown promise in enhancing risk stratification and improving prevention strategies. We discuss the potential of polygenic scores in identifying high-risk individuals who may benefit from early intervention or more aggressive preventive measures. Additionally, we explore the challenges and limitations of implementing polygenic scores in clinical practice, including issues of generalizability across diverse populations and the need for standardization. Finally, we highlight future directions for research, including the potential for personalized medicine approaches based on polygenic risk assessment for CAD.", "label": 1}
