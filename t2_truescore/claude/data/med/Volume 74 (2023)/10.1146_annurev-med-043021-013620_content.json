{"grounding": "Chronic respiratory failure is a common, important complication of many types of neuromuscular and chest wall disorders. While the pathophysiology of each disease may be different, these disorders can variably affect all muscles involved in breathing, including inspiratory, expiratory, and bulbar muscles, ultimately leading to chronic respiratory failure and hypoventilation. The use of home assisted ventilation through noninvasive interfaces aims to improve the symptoms of hypoventilation, improve sleep quality, and, when possible, improve mortality. An increasing variety of interfaces has allowed for improved comfort and compliance. In a minority of scenarios, noninvasive ventilation is either not appropriate or no longer effective due to disease progression, and a transition to tracheal ventilation should be considered.", "generated_text": "Chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure is a significant complication of various neuromuscular disorders, leading to decreased quality of life and increased mortality. This review explores the role of home assisted ventilation in managing this condition, focusing on noninvasive ventilation techniques. We examine the physiological mechanisms underlying respiratory failure in neuromuscular diseases and discuss the benefits of early intervention with home ventilation. The review highlights recent advancements in ventilator technology, patient interfaces, and monitoring systems that have improved the efficacy and acceptability of home-based respiratory support. Additionally, we address the challenges in implementing and maintaining long-term ventilation at home, including patient adherence, caregiver burden, and healthcare resource allocation. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in optimizing outcomes for patients with chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure.", "label": 1}
