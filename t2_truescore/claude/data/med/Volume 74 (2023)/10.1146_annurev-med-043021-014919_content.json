{"grounding": "Nearly half of Americans are projected to have obesity by 2030, underscoring the pressing need for effective treatments. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) represent the first agents in a rapidly evolving, highly promising landscape of nascent hormone-based obesity therapeutics. With the understanding of the neurobiology of obesity rapidly expanding, these emerging entero-endocrine and endo-pancreatic agents combined or coformulated with GLP-1 RAs herald a new era of targeted, mechanism-based treatment of obesity. This article reviews GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of obesity and previews the imminent future of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based anti-obesity therapeutics.", "generated_text": "The obesity epidemic continues to pose significant health challenges worldwide. This review explores the latest advancements in obesity treatment, focusing on GLP-1 receptor agonists and emerging nutrient-stimulated hormone-based (NuSH) therapies. We discuss the efficacy and safety of current GLP-1 receptor agonists as antiobesity medications and examine the potential of dual and triple receptor agonists. Additionally, we investigate the promising field of NuSH-based therapies, which harness the body's natural appetite-regulating mechanisms. By analyzing recent clinical trials and preclinical studies, we highlight the potential of these innovative approaches to revolutionize obesity management and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
