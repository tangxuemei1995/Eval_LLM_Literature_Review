{"grounding": "Shortly after the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019, clinicians rapidly recognized an apparent association between the disease and both arterial and venous thrombotic complications, which was confirmed in epidemiologic studies. Based on these data, hospitals empirically developed and implemented protocols with different strategies for anticoagulation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Subsequent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) clarified the role of anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and recently discharged from the hospital. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, observational comparative effectiveness analyses that provided hints of a benefit from anticoagulation, and finally the RCTs that established which patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation. These RCTs have demonstrated that hospitalized, noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation, but patients who are hospitalized and critically ill, discharged from the hospital, or not hospitalized do not benefit.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant risk of thrombotic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related thrombosis and evaluates current therapeutic strategies. We discuss the complex interplay between inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation activation in COVID-19 patients. The role of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in preventing and managing thrombotic events is critically examined, with a focus on their efficacy and safety profiles. Recent clinical trials and observational studies are analyzed to provide evidence-based recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in different patient populations. Additionally, we address the challenges in balancing the risk of thrombosis against the potential for bleeding complications. This comprehensive review aims to guide clinicians in optimizing antithrombotic strategies for COVID-19 patients and identifies areas for future research to improve outcomes in this evolving field.", "label": 1}
