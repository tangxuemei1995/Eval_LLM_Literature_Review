{"grounding": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described in 1906 as a dementing disease marked by the presence of two types of fibrillar aggregates in the brain: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. The process of aggregation and formation of the aggregates has been a major focus of investigation ever since the discoveries that the tau protein is the predominant protein in tangles and amyloid \u03b2 is the predominant protein in plaques. The idea that smaller, oligomeric species of amyloid may also be bioactive has now been clearly established. This review examines the possibility that soluble, nonfibrillar, bioactive forms of tau\u2014the \u201ctau we cannot see\u201d\u2014comprise a dominant driver of neurodegeneration in AD.", "generated_text": "Tau protein aggregation and neurofibrillary tangle formation are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, yet our understanding of tau's role in neurodegeneration remains incomplete. This review explores recent advances in tau research, focusing on novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We examine the complex interplay between tau pathology and cognitive decline, highlighting the potential of tau-targeted interventions. Additionally, we discuss emerging imaging techniques and fluid-based assays that enable earlier and more accurate detection of tau-related changes. By synthesizing current knowledge on tau's multifaceted involvement in Alzheimer's disease, this review aims to provide insights into future directions for diagnosis and treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.", "label": 1}
