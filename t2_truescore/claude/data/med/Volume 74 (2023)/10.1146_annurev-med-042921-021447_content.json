{"grounding": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited multisystemic disease that can cause progressive bronchiectasis, pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, liver dysfunction, and other disorders. Traditional therapies focused on the treatment or prevention of damage to each organ system with incremental modalities such as nebulized medications for the lungs, insulin for diabetes, and supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. However, the advent of highly effective modulator therapies that target specific cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein malformations resulting from individual genetic mutations has transformed the lives and prognosis for persons with CF.", "generated_text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Recent advancements in CFTR modulator therapies have revolutionized CF treatment. These modulators target specific defects in CFTR protein function, improving chloride transport and alleviating symptoms. This review explores the mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety profiles of various CFTR modulators, including potentiators, correctors, and amplifiers. We discuss the impact of these therapies on patient outcomes, quality of life, and disease progression. Additionally, we examine ongoing research and future directions in modulator therapy development for CF patients with rare mutations.", "label": 1}
