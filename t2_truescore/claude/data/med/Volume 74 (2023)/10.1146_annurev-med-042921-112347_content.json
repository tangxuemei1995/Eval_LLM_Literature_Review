{"grounding": "Aging is associated with increased mutational burden in every tissue studied. Occasionally, fitness-increasing mutations will arise, leading to stem cell clonal expansion. This process occurs in several tissues but has been best studied in blood. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, which result if additional cooperating mutations occur. Surprisingly, it is also associated with an increased risk of nonmalignant diseases, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This may be due to enhanced inflammation in mutated innate immune cells, which could be targeted clinically with anti-inflammatory drugs. Recent studies have uncovered other factors that predict poor outcomes in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, such as size of the mutant clone, mutated driver genes, and epigenetic aging. Though clonality is inevitable and largely a function of time, recent work has shown that inherited genetic variation can also influence this process. Clonal hematopoiesis provides a paradigm for understanding how age-related changes in tissue stem cell composition and function influence human health.", "generated_text": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has emerged as a significant factor in age-related health outcomes. This review explores the impact of CHIP on human health, focusing on its associations with aging, coronary artery disease (CAD), and malignancy. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying CHIP, including DNA methylation changes and clonal trajectories. Recent studies have revealed that CHIP is more prevalent in older individuals and is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events and hematological malignancies. The review discusses how CHIP-associated mutations in genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 contribute to altered hematopoietic stem cell function and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we analyze the potential of CHIP as a biomarker for age-related diseases and its implications for personalized medicine. Understanding the complex interplay between CHIP and human health may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for age-related disorders and cancer prevention.", "label": 1}
