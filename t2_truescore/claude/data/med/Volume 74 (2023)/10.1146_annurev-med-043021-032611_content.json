{"grounding": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating autoimmune disease that can result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and treatment of SLE are clinical challenges. Patient presentation and response to therapy are heterogeneous because of the complex immune dysregulation that results in SLE disease pathogenesis. An intricate interplay between genetic risk and skewing of adaptive and innate immune system responses leads to overproduction of type I interferons and other cytokines, complement activation, immune-complex deposition, and ultimately inflammation and tissue damage. Here, we review the classification criteria as well as standard and emerging diagnostic tools available to identify patients with SLE. We then focus on medical management, including novel therapeutics, nonpharmacologic interventions, and comorbidity management.", "generated_text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) remains a challenging autoimmune disease to diagnose and treat. This review explores recent advancements in SLE management, focusing on novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches. We discuss the role of interferon signatures in disease pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers. The emergence of biologic therapies targeting specific immune pathways has revolutionized SLE treatment, offering new hope for patients with refractory disease. We examine the efficacy and safety profiles of recently approved biologics and those in late-stage clinical trials. Additionally, we highlight the importance of personalized medicine in SLE, emphasizing the need for tailored treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics and disease manifestations. These developments promise to improve outcomes and quality of life for SLE patients.", "label": 1}
