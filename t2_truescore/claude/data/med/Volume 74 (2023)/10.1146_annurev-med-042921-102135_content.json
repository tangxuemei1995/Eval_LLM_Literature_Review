{"grounding": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) were originally developed as antidiabetic agents, with cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials demonstrating improved CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Secondary analyses of CV outcome trials and later dedicated kidney outcome trials consistently reported improved kidney-related outcomes independent of T2D status and across a range of kidney function and albuminuria. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trials and real-world analyses demonstrating a decrease in the risk of acute kidney injury. The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors generally extend across different members of the class, possibly on the basis of hemodynamic, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in diverse patient populations.", "generated_text": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a groundbreaking therapeutic class in the management of kidney diseases. Initially developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, these agents have demonstrated remarkable renoprotective effects in both diabetic and nondiabetic kidney diseases. This review explores the expanding role of SGLT2 inhibitors in nephrology, focusing on their impact on kidney outcomes, including reduced progression of chronic kidney disease and decreased risk of acute kidney injury. We examine the mechanisms underlying their renoprotective effects, which extend beyond glycemic control to include hemodynamic, metabolic, and anti-inflammatory actions. The potential of SGLT2 inhibitors in various kidney diseases is discussed, along with ongoing clinical trials and future directions for research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
