{"grounding": "Understanding how biases originate in medical technologies and developing safeguards to identify, mitigate, and remove their harms are essential to ensuring equal performance in all individuals. Drawing upon examples from pulmonary medicine, this article describes how bias can be introduced in the physical aspects of the technology design, via unrepresentative data, or by conflation of biological with social determinants of health. It then can be perpetuated by inadequate evaluation and regulatory standards. Research demonstrates that pulse oximeters perform differently depending on patient race and ethnicity. Pulmonary function testing and algorithms used to predict healthcare needs are two additional examples of medical technologies with racial and ethnic biases that may perpetuate health disparities.", "generated_text": "This review explores the origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies, focusing on disparities in pulse oximetry and pulmonary function testing. We examine how structural racism has influenced the development and implementation of medical devices and algorithms in respiratory care. The study analyzes historical data, clinical trials, and recent research to uncover the roots of these biases and their impact on patient outcomes. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies in the accuracy of pulmonary measurements across different racial and ethnic groups, highlighting the need for more inclusive device design and algorithm development. We discuss potential solutions and emphasize the importance of addressing these disparities to improve healthcare equity and patient safety in pulmonary medicine.", "label": 1}
