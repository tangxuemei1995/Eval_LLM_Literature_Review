{"grounding": "In 2020, the nephrology community formally interrogated long-standing race-based clinical algorithms used in the field, including the kidney function estimation equations. A comprehensive understanding of the history of kidney function estimation and racial essentialism is necessary to understand underpinnings of the incorporation of a Black race coefficient into prior equations. We provide a review of this history, as well as the considerations used to develop race-free equations that are a guidepost for a more equity-oriented, scientifically rigorous future for kidney function estimation and other clinical algorithms and processes in which race may be embedded as a variable.", "generated_text": "The use of race in kidney function estimation has been a contentious issue in nephrology. This review examines the historical context, scientific validity, and ethical implications of incorporating race into clinical algorithms for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We analyze the lessons learned from recent efforts to remove race from these equations and discuss the broader implications for health equity. The paper explores alternative approaches to kidney function estimation that prioritize accuracy while avoiding the perpetuation of racial disparities. Finally, we propose a framework for developing more inclusive and just clinical tools, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and patient engagement in advancing health justice in nephrology and beyond.", "label": 1}
