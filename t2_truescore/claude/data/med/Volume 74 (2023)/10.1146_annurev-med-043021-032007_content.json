Numerous studies, primarily of short- and medium-term duration (up to 6 years), demonstrate the clearly beneficial\u2014even lifesaving\u2014mental health impact of gender-affirming medical care in TGD youth. However, there are significant gaps in knowledge and challenges to such care. Long-term safety and efficacy studies are needed to optimize medical care for TGD youth.", "generated_text": "This review examines current concepts in gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth.
