{"grounding": "Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) have radically transformed the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed rare/ultrarare Mendelian diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), the technology integral for ES, GS, and most large (100+) gene panels, has enabled previously unimaginable diagnoses, changes in medical management, new treatments, and accurate reproductive risk assessments for patients, as well as new disease gene discoveries. Yet, challenges remain, as most individuals remain undiagnosed with current NGS. Improved NGS technology has resulted in long-read sequencing, which may resolve diagnoses in some patients who do not obtain a diagnosis with current short-read ES and GS, but its effectiveness is unclear, and it is expensive. Other challenges that persist include the resolution of variants of uncertain significance, the urgent need for patients with ultrarare disorders to have access to therapeutics, the need for equity in patient access to NGS-based testing, and the study of ethical concerns. However, the outlook for undiagnosed disease resolution is bright, due to continual advancements in the field.", "generated_text": "Exome and genome sequencing have revolutionized the diagnosis of rare and undiagnosed genetic disorders. This review explores the application of next-generation sequencing technologies in identifying the molecular basis of Mendelian diseases and complex syndromes that have eluded traditional diagnostic approaches. We discuss the advantages and limitations of exome sequencing compared to whole-genome sequencing in the context of undiagnosed diseases. The paper examines recent advances in bioinformatics tools and variant interpretation strategies that have improved the diagnostic yield of these technologies. Additionally, we highlight the importance of integrating clinical phenotyping with genomic data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The review also addresses the challenges of interpreting variants of uncertain significance and the ethical considerations surrounding incidental findings. Finally, we present case studies demonstrating the successful application of exome/genome sequencing in solving diagnostic odysseys and discuss the potential for these technologies to guide personalized treatment strategies in rare disease management.", "label": 1}
