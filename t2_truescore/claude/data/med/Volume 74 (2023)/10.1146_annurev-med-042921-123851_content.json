{"grounding": "Maternal mortality is unusually high in the United States compared to other wealthy nations and is characterized by major disparities in race/ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic factors. Similar to other developed nations, the United States has seen a shift in the underlying causes of pregnancy-related death, with a relative increase in mortality resulting from diseases of the cardiovascular system and preexisting medical conditions. Improved continuity of care aimed at identifying reproductive-age women with preexisting conditions that may heighten the risk of maternal death, preconception management of risk factors for major adverse pregnancy outcomes, and primary care visits within the first year after delivery may offer opportunities to address gaps in medical care contributing to the unacceptable rates of maternal mortality in the United States.", "generated_text": "Maternal mortality in the United States remains a critical public health concern, with rates significantly higher than other developed nations. This review examines recent trends in maternal mortality, highlighting persistent disparities among racial and socioeconomic groups. We explore the role of preconception health and counseling in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal deaths. The analysis reveals that addressing modifiable risk factors before pregnancy, improving access to quality healthcare, and implementing evidence-based interventions can significantly reduce maternal mortality rates. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of targeted interventions for high-risk populations and the need for comprehensive policy changes to support maternal health. This review emphasizes the urgent need for a multifaceted approach to prevent maternal deaths and reduce disparities in maternal health outcomes across the United States.", "label": 1}
