{"grounding": "In vivo gene therapy is rapidly emerging as a new therapeutic paradigm for monogenic disorders. For almost three decades, hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) have served as model disorders for the development of gene therapy. This effort is soon to bear fruit with completed pivotal adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene addition trials reporting encouraging results and regulatory approval widely anticipated in the near future for the current generation of HA and HB AAV vectors. Here we review the clinical development of AAV gene therapy for HA and HB and examine outstanding questions that have recently emerged from AAV clinical trials for hemophilia and other monogenic disorders.", "generated_text": "Hemophilia, a genetic bleeding disorder caused by deficiencies in coagulation factors VIII or IX, has long been a target for gene therapy. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have emerged as promising tools for delivering functional genes to treat both hemophilia A and B. This review explores recent advances in AAV-mediated gene therapy for hemophilia, highlighting successful clinical trials that have demonstrated long-term expression of therapeutic levels of clotting factors. We discuss the challenges of immune responses to AAV vectors and strategies to overcome them. Additionally, we examine ongoing efforts to optimize vector design, improve transgene expression, and enhance the safety profile of AAV-based therapies. The potential of AAV gene therapy to revolutionize hemophilia treatment is evaluated, considering both current limitations and future prospects.", "label": 1}
