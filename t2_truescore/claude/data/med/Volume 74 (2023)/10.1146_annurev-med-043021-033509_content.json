{"grounding": "The multifaceted interaction between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the endocrine system has been a major area of scientific research over the past two years. While common endocrine/metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes have been recognized among significant risk factors for COVID-19 severity, several endocrine organs were identified to be targeted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). New-onset endocrine disorders related to COVID-19 were reported while long-term effects, if any, are yet to be determined. Meanwhile, the \u201cstay home\u201d measures during the pandemic caused interruption in the care of patients with pre-existing endocrine disorders and may have impeded the diagnosis and treatment of new ones. This review aims to outline this complex interaction between COVID-19 and endocrine disorders by synthesizing the current scientific knowledge obtained from clinical and pathophysiological studies, and to emphasize considerations for future research.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has significantly impacted global health, with emerging evidence suggesting a complex interplay between the virus and the endocrine system. This review explores the bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and various endocrine disorders, focusing on obesity, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, pituitary disorders, and reproductive health. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to exacerbate pre-existing endocrine conditions and potentially trigger new ones. Conversely, certain endocrine disorders, particularly obesity, have been associated with increased COVID-19 severity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying these interactions involve ACE2 receptor expression, cytokine storms, and direct viral effects on endocrine tissues. Understanding these connections is crucial for optimizing patient care, developing targeted therapies, and improving outcomes in individuals with endocrine disorders during the ongoing pandemic.", "label": 1}
