{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell therapy has transformed the management of relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. Despite high overall response rates, relapse post CAR T treatment remains a clinical challenge. Loss of target antigen, specifically CD19, is one well-defined mechanism of disease relapse. The mechanism of CD19 loss and which patients are at higher risk of CD19 loss remain poorly understood. To overcome CD19 loss, CARs targeting multiple antigens are being tested in clinical trials. CD19/20 and CD19/22 bispecific CARs demonstrate cytotoxicity against CD19-negative cells in preclinical studies. These CARs have also shown efficacy, safety, and a relatively low rate of CD19-negative relapse in phase I trials. These small studies suggest that multispecific CAR T cells can deprive lymphomas of escape via antigen loss. However, the selection of an ideal target, the right CAR construct, and whether these multispecific CARs can induce long-term remissions are still under investigation.", "generated_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating hematological malignancies. However, antigen loss remains a significant challenge, leading to tumor escape and relapse. This study investigates the efficacy of multispecific CAR T cells in addressing antigen loss in lymphomas. We engineered bispecific and trispecific CAR T cells targeting combinations of CD19, CD20, and CD22 antigens. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated superior antitumor activity of multispecific CAR T cells compared to monospecific counterparts. Notably, trispecific CAR T cells exhibited enhanced persistence and reduced antigen escape in patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistic studies revealed increased activation and reduced exhaustion in multispecific CAR T cells. Our findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cells represent a promising approach to mitigate antigen loss and improve long-term outcomes in lymphoma patients, potentially revolutionizing CAR T cell therapy for hematological malignancies.", "label": 1}
