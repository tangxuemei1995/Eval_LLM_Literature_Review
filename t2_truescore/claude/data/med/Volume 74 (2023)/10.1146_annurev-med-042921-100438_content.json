{"grounding": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension but is frequently underrecognized and undertreated. Patients with PA are at a markedly increased risk for target organ damage to the heart and kidneys. While patients with unilateral PA can be treated surgically, many patients with PA are not eligible or willing to undergo surgery. Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are highly effective for treating PA and reducing the risk of target organ damage. However, steroidal MRAs are often underprescribed and can be poorly tolerated by some patients due to side effects. Nonsteroidal MRAs reduce adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetic kidney disease and are bettertolerated than steroidal MRAs. While their blood pressure\u2013lowering effects remain unclear, these agents may have a potential role in reducing target organ damage in patients with PA.", "generated_text": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common cause of secondary hypertension associated with increased cardiovascular and renal morbidity. This review explores the pathophysiology of PA and the therapeutic potential of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in protecting the heart and kidneys. We discuss the mechanisms by which excess aldosterone contributes to cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, highlighting the role of mineralocorticoid receptor activation in promoting inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress. The review examines the efficacy of MRAs in reducing blood pressure, improving cardiovascular outcomes, and preserving renal function in patients with PA. Additionally, we address the challenges in diagnosing PA and the importance of early intervention with MRAs to prevent end-organ damage. Finally, we consider emerging research on novel MRAs and their potential to enhance treatment options for PA.", "label": 1}
