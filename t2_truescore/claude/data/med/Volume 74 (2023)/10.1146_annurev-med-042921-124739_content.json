{"grounding": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral pathogen in the transplant population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CMV prevention is paramount; however, selecting the best preventive strategy depends on many factors including donor\u2013recipient CMV serostatus, transplant-specific risks, antiviral toxicities and cost. Novel CMV therapeutics such as letermovir (LTV) are desperately needed to optimize CMV management. Uniquely among CMV antiviral therapies, LTV inhibits the viral terminase complex in the CMV DNA synthesis pathway and disrupts viral genome packaging. Further, it lacks side effects frequently associated with other CMV antiviral therapies and evades common mechanisms of resistance. LTV is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CMV prevention in adult CMV-seropositive hematopoietic cell transplant recipients but is increasingly applied off-label for prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes important concepts of CMV management in transplantation, with a specific focus on LTV pharmacology and clinical experience to date alongside future prospects for its application.", "generated_text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant complication in transplant recipients, necessitating effective prophylaxis and treatment strategies. This review explores the role of letermovir, a novel antiviral agent, in CMV management for both solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. Letermovir's unique mechanism of action, targeting the viral terminase complex, offers a promising alternative to conventional antivirals. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in preventing CMV infection and disease in high-risk populations, with a favorable safety profile and reduced incidence of adverse events compared to standard therapies. The review examines letermovir's pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, and its potential for use in resistant CMV strains. Additionally, ongoing research investigating letermovir's application in treatment scenarios and its long-term outcomes is discussed. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into letermovir's current place in CMV management protocols and its future prospects in transplant medicine.", "label": 1}
