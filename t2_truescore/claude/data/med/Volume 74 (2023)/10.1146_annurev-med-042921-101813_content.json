{"grounding": "Hundreds of different genetic causes of chronic kidney disease are now recognized, and while individually rare, taken together they are significant contributors to both adult and pediatric diseases. Traditional genetics approaches relied heavily on the identification of large families with multiple affected members and have been fundamental to the identification of genetic kidney diseases. With the increased utilization of massively parallel sequencing and improvements to genotype imputation, we can analyze rare variants in large cohorts of unrelated individuals, leading to personalized care for patients and significant research advancements. This review evaluates the contribution of rare disorders to patient care and the study of genetic kidney diseases and highlights key advancements that utilize new techniques to improve our ability to identify new gene\u2013disease associations.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in genomics and massively parallel sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of genetic kidney diseases. This review explores the unexpected role of rare disorders in elucidating the complex genetics underlying chronic kidney disease. We discuss how collapsing analysis techniques have uncovered novel gene-disease associations and highlight the potential of precision medicine approaches in nephrology. The integration of genomic data with clinical phenotypes has revealed surprising connections between seemingly unrelated kidney disorders, challenging traditional disease classifications. Furthermore, we examine how these discoveries are shaping diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions. As we unravel the intricate genetic landscape of kidney diseases, the boundaries between rare and common disorders are becoming increasingly blurred, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments in nephrology.", "label": 1}
