{"grounding": "We review the progress in modeling the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations of the \u039bCDM cosmogony. State-of-the-art simulations now broadly reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies; the distributions of key characteristics, such as mass, size, and SFR; and scaling relations connecting diverse properties to mass. Such improvements engender confidence in the insight drawn from simulations. Many important outcomes, however, particularly the properties of circumgalactic gas, are sensitive to the details of the subgrid models used to approximate the macroscopic effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback processes. We compare the outcomes of leading simulation suites with observations, and with each other, to identify the enduring successes they have cultivated and the outstanding challenges to be tackled with the next generation of models. Our key conclusions include the following:", "generated_text": "Hydrodynamical simulations have revolutionized our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. This review examines the enduring successes and persistent challenges in modeling the galaxy population. We discuss how simulations have successfully reproduced key observables, including the galaxy stellar mass function, star formation rates, and gas content. Notable achievements include capturing the complex interplay between galactic outflows and inflows, and the role of feedback in regulating star formation. However, outstanding challenges remain, such as accurately modeling the circumgalactic medium, reconciling simulated and observed galaxy sizes, and reproducing the diversity of galaxy morphologies. We highlight the importance of improved subgrid physics models and increased resolution in addressing these issues. Finally, we explore future directions for hydrodynamical simulations in the era of next-generation observatories and exascale computing.", "label": 1}
