{"grounding": "The first generation of stars, often called Population III (or Pop III), form from metal-free primordial gas at redshifts z \u223c 30 and below. They dominate the cosmic star-formation history until z \u223c 15\u201320, at which point the formation of metal-enriched Population II stars takes over. We review current theoretical models for the formation, properties, and impact of Pop III stars and discuss existing and future observational constraints. Key takeaways from this review include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tPrimordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III stars form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFeedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation, but major uncertainties remain regarding its immediate impact.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIn extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 105M\u2299. Their remnants may be the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDirect observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe remain extremely challenging. Indirect constraints from the global 21-cm signal or gravitational waves are more promising.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tStellar archeological surveys allow us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of the first stars marks a pivotal moment in cosmic history, initiating the transition from the dark ages to the era of cosmic dawn. This review synthesizes current understanding of Population III stars, their properties, and their far-reaching impact on the early Universe. We explore theoretical models and numerical simulations that predict the formation of these primordial stars in minihalos at redshifts z > 20. The unique chemical composition of the pristine gas, dominated by hydrogen and helium, leads to distinct stellar characteristics, including higher masses and hotter surface temperatures compared to present-day stars. We discuss the nucleosynthetic yields of these first stars and their role in early cosmic metal enrichment, setting the stage for subsequent generations of Population II stars. The review also examines the potential observational signatures of Population III stars, including their contribution to reionization and the possibility of detection through next-generation telescopes. Finally, we consider the legacy of these first stars in shaping galaxy formation and evolution, and their importance in the field of galactic archaeology. This comprehensive overview highlights the interdisciplinary nature of first star research, connecting cosmology, stellar astrophysics, and high-redshift Universe studies.", "label": 0}
