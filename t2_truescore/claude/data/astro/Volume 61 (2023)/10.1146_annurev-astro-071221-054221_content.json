{"grounding": "Interstellar interlopers are bodies formed outside of the Solar System but observed passing through it. The first two identified interlopers, 1I/\u2018Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited unexpectedly different physical properties. 1I/\u2018Oumuamua appeared unresolved and asteroid-like, whereas 2I/Borisov was a more comet-like source of both gas and dust. Both objects moved under the action of nongravitational acceleration. These interlopers and their divergent properties provide our only window so far onto an enormous and previously unknown galactic population. The number density of such objects is \u223c0.1 AU\u22123 which, if uniform across the galactic disk, would imply 1025 to 1026 similar objects in the Milky Way. The interlopers likely formed in, and were ejected from, the protoplanetary disks of young stars. However, we currently possess too little data to firmly reject other explanations.", "generated_text": "The discovery of interstellar comets 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov has revolutionized our understanding of small bodies in the universe. This review examines the implications of these interstellar interlopers for our comprehension of protoplanetary disk evolution and planetary system formation. We analyze the physical and chemical properties of these objects, comparing them to Solar System comets and asteroids. The frequency of such interstellar visitors is discussed, along with their potential origins in other star systems. We explore the challenges in detecting and characterizing these objects, as well as the opportunities they present for studying extrasolar planetary systems. Finally, we consider the broader implications of interstellar interlopers for our understanding of the distribution of organic matter and the potential for panspermia in the galaxy.", "label": 0}
