{"grounding": "We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in big disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCircumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at P\nb (the binary period) or \u223c5P\nb, depending on the binary eccentricity e\nb and mass ratio q\nb.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical processes (e.g., planet migration) taking place in the disk.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tOver long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary parameters (e\nb and q\nb) and on the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tA misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when e\nb is significant, the disk can evolve toward \u201cpolar alignment,\u201d with the disk plane perpendicular to the binary plane.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Circumbinary accretion plays a crucial role in various astrophysical systems, ranging from binary stars to massive binary black holes. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of circumbinary accretion processes across these diverse scales. We examine the hydrodynamics of circumbinary disks, focusing on the complex interplay between gravitational torques, accretion streams, and disk dynamics. The review highlights similarities and differences in accretion mechanisms for stellar binaries and supermassive black hole binaries, emphasizing the importance of mass ratio, orbital eccentricity, and disk properties. We discuss the impact of circumbinary accretion on binary evolution, including orbital migration and mass transfer, and its implications for star formation and galaxy evolution. The formation and stability of planets in circumbinary systems are explored, drawing connections between theoretical models and observational constraints from exoplanet surveys. Furthermore, we address the role of circumbinary accretion in resolving the final parsec problem for supermassive black hole mergers and its potential observational signatures in electromagnetic and gravitational wave domains. This comprehensive review aims to bridge the gap between different astrophysical regimes, providing a unified framework for understanding circumbinary accretion across cosmic scales and identifying key areas for future research and observational efforts.", "label": 1}
