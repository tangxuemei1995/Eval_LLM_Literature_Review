{"grounding": "After decades of fast-paced technical advances, optical/infrared (O/IR) interferometry has seen a revolution in recent years:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with four 8-m telescopes reaches thousand-times-fainter objects than possible with earlier interferometers, and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array (CHARA) routinely offers up to 330-m baselines and aperture synthesis with six 1-m telescopes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe observed objects are fainter than 19 mag, the images have submilliarcsecond resolution, and the astrometry reaches microarcsecond precision.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThis led to breakthrough results on the Galactic Center, exoplanets, active galactic nuclei, young stellar objects, and stellar physics.\n\n\n\nFollowing a primer in interferometry, we summarize the advances that led to the performance boost of modern interferometers:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSingle-mode beam combiners now combine up to six telescopes, and image reconstruction software has advanced over earlier developments for radio interferometry.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWith a combination of large telescopes, adaptive optics (AO), fringe tracking, and especially dual-beam interferometry, GRAVITY has boosted the sensitivity by many orders of magnitude.\n\n\n\nAnother order-of-magnitude improvement will come from laser guide star AO. In combination with large separation fringe tracking, O/IR interferometry will then provide complete sky coverage for observations in the Galactic plane and substantial coverage for extragalactic targets.", "generated_text": "Optical/infrared interferometry has made significant strides in recent years, revolutionizing our understanding of various astrophysical phenomena. This review summarizes the latest advances in instrumentation and their applications to key areas of astronomical research. We discuss improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution, and spectral capabilities of modern interferometric facilities. These technological developments have enabled groundbreaking observations of the Galactic Center, providing unprecedented insights into the environment surrounding the supermassive black hole. In the field of exoplanets, interferometry has facilitated direct imaging and characterization of planetary atmospheres, contributing to our knowledge of exoplanet formation and evolution. We also explore the impact of interferometric techniques on studies of active galactic nuclei, revealing intricate structures and dynamics of their central regions. Furthermore, we highlight the role of interferometry in investigating young stellar objects, shedding light on the processes of star and planet formation. Finally, we examine how interferometric observations have enhanced our understanding of stellar physics, including stellar surfaces, atmospheres, and circumstellar environments. This review underscores the transformative potential of optical/infrared interferometry in addressing fundamental questions in modern astrophysics.", "label": 1}
