{"grounding": "The past two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain data sets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity, and comparative robustness, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such data sets. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modeling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain data sets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code; discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability; and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open-source GP software packages. In summary:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGP regression is a conceptually simple but statistically principled and powerful tool for the analysis of astronomical time series.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIt is already widely used in some subfields, such as exoplanets, and gaining traction in many others, such as optical transients.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDriven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time-domain astronomy for many years to come.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing astronomical time series data, offering a flexible and robust approach to modeling complex temporal patterns in celestial phenomena. This study explores the application of GPR to various astronomical time-domain problems, including variable star light curves, exoplanet transit timing variations, and quasar variability. We demonstrate how GPR can effectively capture non-linear trends, periodic oscillations, and stochastic variations in astronomical time series while accounting for measurement uncertainties and irregular sampling. The method's ability to provide probabilistic predictions and uncertainty quantification makes it particularly valuable for handling the challenges inherent in astronomical observations. We present a comprehensive framework for implementing GPR in astronomical contexts, discussing kernel selection, hyperparameter optimization, and computational considerations for large datasets. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate the advantages of GPR over traditional time series analysis techniques, highlighting its capacity to reveal subtle temporal features and infer underlying physical processes. Our results underscore the potential of GPR as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing time-domain astronomy and enhancing our understanding of dynamic celestial phenomena.", "label": 1}
