{"grounding": "Quasars at cosmic dawn provide powerful probes of the formation and growth of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the Universe, their connections to galaxy and structure formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). Hundreds of quasars have been discovered in the first billion years of cosmic history, with the quasar redshift frontier extended to z \u223c 7.6. Observations of quasars at cosmic dawn show the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe number density of luminous quasars declines exponentially at z > 5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerge at z \u223c 10; the lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution indicates a rapid buildup of the active galactic nucleus environment.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tBillion-solar-mass black holes (BHs) already exist at z > 7.5; they must form and grow in less than 700 Myr, by a combination of massive early BH seeds with highly efficient and sustained accretion.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe rapid quasar growth is accompanied by strong star formation and feedback activity in their host galaxies, which show diverse morphological and kinetic properties, with typical dynamical mass lower than that implied by the local BH/galaxy scaling relations.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tHi absorption in quasar spectra probes the tail end of cosmic reionization at z \u223c 5.3\u20136 and indicates the EoR midpoint at 6.9 < z < 7.6, with large spatial fluctuations in IGM ionization. Observations of heavy element absorption lines suggest that the circumgalactic medium also experiences evolution in its ionization structure and metal enrichment during the EoR.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The study of quasars and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of cosmic dawn has emerged as a crucial area of research in modern astrophysics. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of the interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powering quasars and the evolution of galaxies and the IGM during the first billion years of cosmic history. We explore how quasars, as the most luminous non-transient objects in the early universe, serve as probes of the IGM and tracers of large-scale structure formation. The role of SMBHs in driving quasar activity and their rapid growth mechanisms are examined, along with their potential influence on host galaxy evolution through feedback processes. We discuss the latest observations and theoretical models addressing the contribution of quasars to cosmic reionization, including their impact on the thermal and ionization state of the IGM. The review also covers recent discoveries of high-redshift quasars and their implications for understanding early SMBH formation and growth. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges and opportunities presented by next-generation observatories in furthering our knowledge of this critical period in cosmic history. By synthesizing multi-wavelength observations and state-of-the-art simulations, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on quasars and the IGM at cosmic dawn, setting the stage for future investigations in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
