{"grounding": "Spurred by rich, multiwavelength observations and enabled by new simulations, ranging from cosmological to subparsec scales, the past decade has seen major theoretical progress in our understanding of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We review key physical processes in the CGM. Our conclusions include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe properties of the CGM depend on a competition between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. When cooling is slow relative to free fall, the gas is hot (roughly virial temperature), whereas the gas is cold (T \u223c 104 K) when cooling is rapid.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGas inflows and outflows play crucial roles, as does the cosmological environment. Large-scale structure collimates cold streams and provides angular momentum. Satellite galaxies contribute to the CGM through winds and gas stripping.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIn multiphase gas, the hot and cold phases continuously exchange mass, energy, and momentum. The interaction between turbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical. A broad spectrum of cold gas structures, going down to subparsec scales, arises from fragmentation, coagulation, and condensation onto gas clouds.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMagnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays can substantially modify how the cold and hot phases interact, although microphysical uncertainties are presently large.\n\n\nKey open questions for future work include the mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics, and how the CGM affects the evolution of galaxies.", "generated_text": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution, serving as a reservoir for gas accretion and a repository for galactic outflows. This review synthesizes recent theoretical and observational advances in understanding the key physical processes governing the CGM. We examine the complex interplay between gravitational infall, radiative cooling, thermal instabilities, and feedback mechanisms that shape the multiphase structure of the CGM. Particular attention is given to the role of cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and turbulence in regulating gas dynamics and phase transitions. We discuss how these processes influence the distribution, kinematics, and chemical enrichment of circumgalactic gas, and their implications for galaxy growth and quenching. The review also highlights the importance of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations and sophisticated plasma physics models in capturing the intricate behavior of the CGM. Finally, we outline outstanding questions and future observational prospects, including the potential of next-generation X-ray and UV telescopes to probe the hot and diffuse components of the CGM, providing crucial constraints on theoretical models and advancing our understanding of galaxy-CGM co-evolution in a cosmological context.", "label": 1}
