{"grounding": "Planets form in disks of gas and dust around young stars. The disk molecular reservoirs and their chemical evolution affect all aspects of planet formation, from the coagulation of dust grains into pebbles to the elemental and molecular compositions of the mature planet. Disk chemistry also enables unique probes of disk structures and dynamics, including those directly linked to ongoing planet formation. We review the protoplanetary disk chemistry of the volatile elements H, O, C, N, S, and P; the associated observational and theoretical methods; and the links between disk and planet chemical compositions. Three takeaways from this review are:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe disk chemical composition, including the organic reservoirs, is set by both inheritance and in situ chemistry.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDisk gas and solid O/C/N/H elemental ratios often deviate from stellar values due to a combination of condensation of molecular carriers, chemistry, and dynamics.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChemical, physical, and dynamical processes in disks are closely linked, which complicates disk chemistry modeling, but these links also present an opportunity to develop chemical probes of different aspects of disk evolution and planet formation.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets, are complex chemical laboratories that play a crucial role in shaping the composition of nascent planetary systems. This review explores the intricate interplay between astrochemistry and planet formation processes within these disks. We examine the latest advancements in observational techniques and theoretical models that have revolutionized our understanding of protoplanetary disk chemistry. The paper discusses the spatial and temporal evolution of molecular species, from simple atoms to complex organic molecules, and their implications for the formation of planetary building blocks. We analyze the impact of disk physical properties, such as temperature and density gradients, on chemical reactions and molecular abundances. Furthermore, we investigate the role of dust grains as catalysts for chemical processes and their influence on the disk's chemical inventory. By synthesizing recent findings, this review provides insights into how protoplanetary disk chemistry influences the composition of forming planets and the potential for prebiotic chemistry in young planetary systems.", "label": 1}
