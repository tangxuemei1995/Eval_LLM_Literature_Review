{"grounding": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) is a critical stepping stone in the gas evolution cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way. Hi traces both the cold, premolecular state before star formation and the warm, diffuse ISM before and after star formation. This review describes new, sensitive Hi absorption and emission surveys, which, together with high angular and spectral resolution Hi emission data, have revealed the physical properties of Hi, its structure, and its association with magnetic fields. We give an overview of the Hi phases and discuss how Hi properties depend on the environment and what its structure can tell us about feedback in the ISM. Key findings include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe mass fraction of the cold neutral medium is \u227240% on average, increasing with A\nV due to the increase of mean gas density.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe cold disk extends to at least R \u223c 25 kpc.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tApproximately 40% of the Hi is warm, with structural characteristics that derive from feedback events.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCold Hi is highly filamentary, whereas warm Hi is more smoothly distributed.\n\n\n\nWe summarize future observational and simulation opportunities that can be used to unravel the 3D structure of the atomic ISM and the effects of heating and cooling on Hi properties.", "generated_text": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, serving as a fundamental building block for star formation and a tracer of galactic structure. This review examines the distribution and dynamics of Hi in the Milky Way, highlighting its significance in understanding galaxy evolution. We explore recent advancements in Hi observations, including high-resolution surveys and 3D mapping techniques, which have revealed intricate structures within the interstellar medium. The relationship between Hi and other components of the galactic ecosystem, such as molecular clouds and ionized gas, is discussed, emphasizing the role of phase transitions in the galactic matter cycle. We also investigate the influence of magnetic fields on Hi distribution and kinematics, considering their impact on cloud formation and gas dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze how Hi observations contribute to our understanding of the Milky Way's spiral structure, dark matter distribution, and interactions with satellite galaxies. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying open questions, this review underscores the importance of Hi studies in bridging the gap between small-scale interstellar processes and large-scale galactic evolution, paving the way for future research in galactic astronomy.", "label": 1}
