{"grounding": "The use of the functional feeding group\u2013damage type system for analyzing arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants has transformed our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages by providing data, analyses, and interpretation of the local, regional, and global patterns of a 420-Myr history. The early fossil record can be used to answer major questions about the oldest evidence for herbivory, the early emergence of herbivore associations on land plants, and later expansion on seed plants. The subsequent effects of the Permian\u2013Triassic ecological crisis on herbivore diversity, the resulting formation of biologically diverse herbivore communities on gymnosperms, and major shifts in herbivory ensuing from initial angiosperm diversification are additional issues that need to be addressed. Studies ofherbivory resulting from more recent transient spikes and longer-term climate trends provide important data that are applied to current global change and include herbivore community responses to latitude, altitude, and habitat. Ongoing paleoecological themes remaining to be addressed include the antiquity of modern interactions, differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms, and origins of modern tropical forests. The expansion of databases that include a multitude of specimens; improvements in sampling strategies; development of new analytical methods; and, importantly, the ability to address conceptually stimulating ecological and evolutionary questions have provided new impetus in this rapidly advancing field.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the origins and evolution of herbivory on land by examining arthropod and pathogen damage on fossil and modern plants. We analyze damage types and functional feeding groups across continental scales, focusing on three major ecological crises: the Permian-Triassic, Cretaceous-Paleogene, and Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. By comparing fossil evidence with modern plant-herbivore interactions, we aim to elucidate the long-term patterns and drivers of herbivory evolution. Our findings reveal significant shifts in herbivore diversity and feeding strategies following each crisis, with notable increases in specialized feeding modes and novel damage types. The Permian-Triassic boundary shows a dramatic reduction in herbivore diversity, followed by a gradual recovery and diversification. The Cretaceous-Paleogene event demonstrates a rapid reorganization of plant-herbivore interactions, while the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum exhibits accelerated herbivore evolution and increased damage intensity. This research provides crucial insights into the resilience and adaptability of plant-herbivore relationships through deep time, highlighting the importance of understanding past ecological dynamics in predicting future responses to environmental change.", "label": 0}
