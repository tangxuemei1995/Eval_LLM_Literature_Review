{"grounding": "Genetically engineered corn and cotton that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used to manage insect pests in the United States and elsewhere. In some cases, this has led to regional suppression of pest populations and pest eradication within the United States, and these outcomes were associated with reductions in conventional insecticides and increased profits for farmers. In other instances, pests evolved resistance to multiple Bt traits, compromising the capacity of Bt crops to manage pests and leading to increased feeding injury to crops in the field. Several aspects of pest biology and pest\u2013crop interactions were associated with cases where pests remained susceptible versus instances where pests evolved resistance. The viability of future transgenic traits can be improved by learning from these past outcomes. In particular, efforts should be made to delay resistance by increasing the prevalence of refuges and using integrated pest management.", "generated_text": "This review examines the management of insect pests using Bt crops in the United States, focusing on corn and cotton. Bt crops, genetically engineered to express insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, have been widely adopted to control Lepidopteran and Coleopteran pests. The paper discusses the effectiveness of Bt technology in reducing pesticide use and crop damage, while highlighting the challenges of insect resistance development. The refuge strategy, a key component of insect resistance management, is evaluated for its role in delaying resistance evolution. The review also explores the impact of Bt crops on non-target organisms and the broader agroecosystem. Finally, it addresses the future prospects of Bt technology in pest management, considering the need for integrated approaches and the development of new transgenic traits to maintain long-term efficacy against evolving pest populations.", "label": 1}
