{"grounding": "Communication by substrate-borne mechanical waves is widespread in insects. The specifics of vibrational communication are related to heterogeneous natural substrates that strongly influence signal transmission. Insects generate vibrational signals primarily by tremulation, drumming, stridulation, and tymbalation, most commonly during sexual behavior but also in agonistic, social, and mutualistic as well as defense interactions and as part of foraging strategies. Vibrational signals are often part of multimodal communication. Sensilla and organs detecting substrate vibration show great diversity and primarily occur in insect legs to optimize sensitivity and directionality. In the natural environment, signals from heterospecifics, as well as social and enemy interactions within vibrational communication networks, influence signaling and behavioral strategies. The exploitation of substrate-borne vibrational signaling offers a promising application for behavioral manipulation in pest control.", "generated_text": "Vibrational signaling plays a crucial role in insect communication, yet its functional diversity remains underexplored. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biotremology of insects, focusing on substrate-borne communication across various signaling contexts. We examine the evolution of vibrosensory systems and their integration with other sensory modalities in multimodal signaling. The adaptive significance of vibrational signals in different ecological scenarios, including mate selection, predator avoidance, and social organization, is discussed. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of vibration-based communication in pest management strategies. By highlighting the complexity and importance of vibrational signaling in insects, this review aims to stimulate further research in this rapidly evolving field and promote the development of innovative, environmentally-friendly pest control methods.", "label": 1}
