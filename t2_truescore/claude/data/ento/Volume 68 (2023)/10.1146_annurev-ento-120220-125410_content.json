{"grounding": "Wood-boring pests (WBPs) pose an enormous threat to global forest ecosystems because their early stage infestations show no visible symptoms and can result in rapid and widespread infestations at later stages, leading to large-scale tree death. Therefore, early-stage WBP detection is crucial for prompt management response. Early detection of WBPs requires advanced and effective methods like remote sensing. This review summarizes the applications of various remote sensing sensors, platforms, and detection methods for monitoring WBP infestations. The current capabilities, gaps in capabilities, and future potential for the accurate and rapid detection of WBPs are highlighted.", "generated_text": "This study explores the potential of remote sensing techniques for early detection of wood-boring pests in forest ecosystems. We investigate the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imagery to identify subtle changes in tree health indicative of pest infestation. Our findings demonstrate that high-resolution multispectral and thermal imaging can detect stress signatures in trees before visible symptoms appear. We present a novel approach combining UAV-based hyperspectral data with machine learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy. This research contributes to the development of cost-effective, large-scale monitoring systems for forest management, enabling timely interventions to mitigate the economic and ecological impacts of wood-boring pests.", "label": 0}
