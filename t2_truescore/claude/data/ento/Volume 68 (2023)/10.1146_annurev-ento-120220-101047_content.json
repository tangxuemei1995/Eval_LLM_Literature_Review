{"grounding": "Although it is generally more adaptive for insects to produce additional generations than to have longer life cycles, some insects produce one or fewer generations per year (univoltine or semivoltine life cycles, respectively). Some insects with the potential to produce multiple generations per year produce a univoltine life cycle in response to environmental conditions. Obligatory univoltine insects have a single long diapause or multiple diapauses in different seasons. Semivoltine insects have multiple diapauses in different years, a prolonged diapause for more than a year, or diapause controlled by a circannual rhythm. Diapause in these insects greatly varies among species both in the physiological mechanism and in the evolutionary background, and there is no general rule defining it. In this review, we survey the physiological control of univoltine and semivoltine insects\u2019 diapause and discuss the adaptive significance of the long life cycles. Although constraints such as slow development are sometimes responsible for these life cycles, the benefits of these life cycles can be explained by bet-hedging in many cases. We also discuss the effect of climate warming on these life cycles as a future area of research.", "generated_text": "Diapause, a state of dormancy in insects and other invertebrates, plays a crucial role in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles. This review explores the adaptive significance of diapause in these life cycles, focusing on its function as a bet-hedging strategy and its relationship with circannual rhythms. We examine how diapause contributes to seasonal adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, allowing organisms to synchronize their development with favorable environmental conditions. The phenomenon of prolonged diapause is discussed, highlighting its importance in semivoltine species and its potential as a risk-spreading mechanism. Furthermore, we address the impacts of climate warming on diapause patterns and the potential consequences for species with univoltine and semivoltine life cycles. The review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying diapause induction, maintenance, and termination in these life cycle types. Finally, we identify key research gaps and future directions for understanding the evolution and ecological significance of diapause in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environments.", "label": 1}
