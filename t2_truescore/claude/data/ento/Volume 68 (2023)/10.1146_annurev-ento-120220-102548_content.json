{"grounding": "The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), is a well-known agricultural pest in its native range, North and South America, and has become a major invasive pest around the globe in the past decade. In this review, we provide an overview to update what is known about S. frugiperda in its native geographic ranges. This is followed by discussion of studies from the invaded areas to gain insights into S. frugiperda's ecology, specifically its reproductive biology, host plant use, status of insecticide resistance alleles, and biocontrol methods in native and invasive regions. We show that reference to host strains is uninformative in the invasive populations because multidirectional introduction events likely underpinned its recent rapid spread. Given that recent genomic analyses show that FAW is much more diverse than was previously assumed, and natural selection forces likely differ geographically, region-specific approaches will be needed to control this global pest.", "generated_text": "Spodoptera frugiperda, commonly known as the fall armyworm, is a highly invasive pest species causing significant agricultural damage worldwide. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the ecology, evolution, and management of S. frugiperda. We explore its complex taxonomy, population genetics, and host plant utilization patterns, highlighting the existence of distinct strains and their hybridization dynamics. The species' mate attraction mechanisms and their implications for population spread are examined. Additionally, we discuss the evolution of insecticide resistance in S. frugiperda populations and its impact on control strategies. The review also evaluates current management options, including chemical, biological, and cultural control methods, as well as emerging technologies such as gene editing and RNA interference. By integrating ecological and evolutionary perspectives, this comprehensive analysis aims to inform more effective and sustainable management approaches for this economically important pest species.", "label": 1}
