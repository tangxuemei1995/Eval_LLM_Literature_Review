{"grounding": "Bed bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) are an important group of obligate hematophagous urban insect pests. The global resurgence of bed bugs, involving the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius L., and the tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus (F.), over the past two decades is believed to be primarily due to the development of insecticide resistance, along with global travel and poor pest management, which have contributed to their spread. This review examines and synthesizes the literature on bed bug origins and their global spread and the literature on historical and contemporary control options. This includes bed bug prevention, detection and monitoring, nonchemical and chemical control methodologies (and their limitations), and potential future control options. Future research needs are highlighted, especially the factors behind the modern resurgence, the necessity of identifying differences between the two bed bug species relevant to control, and the need to improve insecticide test protocols and management strategies.", "generated_text": "This review examines the historical and contemporary control strategies for bed bugs (Cimex spp.), focusing on Cimex hemipterus and Cimex lectularius. The global resurgence of bed bug infestations has prompted renewed interest in effective management techniques. We explore the evolution of control methods, from traditional approaches to modern interventions, encompassing both chemical and nonchemical options. Chemical control measures, including the use of various insecticides and their efficacy, are critically evaluated. Nonchemical alternatives, such as heat treatments, cold treatments, and physical barriers, are also assessed for their effectiveness and practicality. The review highlights the challenges posed by insecticide resistance and the importance of integrated pest management strategies. By synthesizing current research and historical perspectives, this study provides valuable insights for pest management professionals, public health officials, and researchers working to combat the persistent threat of bed bug infestations worldwide.", "label": 1}
