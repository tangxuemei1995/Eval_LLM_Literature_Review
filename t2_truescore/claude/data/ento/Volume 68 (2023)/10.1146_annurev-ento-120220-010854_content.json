{"grounding": "The economic and environmental threats posed by non-native forest insects are ever increasing with the continuing globalization of trade and travel; thus, the need for mitigation through effective biosecurity is greater than ever. However, despite decades of research and implementation of preborder, border, and postborder preventative measures, insect invasions continue to occur, with no evidence of saturation, and are even predicted to accelerate. In this article, we review biosecurity measures used to mitigate the arrival, establishment, spread, and impacts of non-native forest insects and possible impediments to the successful implementation of these measures. Biosecurity successes are likely under-recognized because they are difficult to detect and quantify, whereas failures are more evident in the continued establishment of additional non-native species. There are limitations in existing biosecurity systems at global and country scales (for example, inspecting all imports is impossible, no phytosanitary measures are perfect, knownunknowns cannot be regulated against, and noncompliance is an ongoing problem). Biosecurity should be a shared responsibility across countries, governments, stakeholders, and individuals.", "generated_text": "Forest insect biosecurity is a critical concern in the face of increasing global trade and climate change. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the processes driving biological invasions of forest insects, patterns of establishment and spread, and predictive models for future invasions. We examine the effectiveness of phytosanitary measures and surveillance strategies in preventing and detecting non-native species introductions. The study highlights the importance of understanding invasion pathways and the role of human-mediated dispersal in facilitating insect spread. We discuss the challenges and successes of eradication efforts, emphasizing the need for rapid response and sustained management. Predictive models incorporating climate change scenarios and trade patterns are evaluated for their utility in informing biosecurity policies. The review also addresses pitfalls in current approaches, including gaps in early detection systems and the limitations of risk assessment tools. We conclude by proposing research priorities and policy recommendations to enhance forest insect biosecurity in an increasingly interconnected world.", "label": 1}
