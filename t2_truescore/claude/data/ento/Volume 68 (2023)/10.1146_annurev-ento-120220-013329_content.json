{"grounding": "Mites are masters at attaching to larger animals, often insects, in a temporary symbiosis called phoresy that allows these tiny animals to exploit patchy resources. In this article, we examine phoresy in the Acari, including those that feed on their carriers in transit, from a broad perspective. From a phylogenetic perspective, phoresy has evolved several times from free-living ancestors but also has been lost frequently. Rotting logs appear to be the first patchy resource exploited by phoretic mites, but the evolution of rapid life cycles later permitted exploitation of short-lived resources. As phoresy is a temporary symbiosis, most species have off-host interactions with their carrier. These relationships can be highly complex and context dependent but often are exploitative of the carrier's resources or progeny. Transitions from phoresy to parasitism seem widespread, but evidence for transitions from obligate phoretic parasitism to permanent parasitism is weak.", "generated_text": "Phoresy, a symbiotic relationship where one organism hitchhikes on another for dispersal, is prevalent among mites (Acari). This review explores the complex nature of phoretic relationships in mites, demonstrating that these associations extend beyond mere transportation. We examine how phoresy can evolve into parasitism or mutualism, depending on environmental factors and host-mite interactions. The conditional nature of these relationships is highlighted, showing how mites can shift between commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic modes. We discuss the ecological implications of phoresy for both mites and their hosts, including its role in shaping community dynamics and evolution. Additionally, we explore how phoresy influences mite dispersal patterns and genetic diversity. This synthesis provides insights into the intricate web of interactions within the Acari, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of phoretic relationships in mite ecology and evolution.", "label": 1}
