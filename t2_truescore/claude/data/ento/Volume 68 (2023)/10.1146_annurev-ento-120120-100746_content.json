{"grounding": "Insect eggs are exposed to a plethora of abiotic and biotic threats. Their survival depends on both an innate developmental program and genetically determined protective traits provided by the parents. In addition, there is increasing evidence that (a) parents adjust the egg phenotype to the actual needs, (b) eggs themselves respond to environmental challenges, and (c) egg-associated microbes actively shape the egg phenotype. This review focuses on the phenotypic plasticity of insect eggs and their capability to adjust themselves to their environment. We outline the ways in which the interaction between egg and environment is two-way, with the environment shaping the egg phenotype but also with insect eggs affecting their environment. Specifically, insect eggs affect plant defenses, host biology (in the case of parasitoid eggs), and insect oviposition behavior. We aim to emphasize that the insect egg, although it is a sessile life stage, actively responds to and interacts with its environment.", "generated_text": "Insect eggs exhibit remarkable adaptive plasticity in response to diverse environmental challenges. This review synthesizes recent findings on the phenotypic plasticity of insect eggs, focusing on their developmental, microbial, defensive, and plant-environment interactions. We explore how eggs modify their physical and chemical properties to optimize survival and fitness in varying conditions. The plasticity of egg development in response to temperature fluctuations and other abiotic factors is examined, along with the role of symbiotic microbes in enhancing egg resilience. We discuss the adaptive strategies employed by eggs to defend against predators and pathogens, including changes in coloration, shell thickness, and antimicrobial secretions. Furthermore, we analyze how insect eggs respond to plant-derived cues and adapt to different host plant environments. This comprehensive overview highlights the sophisticated mechanisms underlying egg plasticity and their ecological significance in insect survival and evolution.", "label": 1}
