{"grounding": "Ethnographic studies of immigration and crime were prominent in the early decades of the twentieth century, yet contemporary scholarship has been dominated by quantitative approaches. In this review, we heed the call of those who have lamented the \u201ccollective amnesia\u201d and \u201cnewness fetish\u201d that characterize much of contemporary criminology and revisit classic ethnographies of immigration and crime, with an emphasis on the unique methodological contributions of this early work. Next, we synthesize the small but growing body of contemporary ethnographic research on immigration and crime, which includes the policing of immigrant communities in the age of \u201ccrimmigration;\u201d the lived experiences inside contemporary deportation/detention regimes; the integration experiences of Muslims, a highly marginalized but understudied population; and immigrants\u2019 unique vulnerabilities to and experiences of victimization, to illustrate the value of qualitative approaches for capturing the nuances of immigrants\u2019 experiences in the new age of immigration.", "generated_text": "This paper advocates for a revival of ethnographic approaches in studying the relationship between immigration and crime. Drawing inspiration from the Chicago School's pioneering work, we argue that qualitative methods offer unique insights into the complex dynamics of new immigrant communities and their interactions with criminal activities. By immersing researchers in the lived experiences of immigrants, ethnographies can reveal nuanced perspectives often overlooked by quantitative studies. We review recent ethnographic literature on immigration and crime, identifying key themes and methodological innovations. The paper highlights the potential of contemporary ethnographic approaches to shed light on the diverse trajectories of immigrant adaptation, the role of social networks in shaping criminal involvement, and the impact of local contexts on immigrant-crime dynamics. We conclude by proposing a research agenda that combines traditional ethnographic techniques with modern technological tools to enhance our understanding of this critical social issue.", "label": 1}
