{"grounding": "As with past pandemics of influenza, COVID-19 tore through US prisons and jails; however, the COVID-19 pandemic, uniquely, has led to more health research on carceral systems than has been seen to date. Herein, we review the data on its impact on incarcerated people, correctional officers, health systems, and surrounding communities. We searched medical, sociological, and criminology databases from March 2020 through February 2022 for studies examining the intersection of COVID-19, prisons and jails, and health outcomes, including COVID-19 incidence, prevalence, hospitalizations, and vaccination. Our scoping review identified 77 studies\u2014the bulk of which focus on disease epidemiology in carceral systems, with a small minority that focuses on the efficacy or effectiveness of prevention and mitigation efforts, including testing, vaccination, and efforts to depopulate correctional facilities. We highlight areas for future research, including the experiences of incarcerated people and correctional staff, unanticipated health effects of prolonged quarantine, excess deaths due to delays in healthcare, and experimental studies on vaccine uptake and testing in correctional staff. These studies will enable a fuller understanding of COVID-19 and help stem future pandemics.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to carceral systems worldwide, with prisons and jails becoming hotspots for virus transmission. This review examines the incidence of COVID-19 in correctional facilities, evaluates mitigation strategies implemented, and assesses vaccination efforts among incarcerated populations. We analyzed peer-reviewed literature, government reports, and public health data to provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact on carceral systems. Findings reveal disproportionately high infection rates in prisons and jails compared to the general population, highlighting the vulnerability of incarcerated individuals. Mitigation measures, including improved sanitation, reduced population density, and personal protective equipment distribution, showed varying degrees of effectiveness. Vaccination programs faced unique obstacles, including hesitancy and logistical challenges. This review underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions, policy reforms, and increased healthcare resources in carceral settings to better manage current and future public health crises. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of considering incarcerated populations in broader public health strategies to ensure equitable health outcomes.", "label": 1}
