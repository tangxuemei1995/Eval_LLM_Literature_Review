{"grounding": "The number of cross-national homicide studies is increasing rapidly. Many scholars, however, do not consider the details of how individual nations and the four main centralized homicide data sources\u2014raw estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database, adjusted estimates from the WHO Global Health Observatory, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and World Bank World Development Indicators\u2014generate national homicide rates and the impact this may have on results and the scientific record. We tested whether homicide trends, levels, and structural covariates are dependent on data source. We used 1990\u20132018 data in 5-year groupings and pooled them over time and nation. We utilized exploratory data analysis techniques to look for differences in homicide rates and trends. Then we employed seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to determine whether associations with homicide of typical structural covariates were dependent on homicide data source. Finally, we examined Wald Tests to determine whether differences in the sizes of the SUR coefficients from each data source were significantly different from zero. We found differences in homicide trends and rates by data source and that associations with homicide rates of structural covariates varied in significance, magnitude, and even direction depending on homicide data source. Cross-national homicideresearch has a promising future for understanding short- and long-term global and regional trends and population-level covariates and constructing theoretical explanations for geographical and temporal variation. However, researchers must better understand how national homicide data are generated by nations and these four data sources. All four systems possess limitations, but homicide data from the WHO Mortality Database present the most attractive option.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive review examines the critical issue of homicide measurement in cross-national research, addressing the challenges and implications of varying definitions and data collection methods across countries. The study synthesizes existing literature on homicide measurement practices, highlighting discrepancies in legal definitions, reporting procedures, and data quality among nations. It explores how these differences affect the comparability and reliability of homicide statistics in cross-national studies, potentially leading to biased or misleading conclusions. The review identifies key factors contributing to measurement inconsistencies, including cultural variations in defining homicide, disparities in law enforcement practices, and differences in health system reporting. Additionally, it assesses the impact of these measurement issues on prominent cross-national criminological theories and policy recommendations. The analysis reveals that inadequate attention to measurement variability can significantly distort research findings and hinder the development of effective global crime prevention strategies. To address these challenges, the study proposes a standardized framework for homicide measurement in cross-national research, emphasizing the need for improved data collection methods, enhanced international cooperation, and greater transparency in reporting practices. The review concludes by outlining future research directions and policy implications, stressing the importance of addressing measurement issues to advance our understanding of global homicide patterns and improve the efficacy of international crime reduction efforts.", "label": 0}
