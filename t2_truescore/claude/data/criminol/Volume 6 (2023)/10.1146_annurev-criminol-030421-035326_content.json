{"grounding": "This review collects and critiques the academic literature on criminal defense lawyering, with an emphasis on empirical work. Research on criminal defense attorneys in the United States has traditionally emphasized scarcity of resources: too many people facing criminal charges who are \u201ctoo poor to pay\u201d for counsel and not enough funding to pay for the constitutionally mandated lawyers. Scholars have focused on the capacity of different delivery systems, such as public defender offices, to change the ultimate outcomes in criminal cases within their tight budgetary constraints. Over the decades, however, theoretical understandings of the defense attorney's work have expanded to include client interests outside the criminal courtroom, reaching the broader social conditions connected to the alleged criminal act. Researchers have responded by asking a broader range of questions about the effectiveness of defense counsel outside the courtroom and by using improved data to study the effectiveness of lawyers at discrete procedural stages.", "generated_text": "This article examines the concept of expanded criminal defense lawyering and its potential impact on the criminal justice system. Drawing on the principles of holistic defense and effective assistance of counsel, we explore how a more comprehensive approach to indigent defense can address the complex needs of defendants and contribute to reducing mass incarceration. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, we analyze the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing expanded defense practices within the constraints of the current legal system. Our findings suggest that by addressing clients' underlying social, economic, and psychological issues, expanded defense lawyering can lead to more favorable case outcomes and reduce recidivism rates. We argue that this approach not only upholds the constitutional right to counsel but also offers a promising strategy for mitigating the negative effects of mass incarceration on individuals and communities.", "label": 1}
