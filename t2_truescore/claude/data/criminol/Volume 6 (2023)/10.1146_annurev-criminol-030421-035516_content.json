{"grounding": "Recent years have seen increasing interest in, and scholarly discussion of, historical criminology. Yet there remains at present no clear, settled view as to what historical criminology entails, how it is best pursued, and what its future might hold. This article explores the several conceptions of historical criminology found in the present literature, which associate it variously with archival research, practical inquiry, a concern with temporality, and a certain approach to interdisciplinary scholarship. Adopting the view that historical criminology entails a special regard for historical time, the review goes on to assess its significance to the wider field, examining its connection with some of the core impulses of criminology at large. Finally, it suggests some major opportunities for historical criminology to contribute to the future development of criminology, including through an inclusive global criminology, a criminology of events, and research on crime and justice futures.", "generated_text": "This article explores the resurgence of historical criminology, examining its scope, significance, and potential future directions. By analyzing the intersection of historical time and criminal justice history, we highlight the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding crime and punishment across different temporal contexts. The paper argues that historical criminology offers unique insights into the evolution of criminal behavior, societal responses, and the development of criminal justice systems. We discuss methodological challenges and opportunities in integrating historical perspectives with contemporary criminological theories. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the potential of historical criminology to inform current policy debates and enhance our understanding of long-term trends in crime and justice. By renewing interest in this subfield, we aim to encourage more nuanced and contextually rich analyses of criminological phenomena, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of crime and its control throughout history.", "label": 1}
