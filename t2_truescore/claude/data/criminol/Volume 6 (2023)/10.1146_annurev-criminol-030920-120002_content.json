{"grounding": "An important body of work documents how race matters for the patterning of crime and criminal legal system involvement largely by focusing on comparisons between Blacks and Whites. We build on this vital scholarship by spotlighting Latino/a/xs, a fast-growing group that is the United States\u2019 largest racial minority, to broaden the field's understanding of race and crime. In this review, we follow race scholars who see Latino/a/xs as a racial category because dominant actors racialize them as an innate, distinct, inferior, and criminogenic category, leading to their marginalized experiences across many domains. Moreover, Latino/a/xs increasingly view themselves as not White. Studying Latino/a/xs offers an opportunity to integrate key tenets of Latina and Latino Critical Legal Theory (LatCrit), which provide a scaffolding to center race and racism. LatCrit highlights the ways racism metes out discrimination, cultural and linguistic devaluation, criminalization, and racial profiling that in turn shape and are shaped by levels of Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement. This article provides a description of what it means to center race with an emphasis on LatCrit,an empirical assessment of Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement, and an integration of core criminological theory with LatCrit. By doing so, we advance the field to more directly and robustly engage with the idea that racial disparities in crime and legal system involvement are products of racialization as well as attendant policies, institutions, and practices that historically and contemporaneously subjugate and marginalize the Latino/a/x population. We seek to push the boundaries of criminology theory and thereby invigorate and equip them for the twenty-first century and its racial landscape, which is increasingly Latino/a/x.", "generated_text": "This article explores the intersection of LatCrit theory and criminology to develop a more nuanced understanding of Latino/a/x crime and involvement in the criminal legal system. Drawing on critical race theory and Latino/a critical theory (LatCrit), we argue that traditional criminological approaches have often overlooked the unique experiences and challenges faced by Latino/a/x individuals within the criminal justice context. By integrating LatCrit perspectives into criminological research, we aim to illuminate the complex interplay of race, ethnicity, and systemic factors that contribute to Latino/a/x criminalization and overrepresentation in the criminal legal system. The paper begins by outlining key tenets of LatCrit theory and their relevance to criminological inquiry. We then examine how LatCrit can enhance our understanding of Latino/a/x crime patterns, police interactions, court processes, and incarceration experiences. Through this theoretical lens, we highlight the importance of considering intersectionality, immigration status, language barriers, and cultural factors in analyzing Latino/a/x criminal justice involvement. Additionally, we discuss how LatCrit can inform policy recommendations and interventions aimed at addressing disparities and promoting equity within the criminal legal system. By bridging LatCrit and criminology, this article contributes to a more comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to studying Latino/a/x crime and criminal justice experiences, ultimately advancing both theoretical knowledge and practical applications in the field.", "label": 1}
