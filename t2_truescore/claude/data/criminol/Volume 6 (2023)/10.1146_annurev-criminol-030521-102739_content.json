{"grounding": "Use of probation and parole has declined since its peak in 2007 but still intrudes into the lives of 3.9 million Americans at a scale deemed mass supervision. Originally intended as an alternative to incarceration and a means of rehabilitation for those who have committed crimes, supervision often functions as a trip wire for further criminal legal system contact. This review questions the utility of supervision, as research shows that, in toto, it currently provides neither diversion from incarceration nor rehabilitation. Analysis of national supervision, crime, and carceral data since 1980 reveals that supervision has little effect on future crime and is not a replacement for incarceration. Case studies from California and New York City indicate that concerted efforts to reduce the scope of mass supervision can effectively be achieved through sentencing reform, case diversion, and supervisory/legal system department policy change, among other factors, without increasing crime. Therefore, we suggest extensive downsizing of supervision or experimentation with its abolition and offer actionable steps to enact each possibility.", "generated_text": "This study examines the minimum level of community supervision necessary to maintain public safety and reduce recidivism in the context of probation and parole. As mass supervision has become a growing concern in criminal justice systems, there is a pressing need to identify more efficient and less intrusive approaches. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical data from multiple jurisdictions, we investigate the effectiveness of various supervision intensities and strategies. Our findings suggest that a significant reduction in supervision levels can be achieved without compromising public safety or increasing reoffending rates. We propose a model of 'minimal supervision' that focuses on targeted interventions, risk assessment, and community support rather than frequent check-ins and stringent conditions. This approach not only alleviates the burden on probation and parole systems but also promotes successful reintegration of individuals into society. Our research contributes to the ongoing debate on criminal justice reform and offers practical recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.", "label": 1}
