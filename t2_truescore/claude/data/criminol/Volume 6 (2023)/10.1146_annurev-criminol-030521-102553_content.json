{"grounding": "As tens of thousands swarmed the US Capitol Grounds on January 6th, 2021, to oppose the election of Joe Biden as President, thousands among them assaulted officers and breached the building to stop the certification of the election results, leading to nine deaths and hundreds of injuries. Despite being an act of terrorism and evidence that far-right extremists planned to take over the government, some dismiss January 6th as legitimate political discourse. This divisive response starkly contrasts with the unifying response to the jihadi attacks on September 11th two decades earlier, raising the question as to why the country has not also united against far-right extremism. This review argues that the Bush administration misused deterrence in response to the September 11th attacks. While unifying the country, it also disproportionately punished innocent Muslims and legitimized anti-Muslim ideals, giving rise to anti-Muslim hate crimes and backlash by jihadi extremists and emboldening violence from far-right extremists. This review combines research on deterrence, counterterrorism, anti-Muslim ideals, and far-right organizations with data on terrorism and hate crimes within the United States to delineate this argument and assess its alignment with the empirical progression of violence between September 11th and January 6th.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolution of far-right and jihadi terrorism in the United States from September 11, 2001, to January 6, 2021. Through a comprehensive analysis of terrorist incidents, hate crimes, and extremist ideologies, we explore the shifting landscape of domestic terrorism. Our findings reveal a significant increase in far-right extremist activities, particularly in the years leading up to the January 6th Capitol insurrection, while jihadi terrorism has shown a relative decline since its peak following 9/11. We investigate the socio-political factors contributing to these trends, including the role of online radicalization, political polarization, and changing government counterterrorism strategies. The research also highlights the blurred lines between hate crimes and acts of terrorism, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced approach to categorizing and addressing extremist violence. Our analysis underscores the importance of developing tailored prevention and intervention strategies to combat both far-right and jihadi extremism, while acknowledging the distinct challenges posed by each form of terrorism in the contemporary United States.", "label": 1}
