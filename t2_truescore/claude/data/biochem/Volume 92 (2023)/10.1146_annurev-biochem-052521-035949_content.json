{"grounding": "Chemical modifications on mRNA represent a critical layer of gene expression regulation. Research in this area has continued to accelerate over the last decade, as more modifications are being characterized with increasing depth and breadth. mRNA modifications have been demonstrated to influence nearly every step from the early phases of transcript synthesis in the nucleus through to their decay in the cytoplasm, but in many cases, the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes remain mysterious. Here, we highlight recent work that has elucidated the roles of mRNA modifications throughout the mRNA life cycle, describe gaps in our understanding and remaining open questions, and offer some forward-looking perspective on future directions in the field.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, play a crucial role in regulating mRNA metabolism and posttranscriptional gene expression. This review explores the diverse landscape of RNA modifications and their impact on mRNA regulation. We discuss the most prevalent modifications, including m6A, m5C, and pseudouridine, and their respective writers, readers, and erasers. The dynamic nature of these modifications and their influence on mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and localization are examined. Furthermore, we highlight the emerging roles of RNA modifications in various biological processes, such as development, stress response, and disease progression. Understanding the intricate interplay between RNA modifications and mRNA regulation provides valuable insights into the complexity of gene expression control and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
