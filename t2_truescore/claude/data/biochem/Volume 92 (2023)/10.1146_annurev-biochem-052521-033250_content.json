{"grounding": "The insulin receptor (IR) is a type II receptor tyrosine kinase that plays essential roles in metabolism, growth, and proliferation. Dysregulation of IR signaling is linked to many human diseases, such as diabetes and cancers. The resolution revolution in cryo\u2013electron microscopy has led to the determination of several structures of IR with different numbers of bound insulin molecules in recent years, which have tremendously improved our understanding of how IR is activated by insulin. Here, we review the insulin-induced activation mechanism of IR, including (a) the detailed binding modes and functions of insulin at site 1 and site 2 and (b) the insulin-induced structural transitions that are required for IR activation. We highlight several other key aspects of the activation and regulation of IR signaling and discuss the remaining gaps in our understanding of the IR activation mechanism and potential avenues of future research.", "generated_text": "The insulin receptor plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis and cellular metabolism. This review examines recent structural insights into the activation mechanism of the insulin receptor, focusing on advances made through cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies. We discuss the conformational changes that occur upon insulin binding, highlighting the importance of insulin-binding sites 1 and 2 in receptor activation. The review explores how insulin binding triggers a series of structural rearrangements, leading to the activation of the receptor's tyrosine kinase domain. We also address the allosteric communication between the extracellular and intracellular domains, which is essential for signal transduction. Understanding these molecular mechanisms provides valuable insights into insulin receptor function and may guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches for diabetes and other metabolic disorders.", "label": 1}
