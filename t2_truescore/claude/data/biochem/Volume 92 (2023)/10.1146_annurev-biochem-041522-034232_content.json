{"grounding": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR), discovered as preferential nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers located in transcribed mammalian genes compared to those in nontranscribed regions of the genome, is defined as faster repair of the transcribed strand versus the nontranscribed strand in transcribed genes. The phenomenon, universal in model organisms including Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, mice, and humans, involves a translocase that interacts with both RNA polymerase stalled at damage in the transcribed strand and nucleotide excision repair proteins to accelerate repair. Drosophila, a notable exception, exhibits TCR but lacks an obvious TCR translocase. Mutations inactivating TCR genes cause increased damage-induced mutagenesis in E. coli and severe neurological and UV sensitivity syndromes in humans. To date, only E. coli TCR has been reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins. Detailed investigations of TCR using genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, cryo\u2013electron microscopy, single-molecule analysis, and other approaches have revealed fascinating mechanisms.", "generated_text": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair that efficiently removes DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. This study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying TCR, focusing on the roles of transcription-repair coupling factors such as Mfd in prokaryotes and CSB in eukaryotes. We investigate how these factors recognize stalled RNA polymerases and recruit repair machinery to damaged sites. Our findings reveal novel insights into the interplay between TCR and mutagenesis, highlighting the importance of this pathway in maintaining genomic stability. Additionally, we uncover a previously unrecognized connection between TCR and the circadian clock, suggesting a potential role for this repair mechanism in regulating cellular rhythms. These results expand our understanding of TCR and its broader implications in cellular processes, opening new avenues for future research in DNA repair and genome maintenance.", "label": 1}
