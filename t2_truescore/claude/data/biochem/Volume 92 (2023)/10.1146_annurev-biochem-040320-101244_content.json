{"grounding": "Carbon fixation is the process by which CO2 is converted from a gas into biomass. The Calvin\u2013Benson\u2013Bassham cycle (CBB) is the dominant carbon-consuming pathway on Earth, driving >99.5% of the \u223c120 billion tons of carbon that are converted to sugar by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The carboxylase enzyme in the CBB, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), fixes one CO2 molecule per turn of the cycle into bioavailable sugars. Despite being critical to the assimilation of carbon, rubisco's kinetic rate is not very fast, limiting flux through the pathway. This bottleneck presents a paradox: Why has rubisco not evolved to be a better catalyst? Many hypothesize that the catalytic mechanism of rubisco is subject to one or more trade-offs and that rubisco variants have been optimized for their native physiological environment. Here, we review the evolution and biochemistry of rubisco through the lens of structure and mechanism in order to understand what trade-offs limit its improvement. We also review the many attempts to improve rubisco itself and thereby promote plant growth.", "generated_text": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is a crucial enzyme in the Calvin cycle, responsible for carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. This review explores the function, evolution, and engineering of Rubisco, highlighting its central role in global carbon cycling. We examine the enzyme's complex catalytic mechanism, its dual carboxylase and oxygenase activities, and the evolutionary trade-offs that have shaped its performance across diverse photosynthetic lineages. Recent advances in structural biology and biochemistry have provided new insights into Rubisco's catalytic limitations and potential strategies for improvement. We discuss various approaches to engineering Rubisco, including directed evolution, rational design, and the exploration of natural variation. Additionally, we consider the challenges and opportunities in transferring engineered Rubisco variants into plants and the potential impact on crop productivity and climate change mitigation. This review synthesizes current knowledge on Rubisco and outlines future directions for research and biotechnological applications.", "label": 0}
