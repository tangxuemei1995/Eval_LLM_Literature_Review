{"grounding": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and other genotoxic stresses induce bulky DNA lesions, which threaten genome stability and cell viability. Cells have evolved two main repair pathways to remove such lesions: global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The modes by which these subpathways recognize DNA lesions are distinct, but they converge onto the same downstream steps for DNA repair. Here, we first summarize the current understanding of these repair mechanisms, specifically focusing on the roles of stalled RNA polymerase II, Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), CSA and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) in TC-NER. We also discuss the intriguing role of protein ubiquitylation in this process. Additionally, we highlight key aspects of the effect of UV irradiation on transcription and describe the role of signaling cascades in orchestrating this response. Finally, we describe the pathogenic mechanisms underlying xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, the two main diseases linked to mutations in NER factors.", "generated_text": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces DNA damage that can disrupt cellular processes, including transcription. This review explores the intricate relationship between transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage. We discuss how RNA polymerase II stalling at DNA lesions triggers TC-NER, a specialized repair pathway that preferentially removes damage from actively transcribed genes. The interplay between TC-NER and global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) is examined, highlighting their complementary roles in maintaining genomic integrity. We also delve into the transcriptional changes that occur in response to UV damage, including the activation of stress response genes and the modulation of repair-related gene expression. Furthermore, we address the implications of defective TC-NER in Cockayne syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by UV sensitivity and developmental abnormalities. Understanding these mechanisms provides crucial insights into cellular responses to DNA damage and potential therapeutic targets for UV-related disorders.", "label": 1}
