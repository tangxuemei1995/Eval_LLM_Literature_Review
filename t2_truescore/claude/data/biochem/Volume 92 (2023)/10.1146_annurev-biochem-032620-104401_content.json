{"grounding": "According to the endosymbiotic theory, most of the DNA of the original bacterial endosymbiont has been lost or transferred to the nucleus, leaving a much smaller (\u223c16 kb in mammals), circular molecule that is the present-day mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The ability of mtDNA to escape mitochondria and integrate into the nuclear genome was discovered in budding yeast, along with genes that regulate this process. Mitochondria have emerged as key regulators of innate immunity, and it is now recognized that mtDNA released into the cytoplasm, outside of the cell, or into circulation activates multiple innate immune signaling pathways. Here, we first review the mechanisms through which mtDNA is released into the cytoplasm, including several inducible mitochondrial pores and defective mitophagy or autophagy. Next, we cover how the different forms of released mtDNA activate specific innate immune nucleic acid sensors and inflammasomes. Finally, we discuss how intracellular and extracellular mtDNA release, including circulating cell-free mtDNA that promotes systemic inflammation, are implicated in human diseases, bacterial and viral infections, senescence and aging.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has emerged as a crucial player in innate immune signaling, bridging cellular stress and inflammatory responses. This review explores the mechanisms of mtDNA release and its role in activating innate immune pathways. We discuss how mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cellular damage can trigger the release of mtDNA through various pores and channels. Once in the cytosol or extracellular space, mtDNA acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), engaging multiple DNA sensing pathways, including cGAS-STING and TLR9. The subsequent activation of inflammatory cascades contributes to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions. Understanding the intricate relationship between mtDNA release and innate immune signaling provides new insights into the molecular basis of inflammation and offers potential therapeutic targets for modulating immune responses in diverse pathological contexts.", "label": 1}
