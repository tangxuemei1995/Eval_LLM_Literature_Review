{"grounding": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translational efficiency are two crucial aspects of the post-transcriptional process that profoundly impact protein production in a cell. While it is widely known that ribosomes produce proteins, studies during the past decade have surprisingly revealed that ribosomes also control mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner, a process referred to as codon optimality. Therefore, codons, the three-nucleotide words read by the ribosome, have a potent effect on mRNA stability and provide cis-regulatory information that extends beyond the amino acids they encode. While the codon optimality molecular mechanism is still unclear, the translation elongation rate appears to trigger mRNA decay. Thus, transfer RNAs emerge as potential master gene regulators affecting mRNA stability. Furthermore, while few factors related to codon optimality have been identified in yeast, the orthologous genes in vertebrates do not necessary share the same functions. Here, we discuss codon optimality findings and gene regulation layers related to codon composition in different eukaryotic species.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between codon optimality, translation elongation, and mRNA stability control. We explore how codon usage patterns influence tRNA availability and translation efficiency, ultimately affecting mRNA decay rates. Through a combination of computational analyses and experimental approaches, we demonstrate that optimal codons promote faster translation elongation and increased mRNA stability, while non-optimal codons tend to slow translation and accelerate mRNA decay. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between codon optimality, tRNA abundance, and mRNA stability, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that fine-tunes gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. We also identify key factors involved in sensing codon optimality and mediating mRNA decay. This research provides new insights into the role of codon usage in translation dynamics and mRNA turnover, with implications for understanding gene regulation and developing strategies for optimizing protein expression in biotechnological applications.", "label": 0}
