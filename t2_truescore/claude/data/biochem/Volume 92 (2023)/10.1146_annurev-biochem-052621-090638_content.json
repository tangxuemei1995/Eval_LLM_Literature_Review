{"grounding": "Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes use a site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] cluster and SAM to initiate radical reactions through liberation of the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl (5\u2032-dAdo\u2022) radical. They form the largest enzyme superfamily, with more than 700,000 unique sequences currently, and their numbers continue to grow as a result of ongoing bioinformatics efforts. The range of extremely diverse, highly regio- and stereo-specific reactions known to be catalyzed by radical SAM superfamily members is remarkable. The common mechanism of radical initiation in the radical SAM superfamily is the focus of this review. Most surprising is the presence of an organometallic intermediate, \u03a9, exhibiting an Fe\u2013C5\u2032-adenosyl bond. Regioselective reductive cleavage of the SAM S\u2013C5\u2032 bond produces 5\u2032-dAdo\u2022 to form \u03a9, with the regioselectivity originating in the Jahn\u2013Teller effect. \u03a9 liberates the free 5\u2032-dAdo\u2022 as the catalytically active intermediate through homolysis of the Fe\u2013C5\u2032 bond, in analogy to Co\u2013C5\u2032 bond homolysis in B12, which was once viewed as biology's choice of radical generator.", "generated_text": "The radical SAM enzyme superfamily plays a crucial role in numerous biochemical processes through the generation of highly reactive radical species. This review explores the mechanism of radical initiation in these enzymes, focusing on the unique organometallic chemistry involving S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and iron-sulfur clusters. We discuss the formation of the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical, a key intermediate in the catalytic cycle, and its subsequent reactions. Recent structural and spectroscopic studies have provided insights into the precise positioning of SAM relative to the iron-sulfur cluster, elucidating the electron transfer process that initiates radical formation. Additionally, we examine the diversity of radical SAM enzymes and their substrate specificity, highlighting the adaptability of this mechanism across various biological systems. Understanding these fundamental processes contributes to our knowledge of enzyme catalysis and may inform future applications in biotechnology and medicine.", "label": 1}
