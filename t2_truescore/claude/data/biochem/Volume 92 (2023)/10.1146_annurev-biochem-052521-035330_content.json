{"grounding": "Over the past decade, mRNA modifications have emerged as important regulators of gene expression control in cells. Fueled in large part by the development of tools for detecting RNA modifications transcriptome wide, researchers have uncovered a diverse epitranscriptome that serves as an additional layer of gene regulation beyond simple RNA sequence. Here, we review the proteins that write, read, and erase these marks, with a particular focus on the most abundant internal modification, N\n6-methyladenosine (m6A). We first describe the discovery of the key enzymes that deposit and remove m6A and other modifications and discuss how our understanding of these proteins has shaped our views of modification dynamics. We then review current models for the function of m6A reader proteins and how our knowledge of these proteins has evolved. Finally, we highlight important future directions for the field and discuss key questions that remain unanswered.", "generated_text": "The epitranscriptome, encompassing diverse RNA modifications, has emerged as a crucial regulator of gene expression. This review focuses on the proteins involved in mRNA modification, particularly m6A (N6-methyladenosine), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNAs. We discuss the 'writers' (methyltransferases), 'readers' (binding proteins), and 'erasers' (demethylases) of m6A modifications. Writers, such as METTL3-METTL14 complex, catalyze m6A deposition, while readers, including YTH domain-containing proteins, recognize and bind to m6A-modified transcripts. Erasers, like FTO and ALKBH5, remove m6A marks, enabling dynamic regulation. We explore the structural features, mechanisms, and biological functions of these proteins, highlighting their roles in mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. Understanding these key players in the epitranscriptome provides insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and potential therapeutic targets for various diseases.", "label": 1}
