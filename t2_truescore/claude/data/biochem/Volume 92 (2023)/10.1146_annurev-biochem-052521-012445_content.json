{"grounding": "Formation of the 3\u2032 end of a eukaryotic mRNA is a key step in the production of a mature transcript. This process is mediated by a number of protein factors that cleave the pre-mRNA, add a poly(A) tail, and regulate transcription by protein dephosphorylation. Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) in humans, or cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) in yeast, coordinates these enzymatic activities with each other, with RNA recognition, and with transcription. The site of pre-mRNA cleavage can strongly influence the translation, stability, and localization of the mRNA. Hence, cleavage site selection is highly regulated. The length of the poly(A) tail is also controlled to ensure that every transcript has a similar tail when it is exported from the nucleus. In this review, we summarize new mechanistic insights into mRNA 3\u2032-end processing obtained through structural studies and biochemical reconstitution and outline outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "The 3\u2032-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, involving a complex interplay of machinery and regulatory mechanisms. This review explores the intricate process of pre-mRNA processing, focusing on the endonucleolytic cleavage and subsequent polyadenylation that generate the mature 3\u2032 end. We examine the key components of the processing machinery, including the endonuclease responsible for cleavage and the poly(A) polymerase that synthesizes the poly(A) tail. The regulatory factors that modulate this process and their impact on transcription and overall gene expression are discussed. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in understanding the coupling between 3\u2032-end processing and other stages of mRNA biogenesis, such as transcription termination. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of 3\u2032-end processing in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
