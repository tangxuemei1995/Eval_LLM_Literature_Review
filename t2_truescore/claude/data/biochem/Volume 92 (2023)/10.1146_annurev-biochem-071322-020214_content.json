{"grounding": "In this autobiographical article, I reflect on my Swedish background. Then I discuss endogenous DNA alterations and the base excision repair pathway and alternative repair strategies for some unusual DNA lesions. Endogenous DNA damage, such as loss of purine bases and cytosine deamination, is proposed as a major source of cancer-causing mutations.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical account reflects on the author's contributions to understanding endogenous DNA damage and base excision repair mechanisms. The narrative explores the discovery of DNA glycosylases, their role in repairing damaged DNA, and the implications for cancer mutations. Personal anecdotes and scientific insights intertwine, offering a unique perspective on the field's evolution.", "label": 0}
