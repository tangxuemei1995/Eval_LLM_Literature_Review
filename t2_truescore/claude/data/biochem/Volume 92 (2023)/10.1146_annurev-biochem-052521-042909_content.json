{"grounding": "Muscles are essential for movement and heart function. Contraction and relaxation of muscles rely on the sliding of two types of filaments\u2014the thin filament and the thick myosin filament. The thin filament is composed mainly of filamentous actin (F-actin), tropomyosin, and troponin. Additionally, several other proteins are involved in the contraction mechanism, and their malfunction can lead to diverse muscle diseases, such as cardiomyopathies. We review recent high-resolution structural data that explain the mechanism of action of muscle proteins at an unprecedented level of molecular detail. We focus on the molecular structures of the components of the thin and thick filaments and highlight the mechanisms underlying force generation through actin\u2013myosin interactions, as well as Ca2+-dependent regulation via the dihydropyridine receptor, the ryanodine receptor, and troponin. We particularly emphasize the impact of cryo\u2013electron microscopy and cryo\u2013electron tomography in leading muscle research into a new era.", "generated_text": "Muscle contraction is a complex process involving the intricate interplay of various proteins and molecular structures. This review explores recent advancements in our understanding of the structural biochemistry underlying muscle contraction, focusing on key players such as actin, myosin, ryanodine receptors, and troponin. We examine the latest findings obtained through cutting-edge techniques like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), which have revolutionized our ability to visualize and analyze these molecular structures at unprecedented resolutions. The review highlights the dynamic conformational changes and interactions between these proteins during the contraction cycle, providing insights into the mechanistic details of force generation and regulation. Furthermore, we discuss how these structural insights contribute to our understanding of muscle-related diseases and potential therapeutic interventions. This comprehensive overview synthesizes current knowledge and identifies future research directions in the field of muscle contraction biochemistry.", "label": 1}
