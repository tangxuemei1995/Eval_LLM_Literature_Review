{"grounding": "The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are abundant polycations of vital importance in mammalian cells. Their cellular levels are tightly regulated by degradation and synthesis, as well as by uptake and export. Here, we discuss the delicate balance between the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of polyamines in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyamine levels decline with aging and are altered in patients with PD, whereas recent mechanistic studies on ATP13A2 (PARK9) demonstrated a driving role of a disturbed polyamine homeostasis in PD. Polyamines affect pathways in PD pathogenesis, such as \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, and influence PD-related processes like autophagy, heavy metal toxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and lysosomal/mitochondrial dysfunction. We formulate outstanding research questions regarding the role of polyamines in PD, their potential as PD biomarkers, and possible therapeutic strategies for PD targeting polyamine homeostasis.", "generated_text": "Polyamines, essential molecules for cellular function, play a complex role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. This review explores the dual nature of polyamines in PD, examining their potential for both neurotoxicity and neuroprotection. We discuss the interactions between polyamines and key cellular components, including endo/lysosomes, mitochondria, and \u03b1-synuclein, which are implicated in PD progression. The review also highlights the role of astrocytes in polyamine metabolism and their impact on neuronal health. Recent findings suggest that while polyamine dysregulation can contribute to cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration, controlled polyamine supplementation may offer neuroprotective benefits. Understanding the delicate balance of polyamine function in PD could lead to novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating polyamine levels or their interactions with cellular targets to slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
