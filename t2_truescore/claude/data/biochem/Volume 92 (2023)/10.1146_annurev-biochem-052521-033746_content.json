{"grounding": "Thiolases are CoA-dependent enzymes that catalyze the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA, as well as its reverse reaction, which is the thioester-dependent Claisen condensation reaction. Thiolases are dimers or tetramers (dimers of dimers). All thiolases have two reactive cysteines: (a) a nucleophilic cysteine, which forms a covalent intermediate, and (b) an acid/base cysteine. The best characterized thiolase is the Zoogloea ramigera thiolase, which is a bacterial biosynthetic thiolase belonging to the CT-thiolase subfamily. The thiolase active site is also characterized by two oxyanion holes, two active site waters, and four catalytic loops with characteristic amino acid sequence fingerprints. Three thiolase subfamilies can be identified, each characterized by a unique sequence fingerprint for one of their catalytic loops, which causes unique active site properties. Recent insights concerning the thiolase reaction mechanism, as obtained from recent structural studies, as well as from classical and recent enzymological studies, are addressed, and open questions are discussed.", "generated_text": "Thiolase enzymes play a crucial role in diverse metabolic pathways by catalyzing the reversible formation and cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds using coenzyme A-thioester chemistry. This review explores the versatility of thiolases, focusing on their unique structural features and catalytic mechanisms. We examine the intricate hydrogen-bond network and proton wire system that facilitate proton transfer during catalysis, as well as the oxyanion hole that stabilizes reaction intermediates. The review highlights the importance of coenzyme A in thiolase-mediated reactions, particularly in Claisen condensation-like processes. We discuss how thiolases employ thioester chemistry to achieve efficient C-C bond formation and cleavage, emphasizing their significance in both biosynthetic and degradative pathways. Furthermore, we explore recent advances in understanding thiolase structure-function relationships and their potential applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology. This comprehensive analysis underscores the fundamental importance of thiolases in cellular metabolism and their potential as biocatalysts for industrial applications.", "label": 1}
