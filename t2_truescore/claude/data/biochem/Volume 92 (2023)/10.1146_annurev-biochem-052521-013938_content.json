{"grounding": "DNA-editing enzymes perform chemical reactions on DNA nucleobases. These reactions can change the genetic identity of the modified base or modulate gene expression. Interest in DNA-editing enzymes has burgeoned in recent years due to the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems, which can be used to direct their DNA-editing activity to specific genomic loci of interest. In this review, we showcase DNA-editing enzymes that have been repurposed or redesigned and developed into programmable base editors. These include deaminases, glycosylases, methyltransferases, and demethylases. We highlight the astounding degree to which these enzymes have been redesigned, evolved, and refined and present these collective engineering efforts as a paragon for future efforts to repurpose and engineer other families of enzymes. Collectively, base editors derived from these DNA-editing enzymes facilitate programmable point mutation introduction and gene expression modulation by targeted chemical modification of nucleobases.", "generated_text": "DNA-editing enzymes have emerged as powerful tools for precise genome modification, with base editors representing a significant advancement in this field. This review explores the design principles and applications of various base editors, including deaminases, methyltransferases, demethylases, and glycosylases. We discuss the protein engineering strategies employed to enhance the specificity, efficiency, and versatility of these enzymes. The development of novel base editors through rational design and directed evolution is examined, along with their potential for treating genetic disorders and improving crop traits. We also address the challenges and limitations of current base editing technologies, such as off-target effects and delivery methods. Finally, we highlight emerging trends and future directions in the field, including the integration of base editors with other genome engineering tools and their potential impact on personalized medicine and biotechnology.", "label": 0}
