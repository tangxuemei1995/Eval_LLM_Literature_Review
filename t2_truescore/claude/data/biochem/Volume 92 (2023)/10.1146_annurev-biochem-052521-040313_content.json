{"grounding": "Ligands of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway are paracrine signaling molecules that coordinate tissue development in metazoans. A remarkable feature of HH signaling is the repeated use of cholesterol in steps spanning ligand biogenesis, secretion, dispersal, and reception on target cells. A cholesterol molecule covalently attached to HH ligands is used as a molecular baton by transfer proteins to guide their secretion, spread, and reception. On target cells, a signaling circuit composed of a cholesterol transporter and sensor regulates transmission of HH signals across the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The repeated use of cholesterol in signaling supports the view that the HH pathway likely evolved by coopting ancient systems to regulate the abundance or organization of sterol-like lipids in membranes.", "generated_text": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Recent studies have unveiled an intricate relationship between cholesterol and Hh signaling, highlighting the importance of this lipid in regulating pathway activity. Cholesterol is not only essential for the post-translational modification of Hh ligands but also serves as a key component in the primary cilium, where Hh signal transduction occurs. Furthermore, cholesterol modulates the function of Smoothened, the G protein-coupled receptor central to Hh signaling. This review explores the multifaceted roles of cholesterol in Hh pathway regulation, from ligand processing to receptor activation and signal transduction. Understanding this cholesterol-Hh interplay provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for Hh-related disorders and opens new avenues for manipulating this essential developmental pathway.", "label": 1}
