{"grounding": "Primates have evolved diverse cognitive capabilities to navigate their complex social world. To understand how the brain implements critical social cognitive abilities, we describe functional specialization in the domains of face processing, social interaction understanding, and mental state attribution. Systems for face processing are specialized from the level of single cells to populations of neurons within brain regions to hierarchically organized networks that extract and represent abstract social information. Such functional specialization is not confined to the sensorimotor periphery but appears to be a pervasive theme of primate brain organization all the way to the apex regions of cortical hierarchies. Circuits processing social information are juxtaposed with parallel systems involved in processing nonsocial information, suggesting common computations applied to different domains. The emerging picture of the neural basis of social cognition is a set of distinct but interacting subnetworks involved in component processes such as face perception and social reasoning, traversing large parts of the primate brain.", "generated_text": "This review examines the specialized neural networks underlying social cognition in primates, with a focus on the functional organization of the 'social brain.' We synthesize recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies to elucidate the distinct yet interconnected brain regions involved in various aspects of social information processing. Key areas discussed include the fusiform face area for face perception, the superior temporal sulcus for analyzing social interactions, and the medial prefrontal cortex for mentalizing and social knowledge representation. We highlight the dynamic interplay between these specialized networks and their role in integrating multiple social cues. Additionally, we explore how these neural systems support complex social behaviors and decision-making in both human and non-human primates. This research provides insights into the evolution of social cognition and has implications for understanding social deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders.", "label": 1}
