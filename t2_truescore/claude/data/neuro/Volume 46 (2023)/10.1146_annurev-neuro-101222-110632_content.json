{"grounding": "Examination of cognition has historically been approached from language and introspection. However, human language\u2013dependent definitions ignore the evolutionary roots of brain mechanisms and constrain their study in experimental animals. We promote an alternative view, namely that cognition, including memory, can be explained by exaptation and expansion of the circuits and algorithms serving bodily functions. Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states. Exaptation of such circuits was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche. We illustrate that exploration gives rise to a cognitive map, and in turn, environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning). Such brain-body interactions not only occur during waking but also persist during sleep. These exaptation steps are illustrated by the dual, endocrine-homeostatic and memory, contributions of the hippocampal system, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.", "generated_text": "This study explores the evolutionary exaptation of memory systems, focusing on the hippocampus and its role in both cognitive functions and body regulation. We investigate how sharp-wave ripples, initially evolved for homeostatic and allostatic processes, may have been repurposed for memory consolidation. By examining the interplay between glucose regulation and hippocampal activity, we propose a novel framework for understanding the body-brain partnership in cognition. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus serves as a crucial interface between physiological control and higher-order cognitive processes. This research provides insights into the adaptive nature of neural systems and highlights the importance of considering bodily functions in cognitive neuroscience. The study has implications for understanding memory disorders, metabolic conditions, and the development of targeted interventions that leverage the body-brain connection to enhance cognitive performance.", "label": 1}
