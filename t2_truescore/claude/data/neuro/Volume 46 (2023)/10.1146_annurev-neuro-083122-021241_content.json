{"grounding": "Radial cell columns are a hallmark feature of cortical architecture in many mammalian species. It has long been held, based on the lack of orientation columns, that such functional units are absent in rodent primary visual cortex (V1). These observations led to the view that rodent visual cortex has a fundamentally different network architecture than that of carnivores and primates. While columns may be lacking in rodent V1, we describe in this review that modular clusters of inputs to layer 1 and projection neurons in the layers below are prominent features of the mouse visual cortex. We propose that modules organize thalamocortical inputs, intracortical processing streams, and transthalamic communications that underlie distinct sensory and sensorimotor functions.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the integration of feedforward and feedback information streams within the modular architecture of the mouse visual cortex. We examine the role of patchy connections in layer 1 and their contribution to the processing hierarchy. Our findings reveal that M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors play a crucial role in modulating these connections, influencing the flow of information between different processing streams. We demonstrate that the interplay between feedforward and feedback pathways is essential for the efficient processing of visual information. Our results provide new insights into the complex organization of the mouse visual cortex and highlight the importance of understanding the modular architecture in relation to information processing and integration across different cortical layers.", "label": 0}
