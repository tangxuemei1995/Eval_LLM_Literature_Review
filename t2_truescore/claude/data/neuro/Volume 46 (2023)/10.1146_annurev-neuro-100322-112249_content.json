{"grounding": "This review explores the interface between circadian timekeeping and the regulation of brain function by astrocytes. Although astrocytes regulate neuronal activity across many time domains, their cell-autonomous circadian clocks exert a particular role in controlling longer-term oscillations of brain function: the maintenance of sleep states and the circadian ordering of sleep and wakefulness. This is most evident in the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where the molecular clock of astrocytes suffices to drive daily cycles of neuronal activity and behavior. In Alzheimer's disease, sleep impairments accompany cognitive decline. In mouse models of the disease, circadian disturbances accelerate astroglial activation and other brain pathologies, suggesting that daily functions in astrocytes protect neuronal homeostasis. In brain cancer, treatment in the morning has been associated with prolonged survival, and gliomas have daily rhythms in gene expression and drug sensitivity. Thus, circadian time is fast becoming critical to elucidating reciprocal astrocytic-neuronal interactions in health and disease.", "generated_text": "Circadian rhythms, the internal biological clocks that regulate various physiological processes, have been extensively studied in neurons. However, recent research has shed light on the crucial role of astrocytes in maintaining and modulating these rhythms. This review explores the multifaceted involvement of astrocytes in circadian regulation, highlighting their beneficial (good), detrimental (bad), and complex (ugly) aspects. We discuss how astrocytic calcium signaling and gliotransmitter release contribute to the synchronization of circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. The review also examines the implications of disrupted astrocytic circadian rhythms in neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, we investigate the potential link between circadian dysregulation in astrocytes and the development of gliomas. By synthesizing current knowledge, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between astrocytes and circadian rhythms, emphasizing their significance in both health and disease.", "label": 1}
