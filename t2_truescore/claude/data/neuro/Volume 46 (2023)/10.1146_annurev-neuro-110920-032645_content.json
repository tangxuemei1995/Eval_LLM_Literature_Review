{"grounding": "Many animals can navigate toward a goal they cannot see based on an internal representation of that goal in the brain's spatial maps. These maps are organized around networks with stable fixed-point dynamics (attractors), anchored to landmarks, and reciprocally connected to motor control. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding these networks, focusing on studies in arthropods. One factor driving recent progress is the availability of the Drosophila connectome; however, it is increasingly clear that navigation depends on ongoing synaptic plasticity in these networks. Functional synapses appear to be continually reselected from the set of anatomical potential synapses based on the interaction of Hebbian learning rules, sensory feedback, attractor dynamics, and neuromodulation. This can explain how the brain's maps of space are rapidly updated; it may also explain how the brain can initialize goals as stable fixed points for navigation.", "generated_text": "Neural networks play a crucial role in animal navigation, integrating various sensory inputs and computational processes to guide spatial behavior. This review explores the neural mechanisms underlying navigation, focusing on key components such as memory, menotaxis, path integration, and head direction systems. We examine how these processes are interconnected and how they contribute to the formation of cognitive maps. The role of dopamine in modulating navigational behaviors and reinforcing spatial learning is discussed. Additionally, we investigate the neural basis of coordinate transformations, which allow animals to seamlessly switch between egocentric and allocentric reference frames. By synthesizing recent findings from neuroscience and computational modeling, we provide insights into the complex neural computations that enable efficient navigation across diverse environments. This understanding may inform the development of advanced artificial navigation systems and contribute to our knowledge of spatial cognition in both animals and humans.", "label": 1}
