{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires the creation, updating, and expression of memories to depend on context. While the neural underpinnings of each of these processes have been intensively studied, recent advances in computational modeling revealed a key challenge in context-dependent learning that had been largely ignored previously: Under naturalistic conditions, context is typically uncertain, necessitating contextual inference. We review a theoretical approach to formalizing context-dependent learning in the face of contextual uncertainty and the core computations it requires. We show how this approach begins to organize a large body of disparate experimental observations, from multiple levels of brain organization (including circuits, systems, and behavior) and multiple brain regions (most prominently the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and motor cortices), into a coherent framework. We argue that contextual inference may also be key to understanding continual learning in the brain. This theory-driven perspective places contextual inference as a core component of learning.", "generated_text": "Context-dependent learning is a crucial aspect of adaptive behavior, enabling organisms to flexibly apply knowledge across diverse situations. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this process. We examine how Bayesian inference frameworks model context-dependent learning, highlighting their ability to capture the integration of prior knowledge with new information. Neural investigations reveal a distributed network involving the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortex in supporting context-dependent learning. The prefrontal cortex plays a key role in maintaining contextual representations, while the hippocampus contributes to rapid encoding of context-specific associations. Thalamic circuits facilitate information routing, and motor cortex implements context-appropriate actions. We discuss how these findings inform theories of continual learning and memory consolidation, emphasizing the importance of context in shaping cognitive flexibility and adaptive behavior across species.", "label": 1}
