{"grounding": "In mammals, the activity of neurons in the entorhinal-hippocampal network is modulated by the animal's position and its movement through space. At multiple stages of this distributed circuit, distinct populations of neurons can represent a rich repertoire of navigation-related variables like the animal's location, the speed and direction of its movements, or the presence of borders and objects. Working together, spatially tuned neurons give rise to an internal representation of space, a cognitive map that supports an animal's ability to navigate the world and to encode and consolidate memories from experience. The mechanisms by which, during development, the brain acquires the ability to create an internal representation of space are just beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we examine recent work that has begun to investigate the ontogeny of circuitry, firing patterns, and computations underpinning the representation of space in the mammalian brain.", "generated_text": "The ability to navigate and form spatial memories is crucial for survival across species. This review explores the developmental processes underlying the formation of cognitive maps in the brain, focusing on the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. We examine the emergence of specialized neural circuits and computations that support spatial representation, from early postnatal stages to adulthood. Key topics include the maturation of grid cells, place cells, and other spatially-tuned neurons, as well as the development of synaptic connections and network dynamics. We discuss how genetic factors, environmental experiences, and neural plasticity contribute to the establishment of these complex spatial systems. Understanding the developmental trajectory of cognitive map formation provides insights into both normal brain function and potential interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders affecting spatial cognition and memory.", "label": 0}
