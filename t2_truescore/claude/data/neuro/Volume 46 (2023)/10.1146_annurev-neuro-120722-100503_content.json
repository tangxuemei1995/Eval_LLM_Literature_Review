{"grounding": "Despite increasing evidence of its involvement in several key functions of the cerebral cortex, the vestibular sense rarely enters our consciousness. Indeed, the extent to which these internal signals are incorporated within cortical sensory representation and how they might be relied upon for sensory-driven decision-making, during, for example, spatial navigation, is yet to be understood. Recent novel experimental approaches in rodents have probed both the physiological and behavioral significance of vestibular signals and indicate that their widespread integration with vision improves both the cortical representation and perceptual accuracy of self-motion and orientation. Here, we summarize these recent findings with a focus on cortical circuits involved in visual perception and spatial navigation and highlight the major remaining knowledge gaps. We suggest that vestibulo-visual integration reflects a process of constant updating regarding the status of self-motion, and access to such information by the cortex is used for sensory perception and predictions that may be implemented for rapid, navigation-related decision-making.", "generated_text": "The integration of vestibular and visual information in the cerebral cortex plays a crucial role in spatial navigation, visual processing, and perception of self-motion. This review synthesizes recent findings on the cortical mechanisms underlying multisensory integration of vestibular and visual cues. We examine the neural substrates involved in processing these sensory inputs, focusing on key cortical areas such as the parietal, temporal, and frontal regions. The review highlights the dynamic interplay between vestibular and visual systems in constructing a coherent representation of the environment and guiding navigation. We discuss how this integration contributes to spatial orientation, heading estimation, and the perception of self-motion. Additionally, we explore the implications of vestibular-visual integration for visual stability during head and body movements. Understanding these cortical processes provides insights into the neural basis of spatial cognition and has potential applications in developing interventions for disorders affecting spatial navigation and perception.", "label": 1}
