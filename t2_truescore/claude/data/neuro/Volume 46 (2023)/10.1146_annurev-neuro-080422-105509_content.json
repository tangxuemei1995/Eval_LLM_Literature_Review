{"grounding": "Migraine is a complex neurovascular pain disorder linked to the meninges, a border tissue innervated by neuropeptide-containing primary afferent fibers chiefly from the trigeminal nerve. Electrical or mechanical stimulation of this nerve surrounding large blood vessels evokes headache patterns as in migraine, and the brain, blood, and meninges are likely sources of headache triggers. Cerebrospinal fluid may play a significant role in migraine by transferring signals released from the brain to overlying pain-sensitive meningeal tissues, including dura mater. Interactions between trigeminal afferents, neuropeptides, and adjacent meningeal cells and tissues cause neurogenic inflammation, a critical target for current prophylactic and abortive migraine therapies. Here we review the importance of the cranial meninges to migraine headaches, explore the properties of trigeminal meningeal afferents, and briefly review emerging concepts, such as meningeal neuroimmune interactions, that may one day prove therapeutically relevant.", "generated_text": "Migraine, a debilitating neurological disorder, has long puzzled researchers due to its complex pathophysiology. Recent advances in understanding meningeal mechanisms have shed light on the intricate relationship between the meninges and migraine pathogenesis. This review explores the role of meningeal afferents, trigeminal nerve activation, and neurogenic inflammation in migraine development. We examine the sensitization of meningeal nociceptors and their contribution to headache progression. Additionally, we discuss the phenomenon of cortical spreading depression and its potential influence on meningeal processes. By integrating current research findings, we propose a comprehensive model linking meningeal mechanisms to various aspects of migraine, including pain perception, associated symptoms, and chronification. This synthesis of knowledge provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and paves the way for novel treatment strategies in migraine management.", "label": 1}
