{"grounding": "Emotions are fundamental to our experience and behavior, affecting and motivating all aspects of our lives. Scientists of various disciplines have been fascinated by emotions for centuries, yet even today vigorous debates abound about how to define emotions and how to best study their neural underpinnings. Defining emotions from an evolutionary perspective and acknowledging their important functional roles in supporting survival allows the study of emotion states in diverse species. This approach enables taking advantage of modern tools in behavioral, systems, and circuit neurosciences, allowing the precise dissection of neural mechanisms and behavior underlying emotion processes in model organisms. Here we review findings about the neural circuit mechanisms underlying emotion processing across species and try to identify points of convergence as well as important next steps in the pursuit of understanding how emotions emerge from neural activity.", "generated_text": "Emotion is a fundamental aspect of human experience, yet its neural underpinnings remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes recent advances in circuit neuroscience and affective neuroscience to elucidate the neural circuits underlying emotional states. We focus on the concept of valence, which refers to the positive or negative quality of an emotional experience. By integrating findings from cross-species approaches, including rodent models and human neuroimaging studies, we identify key brain regions and circuits involved in emotional processing. We discuss how these circuits interact to generate and regulate emotional states, emphasizing the role of neurotransmitter systems and neuromodulators. Additionally, we explore how disruptions in these circuits may contribute to affective disorders. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex neural mechanisms underlying emotion and highlights potential targets for therapeutic interventions in emotional disorders.", "label": 1}
