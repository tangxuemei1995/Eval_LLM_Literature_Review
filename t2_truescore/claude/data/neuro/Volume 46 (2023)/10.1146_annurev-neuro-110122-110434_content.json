{"grounding": "The field of stereotactic neurosurgery developed more than 70 years ago to address a therapy gap for patients with severe psychiatric disorders. In the decades since, it has matured tremendously, benefiting from advances in clinical and basic sciences. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe, treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders is currently poised to transition from a stage of empiricism to one increasingly rooted in scientific discovery. Current drivers of this transition are advances in neuroimaging, but rapidly emerging ones are neurophysiological\u2014as we understand more about the neural basis of these disorders, we will more successfully be able to use interventions such as invasive stimulation to restore dysfunctional circuits to health. Paralleling this transition is a steady increase in the consistency and quality of outcome data. Here, we focus on obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, two topics that have received the most attention in terms of trial volume and scientific effort.", "generated_text": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, particularly obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. This review examines the current state of psychiatric neurosurgery, focusing on the application of DBS in these conditions. We analyze the neuroanatomical targets, stimulation parameters, and clinical outcomes reported in recent studies. The efficacy of DBS in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life for patients with OCD and depression is evaluated, along with potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, we discuss the ethical considerations and challenges associated with neuromodulation in psychiatric populations. While DBS shows promise as a treatment option for severe, refractory cases of OCD and depression, further research is needed to optimize target selection, refine stimulation protocols, and identify suitable patient populations to maximize therapeutic benefits and minimize risks.", "label": 1}
