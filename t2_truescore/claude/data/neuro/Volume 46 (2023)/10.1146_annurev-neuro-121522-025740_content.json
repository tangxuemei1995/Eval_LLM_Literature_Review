{"grounding": "Striosomes form neurochemically specialized compartments of the striatum embedded in a large matrix made up of modules called matrisomes. Striosome-matrix architecture is multiplexed with the canonical direct-indirect organization of the striatum. Striosomal functions remain to be fully clarified, but key information is emerging. First, striosomes powerfully innervate nigral dopamine-containing neurons and can completely shut down their activity, with a following rebound excitation. Second, striosomes receive limbic and cognition-related corticostriatal afferents and are dynamically modulated in relation to value-based actions. Third, striosomes are spatially interspersed among matrisomes and interneurons and are influenced by local and global neuromodulatory and oscillatory activities. Fourth, striosomes tune engagement and the motivation to perform reinforcement learning, to manifest stereotypical behaviors, and to navigate valence conflicts and valence discriminations. We suggest that, at an algorithmic level, striosomes could serve as distributed scaffolds to provide formats of the striatal computations generated through development and refined through learning. We propose that striosomes affect subjective states. By transforming corticothalamic and other inputs to the functional formats of the striatum, they could implement state transitions in nigro-striato-nigral circuits to affect bodily and cognitive actions according to internal motives whose functions are compromised in neuropsychiatric conditions.", "generated_text": "The striatum, a key component of the basal ganglia, plays a crucial role in learning, decision-making, and motor control. This review explores the intricate relationship between striosomes and matrisomes, two distinct compartments within the striatum, and their role in coupling volition and action. We examine recent evidence suggesting that striosomes, rich in mu-opioid receptors, are involved in value-based decision-making and motivation, while matrisomes, abundant in dopamine receptors, are primarily associated with action selection and execution. The dynamic interplay between these compartments is proposed to form a scaffold for integrating cognitive and motor processes. We discuss how dopamine signaling differentially modulates striosome and matrisome activity, influencing learning and behavioral adaptation. Furthermore, we highlight the potential implications of striosome-matrisome interactions in neurological and psychiatric disorders affecting volition and action. This review synthesizes current knowledge and proposes a framework for understanding how the striatal architecture facilitates the seamless transition from intention to action, opening new avenues for research in basal ganglia function and related disorders.", "label": 1}
