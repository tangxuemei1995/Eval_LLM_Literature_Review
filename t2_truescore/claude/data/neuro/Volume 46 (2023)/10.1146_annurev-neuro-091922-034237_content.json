{"grounding": "All mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol to maintain membrane integrity. The transport of this hydrophobic lipid is mediated by lipoproteins. Cholesterol is especially enriched in the brain, particularly in synaptic and myelin membranes. Aging involves changes in sterol metabolism in peripheral organs and also in the brain. Some of those alterations have the potential to promote or to counteract the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of general principles of sterol metabolism in humans and mice, the most widely used model organism in biomedical research. We discuss changes in sterol metabolism that occur in the aged brain and highlight recent developments in cell type\u2013specific cholesterol metabolism in the fast-growing research field of aging and age-related diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. We propose that cell type\u2013specific cholesterol handling and the interplay between cell types critically influence age-related disease processes.", "generated_text": "Cholesterol metabolism plays a crucial role in aging and age-related neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease. This review explores the intricate relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and the aging brain, focusing on its impact on neurons and microglia. We examine how age-related changes in cholesterol metabolism contribute to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. The role of cholesterol in the formation and clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, is discussed. Additionally, we investigate the potential of targeting cholesterol metabolism as a therapeutic approach for age-related neurological disorders. Recent advances in understanding the interplay between cholesterol, microglia, and neurons in the aging brain are highlighted, providing insights into novel interventions for maintaining cognitive health in older adults and mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.", "label": 1}
