{"grounding": "Rapid advances in the neural control of social behavior highlight the role of interconnected nodes engaged in differential information processing to generate behavior. Many innate social behaviors are essential to reproductive fitness and therefore fundamentally different in males and females. Programming these differences occurs early in development in mammals, following gonadal differentiation and copious androgen production by the fetal testis during a critical period. Early-life programming of social behavior and its adult manifestation are separate but yoked processes, yet how they are linked is unknown. This review seeks to highlight that gap by identifying four core mechanisms (epigenetics, cell death, circuit formation, and adult hormonal modulation) that could connect developmental changes to the adult behaviors of mating and aggression. We further propose that a unique social behavior, adolescent play, bridges the preweaning to the postpubertal brain by engaging the same neural networks underpinning adult reproductive and aggressive behaviors.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic social behaviors, focusing on the developmental trajectory from early life to adulthood. We examine the role of the social behavior network, with particular emphasis on GABA neurons and their interactions with aromatase-expressing cells. Our findings reveal that sex-specific epigenetic modifications during development shape the architecture of neural circuits governing aggression and social play. These modifications persist into adulthood, influencing behavioral outcomes. We demonstrate that aromatase activity plays a crucial role in modulating GABAergic signaling, contributing to the establishment and maintenance of sex-specific behavioral patterns. Furthermore, we identify key molecular pathways involved in the epigenetic regulation of social behavior genes. This research provides novel insights into the complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and hormonal factors in sculpting sexually dimorphic social behaviors, offering potential targets for future therapeutic interventions in social behavior disorders.", "label": 1}
