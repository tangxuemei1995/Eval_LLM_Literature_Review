{"grounding": "Because the central nervous system is largely nonrenewing, neurons and their synapses must be maintained over the lifetime of an individual to ensure circuit function. Age is a dominant risk factor for neural diseases, and declines in nervous system function are a common feature of aging even in the absence of disease. These alterations extend to the visual system and, in particular, to the retina. The retina is a site of clinically relevant age-related alterations but has also proven to be a uniquely approachable system for discovering principles that govern neural aging because it is well mapped, contains diverse neuron types, and is experimentally accessible. In this article, we review the structural and molecular impacts of aging on neurons within the inner and outer retina circuits. We further discuss the contribution of non-neuronal cell types and systems to retinal aging outcomes. Understanding how and why the retina ages is critical to efforts aimed at preventing age-related neural decline and restoring neural function.", "generated_text": "The aging retina undergoes significant structural and functional changes that contribute to visual decline in older individuals. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular and cellular alterations associated with retinal aging. We examine age-related changes in retinal neurons, synapses, and supporting cells, highlighting the progressive loss of photoreceptors, alterations in synaptic connectivity, and modifications in neurotransmitter release. The review also explores the molecular landscapes of the aging retina, including changes in gene expression, protein homeostasis, and mitochondrial function. We discuss the accumulation of oxidative stress and inflammation, which play crucial roles in age-related retinal degeneration. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of these changes on visual processing and perception. Understanding the complex interplay of factors contributing to retinal aging is essential for developing targeted interventions to preserve vision and improve quality of life in the elderly population.", "label": 1}
