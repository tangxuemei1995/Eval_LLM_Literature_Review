{"grounding": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are machine learning algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision due to their remarkable successes in tasks like object classification and segmentation. The success of DNNs as computer vision algorithms has led to the suggestion that DNNs may also be good models of human visual perception. In this article, we review evidence regarding current DNNs as adequate behavioral models of human core object recognition. To this end, we argue that it is important to distinguish between statistical tools and computational models and to understand model quality as a multidimensional concept in which clarity about modeling goals is key. Reviewing a large number of psychophysical and computational explorations of core object recognition performance in humans and DNNs, we argue that DNNs are highly valuable scientific tools but that, as of today, DNNs should only be regarded as promising\u2014but not yet adequate\u2014computational models of human core object recognition behavior. On the way, we dispel several myths surrounding DNNs in vision science.", "generated_text": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, leading to questions about their adequacy as models of human visual perception. This review examines the current state of research comparing deep neural networks to human visual processing, focusing on object recognition and related psychophysical phenomena. We analyze studies that evaluate the similarities and differences between human and machine vision, considering aspects such as generalization, robustness to visual perturbations, and sensitivity to contextual information. While deep neural networks show some alignment with human visual perception in certain tasks, significant discrepancies are observed in others. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding human vision and developing more biologically plausible computational models. Finally, we highlight promising directions for future research that may bridge the gap between artificial and biological visual systems, potentially leading to more comprehensive models of human visual perception.", "label": 1}
