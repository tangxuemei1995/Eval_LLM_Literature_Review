{"grounding": "Some visual properties are consistent across a wide range of environments, while other properties are more labile. The efficient coding hypothesis states that many of these regularities in the environment can be discarded from neural representations, thus allocating more of the brain's dynamic range to properties that are likely to vary. This paradigm is less clear about how the visual system prioritizes different pieces of information that vary across visual environments. One solution is to prioritize information that can be used to predict future events, particularly those that guide behavior. The relationship between the efficient coding and future prediction paradigms is an area of active investigation. In this review, we argue that these paradigms are complementary and often act on distinct components of the visual input. We also discuss how normative approaches to efficient coding and future prediction can be integrated.", "generated_text": "This study explores the relationship between efficient coding and predictive processing in visual perception. We propose that these two fundamental principles of neural computation are intrinsically linked, representing two sides of the same coin. Using an information bottleneck framework, we demonstrate how neural networks can simultaneously optimize for both efficiency and prediction. Our experiments on natural image datasets reveal that networks trained to efficiently encode visual information also exhibit improved predictive capabilities. Conversely, networks optimized for prediction show enhanced coding efficiency. We analyze the emergent representations and find that they capture both low-level statistical regularities and high-level semantic features of visual scenes. These findings suggest a unified theoretical framework for understanding neural coding in the visual system, with implications for both biological and artificial vision systems. Our results provide new insights into the computational principles underlying visual perception and may inform the development of more efficient and robust computer vision algorithms.", "label": 1}
