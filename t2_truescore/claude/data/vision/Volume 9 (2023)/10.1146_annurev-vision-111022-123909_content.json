{"grounding": "This review examines the concept of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in patients with macular diseases. Considering monocular and binocular viewing, we (a) explain how to identify the PRL and discuss the pitfalls associated with its measurement, (b) review the current hypotheses for PRL development, (c) assess whether the PRL is the new reference point of the ocular motor system, and discuss (d) the functional and (e) the clinical implications of the PRL. We conclude that the current definition of the PRL is probably incomplete and should incorporate the need to evaluate the PRL in the framework of binocular viewing. We emphasize the need for more research.", "generated_text": "The preferred retinal locus (PRL) is a crucial adaptation mechanism in individuals with central vision loss, particularly those affected by macular degeneration. This review explores the concept of PRL, its development, and its role in maintaining visual function. We discuss the factors influencing PRL formation, including eccentricity, fixation stability, and visual field characteristics. The importance of binocular viewing and its impact on PRL selection is examined. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between PRL and functional vision outcomes, highlighting its significance in rehabilitation strategies. Understanding the complexities of PRL can inform clinical interventions and improve quality of life for patients with central vision impairment.", "label": 1}
