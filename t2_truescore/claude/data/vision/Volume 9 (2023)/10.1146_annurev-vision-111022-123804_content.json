{"grounding": "The basal ganglia (BG) make up a prominent nexus between visual and motor-related brain regions. In contrast to the BG's well-established roles in movement control and value-based decision making, their contributions to the transformation of visual input into an action remain unclear, especially in the context of perceptual decisions based on uncertain visual evidence. This article reviews recent progress in our understanding of the BG's contributions to the formation, evaluation, and adjustment of such decisions. From theoretical and experimental perspectives, the review focuses on four key stations in the BG network, namely, the striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons, which can have different roles and together support the decision process.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of basal ganglia structures in visual perceptual decision-making. Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral techniques, we examined the contributions of the striatum and pallidum during a saccade-based choice task. Participants made rapid decisions about visual stimuli while their neural activity and reaction times were recorded. We applied sequential analysis and signal detection theory to model the decision-making process. Results revealed that basal ganglia activation correlated with both choice accuracy and reaction time, suggesting a crucial role in evidence accumulation and decision threshold modulation. Our findings highlight the importance of these subcortical structures in integrating sensory information and motor output during perceptual decisions, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual cognition and action selection.", "label": 0}
