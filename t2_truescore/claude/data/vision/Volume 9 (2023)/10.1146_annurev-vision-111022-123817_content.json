{"grounding": "The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical brain structure that is relevant for sensation, cognition, and action. In nonhuman primates, a rich history of studies has provided unprecedented detail about this structure's role in controlling orienting behaviors; as a result, the primate SC has become primarily regarded as a motor control structure. However, as in other species, the primate SC is also a highly visual structure: A fraction of its inputs is retinal and complemented by inputs from visual cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex. Motivated by this, recent investigations are revealing the rich visual pattern analysis capabilities of the primate SC, placing this structure in an ideal position to guide orienting movements. The anatomical proximity of the primate SC to both early visual inputs and final motor control apparatuses, as well as its ascending feedback projections to the cortex, affirms an important role for this structure in active perception.", "generated_text": "The superior colliculus (SC) plays a crucial role in primate visual function and orienting behavior. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the SC's involvement in visual processing, eye movements, and active vision in primates. We examine the SC's layered structure and its diverse neuronal populations, which contribute to both sensory and motor functions. The SC's role in saccade generation, smooth pursuit, and fixation is discussed, along with its interactions with cortical and subcortical areas. We explore the SC's contribution to covert attention and its involvement in multisensory integration. Recent findings on the SC's role in active vision, including its participation in visual search and object recognition, are highlighted. Finally, we consider the evolutionary significance of the SC in primate visual behavior and discuss future research directions that may further elucidate its complex functions in visual cognition and motor control.", "label": 1}
