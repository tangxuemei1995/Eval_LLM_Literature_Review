{"grounding": "Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) is clinically diagnosed as a vascular disease, many studies find retinal neuronal and visual dysfunction before the onset of vascular DR. This suggests that DR should be viewed as a neurovascular disease. Prior to the onset of DR, human patients have compromised electroretinograms that indicate a disruption of normal function, particularly in the inner retina. They also exhibit reduced contrast sensitivity. These early changes, especially those due to dysfunction in the inner retina, are also seen in rodent models of diabetes in the early stages of the disease. Rodent models of diabetes exhibit several neuronal mechanisms, such as reduced evoked GABA release, increased excitatory glutamate signaling, and reduced dopamine signaling, that suggest specific neuronal deficits. This suggests that understanding neuronal deficits may lead to early diabetes treatments to ameliorate neuronal dysfunction.", "generated_text": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that can lead to significant visual dysfunction, primarily due to its effects on the retina. This review examines the current understanding of diabetic retinopathy in both human and rodent models, focusing on the impact of diabetes on retinal neurons and their physiological functions. We explore the similarities and differences between human, mouse, and rat retinal responses to diabetes, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each model. The paper discusses the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotransmitter imbalances. Additionally, we evaluate potential therapeutic targets and interventions aimed at preserving retinal function in diabetic patients. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between diabetes and visual impairment, paving the way for improved diagnostic and treatment strategies.", "label": 1}
