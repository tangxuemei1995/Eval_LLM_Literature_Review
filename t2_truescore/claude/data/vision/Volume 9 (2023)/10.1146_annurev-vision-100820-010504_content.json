{"grounding": "Global health security threats and the public health impact resulting from emerging infectious diseases including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent Ebola virus disease outbreaks continuously emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to preparedness, management of disease outbreaks, and health sequelae associated with emergent pathogens. A spectrum of associated ophthalmic manifestations, along with the potential persistence of emerging viral pathogens in ocular tissues, highlight the importance of an ophthalmic approach to contributing to efforts in the response to public health emergencies from disease outbreaks. This article summarizes the ophthalmic and systemic findings, epidemiology, and therapeutics for emerging viral pathogens identified by the World Health Organization as high-priority pathogens with epidemic potential.", "generated_text": "This review explores the impact of emerging pathogenic viral infections on ocular health, focusing on COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease. Recent outbreaks have highlighted the potential for these viruses to cause significant ophthalmic manifestations, including uveitis and other sight-threatening conditions. The study examines viral persistence in ocular tissues, which may contribute to disease transmission and long-term complications. By analyzing current literature and clinical observations, we aim to enhance understanding of the ocular implications of these emerging infectious diseases. This knowledge is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and treatment strategies, as well as implementing appropriate infection control measures in ophthalmic settings. The findings underscore the importance of ophthalmologists in managing and mitigating the impact of emerging viral infections on eye health.", "label": 1}
