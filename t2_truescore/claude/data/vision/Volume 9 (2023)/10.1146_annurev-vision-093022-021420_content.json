{"grounding": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a complex disease involving development of the neural retina, ocular circulations, and other organ systems of the premature infant. The external stresses of the ex utero environment also influence the pathophysiology of ROP through interactions among retinal neural, vascular, and glial cells. There is variability among individual infants and presentations of the disease throughout the world, making ROP challenging to study. The methods used include representative animal models, cell culture, and clinical studies. This article describes the impact of maternal\u2013fetal interactions; stresses that the preterm infant experiences; and biologic pathways of interest, including growth factor effects and cell\u2013cell interactions, on the complex pathophysiology of ROP phenotypes in developed and emerging countries.", "generated_text": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a complex disorder affecting premature infants, characterized by abnormal retinal vascularization. This review explores the pathophysiology of ROP, focusing on oxygen-induced retinopathy and its impact on angiogenesis. We examine the role of maternal-fetal interactions in ROP development and discuss key growth factors and cell signaling pathways involved in retinal vascularization. The two-phase model of ROP progression is analyzed, highlighting the initial vessel loss followed by pathological neovascularization. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in the premature retina. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving outcomes for infants at risk of ROP.", "label": 1}
