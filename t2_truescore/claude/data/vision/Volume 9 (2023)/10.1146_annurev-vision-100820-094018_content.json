{"grounding": "We live on a planet that is bathed in daily and seasonal sunlight cycles. In this context, terrestrial life forms have evolved mechanisms that directly harness light energy (plants) or decode light information for adaptive advantage. In animals, the main light sensors are a family of G protein\u2013coupled receptors called opsins. Opsin function is best described for the visual sense. However, most animals also use opsins for extraocular light sensing for seasonal behavior and camouflage. While it has long been believed that mammals do not have an extraocular light sensing capacity, recent evidence suggests otherwise. Notably, encephalopsin (OPN3) and neuropsin (OPN5) are both known to mediate extraocular light sensing in mice. Examples of this mediation include photoentrainment of circadian clocks in skin (by OPN5) and acute light-dependent regulation of metabolic pathways (by OPN3 and OPN5). This review summarizes current findings in the expanding field of extraocular photoreception and their relevance for human physiology.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in photobiology have revealed an expanding role for nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing physiology. These photosensitive proteins, distinct from classical visual opsins, are expressed in various tissues throughout the body and contribute to a range of light-dependent processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diverse functions of nonvisual opsins, focusing on their involvement in circadian rhythm regulation, metabolism, and other physiological processes. We explore the molecular mechanisms underlying extraocular photoreception and discuss how these light-sensing systems integrate environmental cues to modulate organismal physiology. The emerging picture suggests a complex network of light-responsive pathways that extend far beyond the visual system, with implications for human health, chronobiology, and potential therapeutic interventions. This expanding field highlights the pervasive influence of light on biological systems and opens new avenues for research in photobiology and chronophysiology.", "label": 1}
