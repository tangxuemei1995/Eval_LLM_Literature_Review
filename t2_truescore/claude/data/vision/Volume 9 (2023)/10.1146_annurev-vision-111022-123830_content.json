{"grounding": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the key methodology for mapping the functions of the human brain in a noninvasive manner, is limited by low temporal and spatial resolution. Recent advances in ultra-high field (UHF) fMRI provide a mesoscopic (i.e., submillimeter resolution) tool that allows us to probe laminar and columnar circuits, distinguish bottom-up versus top-down pathways, and map small subcortical areas. We review recent work demonstrating that UHF fMRI provides a robust methodology for imaging the brain across cortical depths and columns that provides insights into the brain's organization and functions at unprecedented spatial resolution, advancing our understanding of the fine-scale computations and interareal communication that support visual cognition.", "generated_text": "Ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized our understanding of human visual cognition by providing unprecedented spatial resolution. This review explores the latest advancements in 7T and higher field strength imaging, focusing on their applications in studying cortical layers, columnar organization, and subcortical structures involved in visual processing. We discuss how these techniques have enabled researchers to investigate the fine-grained functional architecture of the visual system, revealing layer-specific activations and columnar-level representations. Additionally, we examine the challenges and limitations of ultra-high field imaging, including increased susceptibility artifacts and safety considerations. Finally, we highlight future directions and potential clinical applications of this cutting-edge technology in understanding visual cognition and related disorders.", "label": 1}
