{"grounding": "As we navigate and behave in the world, we are constantly deciding, a few times per second, where to look next. The outcomes of these decisions in response to visual input are comparatively easy to measure as trajectories of eye movements, offering insight into many unconscious and conscious visual and cognitive processes. In this article, we review recent advances in predicting where we look. We focus on evaluating and comparing models: How can we consistently measure how well models predict eye movements, and how can we judge the contribution of different mechanisms? Probabilistic models facilitate a unified approach to fixation prediction that allows us to use explainable information explained to compare different models across different settings, such as static and video saliency, as well as scanpath prediction. We review how the large variety of saliency maps and scanpath models can be translated into this unifying framework, how much different factors contribute, and how we can select the most informative examples for model comparison. We conclude that the universal scale of information gain offers a powerful tool for the inspection of candidate mechanisms and experimental design that helps us understand the continual decision-making process that determines where we look.", "generated_text": "Visual fixations play a crucial role in human perception and cognition, yet accurately predicting where people look remains a challenging task. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art fixation prediction models, employing a novel unifying framework and taxonomy to compare their performance. We leverage information theory and transfer learning techniques to develop a more robust benchmarking methodology, addressing limitations in existing evaluation metrics. Our approach integrates saliency-based and cognitive models, considering both bottom-up and top-down factors influencing eye movements. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in capturing the complex nature of visual attention. Results reveal significant improvements in prediction accuracy and generalizability across different visual contexts. Furthermore, we identify key factors contributing to model success and propose guidelines for future research in fixation prediction. This work provides valuable insights into human visual behavior and offers a standardized approach for evaluating and developing more accurate fixation prediction models.", "label": 0}
