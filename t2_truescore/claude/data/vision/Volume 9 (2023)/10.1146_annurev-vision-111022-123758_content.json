{"grounding": "Augmented reality (AR) systems aim to alter our view of the world and enable us to see things that are not actually there. The resulting discrepancy between perception and reality can create compelling entertainment and can support innovative approaches to education, guidance, and assistive tools. However, building an AR system that effectively integrates with our natural visual experience is hard. AR systems often suffer from visual limitations and artifacts, and addressing these flaws requires basic knowledge of perception. At the same time, AR system development can serve as a catalyst that drives innovative new research in perceptual science. This review describes recent perceptual research pertinent to and driven by modern AR systems, with the goal of highlighting thought-provoking areas of inquiry and open questions.", "generated_text": "Augmented reality (AR) technology has rapidly advanced in recent years, offering new possibilities for enhancing human perception and interaction with the environment. This review examines the perceptual science underlying AR display systems and their impact on visual perception. We explore key challenges in AR design, including depth perception, field of view limitations, and visual-vestibular conflicts. The paper discusses how AR systems can leverage human perceptual mechanisms to create more immersive and effective experiences. Additionally, we analyze the potential cognitive and perceptual benefits of AR in various applications, such as education, healthcare, and industrial settings. By synthesizing current research in visual perception and AR technology, this review provides insights for future developments in perceptually-optimized AR systems.", "label": 1}
