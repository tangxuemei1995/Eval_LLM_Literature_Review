{"grounding": "Perception and memory are traditionally thought of as separate cognitive functions, supported by distinct brain regions. The canonical perspective is that perceptual processing of visual information is supported by the ventral visual stream, whereas long-term declarative memory is supported by the medial temporal lobe. However, this modular framework cannot account for the increasingly large body of evidence that reveals a role for early visual areas in long-term recognition memory and a role for medial temporal lobe structures in high-level perceptual processing. In this article, we review relevant research conducted in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. We conclude that the evidence is largely inconsistent with theoretical proposals that draw sharp functional boundaries between perceptual and memory systems in the brain. Instead, the weight of the empirical findings is best captured by a representational-hierarchical model that emphasizes differences in content, rather than in cognitive processes within the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe.", "generated_text": "This review examines the interplay between perception and memory processes in the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe, with a focus on the perirhinal cortex. Recent evidence challenges the traditional view of a clear distinction between perceptual and mnemonic functions in these brain regions. We synthesize findings from neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and lesion studies to propose an integrated model of perceptual-mnemonic processing along the ventral visual pathway. The perirhinal cortex emerges as a critical node, supporting both high-level object perception and recognition memory. We discuss how this region may resolve feature ambiguity in complex visual discriminations and contribute to familiarity-based recognition. Additionally, we explore the implications of this perceptual-mnemonic continuum for understanding cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative disorders affecting the medial temporal lobe. This integrated perspective offers new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual object processing and memory formation.", "label": 1}
