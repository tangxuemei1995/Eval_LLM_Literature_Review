{"grounding": "Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and particulate matter, with adsorbed organic and inorganic contaminants, to which exposure is lifelong. Epidemiological studies increasingly associate air pollution with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, findings supported by experimental animal models. This breadth of neurotoxicity across these central nervous system diseases and disorders likely reflects shared vulnerability of their inflammatory and oxidative stress\u2013based mechanisms and a corresponding ability to produce brain metal dyshomeo-stasis. Future research to define the responsible contaminants of air pollution underlying this neurotoxicity is critical to understanding mechanisms of these diseases and disorders and protecting public health.", "generated_text": "This review examines the neurotoxic effects of air pollution across different life stages, focusing on ultrafine particles and PM2.5. The study explores the relationship between air pollution exposure and the development of neurodevelopmental disorders in early life, as well as neurodegenerative diseases in later years. Particular attention is given to the role of brain metal dyshomeostasis in mediating these effects. The research synthesizes current evidence on the mechanisms by which air pollutants cross the blood-brain barrier, interact with neural tissues, and disrupt normal brain function. The findings highlight the urgent need for improved air quality standards and interventions to mitigate the long-term neurological impacts of air pollution on human health.", "label": 0}
