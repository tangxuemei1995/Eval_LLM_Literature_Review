{"grounding": "The actions of estrogens and related estrogenic molecules are complex and multifaceted in both sexes. A wide array of natural, synthetic, and therapeutic molecules target pathways that produce and respond to estrogens. Multiple receptors promulgate these responses, including the classical estrogen receptors of the nuclear hormone receptor family (estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2), which function largely as ligand-activated transcription factors, and the 7-transmembrane G protein\u2013coupled estrogen receptor, GPER, which activates a diverse array of signaling pathways. The pharmacology and functional roles of GPER in physiology and disease reveal important roles in responses to both natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds in numerous physiological systems. These functions have implications in the treatment of myriad disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. This review focuses on the complex pharmacology of GPER and summarizes major physiological functions of GPER and the therapeutic implications and ongoing applications of GPER-targeted compounds.", "generated_text": "The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has emerged as a crucial mediator of estrogen signaling, offering novel insights into the complex mechanisms of estrogen action. This review explores the molecular pharmacology of GPER and its potential therapeutic applications across various physiological systems. We examine the receptor's structure, signaling pathways, and interactions with both endogenous and synthetic ligands. The diverse roles of GPER in cancer, cardiovascular health, endocrine function, immunity, and metabolism are discussed, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target. Recent advances in developing GPER-selective agonists and antagonists have opened new avenues for drug discovery and personalized medicine. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of GPER in estrogen biology and its promising potential in treating a wide range of diseases, from hormone-dependent cancers to metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases.", "label": 1}
