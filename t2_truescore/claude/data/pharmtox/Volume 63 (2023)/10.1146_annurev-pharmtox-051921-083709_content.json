{"grounding": "After a traumatic childhood in Europe during the Second World War, I found that scientific research in Israel was a pleasure beyond my expectations. Over the last 65 year, I have worked on the chemistry and pharmacology of natural products. During the last few decades, most of my research has been on plant cannabinoids, the endogenous cannabinoids arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, and endogenous anandamide-like compounds, all of which are involved in a wide spectrum of physiological reactions. Two plant cannabinoids, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, are approved drugs. However, the endogenous cannabinoids and the anandamide-like constituents have not yet been well investigated in humans. For me, intellectual freedom\u2014the ability to do research based on my own scientific interests\u2014has been the most satisfying part of my working life. Looking back over the 91 years of my long life, I conclude that I have been lucky, very lucky, both personally and scientifically.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical review traces the author's journey through the fascinating realm of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid chemistry and pharmacology. The narrative begins with the discovery of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the two primary endocannabinoids, and explores their roles in various physiological processes. The author recounts the elucidation of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) structures, highlighting their distinct pharmacological properties and potential therapeutic applications. The review also delves into the identification and characterization of endocannabinoid-like compounds, shedding light on their diverse functions within the endocannabinoid system. Throughout the account, the author reflects on pivotal moments, collaborations, and breakthroughs that have shaped our understanding of cannabinoid science. This personal perspective offers unique insights into the evolution of the field and its impact on modern medicine and neuroscience.", "label": 0}
