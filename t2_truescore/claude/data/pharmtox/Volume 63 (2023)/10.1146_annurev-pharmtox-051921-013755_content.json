{"grounding": "Lysosomes play fundamental roles in material digestion, cellular clearance, recycling, exocytosis, wound repair, Ca2+ signaling, nutrient signaling, and gene expression regulation. The organelle also serves as a hub for important signaling networks involving the mTOR and AKT kinases. Electrophysiological recording and molecular and structural studies in the past decade have uncovered several unique lysosomal ion channels and transporters, including TPCs, TMEM175, TRPMLs, CLN7, and CLC-7. They underlie the organelle's permeability to major ions, including K+, Na+, H+, Ca2+, and Cl\u2212. The channels are regulated by numerous cellular factors, ranging from H+ in the lumen and voltage across the lysosomal membrane to ATP in the cytosol to growth factors outside the cell. Genetic variations in the channel/transporter genes are associated with diseases that include lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies with human genetics and channel activators suggest that lysosomal channels may be attractive targets for the development of therapeutics for the prevention of and intervention in human diseases.", "generated_text": "Lysosomes, once considered mere cellular waste disposal units, are now recognized as crucial signaling hubs involved in various physiological processes. This review focuses on lysosomal ion channels, particularly TPCs, TRPMLs, and TMEM175, exploring their roles in cellular function and potential as therapeutic targets. These channels regulate lysosomal pH, calcium signaling, and membrane potential, influencing processes such as autophagy, exocytosis, and nutrient sensing. Recent research has implicated lysosomal channel dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We discuss the current understanding of these channels' structure, function, and regulation, highlighting their importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, we examine the emerging evidence supporting lysosomal ion channels as druggable targets for treating neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage disorders. This review underscores the potential of targeting lysosomal channels for developing novel therapeutic strategies and identifies key areas for future research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
