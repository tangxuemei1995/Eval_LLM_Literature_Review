{"grounding": "In ligand bias different agonist drugs are thought to produce distinct signaling outputs when activating the same receptor. If these signaling outputs mediate therapeutic versus adverse drug effects, then agonists that selectively activate the therapeutic signaling pathway would be extremely beneficial. It has long been thought that \u03bc-opioid receptor agonists that selectively activate G protein\u2013 over \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways would produce effective analgesia without the adverse effects such as respiratory depression. However, more recent data indicate that most of the therapeutic and adverse effects of agonist-induced activation of the \u03bc-opioid receptor are actually mediated by the G protein\u2013dependent signaling pathway, and that a number of drugs described as G protein biased in fact may not be biased, but instead may be low-intrinsic-efficacy agonists. In this review we discuss the current state of the field of bias at the \u03bc-opioid receptor and other opioid receptor subtypes.", "generated_text": "Biased agonism, a phenomenon where ligands selectively activate specific signaling pathways downstream of a receptor, has emerged as a promising approach in drug discovery. This review focuses on the lessons learned from studies of opioid receptor agonists, which have been at the forefront of biased agonism research. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand bias at opioid receptors, particularly the differential activation of G protein and \u03b2-arrestin pathways. The potential therapeutic implications of biased agonism are discussed, including the development of analgesics with reduced side effects. We also address the challenges in quantifying and interpreting ligand bias, as well as the complexities of translating in vitro findings to in vivo efficacy. Finally, we highlight recent advances in structural biology and computational approaches that are enhancing our understanding of biased agonism at opioid receptors and guiding future drug design efforts.", "label": 1}
