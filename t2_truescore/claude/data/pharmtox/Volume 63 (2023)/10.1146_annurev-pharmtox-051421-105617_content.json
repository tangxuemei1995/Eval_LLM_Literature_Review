{"grounding": "Pharmacology and toxicology are part of a much broader effort to understand the relationship between chemistry and biology. While biomedicine has necessarily focused on specific cases, typically of direct human relevance, there are real advantages in pursuing more systematic approaches to characterizing how health and disease are influenced by small molecules and other interventions. In this context, the zebrafish is now established as the representative screenable vertebrate and, through ongoing advances in the available scale of genome editing and automated phenotyping, is beginning to address systems-level solutions to some biomedical problems. The addition of broader efforts to integrate information content across preclinical model organisms and the incorporation of rigorous analytics, including closed-loop deep learning, will facilitate efforts to create systems pharmacology and toxicology with the ability to continuously optimize chemical biological interactions around societal needs. In this review, we outline progress toward this goal.", "generated_text": "Zebrafish have emerged as a powerful and versatile model organism for in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology studies. This review explores the advantages of zebrafish as a scalable in vivo model, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between traditional in vitro assays and mammalian models. We discuss the unique features of zebrafish, including their rapid development, optical transparency, and genetic similarity to humans, which make them ideal for high-throughput screening and mechanistic studies. The review also examines recent advances in zebrafish-based assays for drug discovery, toxicity assessment, and disease modeling. Furthermore, we address the challenges and limitations of using zebrafish as an alternative model and provide insights into future directions for improving their predictive power and translational relevance. Overall, this review underscores the growing importance of zebrafish in accelerating drug development and toxicology research.", "label": 1}
