{"grounding": "A long-standing recognition that information from human genetics studies has the potential to accelerate drug discovery has led to decades of research on how to leverage genetic and phenotypic information for drug discovery. Established simple and advanced statistical methods that allow the simultaneous analysis of genotype and clinical phenotype data by genome- and phenome-wide analyses, colocalization analyses with quantitative trait loci data from transcriptomics and proteomics data sets from different tissues, and Mendelian randomization are essential tools for drug development in the postgenomic era. Numerous studies have demonstrated how genomic data provide opportunities for the identification of new drug targets, the repurposing of drugs, and drug safety analyses. With an increase in the number of biobanks that enable linking in-depth omics data with rich repositories of phenotypic traits via electronic health records, more powerful ways for the evaluation and validation of drug targets will continue to expand across different disciplines of clinical research.", "generated_text": "The integration of electronic health records (EHRs) and genomic data has emerged as a powerful approach for drug discovery. This review explores the synergistic potential of EHRs and genomics in identifying novel drug targets and repurposing existing medications. We discuss the application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) in leveraging large-scale EHR data to uncover genetic associations with disease phenotypes. Additionally, we examine the role of Mendelian randomization in establishing causal relationships between genetic variants and drug targets. The review highlights successful case studies where EHR-genomic integration has led to the discovery of promising drug candidates. Furthermore, we address the challenges and limitations of this approach, including data quality, privacy concerns, and the need for diverse population representation. Finally, we provide insights into future directions and the potential impact of EHR-genomic integration on personalized medicine and drug development pipelines.", "label": 1}
