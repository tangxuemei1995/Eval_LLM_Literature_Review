{"grounding": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are endogenous lipid mediators that are synthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during the acute phase or resolution phase of inflammation. Synthetic SPMs possess broad safety profiles and exhibit potent actions in resolving inflammation in preclinical models. Accumulating evidence in the past decade has demonstrated powerful analgesia of exogenous SPMs in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain. Furthermore, endogenous SPMs are produced by sham surgery and neuromodulation (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation). SPMs produce their beneficial actions through multiple G protein\u2013coupled receptors, expressed by immune cells, glial cells, and neurons. Notably, loss of SPM receptors impairs the resolution of pain. I also highlight the emerging role of SPMs in the control of itch. Pharmacological targeting of SPMs or SPM receptors has the potential to lead to novel therapeutics for pain and itch as emerging approaches in resolution pharmacology.", "generated_text": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have emerged as promising candidates for resolution pharmacology in the management of pain and itch. This review explores the neuroimmune modulatory effects of SPMs, particularly resolvins and neuroprotectins, on nociceptive sensory neurons and their potential to alleviate chronic pain and pruritus. We discuss the mechanisms by which SPMs interact with TRP channels and other molecular targets to attenuate neuronal hyperexcitability and inflammation. Recent preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of SPMs in various pain and itch models are examined, highlighting their potential as novel therapeutic agents. Additionally, we address the challenges and opportunities in translating SPM-based therapies from bench to bedside, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize their clinical application in pain and itch management.", "label": 1}
