{"grounding": "Early human life is considered a critical window of susceptibility to external exposures. Infants are exposed to a multitude of environmental factors, collectively referred to as the exposome. The chemical exposome can be summarized as the sum of all xenobiotics that humans are exposed to throughout a lifetime. We review different exposure classes and routes that impact fetal and infant metabolism and the potential toxicological role of mixture effects. We also discuss the progress in human biomonitoring and present possiblemodels for studying maternal\u2013fetal transfer. Data gaps on prenatal and infant exposure to xenobiotic mixtures are identified and include natural biotoxins, in addition to commonly reported synthetic toxicants, to obtain a more holistic assessment of the chemical exposome. We highlight the lack of large-scale studies covering a broad range of xenobiotics. Several recommendations to advance our understanding of the early-life chemical exposome and the subsequent impact on health outcomes are proposed.", "generated_text": "This review explores the concept of the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood, focusing on the complex mixture of xenobiotics and natural contaminants that can impact human health. We examine recent advances in human biomonitoring techniques and their application in assessing prenatal exposure to various chemicals. The role of the placenta as both a barrier and a potential source of exposure is discussed, highlighting its significance in fetal development. The review synthesizes current knowledge on the diverse range of chemicals that constitute the exposome, including environmental pollutants, pharmaceuticals, and dietary compounds. We also address the challenges in measuring and interpreting exposome data, particularly in the context of early life stages. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the potential long-term health effects of early chemical exposures and emphasizes the need for continued research in this critical area of environmental health.", "label": 1}
