{"grounding": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a chemically diverse group of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) that target the endocannabinoid system, triggering a plethora of actions (e.g., elevated mood sensation, relaxation, appetite stimulation) that resemble, but are more intense than, those induced by cannabis. Although some of these effects have been explored for therapeutic applications, anticipated stronger psychoactive effects than cannabis and reduced risk perception have increased the recreational use of SCs, which have dominated the NPS market in the United States and Europe over the past decade. However, rising SC-related intoxications and deaths represent a major public health concern and embody a major challenge for policy makers.\nHere, we review the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs. A thorough characterization of SCs\u2019 pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics is important to better understand the main mechanisms underlying acute and chronic effects of SCs, interpret the clinical/pathological findings related to SC use, and improve SC risk awareness.", "generated_text": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) have emerged as a significant public health concern, representing a diverse class of new psychoactive substances designed to mimic the effects of cannabis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs, focusing on their interaction with the endocannabinoid system and their potential for abuse. We examine the chemical structures, mechanisms of action, and metabolic pathways of various SC compounds, highlighting their increased potency and unpredictable effects compared to natural cannabinoids. The review also addresses the challenges in detection, regulation, and treatment of SC-related substance use disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the acute and chronic health risks associated with SC consumption, including cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric complications. This analysis underscores the urgent need for improved monitoring, prevention strategies, and targeted interventions to address the growing threat posed by synthetic cannabinoids in the landscape of drug abuse.", "label": 1}
