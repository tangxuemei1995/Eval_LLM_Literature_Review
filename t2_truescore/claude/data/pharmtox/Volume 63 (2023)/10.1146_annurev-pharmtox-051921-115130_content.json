{"grounding": "Apoptosis is central for the maintenance of health. In the immune system, apoptosis guarantees proper development of immune cells and shutdown of immune reactions by the coordinated elimination of activated immune cells. Limitation of the life span of granulocytes is important, as overactivation of these cells is associated with chronic inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Consequently, targeted induction of granulocyte apoptosis may be beneficial in the course of respective immune disorders. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids and monoclonal antibodies against IL-5R\u03b1 exert their function in part by triggering eosinophil apoptosis. Agonistic antibodies targeting Siglec-8 or death receptors are tested (pre)clinically. Moreover, a new class of inhibitors targeting antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins shows great promise for anticancer treatments. Because of their specificity and tolerable side effects, these so-called BH3 mimetics may be worthwhile to evaluate in inflammatory disorders. Here, we review past and recent data on pharmacological apoptosis induction of granulocytes and highlight respective therapeutic potential.", "generated_text": "Granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, play crucial roles in innate immunity and inflammation. However, dysregulation of granulocyte function and survival can contribute to various pathological conditions. This review explores the potential of pharmacologically induced granulocyte cell death as a therapeutic strategy for treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying granulocyte apoptosis and discuss how these pathways can be targeted by novel drug candidates. The review also compares the efficacy and specificity of granulocyte-targeted therapies with existing treatments that affect broader lymphocyte populations. Furthermore, we address the challenges and potential side effects associated with manipulating granulocyte survival, including the risk of compromising host defense. Finally, we highlight promising preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inducing granulocyte apoptosis in various disease models, paving the way for future targeted immunomodulatory therapies.", "label": 1}
