{"grounding": "The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are found in seafood, supplements, and concentrated pharmaceutical preparations. Prospective cohort studies demonstrate an association between higher intakes of EPA+DHA or higher levels of EPA and DHA in the body and lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and of cardiovascular mortality in the general population. The cardioprotective effect of EPA and DHA is due to the beneficial modulation of a number of risk factors for CVD. Some large trials support the use of EPA+DHA (or EPA alone) in high-risk patients, although the evidence is inconsistent. This review presents key studies of EPA and DHA in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD, briefly describes potential mechanisms of action, and discusses recently published RCTs and meta-analyses. Potential adverse aspects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in relation to CVD are discussed.", "generated_text": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-\u03c93-PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their potential cardiovascular benefits. This review examines the pros and cons of LC-\u03c93-PUFAs in cardiovascular health. While numerous studies have demonstrated their positive effects on reducing inflammation, improving lipid profiles, and potentially lowering the risk of cardiovascular events, conflicting evidence exists regarding their efficacy in preventing heart disease. Some research suggests that high doses of LC-\u03c93-PUFAs may increase the risk of atrial fibrillation in certain populations. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the sustainability of fish oil sources and potential contamination with environmental pollutants. This review aims to provide a balanced perspective on the current evidence surrounding LC-\u03c93-PUFAs and their role in cardiovascular health, highlighting both the potential benefits and limitations of their use.", "label": 1}
