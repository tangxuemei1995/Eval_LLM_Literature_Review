{"grounding": "Ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cellular metabolism to electrical activity in multiple tissues; their unique assembly as four Kir6 pore-forming subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits has resulted in a large armory of selective channel opener and inhibitor drugs. The spectrum of monogenic pathologies that result from gain- or loss-of-function mutations in these channels, and the potential for therapeutic correction of these pathologies, is now clear. However, while available drugs can be effective treatments for specific pathologies, cross-reactivity with the other Kir6 or SUR subfamily members can result in drug-induced versions of each pathology and may limit therapeutic usefulness. This review discusses the background to KATP channel physiology, pathology, and pharmacology and considers the potential for more specific or effective therapeutic agents.", "generated_text": "KATP channels, composed of Kir6.x and SURx subunits, play crucial roles in various physiological processes. Mutations in these subunits can lead to severe pathologies, including congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant\u00fa syndrome. This review explores recent advances in personalized therapeutics for KATP-dependent disorders. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions and the development of targeted therapies based on specific genetic mutations. The potential of pharmacological modulators, gene therapy approaches, and precision medicine strategies in treating KATP-related diseases is examined. Additionally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities in translating these personalized interventions from bench to bedside. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the future of tailored treatments for patients with KATP-dependent pathologies, emphasizing the importance of genetic profiling and individualized therapeutic approaches.", "label": 1}
