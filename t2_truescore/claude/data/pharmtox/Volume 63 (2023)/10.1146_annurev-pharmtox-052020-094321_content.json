{"grounding": "Modern antiretroviral therapy safely, potently, and durably suppresses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that, if left untreated, predictably causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which has been responsible for tens of millions of deaths globally since it was described in 1981. In one of the most extraordinary medical success stories in modern times, a combination of pioneering basic science, innovative drug development, and ambitious public health programming resulted in access to lifesaving, safe drugs, taken as an oral tablet daily, for most of the world. However, substantial challenges remain in the fields of prevention, timely access to diagnosis, and treatment, especially in pediatric and adolescent patients. As HIV-positive adults age, treating their comorbidities will require understanding the course of different chronic diseases complicated by HIV-related and antiretroviral toxicities and finding potential treatments. Finally, new long-acting antiretrovirals on the horizon promise exciting new options in both the prevention and treatment fields.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a comprehensive roadmap for achieving universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV/AIDS patients globally. The study analyzes current barriers to ART access and proposes strategies to overcome them, aligning with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. Key focus areas include improving HIV testing rates, enhancing linkage to care, and ensuring long-term adherence to treatment. The roadmap emphasizes the importance of health system strengthening, community engagement, and innovative service delivery models. It also addresses challenges related to drug resistance, immune reconstitution, and the need for sustainable funding mechanisms. By implementing these evidence-based interventions, the authors argue that universal ART coverage can be achieved, leading to significant reductions in HIV transmission rates and improved health outcomes for people living with HIV/AIDS. This roadmap provides a valuable framework for policymakers and healthcare professionals working towards ending the AIDS epidemic.", "label": 0}
