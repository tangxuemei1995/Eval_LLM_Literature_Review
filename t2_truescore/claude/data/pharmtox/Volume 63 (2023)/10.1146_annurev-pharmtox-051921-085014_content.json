{"grounding": "Leukotrienes are potent immune-regulating lipid mediators with patho-genic roles in inflammatory and allergic diseases, particularly asthma. These autacoids also contribute to low-grade inflammation, a hallmark of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, metabolic, and tumor diseases. Biosynthesis of leukotrienes involves release and oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid and proceeds via a set of cytosolic and integral membrane enzymes that are typically expressed by cells of the innate immune system. In activated cells, these enzymes traffic and assemble at the endoplasmic and perinuclear membrane, together comprising a biosynthetic complex. Here we describe recent advances in our molecular understanding of the protein components of the leukotriene-synthesizing enzyme machinery and also briefly touch upon the leukotriene receptors. Moreover, we discuss emerging opportunities for pharmacological intervention and development of new therapeutics.", "generated_text": "Leukotrienes, derived from arachidonic acid, play a crucial role in inflammatory processes and are implicated in various endemic diseases. This review examines the structural biology of key leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes and its application in structure-based drug design. Recent advancements in crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of these enzymes. We discuss how this structural information has facilitated the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting leukotriene pathways. The review highlights successful examples of structure-guided drug discovery, including inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene receptors. Additionally, we explore emerging strategies for modulating leukotriene biosynthesis and signaling, offering promising avenues for treating inflammatory disorders and related endemic diseases. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of structural biology in advancing leukotriene-targeted therapeutics.", "label": 1}
