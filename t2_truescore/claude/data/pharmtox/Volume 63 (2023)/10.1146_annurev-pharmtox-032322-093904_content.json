{"grounding": "The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, which comprises 22 structurally related proteins, plays diverse roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and metabolism. Among them, two classical members (FGF1 and FGF4) and two endocrine members (FGF19 and FGF21) are important regulators of whole-body energy homeostasis, glucose/lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of these FGFs for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Several genetically engineered FGF19 and FGF21 analogs with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties have been developed and progressed into various stages of clinical trials. These FGF analogs are effective in alleviating hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients, whereas their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects are mildand vary greatly in different clinical trials. This review summarizes recent advances in biopharmaceutical development of FGF-based therapies against obesity-related metabolic complications, highlights major challenges in clinical implementation, and discusses possible strategies to overcome these hurdles.", "generated_text": "Obesity and its associated metabolic complications pose significant health challenges worldwide. This review explores the potential of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-based pharmacotherapies as novel treatments for obesity-related metabolic disorders. We examine the role of FGFs in regulating energy homeostasis, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Recent advances in developing FGF analogs and agonistic antibodies targeting FGF receptors are discussed, highlighting their therapeutic potential. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of FGF-based interventions in improving insulin sensitivity, reducing body weight, and alleviating metabolic dysfunction are critically evaluated. Additionally, we address the challenges and limitations of current FGF-based approaches, including off-target effects and the need for optimized delivery methods. This review provides insights into the promising future of FGF-based protein therapeutics in combating obesity and its metabolic complications, emphasizing the importance of continued research and development in this field.", "label": 1}
