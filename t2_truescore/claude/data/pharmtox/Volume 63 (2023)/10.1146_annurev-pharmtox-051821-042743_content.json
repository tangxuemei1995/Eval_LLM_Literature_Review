{"grounding": "Chronic diseases that affect our society are made more complex by comorbidities and are poorly managed by the current pharmacology. While all present inflammatory etiopathogeneses, there is an unmet need for better clinical management of these diseases and their multiple symptoms. We discuss here an innovative approach based on the biology of the resolution of inflammation. Studying endogenous pro-resolving peptide and lipid mediators, how they are formed, and which target they interact with, can offer innovative options through augmenting the expression or function of pro-resolving pathways or mimicking their actions with novel targeted molecules. In all cases, resolution offers innovation for the treatment of the primary cause of a given disease and/or for the management of its comorbidities, ultimately improving patient quality of life. By implementing resolution pharmacology, we harness the whole physiology of inflammation, with the potential to bring a marked change in the management of inflammatory conditions.", "generated_text": "Resolution pharmacology represents a paradigm shift in treating inflammatory disorders, focusing on actively promoting the resolution phase rather than merely suppressing inflammation. This review explores the therapeutic potential of pro-resolving mediators, particularly annexin A1 and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), in innovative inflammation treatments. Annexin A1 peptides and SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in preclinical models of various inflammatory conditions. These endogenous molecules orchestrate the resolution process by modulating immune cell functions, reducing pro-inflammatory mediators, and promoting tissue repair. The development of stable analogs and targeted delivery systems has enhanced their therapeutic applicability. This emerging field offers promising avenues for treating chronic inflammatory diseases, potentially providing more effective and safer alternatives to traditional anti-inflammatory drugs. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms and optimize the clinical translation of these pro-resolving therapies.", "label": 1}
