{"grounding": "Antiplatelet therapy is used in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Clopidogrel is the most widely used antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitor in clinical practice. Genetic variation in CYP2C19 may influence its enzymatic activity, resulting in individuals who are carriers of loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles and thus have reduced active clopidogrel metabolites, high on-treatment platelet reactivity, and increased ischemic risk. Prospective studies have examined the utility of CYP2C19 genetic testing to guide antiplatelet therapy, and more recently published meta-analyses suggest that pharmacogenetics represents a key treatment strategy to individualize antiplatelet therapy. Rapid genetic tests, including bedside genotyping platforms that are validated and have high reproducibility, are available to guide selection of P2Y12 inhibitors in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the background and rationale for the role of a guided antiplatelet approach to enhance patient care.", "generated_text": "Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in optimizing antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This review explores the impact of genetic variations, focusing on the CYP2C19 gene, on the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet drugs. We examine the current evidence supporting guided antiplatelet therapy based on pharmacogenomic testing and its potential to improve clinical outcomes. The implementation of precision medicine approaches in antiplatelet treatment is discussed, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in translating pharmacogenetic knowledge into clinical practice. Additionally, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of genotype-guided therapy and its potential to reduce adverse events and improve patient outcomes. This review underscores the importance of pharmacogenetics in tailoring antiplatelet therapy to individual patients, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatment strategies in cardiovascular medicine.", "label": 1}
