{"grounding": "With the worldwide increase in life span, surgical patients are becoming older and have a greater propensity for postoperative cognitive impairment, either new onset or through deterioration of an existing condition; in both conditions, knowledge of the patient's preoperative cognitive function and postoperative cognitive trajectory is imperative. We describe the clinical utility of a tablet-based technique for rapid assessment of the memory and attentiveness domains required for executive function. The pathogenic mechanisms for perioperative neurocognitive disorders have been investigated in animal models in which excessive and/or prolonged postoperative neuroinflammation has emerged as a likely contender. The cellular and molecular species involved in postoperative neuroinflammation are the putative targets for future therapeutic interventions that are efficacious and do not interfere with the surgical patient's healing process.", "generated_text": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are increasingly recognized as significant complications in older surgical patients, with postoperative delirium being a common manifestation. This review explores experimental models and potential druggable targets for age-related PND. We examine the role of neuroinflammation in PND pathogenesis and discuss various cognitive assessment tools used to detect these disorders. The importance of perioperative brain health is emphasized, highlighting the need for comprehensive care pathways to mitigate PND risk. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PND have revealed promising therapeutic targets. By integrating findings from preclinical studies and clinical observations, this review aims to provide insights into novel strategies for preventing and managing age-related PND, ultimately improving outcomes for older surgical patients.", "label": 1}
