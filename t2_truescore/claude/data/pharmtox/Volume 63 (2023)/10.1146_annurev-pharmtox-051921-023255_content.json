{"grounding": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in pharmaceutical research and development has to date focused on research: target identification; docking-, fragment-, and motif-based generation of compound libraries; modeling of synthesis feasibility; rank-ordering likely hits according to structural and chemometric similarity to compounds having known activity and affinity to the target(s); optimizing a smaller library for synthesis and high-throughput screening; and combining evidence from screening to support hit-to-lead decisions. Applying AI/ML methods to lead optimization and lead-to-candidate (L2C) decision-making has shown slower progress, especially regarding predicting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology properties. The present review surveys reasons why this is so, reports progress that has occurred in recent years, and summarizes some of the issues that remain. Effective AI/ML tools to derisk L2C and later phases of development are important to accelerate the pharmaceutical development process, ameliorate escalating development costs, and achieve greater success rates.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in drug discovery has revolutionized the lead-to-candidate decision-making process. This review explores the applications of AI and ML in enhancing decision quality throughout the drug development pipeline. We examine how these technologies improve the efficiency and accuracy of computational toxicology, target identification, and lead optimization. The paper discusses the implementation of advanced algorithms for predicting drug-like properties, toxicity profiles, and potential off-target effects. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of AI-driven approaches on reducing attrition rates and accelerating the transition from lead compounds to viable drug candidates. The review also highlights the challenges and limitations of current AI/ML methodologies in drug discovery, emphasizing the need for continuous refinement and validation of these tools. Finally, we provide insights into future directions and potential breakthroughs in AI-assisted drug discovery processes.", "label": 0}
