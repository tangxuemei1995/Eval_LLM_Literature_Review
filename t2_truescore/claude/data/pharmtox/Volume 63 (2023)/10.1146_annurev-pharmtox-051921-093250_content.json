{"grounding": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to poor functional outcomes. Methods for assessment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are now well established. In addition, there has been increasing appreciation in recent years of the additional role of social cognitive impairment in driving functional outcomes and of the contributions of sensory-level dysfunction to higher-order impairments. At the neurochemical level, acute administration of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists reproduces the pattern of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia, encouraging the development of treatments targeted at both NMDAR and its interactome. At the local-circuit level, an auditory neurophysiological measure, mismatch negativity, has emerged both as a veridical index of NMDAR dysfunction and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in schizophrenia and as a critical biomarker for early-stage translational drug development. Although no compounds have yet been approved for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, several candidates are showing promise in early-phase testing.", "generated_text": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia that significantly impacts patients' functional outcomes. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, focusing on the roles of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission. We examine the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction in cognitive impairment and its potential as a therapeutic target. The review also discusses the utility of mismatch negativity, an event-related potential, as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we evaluate current pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches aimed at improving cognitive function in schizophrenia patients. By synthesizing recent findings in neurobiology and clinical research, this review provides insights into the complex relationship between cognitive impairment and schizophrenia, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies to enhance cognitive outcomes in this patient population.", "label": 1}
