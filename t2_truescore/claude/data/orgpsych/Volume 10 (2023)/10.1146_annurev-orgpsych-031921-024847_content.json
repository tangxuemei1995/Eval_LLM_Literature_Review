{"grounding": "Emerging from distinct perspectives, decent work and meaningful work are fundamental aspects of contemporary work with profound implications for individuals, organizations, and society. Decent work reflects basic workplace conditions to which all employees are entitled, whereas meaningful work is aspirational, reflecting significance at work. Following a conceptual and empirical review of scholarship on decent work and meaningful work, we draw from psychology of working theory to connect the two constructs. We argue that need satisfaction serves as the primary connector, and societal context, organizational conditions, and individual practices (in order of effectiveness) promote access to each type of work. We suggest future research directions broadening the available scholarship and methods used, promoting a focus on the complex intersection of macrolevel and psychological factors as well as interdisciplinary approaches in determining the quality of work, and engaging in intervention research to improve the way in which people live and work together.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concepts of decent work and meaningful work, examining their interrelationships and implications for employee well-being and organizational outcomes. Drawing from the psychology of working theory and job design literature, we analyze how work conditions contribute to the perception of decent and meaningful work. Through a comprehensive review of existing research and a meta-analysis of empirical studies, we identify key factors that influence the experience of meaningfulness in the workplace. Our findings suggest that decent work serves as a foundation for meaningful work, with job autonomy, skill variety, and social impact emerging as critical components. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates decent work and meaningful work, highlighting their combined effects on job satisfaction, engagement, and overall life satisfaction. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of work quality and provides practical implications for organizations seeking to enhance employee experiences and productivity.", "label": 1}
