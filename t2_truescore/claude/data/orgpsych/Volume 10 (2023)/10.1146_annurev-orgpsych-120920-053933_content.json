{"grounding": "Burnout refers to a work-related state of exhaustion and a sense of cynicism. In contrast, work engagement is a positive motivational state of vigor, dedication, and absorption. In this article, we discuss the concepts of burnout and work engagement and review their antecedents and consequences. We look back at our inaugural Annual Reviews article (Bakker et al. 2014) and highlight new empirical findings and theoretical innovations in relationship to job demands\u2013resources (JD-R) theory. We discuss four major innovations of the past decade, namely (a) the person \u00d7 situation approach of JD-R, (b) multilevel JD-R theory, (c) new proactive approaches in JD-R theory, and (d) the work\u2013home resources model. After discussing practical implications, we elaborate on more opportunities for future research, including JD-R interventions, team-level approaches, and demands and resources from other life domains.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews the Job Demands\u2013Resources (JD-R) theory, a decade after its initial conceptualization. The JD-R theory has become one of the most influential frameworks for understanding employee well-being and performance. We examine the theory's evolution, empirical support, and practical applications across various occupational settings. The review highlights how job demands and resources interact to predict burnout and work engagement, and how these processes influence organizational outcomes. Recent developments in the theory, including the incorporation of personal resources and proactive work behavior, are discussed. The paper also addresses criticisms and limitations of the JD-R theory, suggesting future research directions to enhance its explanatory power and practical utility in job design and organizational interventions.", "label": 1}
