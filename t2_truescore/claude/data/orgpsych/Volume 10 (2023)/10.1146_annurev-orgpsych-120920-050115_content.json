{"grounding": "The growth in virtual work is reshaping how leaders interface with their followers: Face-to-face interactions are increasingly being supplanted by virtual exchanges. To advance understanding of the implications of leading in this changing environment, we apply functional leadership theory to synthesize the findings of the virtual leadership research that has been conducted across different leadership perspectives and levels of analysis. We identify four traditional leadership functions that empirical research suggests have a stronger effect on follower need satisfaction in virtual settings and highlight a new function\u2014facilitate the use of technology\u2014as particularly germane to virtual leadership. Our review reveals several promising future research directions, including the need to examine the effects of leadership along the full spectrum of virtuality and to consider the unique challenges that leaders may encounter in hybrid work environments. We also outline important practical implications for organizations, leaders, and their followers.", "generated_text": "As organizations increasingly adopt remote and hybrid work models, the need for effective virtual leadership has become paramount. This study explores the challenges and opportunities associated with leading virtually, focusing on the dynamics of remote teams and dyadic relationships in digital environments. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical research, we examine the key competencies required for successful virtual leadership, including communication strategies, trust-building techniques, and performance management in distributed settings. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting traditional leadership approaches to suit the unique demands of virtual and hybrid work contexts. We also identify best practices for fostering engagement, collaboration, and productivity among geographically dispersed team members. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on virtual leadership and provides practical insights for managers navigating the complexities of leading in the digital age.", "label": 1}
