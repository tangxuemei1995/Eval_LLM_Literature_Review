{"grounding": "It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the workplace impact of race from the organizational psychology and organizational behavior literature. Topical coverage is spotty and the findings are fragmented, with little existing theory to orient, integrate, and reconcile them. Consequently, it is unsurprising that public opinion is highly divergent about the influence of race at work, and practitioners are left largely unassisted in determining evidence-based approaches to leveraging this form of difference among their personnel. To fill this void, we review the relevant findings through the lens of organizational justice to help clarify the impact of race on organizational experiences. Our findings suggest that justice indeed varies as a function of race, the magnitude of differences depends on the type of justice, and there are several potentially fruitful areas for additional inquiry.", "generated_text": "This review examines the intersection of race and organizational justice in workplace settings, addressing the critical question of whether justice is truly colorblind. By synthesizing existing literature on racial disparities and organizational justice theories, we explore how perceptions of fairness and equity differ across racioethnic groups. The analysis reveals persistent disparities in experiences of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice among minority employees. Factors contributing to these differences include implicit bias, structural inequalities, and cultural variations in justice expectations. The review also highlights the potential of organizational justice frameworks to mitigate workplace discrimination and promote inclusivity. We conclude by identifying gaps in current research and proposing future directions for investigating the complex relationship between race and organizational justice, emphasizing the need for more diverse and culturally sensitive approaches to workplace fairness.", "label": 1}
