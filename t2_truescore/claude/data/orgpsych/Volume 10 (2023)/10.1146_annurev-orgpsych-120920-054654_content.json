{"grounding": "Over the past decade, hundreds of studies have been published on employee voice and silence. In this review, I summarize that body of work, with an emphasis on the progress that has been made in our understanding of when and why employees choose to speak up or remain silent, as well as the individual and organizational implications of these choices. I identify underexplored issues, limitations in how voice has been conceptualized and studied, and promising avenues for future research. Although there has been notable progress in our knowledge of voice and silence, numerous key questions remain, and there are opportunities for the literature on voice to adopt a broader view of that construct. One of the objectives of this review is to motivate and guide research that will address those questions and explore that broader view.", "generated_text": "This review examines the evolution of employee voice and silence research over the past decade. We synthesize key findings and theoretical advancements in understanding why employees choose to speak up or remain silent in organizational settings. The paper explores the antecedents, processes, and consequences of voice and silence, highlighting the roles of individual differences, leadership styles, and organizational climate. We discuss emerging trends, including the impact of digital communication technologies and remote work on voice behaviors. The review also addresses methodological developments and identifies critical gaps in the literature. By integrating diverse perspectives, we propose a comprehensive framework for future research on employee voice and silence. This synthesis contributes to our understanding of upward communication, proactive behavior, and information sharing in contemporary workplaces.", "label": 1}
