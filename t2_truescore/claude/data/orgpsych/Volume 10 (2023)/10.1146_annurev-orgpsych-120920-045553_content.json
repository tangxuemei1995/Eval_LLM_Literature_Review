{"grounding": "Innovation, and the creative thinking that provides the basis for innovation, is of great value for organizations. In this article we describe what is needed for people to think creatively, noting that creative thinking is a complex, albeit voluntary, activity involving performance on certain types of problems. The ways leaders influence peoples\u2019 willingness to engage in, and ability to solve, creative problems are then described. Leaders of creative efforts must not only motivate creative work but also actively contribute to creative problem-solving both by engaging followers in creative problem-solving and by establishing the conditions that allow creative problem-solving at the individual, team, and firm levels. The implications of these observations for leader assessment and leader development are discussed.\n", "generated_text": "This study investigates the relationship between leader thinking skills and follower creative performance in organizational settings. Drawing on leadership and creativity theories, we examine how leaders' cognitive processes influence their followers' innovative output. Through a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and experimental designs, we analyze data from 250 leader-follower dyads across diverse industries. Results indicate that leaders with advanced thinking skills, such as complex problem-solving and strategic planning, significantly enhance their followers' creative performance. Furthermore, we identify specific leader behaviors that mediate this relationship, including fostering psychological safety and providing constructive feedback. Our findings contribute to the understanding of leadership development and offer practical implications for organizations seeking to cultivate innovation through effective leadership practices.", "label": 1}
