{"grounding": "The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) has grown substantially over the past 40 years within organizational research and beyond. There have been many different developments in SEM that make it increasingly useful for a variety of data types, research designs, research questions, and research contexts in the organizational sciences. To give researchers a better understanding of how and why SEM is used, our article (a) presents a review of SEM applications within organizational research; (b) discusses SEM best practices; and (c) explores advanced SEM applications, including instrumental variable methods, latent variable interactions and nonlinear measurement models, multilevel SEM, cross-lagged panel models and dynamic structural equation models, and meta-analytic SEM. We conclude by discussing concerns and debates that are both methodological (i.e., cross-validation and regularization) and theoretical (i.e., understanding causal evidence) as they relate to SEM and its application in organizational research and beyond.", "generated_text": "Structural equation modeling (SEM) has become a cornerstone in organizational research, offering powerful tools for analyzing complex relationships among latent variables. This review examines the current state of SEM in organizational science, highlighting its strengths and limitations. We assess common practices in model specification, estimation, and fit evaluation, identifying areas where researchers often struggle or misapply techniques. Particular attention is given to the handling of latent interactions and the interpretation of model fit indices. We propose several recommendations to enhance the rigor and relevance of SEM applications, including improved reporting standards, increased emphasis on theory-driven model development, and greater consideration of alternative models. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in SEM, such as Bayesian approaches and multilevel modeling, and their potential to address longstanding challenges in organizational research. This review aims to guide researchers towards more effective and meaningful use of SEM in advancing organizational theory and practice.", "label": 1}
