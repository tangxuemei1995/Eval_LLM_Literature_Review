{"grounding": "There is no situation where leadership is more important than during a crisis, and yet crisis leadership is a relatively underdeveloped field. This article explores what we know and what remains unknown about crisis leadership. We begin with an overview of what crises are, including different types and key dynamics of crises. We then review four leadership theories that offer insights into crisis leadership before elucidating five key competencies for crisis leadership. Three distinct avenues for future research are proposed, including exploring the distinctions and intersections of crisis leadership and crisis management, the cross-national and intercultural implications for leading through crises, and the role of ethics in leading well through crisis. Crises are increasingly frequent and complex, warranting a concerted effort to research, teach, and develop good crisis leadership.", "generated_text": "This study explores the critical role of crisis leadership in navigating complex and unpredictable situations. By examining the dynamics of crises and the competencies required for effective leadership during turbulent times, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and developing crisis leadership skills. Through a systematic review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key attributes and strategies that enable leaders to successfully manage crises, including adaptability, communication, decision-making under pressure, and emotional intelligence. Our findings highlight the importance of proactive crisis preparation and the development of specific crisis leadership competencies. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on crisis management and offers practical insights for organizations and leaders seeking to enhance their crisis response capabilities in an increasingly volatile global environment.", "label": 1}
