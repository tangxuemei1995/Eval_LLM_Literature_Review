{"grounding": "Individual and team creativity and innovation are essential for organizational effectiveness and success. The typology we developed in 2014 has stimulated much research in the past decade. We review this body of work and structure our article around the four quadrants described in our typology. We then revisit and update the eight research recommendations we proposed previously, identifying rich opportunities for developing theory and conceiving empirical studies. Finally, we highlight four desirable directions that help to chart the path for conducting frame-breaking research and accelerating theoretical breakthroughs.\n", "generated_text": "This review examines the dynamic interplay between actors (individuals and teams) and their contexts in fostering creativity and innovation. We synthesize recent research on person-context and team-context interactions, highlighting the complex and reciprocal nature of these relationships. Our analysis reveals that contextual factors, such as leadership styles, organizational climate, and resource availability, significantly influence creative outcomes. Simultaneously, individual and team characteristics shape how actors perceive and respond to their environments. We identify key gaps in current understanding and propose future research directions to advance our knowledge of the actor-context dynamics in creativity and innovation processes.", "label": 0}
