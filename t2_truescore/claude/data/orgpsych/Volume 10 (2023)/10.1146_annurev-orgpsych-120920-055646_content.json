{"grounding": "We review the research on the psychology of entrepreneurship of the last decade. We focus on two key topics in entrepreneurship research: action and process. Combining action and process in a model of the psychology of entrepreneurship, we present the action theory process model of entrepreneurship and use it as a guiding framework for the review. We discuss theories of action, such as effectuation/causation, bricolage, theory of planned behavior, and action theory. Furthermore, we adopt a process perspective to discuss antecedents of actions in terms of cognition, motivation, and emotion and how they develop during the entrepreneurial process. The process perspective considers recursive relationships and dynamic changes in actions and their antecedents over time. We conclude that the action theory process model is a useful starting point to explain the psychological dynamics of entrepreneurship.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the psychological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, focusing on the interplay between action and process. Drawing from action theory, we examine how entrepreneurs navigate uncertainty and resource constraints through bricolage and effectuation. The study investigates the cognitive processes that drive entrepreneurial decision-making, highlighting the role of heuristics and biases in opportunity recognition and evaluation. Additionally, we delve into the motivational factors that propel individuals to pursue entrepreneurial ventures, considering both intrinsic and extrinsic drivers. The paper also addresses the impact of emotions on entrepreneurial behavior, exploring how affect influences risk perception and resilience. By synthesizing these psychological perspectives, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the entrepreneurial mindset and its implications for successful venture creation and growth.", "label": 1}
