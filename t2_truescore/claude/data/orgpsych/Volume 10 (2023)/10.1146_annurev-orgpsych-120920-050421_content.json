{"grounding": "Environmental sustainability has become an ethical and strategic imperative for organizations, and more and more employees are interested, encouraged, or instructed to act in environmentally sustainable ways. Consequently, organizational scholars have increasingly studied individual-level antecedents of employee pro-environmental or employee green behavior (EGB). We argue that, to advance this literature and to inform effective interventions, research should investigate how EGB, as a compound performance domain, is associated with antecedents and consequences at multiple levels (i.e., individual, team, work context, organization, society). Accordingly, we pursue three interrelated goals with this review. We first present a comprehensive review of research on EGB, including definitions, theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. Second, we develop an integrative conceptual model of EGB as the core of organizational environmental sustainability. Third, we conclude with recommendations for future theory development and methodological improvements, as well as practical implications for employees, leaders, and human resource management.", "generated_text": "This study explores the critical role of employee green behavior (EGB) in fostering environmentally sustainable organizations. Drawing from environmental psychology and organizational behavior literature, we examine how individual ecological behaviors contribute to broader organizational sustainability goals. Through a comprehensive review of existing research, we identify key factors influencing EGB, including personal values, organizational culture, and leadership support. Our findings suggest that organizations can significantly enhance their environmental performance by promoting and facilitating EGB among their workforce. We propose a conceptual framework that integrates individual, organizational, and societal factors to explain the emergence and maintenance of EGB. Additionally, we discuss practical implications for managers and policymakers, highlighting strategies to cultivate a pro-environmental organizational culture. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on environmental sustainability in the workplace and provides valuable insights for creating more ecologically responsible organizations.", "label": 0}
