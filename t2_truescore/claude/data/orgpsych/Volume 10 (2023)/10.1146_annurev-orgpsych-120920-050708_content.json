{"grounding": "Some assert that noise (i.e., unwanted variance) is the most neglected yet most important source of error in judgment. We suggest that this problem was discovered nearly 100 years ago in the area of personnel selection and that a century of selection research has shown that noise can be demonstrably reduced by structuring the process (i.e., decomposing the component parts, agreeing on standards, and applying those standards consistently) and by aggregating judgments independently. Algorithms can aid significantly in this process but are often confused with methods that, in their current form, can substantially increase noise in judgment (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning).", "generated_text": "This paper examines the concept of noise in workplace judgments, drawing insights from a century of personnel selection research. We explore how unwanted variance in decision-making processes can significantly impact organizational outcomes, from hiring decisions to strategic forecasting. By analyzing historical trends and contemporary studies in judgment and decision making, we identify key sources of noise and their effects on workplace efficiency. The paper proposes evidence-based strategies for reducing noise, including standardized assessment methods, structured interviews, and decision support systems. Our findings suggest that by minimizing noise, organizations can enhance the accuracy and consistency of their judgments, leading to improved personnel selection, more accurate forecasting, and better strategic decision making.", "label": 0}
