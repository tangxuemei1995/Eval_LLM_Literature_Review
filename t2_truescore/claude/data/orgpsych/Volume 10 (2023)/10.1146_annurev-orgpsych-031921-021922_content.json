{"grounding": "Meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for integrating findings from the research literature and building statistical models to explore trends and inconsistencies in the research base. Meta-analysis starts with a process for translating results from each study into an effect size that represents all findings in a common metric. Statistical models are then applied to estimate the mean, variance, and moderators of effect size. This article explores several key decision points in conducting a meta-analysis, including issues in obtaining a common metric, accounting for psychometric artifacts, and choosing an appropriate statistical model. It provides recommendations for choosing among alternate approaches and reporting results to ensure transparency.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive guide explores the methodological options available for conducting meta-analyses in organizational research. We review key concepts such as validity generalization, effect size estimation, and research synthesis techniques. The paper discusses various approaches to addressing psychometric artifacts and their impact on meta-analytic results. We examine statistical models for combining effect sizes, including fixed-effect and random-effects models, and provide guidance on selecting appropriate methods based on research objectives and data characteristics. Additionally, we address common challenges in meta-analysis, such as publication bias and heterogeneity, offering strategies for mitigation. This guide aims to enhance researchers' understanding of meta-analytic techniques and improve the quality of synthesized evidence in organizational studies.", "label": 1}
