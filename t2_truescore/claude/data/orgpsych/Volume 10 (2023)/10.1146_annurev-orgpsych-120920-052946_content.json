{"grounding": "Technology has changed the way that organizational researchers obtain participants for their research studies. Although technology has facilitated the collection of large quantities of data through online platforms, it has also highlighted potential data quality issues for many of our samples. In this article, we review different sampling techniques, including convenience, purposive, probability-based, and snowball sampling. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each approach to help organizational researchers choose the most appropriate sampling techniques for their research questions. We identify best practices that researchers can use to improve the quality of their samples, including reviewing screening techniques to increase the quality of online sampling. Finally, as part of our review we examined the sampling procedures of all empirical research articles published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in the past 5 years, and we use observations from these results to make conclusions about the lack of methodological and sample diversity in organizational research, the overreliance on a few sampling techniques, the need to report key aspects of sampling, and concerns about participant quality.", "generated_text": "This paper examines recent innovations in sampling techniques for organizational research, focusing on improving the appropriateness and quality of samples. As online data collection becomes increasingly prevalent, researchers face new challenges in ensuring sample representativeness and data integrity. We review emerging strategies to address issues such as insufficient effort responding and participant dishonesty in online samples. The study explores advanced sampling methods, including adaptive sampling designs and respondent-driven sampling, which can enhance sample diversity and reduce bias. Additionally, we discuss the implementation of data quality checks and validation techniques to identify and mitigate low-quality responses. The paper also considers ethical implications and best practices for using these innovative sampling approaches. By synthesizing current literature and presenting case studies, we provide practical recommendations for researchers to optimize their sampling strategies and improve the overall quality of organizational research. This work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on research methodology and offers valuable insights for scholars seeking to enhance the rigor and generalizability of their studies.", "label": 0}
