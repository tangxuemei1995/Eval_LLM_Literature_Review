{"grounding": "Amino acid dysregulation has emerged as an important driver of disease progression in various contexts. l-Serine lies at a central node of metabolism, linking carbohydrate metabolism, transamination, glycine, and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism to protein synthesis and various downstream bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways. l-Serine is produced locally in the brain but is sourced predominantly from glycine and one-carbon metabolism in peripheral tissues via liver and kidney metabolism. Compromised regulation or activity of l-serine synthesis and disposal occurs in the context of genetic diseases as well as chronic disease states, leading to low circulating l-serine levels and pathogenesis in the nervous system, retina, heart, and aging muscle. Dietary interventions in preclinical models modulate sensory neuropathy, retinopathy, tumor growth, and muscle regeneration. A serine tolerance test may provide a quantitative readout of l-serine homeostasis that identifies patients who may be susceptible to neuropathy or responsive to therapy.", "generated_text": "Serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes and has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its implications in health and disease. This review explores the sources and sinks of serine in human metabolism, focusing on its interconversion with glycine and its involvement in one-carbon metabolism. We examine the metabolic flux of serine in different tissues and discuss its importance in neurotransmitter synthesis, protein production, and cellular proliferation. Furthermore, we investigate the emerging evidence linking serine metabolism to neurological disorders, diabetes, and cancer. By integrating data from metabolomics studies and clinical research, we provide insights into the potential therapeutic applications of serine supplementation and the modulation of serine biosynthesis pathways in treating various pathological conditions.", "label": 1}
