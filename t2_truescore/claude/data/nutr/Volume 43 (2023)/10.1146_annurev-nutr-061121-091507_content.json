{"grounding": "Gluconeogenesis is a critical biosynthetic process that helps maintain whole-body glucose homeostasis and becomes altered in certain medical diseases. We review gluconeogenic flux in various medical diseases, including common metabolic disorders, hormonal imbalances, specific inborn genetic errors, and cancer. We discuss how the altered gluconeogenic activity contributes to disease pathogenesis using data from experiments using isotopic tracer and spectroscopy methodologies. These in vitro, animal, and human studies provide insights into the changes in circulating levels of available gluconeogenesis substrates and the efficiency of converting those substrates to glucose by gluconeogenic organs. We highlight ongoing knowledge gaps, discuss emerging research areas, and suggest future investigations. A better understanding of altered gluconeogenesis flux may ultimately identify novel and targeted treatment strategies for such diseases.", "generated_text": "Gluconeogenesis, a critical metabolic pathway for glucose production, plays a pivotal role in various metabolic diseases. This review explores the dysregulation of gluconeogenic flux in conditions such as insulin resistance, hormone imbalances, and enzyme deficiencies. We examine the intricate interplay between gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling, highlighting how alterations in this pathway contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of hormonal imbalances on gluconeogenic flux and their implications for metabolic homeostasis. The review also investigates the consequences of enzyme deficiencies in key gluconeogenic steps and their effects on glucose metabolism. Finally, we explore the emerging role of altered gluconeogenesis in cancer metabolism, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for metabolic interventions in oncology.", "label": 1}
