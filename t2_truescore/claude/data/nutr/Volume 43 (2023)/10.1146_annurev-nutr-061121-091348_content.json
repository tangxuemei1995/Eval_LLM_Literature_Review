{"grounding": "Together, loss- and gain-of-function experiments have identified the bone-derived secreted molecule osteocalcin as a hormone with a broad reach in rodents and primates. Following its binding to one of three receptors, osteocalcin exerts a profound influence on various aspects of energy metabolism as well as steroidogenesis, neurotransmitter biosynthesis and thereby male fertility, electrolyte homeostasis, cognition, the acute stress response, and exercise capacity. Although this review focuses mostly on the regulation of energy metabolism by osteocalcin, it also touches on its other functions. Lastly, it proposes what could be a common theme between the functions of osteocalcin and between these functions and the structural functions of bone.", "generated_text": "Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, has emerged as a multifunctional molecule with far-reaching implications beyond skeletal health. This review explores the diverse roles of osteocalcin, focusing on its undercarboxylated form and its impact on energy metabolism and danger response. Recent studies have revealed osteocalcin's involvement in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and fat metabolism. Additionally, its function as a danger repellent has been uncovered, highlighting its potential in stress response mechanisms. The complex interplay between bone and other organ systems through osteocalcin signaling underscores the importance of this hormone in maintaining overall physiological balance. This review synthesizes current knowledge and identifies areas for future research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
