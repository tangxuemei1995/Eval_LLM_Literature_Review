{"grounding": "Pregnancy entails a large negative balance of iron, an essential micronutrient. During pregnancy, iron requirements increase substantially to support both maternal red blood cell expansion and the development of the placenta and fetus. As insufficient iron has long been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, universal iron supplementation is common practice before and during pregnancy. However, in high-resource countries with iron fortification of staple foods and increased red meat consumption, the effects of too much iron supplementation during pregnancy have become a concern because iron excess has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we address physiologic iron homeostasis of the mother, placenta, and fetus and discuss perturbations in iron homeostasis that result in pathological pregnancy. As many mechanistic regulatory systems have been deduced from animal models, we also discuss the principles learned from these models and how these may apply to human pregnancy.", "generated_text": "Iron homeostasis during pregnancy is a complex process involving maternal, placental, and fetal regulatory mechanisms. This review explores the intricate interplay between these systems, focusing on the role of hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism. Maternal iron requirements increase dramatically during pregnancy to support fetal growth and development. The placenta acts as a crucial interface, regulating iron transfer from mother to fetus through various transporters and receptors. Fetal iron homeostasis is tightly controlled to ensure proper organ development and prevent toxicity. Maternal iron deficiency and inflammation can significantly impact this delicate balance, potentially leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is essential for developing targeted interventions to prevent iron-related complications during pregnancy. This review synthesizes current knowledge on iron homeostasis during pregnancy, highlighting the importance of maintaining optimal iron status for both maternal and fetal health.", "label": 1}
