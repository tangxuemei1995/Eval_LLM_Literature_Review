{"grounding": "Riboflavin, in its cofactor forms flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), plays fundamental roles in energy metabolism, cellular antioxidant potential, and metabolic interactions with other micronutrients, including iron, vitamin B6, and folate. Severe riboflavin deficiency, largely confined to low-income countries, clinically manifests as cheilosis, angular stomatitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and severe anemia with erythroid hypoplasia. Subclinical deficiency may be much more widespread, including in high-income countries, but typically goes undetected because riboflavin biomarkers are rarely measured in human studies. There are adverse health consequences of low and deficient riboflavin status throughout the life cycle, including anemia and hypertension, that could contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. This review considers the available evidence on causes, detection, and consequences of riboflavin deficiency, ranging from clinical deficiency signs to manifestations associated with less severe deficiency, and the related research, public health, and policy priorities.", "generated_text": "Riboflavin deficiency, a prevalent nutritional concern, has far-reaching implications for human health. This review explores the etiology and clinical consequences of riboflavin deficiency, focusing on its assessment through the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac). We examine the current dietary reference intakes for riboflavin and their adequacy in preventing deficiency. The study investigates the association between riboflavin status and various health outcomes, particularly hypertension and anemia. Our findings suggest that riboflavin deficiency may contribute to the development of hypertension through impaired nitric oxide synthesis and antioxidant capacity. Additionally, we discuss the role of riboflavin in erythropoiesis and its potential impact on anemia. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of maintaining adequate riboflavin status and proposes areas for future research to elucidate the full spectrum of riboflavin's physiological roles and clinical significance.", "label": 1}
