{"grounding": "Modernization of society from a rural, hunter-gatherer setting into an urban and industrial habitat, with the associated dietary changes, has led to an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic and additional noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. However, while dietary sciences have been rapidly evolving to meet these challenges, validation and translation of experimental results into clinical practice remain limited for multiple reasons, including inherent ethnic, gender, and cultural interindividual variability, among other methodological, dietary reporting\u2013related, and analytical issues. Recently, large clinical cohorts with artificial intelligence analytics have introduced new precision and personalized nutrition concepts that enable one to successfully bridge these gaps in a real-life setting. In this review, we highlight selected examples of case studies at the intersection between diet\u2013disease research and artificial intelligence. We discuss their potential and challenges and offer an outlook toward the transformation of dietary sciences into individualized clinical translation.", "generated_text": "This study explores the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in unraveling complex diet-disease relationships through a series of case studies. As precision nutrition gains prominence, AI techniques, particularly neural networks, offer unprecedented capabilities in analyzing vast datasets to identify intricate connections between dietary patterns and health outcomes. The research examines how machine learning algorithms can integrate diverse data sources, including genomics, metabolomics, and microbiome profiles, to generate personalized nutritional recommendations. Case studies demonstrate AI's potential in predicting disease risk based on dietary habits, optimizing nutrient intake for specific health conditions, and uncovering novel food-health interactions. The findings highlight AI's capacity to revolutionize nutritional science by enabling more accurate, individualized dietary interventions. This work underscores the transformative impact of AI in advancing personalized nutrition strategies and paves the way for more effective disease prevention and management through tailored dietary approaches.", "label": 1}
