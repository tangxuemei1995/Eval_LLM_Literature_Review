{"grounding": "Childhood undernutrition is a major global health burden that is only partially resolved by nutritional interventions. Both chronic and acute forms of child undernutrition are characterized by derangements in multiple biological systems including metabolism, immunity, and endocrine systems. A growing body of evidence supports a role of the gut microbiome in mediating these pathways influencing early life growth. Observational studies report alterations in the gut microbiome of undernourished children, while preclinical studies suggest that this can trigger intestinal enteropathy, alter host metabolism, and disrupt immune-mediated resistance against enteropathogens, each of which contribute to poor early life growth. Here, we compile evidence from preclinical and clinical studies and describe the emerging pathophysiological pathways by which the early life gut microbiome influences host metabolism, immunity, intestinal function, endocrine regulation, and other pathways contributing to child undernutrition. We discuss emerging microbiome-directed therapies and consider future research directions to identify and target microbiome-sensitive pathways in child undernutrition.", "generated_text": "Child undernutrition remains a global health challenge, with complex underlying factors. This review explores the critical role of host-microbiome interactions in child undernutrition, focusing on stunting and wasting. Recent advances in microbiome research have revealed significant alterations in the gut microbial composition and function of malnourished children. These disruptions in the microbiome, characterized by reduced diversity and altered metabolic capabilities, contribute to impaired nutrient absorption, immune dysfunction, and compromised growth. We discuss the bidirectional relationship between malnutrition and the microbiome, examining how dietary deficiencies impact microbial communities and how dysbiosis exacerbates nutritional deficits. Additionally, we highlight potential interventions targeting the microbiome, including probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiota-directed complementary foods, as promising strategies to ameliorate undernutrition. Understanding these host-microbiome interactions provides new insights into the pathophysiology of child undernutrition and opens avenues for innovative therapeutic approaches to combat this pervasive global health issue.", "label": 1}
