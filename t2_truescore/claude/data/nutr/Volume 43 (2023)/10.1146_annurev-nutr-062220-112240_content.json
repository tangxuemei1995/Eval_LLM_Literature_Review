{"grounding": "Fatty acid\u2013binding proteins (FABPs) are small lipid-binding proteins abundantly expressed in tissues that are highly active in fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Ten mammalian FABPs have been identified, with tissue-specific expression patterns and highly conserved tertiary structures. FABPs were initially studied as intracellular FA transport proteins. Further investigation has demonstrated their participation in lipid metabolism, both directly and via regulation of gene expression, and in signaling within their cells of expression. There is also evidence that they may be secreted and have functional impact via the circulation. It has also been shown that the FABP ligand binding repertoire extends beyond long-chain FAs and that their functional properties also involve participation in systemic metabolism. This article reviews the present understanding of FABP functions and their apparent roles in disease, particularly metabolic and inflammation-related disorders and cancers.", "generated_text": "Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of small, highly conserved cytoplasmic proteins that play crucial roles in lipid metabolism and transport. This review explores the diverse functions of mammalian FABPs, highlighting their importance in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and their involvement in various physiological processes. We discuss the tissue-specific expression patterns of different FABP isoforms and their unique roles in fatty acid uptake, intracellular trafficking, and signaling. Furthermore, we examine the emerging evidence linking dysregulation of FABPs to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes, as well as their potential involvement in cancer progression. Understanding the multifaceted nature of FABPs provides valuable insights into lipid metabolism and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases and cancer.", "label": 1}
