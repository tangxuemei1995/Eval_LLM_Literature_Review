{"grounding": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic fatty liver disease worldwide, particularly in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals. Currently, there are no therapies for NAFLD that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Herein, we examine the rationale for using \u03c93 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in NAFLD therapy. This focus is based on the finding that NAFLD severity is associated with a reduction of hepatic C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs. Because C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs are pleiotropic regulators of cell function, loss of C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs has the potential to significantly impact hepatic function. We describe NAFLD prevalence and pathophysiology as well as current NAFLD therapies. We also present evidence from clinical and preclinical studies that evaluated the capacity of C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs to treat NAFLD. Given the clinical and preclinical evidence, dietary C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFA supplementation has the potential to decrease human NAFLD severity by reducing hepatosteatosis and liver injury.", "generated_text": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing global health concern, characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. This review explores the potential therapeutic role of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in NAFLD management. We examine the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids modulate lipid metabolism, reduce inflammation, and attenuate fibrosis in the liver. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated promising results in using omega-3 supplementation to improve liver function and reduce steatosis in NAFLD patients. However, optimal dosage, duration, and long-term efficacy remain subjects of ongoing research. Additionally, we discuss the synergistic effects of omega-3 fatty acids with lifestyle modifications and other therapeutic approaches. This review highlights the need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to establish evidence-based guidelines for the use of omega-3 fatty acids in NAFLD treatment and prevention.", "label": 1}
