{"grounding": "The prenatal and early postnatal periods are stages during which dynamic changes and the development of the brain and gut microbiota occur, and nutrition is one of the most important modifiable factors that influences this process. Given the bidirectional cross talk between the gut microbiota and the brain through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA), there is growing interest in evaluating the potential effects of nutritional interventions administered during these critical developmental windows on gut microbiota composition and function and their association with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We review recent preclinical and clinical evidence from animal studies and infant/child populations. Although further research is needed, growing evidence suggests that different functional nutrients affect the establishment and development of the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis and could have preventive and therapeutic use in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, more in-depth knowledge regarding the effect of nutrition on the MGBA during critical developmental windows may enable the prevention of later neurocognitive and behavioral disorders and allow the establishment of individualized nutrition-based programs that can be used from the prenatal to the early and middle stages of life.", "generated_text": "The microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis plays a crucial role in early life development, influencing cognitive, behavioral, and physiological outcomes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the impact of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of this complex system. We explore the effects of key nutritional components, including milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation significantly influences the infant's gut microbiome composition and subsequent neurodevelopment. Breastfeeding provides a unique blend of bioactive compounds that support optimal gut colonization and brain development. For formula-fed infants, supplementation with MFGM, HMOs, and LC-PUFAs aims to mimic the benefits of human milk. Emerging evidence suggests that pre-, pro-, and postbiotics may offer additional support for the developing microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis. This review highlights the importance of early life nutrition in shaping long-term health outcomes and identifies areas for future research to optimize infant nutrition and neurodevelopment.", "label": 1}
