{"grounding": "As dietary guidance for populations shifts from preventing deficiency disorders to chronic disease risk reduction, the biology supporting such guidance becomes more complex due to the multifactorial risk profile of disease and inherent population heterogeneity in the diet\u2013disease relationship. Diet is a primary driver of chronic disease risk, and population-based guidance should account for individual responses. Cascading effects on evidentiary standards for population-based guidance are not straightforward. Precision remains a consideration for dietary guidance to prevent deficiency through the identification of population subgroups with unique nutritional needs. Reducing chronic disease through diet requires greater precision in (a) establishing essential nutrient needs throughout the life cycle in both health and disease; (b) considering effects of nutrients and other food substances on metabolic, immunological, inflammatory, and other physiological responses supporting healthy aging; and (c) considering healthy eating behaviors. Herein we provide a template for guiding population-based eating recommendations for reducing chronic diseases in heterogenous populations.", "generated_text": "Precision nutrition has gained significant attention as a promising approach to personalize dietary recommendations for chronic disease prevention. However, this review critically examines the current state of evidence supporting precision nutrition and its potential impact on public health policies. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding this field, we argue that the hype is outpacing the scientific evidence and rigorous standards required to inform population-wide dietary guidelines. We analyze the challenges in accounting for complex biological variations, environmental factors, and individual nutrient requirements when developing personalized nutrition strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing studies and the need for large-scale, long-term clinical trials to validate the efficacy of precision nutrition interventions. While acknowledging the potential benefits of tailored dietary advice, we emphasize the importance of maintaining evidence-based, population-level recommendations to ensure equitable public health outcomes. This review calls for a balanced approach that integrates precision nutrition research with established nutritional science to inform future dietary guidelines and policies.", "label": 1}
