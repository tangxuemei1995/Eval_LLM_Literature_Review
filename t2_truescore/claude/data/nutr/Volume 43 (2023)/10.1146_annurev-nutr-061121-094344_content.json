{"grounding": "Amino acids derived from protein digestion are important nutrients for the growth and maintenance of organisms. Approximately half of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids can be synthesized by mammalian organisms, while the other half are essential and must be acquired from the nutrition. Absorption of amino acids is mediated by a set of amino acid transporters together with transport of di- and tripeptides. They provide amino acids for systemic needs and for enterocyte metabolism. Absorption is largely complete at the end of the small intestine. The large intestine mediates the uptake of amino acids derived from bacterial metabolism and endogenous sources. Lack of amino acid transporters and peptide transporter delays the absorption of amino acids and changes sensing and usage of amino acids by the intestine. This can affect metabolic health through amino acid restriction, sensing of amino acids, and production of antimicrobial peptides.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intricate relationship between intestinal amino acid transport and metabolic health, focusing on the impact of protein restriction and digestion on epithelial cell function. We examine the various membrane transport mechanisms involved in amino acid absorption and their regulation in response to dietary changes. The role of specific amino acid transporters in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and modulating nutrient sensing is discussed. Additionally, we investigate how alterations in amino acid availability affect metabolic processes throughout the body, including glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure. The review also highlights recent findings on the interplay between the gut microbiome and amino acid metabolism, and its implications for overall health. Understanding these complex interactions may provide new insights into the development of targeted nutritional interventions for metabolic disorders and the optimization of protein intake for improved health outcomes.", "label": 0}
