{"grounding": "Precise dietary assessment is critical for accurate exposure classification in nutritional research, typically aimed at understanding how diet relates to health. Dietary supplement (DS) use is widespread and represents a considerable source of nutrients. However, few studies have compared the best methods to measure DSs. Our literature review on the relative validity and reproducibility of DS instruments in the United States [e.g., product inventories, questionnaires, and 24-h dietary recalls (24HR)] identified five studies that examined validity (n = 5) and/or reproducibility (n = 4). No gold standard reference method exists for validating DS use; thus, each study's investigators chose the reference instrument used to measure validity. Self-administered questionnaires agreed well with 24HR and inventory methods when comparing the prevalence of commonly used DSs. The inventory method captured nutrient amounts more accurately than the other methods. Reproducibility (over 3 months to 2.4 years) of prevalence of use estimates on the questionnaires was acceptable for common DSs. Given the limited body of research on measurement error in DS assessment, only tentative conclusions on these DS instruments can be drawn at present. Further research is critical to advancing knowledge in DS assessment for research and monitoring purposes.", "generated_text": "Despite widespread use of dietary supplements, significant gaps persist in our understanding of their impact on health and disease. This review critically examines the current state of dietary supplement research, focusing on methodological challenges in assessment and measurement. We highlight the limitations of existing dietary assessment tools, including issues of validity and reproducibility when applied to supplement use. The complex nature of supplement composition and consumption patterns introduces unique measurement errors that are often overlooked in nutritional studies. We discuss the need for standardized methodologies to accurately capture supplement intake and its effects on nutritional status. Additionally, we explore the challenges in separating the effects of supplements from those of dietary patterns and lifestyle factors. The review emphasizes the importance of developing more robust and tailored approaches for assessing supplement use in diverse populations. By addressing these methodological gaps, researchers can enhance the quality and reliability of dietary supplement studies, ultimately improving our understanding of their role in health and disease prevention.", "label": 1}
