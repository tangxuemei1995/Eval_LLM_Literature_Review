{"grounding": "The US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service leads the federal government in data development and research on food security in US households. Nutrition security is an emerging concept that, although closely related, is distinct from food security. No standard conceptualization or measure of nutrition security currently exists. We review the existing research on nutrition security and how it is informed by the more robust literature on food security and diet quality. Based on this review, we propose a conceptual framework for understanding nutrition security and its relationship to food security. We identify two constructs (healthy diets and nutritional status) and multiple subconstructs that form the basis of nutrition security. The proposed framework and corresponding constructs are intended to provide (a) understanding of how nutrition security arises and how it differs from food security, (b) background on why assessment and monitoring of nutrition security is important, and (c) guidance for a research agenda that will further clarify the meaning of nutrition security and its measurement.", "generated_text": "Nutrition security, encompassing both food access and nutritional quality, is crucial for promoting healthy dietary intake and positive health outcomes in the United States. This review examines current methods for assessing and monitoring nutrition security, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We analyze various indicators, including household food security surveys, dietary intake assessments, and biomarkers of nutritional status. The paper also explores the relationship between nutrition security and health outcomes, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach that considers both quantity and quality of food consumed. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in implementing effective monitoring systems and propose innovative strategies to improve nutrition security assessment. Our findings underscore the need for integrated, multidimensional approaches to better understand and address nutrition security issues. By enhancing assessment and monitoring techniques, policymakers and health professionals can develop more targeted interventions to improve dietary intake and overall health outcomes across diverse populations in the United States.", "label": 0}
