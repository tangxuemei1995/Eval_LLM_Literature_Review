{"grounding": "Whales are an extraordinary study group for questions about ecology and evolution because their combinations of extreme body sizes and unique foraging strategies are unparalleled among animals. From a terrestrial ancestry, whales evolved specialized oceanic foraging mechanisms that characterize the two main groups of living cetaceans: echolocation by toothed whales and bulk filter feeding by baleen whales. In toothed whales, lineage-specific increases in body size, enhanced diving capacity, and echolocation enable them to hunt the most abundant prey on the planet: deep-sea fish and cephalopods. Even greater body size increases, along with filter feeding and fasting capacity, permit large baleen whales to migrate long distances and exploit epipelagic patches of schooling prey, such as krill or fish, which are highly abundant but ephemeral. For both groups, prey abundance and distribution limit foraging performance, yielding divergent energetic niches that have shaped their convergent evolution to gigantism.", "generated_text": "This review explores the ecophysiological factors driving foraging behavior and evolution in cetaceans, with a focus on the interplay between body size, diving capabilities, and feeding strategies. We examine how scaling relationships influence diving capacity, metabolic rates, and prey capture efficiency across cetacean species. The evolution of gigantism in baleen whales is discussed in the context of their unique filter-feeding adaptations and the energetic trade-offs associated with their large size. We analyze the physiological limits of diving, including oxygen storage capacity and cardiovascular adaptations, and how these constraints shape foraging patterns. The review also considers the ecological implications of cetacean foraging strategies on marine ecosystems and food webs. By synthesizing current research on cetacean ecophysiology, we provide insights into the evolutionary pressures that have shaped these remarkable marine mammals and their pivotal roles in ocean ecosystems.", "label": 0}
