{"grounding": "Large Old World fruit bats (LOWFBs), species of Pteropus, Acerodon, and related genera of large bats in the pteropodid subfamily Pteropodinae, play important roles as agents of dispersal and pollination across the Paleotropics. LOWFBs are also collectively the most threatened group of bats in the world, with 71% of extant species assessed as threatened by International Union for Conservation of Nature. As highlighted here, contrary to other bats, the vast majority of LOWFBs face multiple simultaneous threats. Most importantly, biological and ecological traits, in particular life history characteristics, diet, movement, social ecology, and physiology, intensify threats and accelerate species declines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LOWFBs are to be considered keystone species and express concern about the erosion of this role and the cascading effects expected on native ecosystems. In response to this alarming situation, we advance general recommendations and identify overarching research and conservation actions.", "generated_text": "Large Old World fruit bats, particularly those of the genus Pteropus, are facing unprecedented threats to their survival. This review examines the primary causes of their decline, including habitat loss, hunting for bushmeat and traditional medicine, and the impacts of climate change. As keystone species and crucial seed dispersers, the potential extinction of these flying foxes could have far-reaching consequences for island ecosystems and biodiversity. We analyze the current conservation efforts and their effectiveness in protecting these species, with a focus on island habitats where many Pteropus species are endemic. The paper also explores the cultural significance of fruit bats in various societies and how this influences conservation strategies. Finally, we propose urgent measures needed to prevent the extinction of these ecologically vital species and maintain the health of tropical and subtropical ecosystems.", "label": 1}
