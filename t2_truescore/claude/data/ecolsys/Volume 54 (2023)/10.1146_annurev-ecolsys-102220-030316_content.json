{"grounding": "The way in which terrestrial organisms use the acoustic realm is fundamentally important and shapes behavior, populations, and communities, but how background acoustics, or noise, influence the patterns and processes in ecology is still relatively understudied. In this review, we summarize how background acoustics have traditionally been studied from the signaling perspective, discuss what is known from a receiver's perspective, and explore what is known about population- and community-level responses to noise. We suggest that there are major gaps linking animal physiology and behavior in noise to fitness; that there is a limited understanding of variation in hearing within and across species, especially in the context of real-world acoustic conditions; and that many puzzling responses to noise could be clarified with a community-level lens that considers indirect effects. Failing to consider variation in acoustic conditions, and the many ways organisms use and interact via this environmental dimension, risks a limited understanding of natural systems.", "generated_text": "Background acoustics play a crucial role in terrestrial ecology, influencing animal behavior, community dynamics, and ecosystem functioning. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the impacts of natural and anthropogenic soundscapes on terrestrial organisms. We explore how background acoustics affect animal communication, predator-prey interactions, and habitat selection through direct and indirect effects. The phenomenon of acoustic masking is examined, highlighting its consequences for species' fitness and community structure. We discuss the importance of considering hearing capabilities across taxa when assessing the ecological implications of soundscapes. Furthermore, we analyze how changes in background acoustics can cascade through ecosystems, altering community composition and ecological processes. By integrating insights from behavioral ecology, community ecology, and bioacoustics, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted role of background acoustics in terrestrial ecosystems and emphasizes the need for further research in this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
