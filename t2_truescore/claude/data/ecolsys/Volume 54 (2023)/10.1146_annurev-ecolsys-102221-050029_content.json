{"grounding": "Sky islands are unique geologic formations, home to populations of organisms that have weathered climate change since the Pleistocene. Long-term isolation and climatic differences between sky islands and adjacent mountain chains result in natural laboratories well suited for examining the direct effects of climate change. Here, we review the global sky island literature to examine how taxa have responded to climate change. Results show lineage formation, reduced genetic variation, and trait evolution across taxa driven by genetic drift and natural selection. These effects continue today due to ongoing habitat reduction and steep selective gradients on sky islands relative to mountain chains. Comparative studies and experimental manipulations are needed to build broad inference into how past climate change has shaped the structure and function of whole ecosystems. The next era of sky island research is poised to create a model for climate change responses and eco-evolutionary dynamics, with profound conservation implications.", "generated_text": "Sky islands, isolated mountain ranges surrounded by contrasting lowland environments, serve as natural laboratories for studying the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. This review synthesizes recent research on sky islands worldwide, highlighting their potential as predictive tools for understanding ecological and evolutionary responses to global warming. We examine how these unique ecosystems foster genetic variation, relict populations, and convergent evolution across diverse taxa. By comparing sky island communities at different elevations and latitudes, researchers can simulate future climate scenarios and forecast species' adaptations or potential extinctions. The isolation and environmental gradients characteristic of sky islands also provide insights into the mechanisms driving speciation and local adaptation. As climate change accelerates, sky islands offer valuable opportunities to study real-time evolutionary processes and inform conservation strategies for vulnerable montane ecosystems globally.", "label": 1}
