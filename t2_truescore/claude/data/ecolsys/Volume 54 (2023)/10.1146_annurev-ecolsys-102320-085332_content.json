{"grounding": "Over 70% of soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored at a depth greater than 20 cm belowground. A portion of this deep SOC actively cycles on annual to decadal timescales and is sensitive to global change. However, deep SOC responses to global change likely differ from surface SOC responses because biotic controls on SOC cycling become weaker as mineral controls predominate with depth. Here, we synthesize the current information on deep SOC responses to the global change drivers of warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. Most deep SOC responses can only be hypothesized because few global change studies measure deep soils, and even fewer global change experiments manipulate deep soils. We call on scientists to incorporate deep soils into their manipulations, measurements, and models so that the response of deep SOC can be accounted for in projections of nature-based climate solutions and terrestrial feedbacks to climate change.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the response of deep soil organic carbon (SOC) to global change factors, including climate change, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. We synthesize data from long-term field experiments and global observational studies to assess the sensitivity of deep SOC pools to these drivers. Our findings reveal that deep SOC is more responsive to global change than previously thought, with significant implications for carbon cycling and climate feedbacks. Elevated CO2 and warming generally increase deep SOC accumulation, while land use change can lead to substantial losses. However, the magnitude and direction of responses vary across ecosystems and soil types. We identify key mechanisms governing deep SOC dynamics and highlight critical knowledge gaps. This research underscores the importance of considering deep soil processes in Earth system models and carbon management strategies to improve predictions of future carbon-climate feedbacks.", "label": 1}
