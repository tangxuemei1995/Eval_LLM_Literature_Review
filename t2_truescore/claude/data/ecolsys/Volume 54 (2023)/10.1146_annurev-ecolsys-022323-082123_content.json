{"grounding": "Greenhouse gas emissions are warming the ocean with profound consequences at all levels of organization, from organismal rates to ecosystem processes. The proximate driver is an interplay between anthropogenic warming (the trend) and natural fluctuations in local temperature. These two properties cause anomalously warm events such as marine heatwaves to occur with increasing frequency and magnitude. Because warming and variance are not uniform, there is a large degree of geographic variation in temporal temperature variability. We review the underappreciated interaction between trend and variance in the ocean and how it modulates ecological responses to ocean warming. For example, organisms in more thermally variable environments are often more acclimatized and/or adapted to temperature extremes and are thus less sensitive to anthropogenic heatwaves. Considering both trend and variability highlights the importance of processes like legacy effects and extinction debt that influence the rate of community transformation.", "generated_text": "Marine ecosystems are experiencing unprecedented changes due to climate change, with increasing attention focused on extreme events like heatwaves. However, this study emphasizes the critical role of both smooth (mean) and spiky (variable) temperature changes in shaping ecological responses. We synthesize recent research on the impacts of temperature variability across different marine habitats and depths, highlighting the importance of considering both gradual shifts and acute fluctuations. Our findings reveal that organisms' responses to temperature changes are complex, influenced by factors such as depth refuges, acclimation potential, and legacy effects from previous exposures. We demonstrate that solely focusing on mean temperature changes may underestimate the true ecological impacts of climate change in marine systems. This work underscores the need for a more nuanced approach in climate change ecology, integrating both smooth and spiky temperature dynamics to better predict and manage marine ecosystem responses.", "label": 1}
