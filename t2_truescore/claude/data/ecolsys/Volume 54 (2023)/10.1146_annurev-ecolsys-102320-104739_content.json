{"grounding": "Seed dispersal, or the movement of diaspores away from the parent location, is a multiscale, multipartner process that depends on the interaction of plant life history with vector movement and the environment. Seed dispersal underpins many important plant ecological and evolutionary processes such as gene flow, population dynamics, range expansion, and diversity. We review exciting new directions that the field of seed dispersal ecology and evolution has taken over the past 40 years. We provide an overview of the ultimate causes of dispersal and the consequences of this important process for plant population and community dynamics. We also discuss several emergent unifying frameworks that are being used to study dispersal and describe how they can be integrated to provide a more mechanistic understanding of dispersal.", "generated_text": "Seed dispersal is a critical process in plant ecology, influencing plant population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of the causes and consequences of seed dispersal. We explore the various dispersal processes and syndromes, highlighting the complex interactions between plants and their dispersal agents. The generalized gravity framework and movement ecology paradigm are discussed as valuable tools for predicting dispersal patterns across landscapes. We introduce the concept of 'seedscape' to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of seeds, emphasizing its importance in shaping plant communities. Finally, we examine seed dispersal effectiveness and its implications for plant fitness, species coexistence, and ecosystem resilience. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the multifaceted nature of seed dispersal and its far-reaching ecological impacts.", "label": 1}
