{"grounding": "Plants and herbivores are remarkably variable in space and time, and variability has been considered a defining feature of their interactions. Empirical research, however, has traditionally focused on understanding differences in means and overlooked the theoretically significant ecological and evolutionary roles of variability itself. We review the literature with the goal of showing how variability-explicit research expands our perspective on plant\u2013herbivore ecology and evolution. We first clarify terminology for describing variation and then review patterns, causes, and consequences of variation in herbivory across scales of space, time, and biological organization. We consider how incorporating variability improves existing hypotheses and leads to new ones. We conclude by suggesting future work that reports full distributions, integrates effects of variation across scales, describes nonlinearities, and considers how stochastic and deterministic variation combine to determine herbivory distributions.", "generated_text": "Plant-herbivore interactions are fundamental to ecosystem dynamics, yet their variability remains poorly understood. This review synthesizes recent research on the factors influencing the diversity and intensity of plant-herbivore relationships. We explore how environmental conditions, plant defense mechanisms, and herbivore adaptations contribute to the observed variability in these interactions across different spatial and temporal scales. Our analysis reveals that plant-herbivore interactions are highly context-dependent, with factors such as climate change, habitat fragmentation, and species composition playing crucial roles in shaping these relationships. We also discuss the implications of this variability for ecosystem functioning, biodiversity conservation, and agricultural management. Understanding the complex nature of plant-herbivore interactions is essential for predicting and mitigating the impacts of global environmental change on ecological communities and ecosystem services.", "label": 1}
