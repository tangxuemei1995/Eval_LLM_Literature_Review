{"grounding": "Parenting is considered a key evolutionary innovation that contributed to the diversification and expansion of vertebrates. However, we know little about how such diversity evolved. Amphibians are an ideal group in which to identify the ecological factors that have facilitated or constrained the evolution of different forms of parental care. Among, but also within, the three amphibian orders\u2014Anura, Caudata, and Gymnophiona\u2014there is a high level of variation in habitat use, fertilization mode, mating systems, and parental sex roles. Recent work using broad phylogenetic, experimental, and physiological approaches has helped to uncover the factors that have selected for the evolution of care and transitions between different forms of parenting. Here, we highlight the exceptional diversity of amphibian parental care, emphasize the unique opportunities this group offers for addressing key questions about the evolution of parenting, and give insights into promising novel directions of research.", "generated_text": "Amphibians exhibit diverse parental care strategies, offering valuable insights into the evolution of parental care across vertebrates. This review examines the relationship between fertilization mode, terrestriality, and parental care in amphibians, focusing on protection, transport, and nutrition provided by parents. We explore how these factors have shaped parental sex roles and care patterns throughout amphibian evolution. Our analysis reveals that terrestrial adaptations and fertilization modes strongly influence the type and extent of parental care observed. External fertilization is often associated with paternal care, while internal fertilization tends to correlate with maternal care. Additionally, we discuss how environmental pressures and reproductive strategies have driven the development of unique care behaviors in various amphibian species. Understanding these patterns in amphibians can provide crucial perspectives on the broader evolution of parental care in vertebrates and inform conservation efforts for endangered amphibian populations.", "label": 1}
