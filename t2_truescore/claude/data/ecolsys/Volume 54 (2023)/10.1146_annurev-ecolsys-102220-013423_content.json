{"grounding": "Functional trait\u2013based mediation of animal invasions is only now developing, yet it is already showing as much promise as the approach has for plant invasion biology. Here, we provide a theory-founded examination of functional trait\u2013based ecology with respect to animal invasions, together with a review of the empirical research. Recent developments in the scaling of traits to ecosystems, along with the frameworks for invasion ecology, provide a powerful foundation for investigations. Despite growing empirical research in this field, interspecific comparisons incorporating comparative phylogenetic approaches remain uncommon, and those examining assemblages are even more so. Despite the importance of time since introduction, it is rarely included in studies. Broad environmental tolerances, life history traits associated with fast growth or greater reproduction, and in some cases, greater phenotypic plasticity of traits, mediate the success of animal alien species at various stages of invasion, although introduction effort remains one of the most important factors affecting success.", "generated_text": "Biological invasions pose significant threats to ecosystems worldwide, yet the mechanisms underlying successful invasions remain poorly understood. This study investigates the functional trait variation of invasive animal species along their invasion pathways, focusing on physiological and phenotypic plasticity. We synthesize data from multiple taxa across diverse ecosystems to identify common patterns in trait expression during different invasion stages. Our findings reveal that successful invaders often exhibit a suite of traits consistent with the 'ideal weed' concept, including rapid growth, high reproductive output, and broad environmental tolerance. Notably, we observe significant shifts in trait expression as species progress from introduction to establishment and spread, highlighting the importance of phenotypic plasticity in invasion success. This research provides valuable insights into the eco-evolutionary dynamics of biological invasions and offers potential avenues for improving prediction and management of invasive species.", "label": 1}
