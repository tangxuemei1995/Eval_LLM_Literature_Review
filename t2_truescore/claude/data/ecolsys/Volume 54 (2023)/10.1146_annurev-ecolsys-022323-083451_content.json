{"grounding": "Pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon of one gene or one mutation affecting multiple phenotypic traits. While the concept of pleiotropy is as old as Mendelian genetics, functional genomics has finally allowed the first glimpses of the extent of pleiotropy for a large fraction of genes in a genome. After describing conceptual and operational difficulties in quantifying pleiotropy and the pros and cons of various methods for measuring pleiotropy, I review empirical data on pleiotropy, which generally show an L-shaped distribution of the degree of pleiotropy (i.e., the number of traits affected), with most genes having low pleiotropy. I then review the current understanding of the molecular basis of pleiotropy. In the rest of the review, I discuss evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on advances in topics including the cost of complexity, regulatory versus coding evolution, environmental pleiotropy and adaptation, evolution of ageing and other seemingly harmful traits, and evolutionary resolution of pleiotropy.", "generated_text": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple traits, plays a crucial role in shaping evolutionary processes and disease susceptibility. This review explores the patterns and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on its impact on adaptation, antagonistic effects, and the cost of complexity. We examine how pleiotropic mutations can simultaneously affect multiple phenotypic traits, potentially leading to trade-offs in fitness. The concept of antagonistic pleiotropy is discussed in relation to aging and disease, where genes beneficial early in life may have detrimental effects later. We also investigate how pleiotropy contributes to the cost of complexity in organisms, potentially constraining evolutionary trajectories. Furthermore, we analyze the implications of pleiotropy for understanding genetic architecture and its role in complex diseases. This synthesis provides insights into the intricate relationship between genetic variation, phenotypic diversity, and evolutionary dynamics, highlighting the significance of pleiotropy in biological systems.", "label": 1}
