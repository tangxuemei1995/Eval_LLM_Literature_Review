{"grounding": "Terrestrial ecosystems encompass a vast and vital component of Earth's biodiversity and ecosystem services. The effect of increased anthropogenic dominance on terrestrial communities defines major challenges for ecosystem conservation, including habitat destruction and fragmentation, climate change, species invasions and extinctions, and disease spread. Here, we integrate fossil, historical, and present-day organismal and ecological data to investigate how conservation paleobiology provides deep-time perspectives on terrestrial organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems impacted by anthropogenic processes. We relate research tools to conservation outputs and highlight gaps that currently limit conservation paleobiology from reaching its full impact on conservation practice and management. In doing so, we also highlight how the colonial legacies of conservation biology and paleobiology confound our understanding of present-day biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and conservation outlooks, and we make recommendations for more inclusive and ethical practices moving forward.", "generated_text": "Conservation paleobiology offers a unique perspective on the long-term dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems, providing crucial insights for addressing contemporary biodiversity challenges. This review synthesizes recent advances in the field, exploring how fossil records illuminate the responses of terrestrial communities to past environmental stressors. We examine case studies that demonstrate the resilience and vulnerability of ecosystems over geological timescales, highlighting parallels with current Anthropocene pressures. The integration of paleontological data with modern ecological observations reveals patterns of community assembly, species interactions, and adaptive responses to climate change. These findings inform conservation strategies by identifying ecological baselines, predicting potential future scenarios, and guiding restoration efforts. We argue that incorporating deep-time perspectives into conservation planning is essential for developing effective, long-term approaches to preserving biodiversity and ecosystem function in the face of unprecedented global change.", "label": 1}
