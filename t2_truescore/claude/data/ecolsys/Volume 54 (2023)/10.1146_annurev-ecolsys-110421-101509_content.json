{"grounding": "The origin of life entails a continuum from simple prebiotic chemistry to cells with genes and molecular machines. Using life as a guide to this continuum, we consider how selection could promote increased complexity before the emergence of genes. Structured, far-from-equilibrium environments such as hydrothermal systems drive the reaction between CO2 and H2 to form organics that self-organize into protocells. CO2 fixation within protocells generates a reaction network with a topology that prefigures the universal core of metabolism. Positive feedback loops amplify flux through this network, giving a metabolic heredity that promotes growth. Patterns in the genetic code show that genes and proteins arose through direct biophysical interactions between amino acids and nucleotides in this protometabolic network. Random genetic sequences template nonrandom peptides, producing selectable function in growing protocells. This context-dependent emergence of information gives rise seamlessly to an autotrophic last universal common ancestor.", "generated_text": "The quest to understand life's origins remains a fundamental scientific challenge. This review explores how studying modern life can inform hypotheses about its emergence. We examine key processes in extant organisms, including CO2 fixation, metabolism, and the use of proton-motive force, as potential clues to primordial biochemistry. The role of FeS clusters in ancient metabolic pathways is discussed, along with the possibility of an 'RNA world' preceding modern genetic systems. We consider how protocells might have evolved, integrating metabolism with primitive replication mechanisms. The universality of the genetic code is examined as a potential window into early life. By synthesizing insights from diverse fields, including biochemistry, genetics, and geochemistry, we aim to bridge the gap between the chemistry of the early Earth and the complexity of modern life, offering new perspectives on life's origins.", "label": 1}
