{"grounding": "Responsive, nurturing parenting helps infants and young children develop secure, organized attachments as well as adequate self-regulatory capabilities. However, when parents experience challenges, they often have difficulty providing responsive, nurturing care. In this article, we provide an overview of interventions that have been developed to enhance parental responsiveness, and we discuss in detail three interventions that have particularly strong evidence of effectiveness. For each intervention, we describe the intervention's purported mechanism and the evidence supporting its engagement as well as proximal and distal intervention outcomes. The three interventions described vary in duration from 6 to 32 sessions on average and are variously implemented in the home or office. Nonetheless, all three interventions have strong evidence of effectiveness in engaging the intervention mechanism of parental responsiveness and show impressive effects on children's attachment and self-regulatory capabilities. We also discuss challenges in disseminating interventions in the community.", "generated_text": "This review examines the efficacy of early socioemotional interventions targeting the parent-infant relationship. We analyze a range of interventions designed to enhance parental sensitivity and promote secure attachment in infants. The literature reveals that interventions implemented during the first year of life can significantly improve parent-infant interactions and infant socioemotional outcomes. Effective programs typically involve video feedback, psychoeducation, and guided parent-infant activities. Short-term interventions show promise in enhancing parental sensitivity, while longer-term programs demonstrate more robust effects on infant attachment security. Notably, interventions tailored to high-risk populations, such as mothers with postpartum depression or families facing socioeconomic adversity, yield particularly encouraging results. This review underscores the importance of early intervention in shaping the foundation of socioemotional development and highlights the potential for preventive approaches in promoting healthy parent-infant relationships and long-term child well-being.", "label": 1}
