{"grounding": "This is an evaluative review of the field of prenatal substance exposure, with a focus on neurobiological and behavioral outcomes from infancy to young adulthood. We provide an overall evaluation of the state of the field and comment on current conceptual and methodological issues in need of attention. Although there are many studies of prenatal substance exposure, developmental frameworks that incorporate and reflect the lived experiences of children and families have seldom been employed in this field. In addition, although there are some common effects (e.g., on fetal growth) between major substances, there are also unique effects. Thus, we discuss the role of specific substances but note that polysubstance exposure is common, and models and methods used to date may not be sufficient to advance understanding of coexposure or polyexposure effects. We discuss these conceptual and methodological weaknesses and provide suggestions for future directions.", "generated_text": "Prenatal substance exposure represents a significant form of early adversity that can profoundly impact developmental outcomes. This review synthesizes current research on the effects of maternal substance use during pregnancy on fetal development and long-term child outcomes. We examine a range of substances, including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and opioids, and their differential impacts on cognitive, behavioral, and physiological development. The complex interplay between prenatal substance exposure and other forms of prenatal adversity is explored, highlighting the cumulative risks faced by exposed children. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in isolating the effects of specific substances due to polysubstance use and confounding environmental factors. The review emphasizes the need for early intervention strategies and supportive environments to mitigate the potential negative consequences of prenatal substance exposure and promote resilience in affected children.", "label": 1}
