{"grounding": "Four decades of research have examined the antecedents and consequences of behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament profile associated with heightened reactivity to sensory stimuli in infancy, reticence toward social cues in childhood, and the later emergence of social anxiety in adolescence. This review proposes that a two-hit model can supplement prior work to better understand these developmental pathways. Specifically, time limited experiences (\u201chits\u201d) centered in infancy and adolescence stress idiosyncratic BI-linked processes that uniquely trigger the developmental pathway from temperament to disorder. To illustrate, we focus on caregiver distress in infancy (including fetal development), social reorientation in adolescence, and their impact on malleable attentional and cognitive systems. These are developmental challenges and processes that go to the heart of the BI phenotype. Finally, we note open questions in this conceptual model, potential caveats, and needed future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the developmental origins of anxiety through a two-hit model of behavioral inhibition. We hypothesized that early behavioral inhibition in infancy, combined with later environmental stressors during adolescence, significantly increases the risk of anxiety disorders. Longitudinal data from 500 participants were collected from infancy through adolescence, assessing behavioral inhibition, environmental factors, and anxiety symptoms. Results revealed that individuals exhibiting high behavioral inhibition in infancy were more susceptible to anxiety when exposed to significant stressors during adolescence. This two-hit model explained 35% of the variance in anxiety outcomes, surpassing single-factor models. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both early temperamental traits and later environmental influences in understanding the etiology of anxiety disorders, potentially informing targeted interventions for at-risk individuals.", "label": 1}
