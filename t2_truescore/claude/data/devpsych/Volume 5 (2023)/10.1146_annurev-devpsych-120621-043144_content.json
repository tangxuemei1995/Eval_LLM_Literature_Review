{"grounding": "Although the intergenerational transmission of risk for depression is well documented, the mechanisms and moderators involved in this transmission of risk from depressed parents to their offspring are not clear. In this review, we discuss the progress that has been made over the past two decades in studying offspring of depressed parents and describe the maladaptive characteristics of these offspring in a diverse range of domains, including clinical, cognitive, and biological functioning. Despite recent advances in this area, there are unresolved questions that warrant further investigation involving the nature of risk transmission from parent to offspring, the specificity of findings to depression, and the role of factors that often accompany depression. We discuss these issues and offer directions for future research that we believe will move the field forward in gaining a better understanding of the relation between parental depression and altered psychobiological functioning in their offspring.", "generated_text": "This review examines the current understanding of the functioning of offspring of depressed parents, highlighting unresolved issues and future research directions. We synthesize findings from psychobiological studies, neuroimaging research on brain structure, and recent investigations into the impact of COVID-19 on this vulnerable population. The literature consistently demonstrates that children of depressed parents face increased risks for various psychological and developmental challenges. However, gaps remain in our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and long-term outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests alterations in brain structure and function may play a crucial role in intergenerational transmission of depression. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the landscape, potentially exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies, gene-environment interactions, and targeted interventions to mitigate risks and promote resilience in offspring of depressed parents.", "label": 1}
