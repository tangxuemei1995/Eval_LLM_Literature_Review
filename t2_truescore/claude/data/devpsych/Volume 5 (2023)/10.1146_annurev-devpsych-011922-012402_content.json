{"grounding": "Poverty is associated with changes in brain development and elevates the risk for psychopathology in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Although the field is rapidly expanding, there are methodological challenges that raise questions about the validity of current findings. These challenges include the interrelated issues of reliability, effect size, interindividual heterogeneity, and replicability. To address these issues, we propose a multipronged approach that spans short-, medium-, and long-term solutions, including changes to data pipelines along with more comprehensive data acquisition of environment, brain, and mental health. Additional suggestions are to use open science approaches, more robust statistical analyses, and replication testing. Furthermore, we propose increased integration between advanced analytical approaches using large samples and neuroscience models in intervention research to enhance the interpretability of findings. Collectively, these approaches will expand the application of neuroimaging findings and provide a foundation for eventual policy changes designed to improve conditions for children in poverty.", "generated_text": "This review examines the current state of research on the impact of poverty on brain development and mental health outcomes. We synthesize findings from neuroimaging studies and developmental psychopathology research to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms through which early-life adversity influences cognitive and emotional functioning. The paper highlights significant progress in understanding the neural correlates of poverty-related stress and their associations with psychopathology. However, we also address critical challenges in the field, including issues of replicability and reproducibility in neuroimaging studies. We discuss methodological limitations and propose strategies to enhance the robustness and generalizability of findings. Finally, we outline promising avenues for future research and interventions, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and translational efforts to mitigate the detrimental effects of poverty on brain development and mental health across the lifespan.", "label": 1}
