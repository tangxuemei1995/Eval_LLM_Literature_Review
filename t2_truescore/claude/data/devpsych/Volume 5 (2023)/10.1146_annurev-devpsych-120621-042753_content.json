{"grounding": "Research on early biomarkers and behavioral precursors of autism has led to interventions initiated during the infant period that could potentially change the course of infant brain and behavioral development in autism. This article integrates neuroscience and clinical perspectives to explore how knowledge of infant brain and behavioral development can inform the design of infant autism interventions. Focusing on infants \u226412 months, we review studies on behavioral precursors of autism and their neural correlates and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of infant autism interventions. We then consider how contemporary developmental social neuroscience theories of autism can shed light on the therapeutic strategies used in infant autism interventions and offer a new perspective that emphasizes improving child outcome and well-being by enhancing infant\u2013environment fit. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research that incorporates brain-based measures to inform individualized approaches to intervention and discuss ethical issues raised by infant autism interventions. Readers are referred to \nSupplemental Table 1\n for a glossary of terms used in this article.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intersection of developmental social neuroscience and infant autism interventions, offering a novel perspective on early detection and treatment strategies. By integrating recent advances in neuroimaging techniques with behavioral observations, researchers have gained unprecedented insights into the developing autistic brain. This paper synthesizes findings from longitudinal studies tracking neural and behavioral changes in high-risk infants, highlighting potential biomarkers for early autism diagnosis. We discuss how these neuroscientific insights inform the design and implementation of targeted interventions, emphasizing the importance of timing and specificity in treatment approaches. The review also examines the role of neuroplasticity in early intervention outcomes, suggesting that capitalizing on critical periods of brain development may enhance the efficacy of autism treatments. By adopting a developmental social neuroscience framework, this paper aims to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical practice, paving the way for more effective, personalized interventions for infants at risk for autism spectrum disorders.", "label": 1}
