{"grounding": "Life-course epidemiologists have developed sophisticated models for how exposures throughout life\u2014from gestation to old age\u2014shape health, sometimes years after the exposure occurred. The field, however, has been slow to adopt robust causal inference methods, including quasi-experimental designs. This reflects, at least in part, a tension between (a) study designs that maximize our ability to make causal claims and (b) exposure operationalizations that correspond with life-course theories. In this narrative review, we attempt to mitigate that tension. We first discuss the unique challenges for causal inference in life-course epidemiology. We then outline how quasi-experimental methods have already contributed to testing life-course theories, as well as the limitations of the quasi-experimental methods therein. We close with solutions that bridge the gap between modern developments in causal inference and life-course epidemiology, including redefined estimands to maximize public health impact; marginal structural and structural nested models; longitudinal instrumental variables approaches; leveraging new data linkages, such as with detailed residential histories; and triangulation across methods, including adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference.", "generated_text": "The fields of life-course epidemiology and causal inference have developed largely in parallel, leading to tensions in methodological approaches and interpretation of findings. This paper aims to bridge the divide between these two disciplines, highlighting their complementary strengths and potential for synergy. We review key concepts from both fields, including the importance of temporal ordering in life-course epidemiology and the emphasis on clearly defined interventions in causal inference. We propose a framework for integrating these approaches, leveraging natural experiments and advanced quantitative methods to strengthen causal claims in life-course research. The paper discusses challenges in harmonizing these perspectives, such as balancing long-term trajectories with point interventions, and offers solutions for researchers. By fostering collaboration between life-course epidemiologists and causal inference experts, we can enhance our understanding of complex health phenomena across the lifespan and inform more effective interventions and policies.", "label": 1}
