{"grounding": "Cognitive control is defined as a set of processes required for the organization of goal-directed thoughts and actions. It is linked to success throughout life including health, wealth, and social capital. How to support the development of cognitive control is therefore an intensively discussed topic. Progress in understanding how this critical life skill can be optimally scaffolded in long-lasting ways has been disappointing. I argue that this effort has been hampered by the predominant perspective that cognitive control is a competence or ability, the development of which is driven by predetermined maturational sequences. I propose that this traditional view needs to be overhauled in light of a growing body of evidence suggesting that cognitive control allocation is a both highly dynamic and rational process subject to cost\u2013benefit analyses from early in development. I discuss the ramifications of shifting our perspective on cognitive control mechanisms in relation to how we design interventions. I close by spelling out new avenues for scientific inquiry.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a rational account of cognitive control development in childhood, integrating theories of competence, maturation, and expected value. We propose that cognitive control abilities emerge through a dynamic interplay between neural maturation and experience-dependent learning, guided by the principle of maximizing expected value. Our model suggests that children's cognitive control improves as they learn to accurately predict the outcomes of their actions and optimize their behavior accordingly. We review evidence from neuroimaging and behavioral studies supporting this account, demonstrating age-related changes in prefrontal cortex activation and performance on cognitive control tasks. The framework explains developmental trajectories across various domains, including inhibitory control, task switching, and working memory. By considering cognitive control development as a rational process, we provide a unifying explanation for both gradual improvements and apparent discontinuities in children's executive functioning. This approach offers new insights into individual differences in cognitive control development and potential interventions to support children's executive skills.", "label": 0}
