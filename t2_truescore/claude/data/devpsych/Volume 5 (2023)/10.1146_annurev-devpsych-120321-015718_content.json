{"grounding": "In the United States, race is a critical factor in determining how children experience and navigate their social worlds. Developmental scientists have examined the complexities and nuances of how children develop an understanding of what race means for them and others as well as their attitudes toward people of other racial groups. We provide an overview of the literature on two approaches to understanding children's racial learning\u2014sociocognitive approaches, which focus on various aspects of children's understanding of, beliefs about, and attitudes toward race and racial groups, and socialization perspectives, which examine the messages that socialization agents transmit to children about race. Throughout, we highlight the ways in which the persistence of structural and interpersonal racism in the United States forms the background context for children's racial learning.", "generated_text": "This review integrates research on cognitive mechanisms and socialization processes underlying children's racial learning. We examine how children develop racial awareness, attitudes, and categorization abilities from early childhood through adolescence. Key cognitive factors include perceptual differentiation, essentialism, and in-group preferences. Socialization influences encompass parental ethnic-racial socialization practices, peer interactions, media exposure, and broader cultural messages. We highlight the interplay between cognitive development and social experiences in shaping racial cognition. Additionally, we consider how contextual factors like neighborhood demographics and school diversity impact racial learning trajectories. Gaps in current understanding and promising directions for future research are identified, including the need for more longitudinal studies and research on intersectionality. This integrative approach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex, multifaceted nature of children's racial learning across development.", "label": 1}
