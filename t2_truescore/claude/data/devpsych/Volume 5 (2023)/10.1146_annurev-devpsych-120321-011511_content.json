{"grounding": "Adolescence is a period of life that encompasses biological maturation and profound change in social roles. It is also a period associated with the onset of mental health problems. The field of developmental cognitive neuroscience has advanced our understanding of the development of the brain within its immediate social and cultural context. In a time of rising rates of mental health problems among adolescents across the globe, it is important to understand how the wider societal, structural, and cultural contexts of young people are impacting their biological and social-cognitive maturation. In this article, we review the landscape of youth mental health and brain development during adolescence and consider the potential role of brain research in understanding the effects of current social determinants of adolescent mental health, including socioeconomic inequality, city living, and eco-anxiety about the climate crisis.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a neuroecosocial perspective on adolescent development, integrating neuroscience, ecological systems theory, and social determinants of health. We explore how youth-led methods can enhance our understanding of adolescent mental health in the context of social inequalities, urbanicity, and the climate crisis. Drawing on recent literature, we examine the complex interplay between neurobiological changes, environmental factors, and societal challenges that shape adolescent well-being. Our analysis reveals that urbanization and climate-related stressors significantly impact youth mental health, particularly among marginalized populations. We argue that incorporating youth voices and participatory approaches in research and policy-making is crucial for developing effective interventions. This interdisciplinary framework offers new insights into the multifaceted nature of adolescent development and provides a foundation for addressing the unique challenges faced by today's youth in an increasingly complex world.", "label": 0}
