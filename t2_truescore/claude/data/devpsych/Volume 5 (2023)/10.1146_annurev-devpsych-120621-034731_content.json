{"grounding": "All human societies are permeated by collectively shared entities that govern daily social interactions and promote coordination and cooperation: norms. While the study of norm development is not new to developmental psychology, it has only recently been the target of an interdisciplinary wave of research using new methodologies and (often) complementary theoretical accounts to describe and explain the origins and potentially species-unique aspects of human norm psychology. Here we review recent developmental research showing that young children swiftly acquire and infer norms in a variety of social contexts. Moreover, children actively enforce these norms, even as unaffected bystanders, when third parties do things the wrong way. This research suggests that the foundations of human norm psychology can be found in early childhood. Deeper insights into the ontogenetic roots of norm psychology may contribute to understanding the evolutionary emergence of human cooperation and its maintenance in the contemporary world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the developmental trajectory of children's acquisition and application of social norms. Drawing on research in norm psychology and social-cognitive development, we investigate how young children internalize, understand, and enforce normative behaviors. Through a series of experiments with children aged 3-7, we examine their ability to distinguish between moral and conventional norms, their propensity to enforce norms on others, and their flexibility in applying norms across different contexts. Results indicate that children as young as 3 demonstrate a basic understanding of norms, with increasing sophistication in norm application and enforcement as they age. Our findings suggest that norm acquisition is a fundamental aspect of early social-cognitive development, playing a crucial role in children's moral reasoning and social interactions. This research contributes to our understanding of the origins of human normativity and has implications for theories of moral development and social learning.", "label": 1}
