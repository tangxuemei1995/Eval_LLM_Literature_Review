{"grounding": "Intimate relationships are hotbeds of emotion. This article presents key findings and current directions in research on couples\u2019 emotion regulation across adulthood as a critical context in which older adults not only maintain functioning but may also outshine younger adults. First, I introduce key concepts, defining qualities (i.e., dynamic, coregulatory, bidirectional, bivalent), and measures (i.e., self-report versus performance-based) of couples\u2019 emotion regulation. Second, I highlight a socioemotional turn in our understanding of adult development with the advent of socioemotional selectivity theory. Third, I offer a life-span developmental perspective on emotion regulation in couples (i.e., across infancy, adolescence and young adulthood, midlife, and late life). Finally, I present the idea that emotion regulation may shift from \u201cme to us\u201d across adulthood and discuss how emotion regulation in couples may become more important, better, and increasingly consequential (e.g., for relationship outcomes, well-being, and health) with age. Ideas for future research are then discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the dynamics of emotion regulation in romantic couples across different stages of adulthood. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined how emotion regulation strategies evolve and impact relationship satisfaction as couples age. Participants included 150 heterosexual couples, divided into three age groups: young (25-40), middle-aged (41-60), and older adults (61+). Data were collected through self-report questionnaires, daily diaries, and laboratory-based interaction tasks. Results revealed that older couples demonstrated more effective emotion regulation strategies, characterized by increased use of cognitive reappraisal and decreased reliance on suppression. Additionally, emotion co-regulation between partners became more synchronized with age, contributing to higher relationship satisfaction. These findings highlight the importance of considering developmental factors in understanding emotion regulation within romantic relationships and suggest potential avenues for interventions aimed at enhancing couple well-being across the lifespan.", "label": 0}
