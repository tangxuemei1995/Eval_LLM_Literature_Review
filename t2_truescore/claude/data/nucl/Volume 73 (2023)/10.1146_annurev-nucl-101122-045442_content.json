{"grounding": "Two topics have recently risen to prominence within the ongoing searches of beyond\u2013Standard Model effects in b and c decays: observables that test lepton flavor universality (LFU) and those that test lepton flavor violation (LFV). A coherent set of measurements suggests nonstandard LFU effects. General arguments relate LFU to LFV, and the observed size of the former gives hope of observable signals for the latter. We attempt a comprehensive discussion of both theoretical and experimental aspects of these tests. The main final message is that all the instruments necessary to fully establish the putative new effects are at hand, thanks to running experiments and their upgrades. Therefore, this subject stands a concrete chance of ushering in genuinely unexpected discoveries.", "generated_text": "This review explores recent developments in lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in b and c meson decays. We examine experimental results from the LHCb collaboration and other particle physics experiments, focusing on anomalies that challenge the Standard Model predictions. The observed deviations in rare B meson decays and ratios of semileptonic decay rates are discussed, along with their implications for new physics models. We analyze potential explanations involving leptoquarks, Z' bosons, and other beyond Standard Model scenarios. The interplay between LFV and LFUV is explored, highlighting the importance of these phenomena in probing the fundamental symmetries of particle interactions and uncovering new physics at the TeV scale.", "label": 1}
