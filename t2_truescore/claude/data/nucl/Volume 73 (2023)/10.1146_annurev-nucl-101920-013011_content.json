{"grounding": "This article is a pedagogical review of searches for long-lived particles at the LHC. It is primarily aimed at experimentalists and theorists seeking to initiate and/or deepen their research in this field. We cover the general theoretical motivation and some example models, the main experimental techniques employed in searches for long-lived particles, and some of the important subtleties involved in estimating signal efficiencies and background rates.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a comprehensive guide for hunting long-lived particles (LLPs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We review current experimental techniques, theoretical motivations, and potential signatures of LLPs. The study covers various detector subsystems and analysis strategies optimized for LLP searches. We discuss challenges in trigger systems, reconstruction algorithms, and background estimation methods specific to LLP scenarios, providing insights for future LHC experiments and upgrades.", "label": 1}
