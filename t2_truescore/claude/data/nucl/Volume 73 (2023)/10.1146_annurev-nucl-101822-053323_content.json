{"grounding": "Vector boson scattering is a key production process to probe the electroweak symmetry breaking of the Standard Model and is one of the most important topics of the physics program for the HL-LHC since it involves both self-couplings of vector bosons and their coupling with the Higgs boson. If the Higgs mechanism is not the sole source of electroweak symmetry breaking, the scattering amplitude deviates from the Standard Model prediction at high scattering energy. Moreover, deviations may be detectable even if a New Physics scale is higher than the reach of direct searches. In this review, the most recent experimental measurements of the production cross sections of vector boson pairs in association with two jets in proton\u2013proton collisions at  TeV at the LHC are reported, using data sets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors. Applications to searches for New Physics, as well as prospects for measuring the electroweak vector boson scattering processes with larger data samples, are also summarized.", "generated_text": "This study investigates boson-boson interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), focusing on diboson production and vector boson scattering processes. We analyze data from proton-proton collisions at \u221as = 13 TeV, collected by the ATLAS and CMS detectors. The research examines various final states, including WW, WZ, and ZZ pairs, as well as same-sign WW production. We present cross-section measurements and compare them with Standard Model predictions, finding good agreement within uncertainties. Additionally, we explore the sensitivity to anomalous triple and quartic gauge couplings, setting new constraints on potential deviations from the electroweak theory. Our results provide crucial insights into the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and test the Standard Model at the highest accessible energies. This work contributes to the ongoing search for new physics phenomena and improves our understanding of fundamental particle interactions at the TeV scale.", "label": 1}
