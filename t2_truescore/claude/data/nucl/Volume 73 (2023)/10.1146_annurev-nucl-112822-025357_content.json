{"grounding": "Ultra-high-energy (UHE, >0.1 PeV) \u03b3-ray astronomy is rapidly evolving into an expanding branch of \u03b3-ray astronomy with the surprising discovery of 12 PeVatrons and the detection of a handful of photons above 1 PeV. Nearly all known celestial object types that have emissions in the TeV band are found also to emit UHE photons. UHE \u03b3-rays have a well-defined horizon inside our Galaxy due to the absorption of infrared and cosmic microwave backgrounds in the Universe. In the last 30 years, traditional cosmic ray (CR) measurement techniques have enabled the detection of UHE \u03b3-rays and opened the last observation window. For leptonic sources, UHE radiation is in the deep Klein\u2013Nishina regime, which is largely suppressed. Therefore, UHE \u03b3-ray detection will be helpful in locating and identifying hadronic radiation sources, tracing the historic pursuit for the origin of CRs around the knee of the spectrum. The Crab Nebula is the focus of attention with measured photon emissions up to 1 PeV. In the absence of hadronic processes, these emissions may indicate the existence of an extreme accelerator of e\n+\ne\n\u2212. Use of CR extensive air shower detection techniques broadens the field of view of the source observations, enabling measurement of UHE radiation surrounding the sources. These observations can probe the particle propagation inside and outside the accelerators and the subsequent injection/escape into the interstellar medium.", "generated_text": "Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has emerged as a crucial field for understanding the most extreme astrophysical phenomena in the universe. This review explores recent advancements in detecting and studying gamma rays with energies exceeding 1 PeV, focusing on the search for cosmic PeVatrons and their role in cosmic ray acceleration. We discuss the latest observations from facilities such as the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), which has detected photons above 1 PeV from the Crab Nebula, providing compelling evidence for the existence of Galactic PeVatrons. The paper examines the techniques used in extensive air shower detection and the importance of muon content analysis in distinguishing gamma-ray-induced showers from hadronic backgrounds. We analyze the implications of these discoveries for our understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms in extreme environments and their connection to the origin of high-energy cosmic rays. Furthermore, we explore the challenges and future prospects in ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, including proposed next-generation observatories and their potential to revolutionize our knowledge of the high-energy universe. This review synthesizes current findings and outlines the path forward in this rapidly evolving field of astrophysics.", "label": 1}
