{"grounding": "The study of high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider has evolved from a qualitative understanding to the precise extraction of the properties of the quantum chromodynamics medium at extremely high temperatures. Jet quenching has offered unique insights into the transport properties of the quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP) created in these energetic collisions. Apart from medium modification of jets, jet-induced medium excitation constitutes another crucial aspect of jet\u2013QGP interaction and is indispensable in understanding the soft components of jets. We review recent theoretical and phenomenological developments regarding medium response to jet energy loss, including an overview of both weakly and strongly coupled approaches for describing the thermalization and propagation of energy deposition from jets, effects of medium response on jet observables, and exploration of its unique signatures in jet\u2013hadron correlations. Jet-induced medium excitation is shown to be an essential component in probing the in-medium dynamics of jets and a critical step toward precise extraction of the QGP properties.", "generated_text": "This study investigates medium response and jet\u2013hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, focusing on the formation and properties of quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP). We employ state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations coupled with jet energy loss models to explore jet quenching phenomena and jet-induced medium excitation. Our analysis reveals intricate patterns in jet\u2013hadron correlations, providing insights into the QGP's properties and its interaction with high-energy partons. We observe significant modifications to jet structures and hadron distributions compared to proton-proton collisions, indicating strong medium effects. The results demonstrate a complex interplay between jet energy loss, medium response, and collective flow, highlighting the importance of considering these factors in understanding QGP dynamics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to characterize the QGP and improve our understanding of the fundamental properties of matter under extreme conditions, with implications for both nuclear physics and early universe cosmology.", "label": 1}
