{"grounding": "In this article, I review scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model in which the top quark plays a special role. Models that aim at the stabilization of the weak scale are presented together with the specific phenomenology of partner states that are characteristic of this type of model. Further, I present models of flavor in which the top quark is singled out as a special flavor in the Standard Model. The flavor and collider phenomenology of these models is broadly presented. Finally, I discuss the possibility that dark matter interacts preferably with the top quark flavor and give an overview of the dark matter phenomenology of these scenarios, as well as collider and flavor signals.", "generated_text": "This review explores physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) associated with the top quark. We examine the top quark's potential role in addressing fundamental questions in particle physics, including the hierarchy problem, flavor physics, and dark matter. The unique properties of the top quark, such as its large mass and strong coupling to the Higgs boson, make it a prime candidate for probing New Physics scenarios. We discuss various BSM models that predict new particles or interactions involving the top quark, and their implications for current and future experiments. Additionally, we review recent experimental results and their constraints on BSM theories, highlighting the importance of top quark physics in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.", "label": 1}
