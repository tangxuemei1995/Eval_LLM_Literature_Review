{"grounding": "Applying dimensional analysis to the Higgs mass leads one to predict new physics interactions that generate this mass at a scale of the order of 1 TeV. The question of what these interactions could be is known as the gauge hierarchy problem. Resolving this question has been a central aim of particle physics for the past few decades. Traditional solutions introduce new particles with masses below 1 TeV, but that prediction is now challenged by experiment. In this article, I review recent new approaches to the problem that do not require new particles at the TeV mass scale. I first discuss the relaxation approach, whereby the Higgs mass is made dynamical and is small at the absolute minimum of its potential. I then discuss the historical approach, whereby details about inflation and/or reheating after inflation cause the Higgs mass to be smaller than otherwise expected. Finally, I discuss solutions that use conditional probability, whereby conditioning on the fact that the cosmological constant is small automatically leads one to select vacua where the Higgs mass is also small.", "generated_text": "The gauge hierarchy problem, a longstanding issue in particle physics, has gained renewed attention following the discovery of the Higgs boson. This paper presents novel approaches to address the problem, focusing on the concept of naturalness and the stability of the electroweak scale. We explore a range of theoretical frameworks, including relaxation mechanisms, that offer potential solutions to the hierarchy problem. Our analysis incorporates recent experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider and examines the implications for beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each proposed solution, considering their compatibility with existing observations and their predictive power for future experiments. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between these new approaches and other fundamental questions in particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter and the origin of neutrino masses. Our findings suggest promising avenues for further research and highlight the importance of continued experimental efforts in probing the electroweak scale.", "label": 1}
