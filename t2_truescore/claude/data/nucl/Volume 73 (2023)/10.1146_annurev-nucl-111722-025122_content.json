{"grounding": "Detection of low-energy nuclear recoil events plays a central role in searches for particle dark matter interactions with atomic matter and studies of coherent neutrino scatters. Precise nuclear recoil calibration data allow the responses of these dark matter and neutrino detectors to be characterized and enable in situ evaluation of an experiment's sensitivity to anticipated signals. This article reviews the common methods for detection of nuclear recoil events and the wide variety of techniques that have been developed to calibrate detector response to nuclear recoils. We summarize the main experimental factors that are critical for accurate nuclear recoil calibrations, investigate mitigation strategies for different backgrounds and biases, and discuss how the presentation of calibration results can facilitate comparison between experiments. Lastly, we discuss the challenges for future nuclear recoil calibration efforts and the physics opportunities they may enable.", "generated_text": "Low-energy nuclear recoils play a crucial role in dark matter and neutrino scattering experiments. This study presents novel techniques for detecting and calibrating these recoils in the context of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter searches. We employ neutron scattering as a proxy for low-energy nuclear recoils, developing a high-precision calibration method for sub-keV energy depositions. Our approach combines advanced detector technologies with sophisticated data analysis algorithms to achieve unprecedented sensitivity. We demonstrate improved discrimination between nuclear and electronic recoils, crucial for background reduction in rare event searches. The calibration technique is validated across multiple target materials relevant to current and future experiments. Our findings significantly enhance the ability to detect and characterize low-energy nuclear recoils, potentially leading to breakthroughs in dark matter detection and neutrino physics.", "label": 1}
