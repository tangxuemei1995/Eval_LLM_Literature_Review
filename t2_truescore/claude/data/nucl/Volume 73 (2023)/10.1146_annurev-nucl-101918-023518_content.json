{"grounding": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides an intense, high-quality source of neutrinos from pion decay at rest. This source was recently used for the first measurements of coherent elastic neutrino\u2013nucleus scattering (CEvNS) by the COHERENT Collaboration, which resulted in new constraints of physics beyond the Standard Model. The SNS neutrino source will enable further CEvNS measurements, exploration of inelastic neutrino\u2013nucleus interactions of particular relevance for understanding supernova neutrinos, and searches for accelerator-produced sub-GeV dark matter. Taking advantage of this unique facility, COHERENT's suite of detectors in Neutrino Alley at the SNS is accumulating more data to address a broad physics program at the intersection of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. This review describes COHERENT's first two CEvNS measurements, their interpretation, and the potential of a future physics program at the SNS.", "generated_text": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) has made significant strides in neutrino physics by observing coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). This process, predicted by the Standard Model but previously undetected, provides a unique window into neutrino interactions and has implications for supernova neutrino detection and dark matter searches. The experiment utilizes the intense, pulsed neutrino flux from the SNS to study CEvNS across multiple nuclear targets. Results from COHERENT have not only confirmed theoretical predictions but also opened new avenues for probing physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiment's success demonstrates the potential for using CEvNS as a tool for investigating fundamental particle physics and astrophysical phenomena, while also contributing to our understanding of neutrino properties and interactions at low energies.", "label": 1}
