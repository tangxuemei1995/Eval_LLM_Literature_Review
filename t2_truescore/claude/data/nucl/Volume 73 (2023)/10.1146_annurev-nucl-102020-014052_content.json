{"grounding": "We present a method for ordering two-nucleon interactions based upon their scaling with the number of QCD colors, N\n\nc\n, in the limit that N\n\nc\n becomes large. Available data in the two-nucleon sector show general agreement with this ordering, indicating that the method may be useful in other contexts where data are less readily available. However, several caveats and potential pitfalls can make the large-N\n\nc\n ordering fragile and/or vulnerable to misinterpretation. We discuss the application of the large-N\n\nc\n analysis to two- and three-nucleon interactions, including those originating from weak and BSM (beyond the Standard Model) interactions, as well as two-nucleon external currents. Finally, we discuss some open questions in the field.", "generated_text": "This study explores the implications of large-N_c QCD for the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction, bridging the gap between fundamental quark-gluon dynamics and effective field theories of nuclear forces. We investigate how the large-N_c expansion affects the hierarchy of two-nucleon interactions and extends to few-nucleon systems. Our analysis reveals that certain features of the NN potential, such as the dominance of central and spin-orbit forces, emerge naturally in the large-N_c limit. We also examine the scaling of various interaction terms with N_c and discuss their impact on nuclear structure calculations. These findings provide valuable insights into the connection between QCD and nuclear physics, potentially improving the predictive power of effective field theories in describing nuclear phenomena.", "label": 0}
