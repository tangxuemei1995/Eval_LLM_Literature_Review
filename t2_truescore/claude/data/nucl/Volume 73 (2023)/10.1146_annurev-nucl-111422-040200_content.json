{"grounding": "The cross sections for neutrino interactions with nucleons have been measured directly in accelerator experiments and through the zenith-angle and energy dependence of neutrino events at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Fluxes of high-energy neutrinos are produced at the Large Hadron Collider and by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. High-energy neutrinos also come from astrophysical and cosmic sources. The theory of neutrino interactions is reviewed. Current cross-section measurements and prospects for the future are discussed. The focus here is on neutrino interactions for energies larger than 1 TeV.", "generated_text": "This review explores the interactions of high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos, focusing on their implications for neutrino astrophysics. We examine the theoretical foundations and experimental observations of neutrino interactions across a wide energy spectrum, from GeV to EeV scales. The paper discusses various detection techniques, including underground detectors, ice-based observatories, and radio detection methods. We analyze the challenges in measuring neutrino cross-sections at extreme energies and their potential to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, we consider the role of neutrino interactions in understanding cosmic ray origins and the high-energy universe.", "label": 0}
