{"grounding": "We present a comprehensive review of purely leptonic and semileptonic decays of D\n0(+), \n\n, and charmed baryons (including \n\n, \u039e\nc\n, and \u03a9\nc\n). The precise studies of these decays help deepen our understanding and knowledge of quantum chromodynamics via measuring decay constants and form factors, and test the Standard Model through examining the unitarity of the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix and lepton flavor universality. We give an overview of the theoretical and experimental tools before discussing the recent progress. The data sets collected by the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) near the production thresholds of \n\n, \n\n, and \n\n offer important opportunities for studies of charm physics.", "generated_text": "This review summarizes recent advancements in the study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons. We discuss the latest experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, focusing on lattice quantum chromodynamics results for decay constants and form factors. The impact of these findings on the determination of Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix elements is examined. We highlight the role of charm physics in probing lepton flavor universality and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The review also addresses current challenges and future prospects in this field, emphasizing the importance of synergy between experimental and theoretical efforts to further our understanding of charm physics.", "label": 1}
