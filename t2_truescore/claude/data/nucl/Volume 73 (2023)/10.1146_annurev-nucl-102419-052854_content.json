{"grounding": "Since its start, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has helped advance both theory and experiment on the production and properties of the heaviest fundamental particle, the top quark. This review focuses on a selected set of measurements and associated searches for new physics, which have opened the door for unprecedented precision in this area of high-energy physics. Fundamental parameters of the theory such as mt\n, \u03b1S, Vtb\n, and yt\n are measured from top quark events with relative uncertainties that are smaller than 0.5%, 1.8%, 2%, and 10%, respectively, and that are expected to improve with more data, better experimental methods, and more accurate theory predictions. Several results, even if statistically limited, already significantly constrain the phase space of new physics: measurements of associated production with bosons, processes with four top quarks, and searches for rare decays, among others. It is expected that until the completion of the LHC program, top quark physics will keep providing unique insights regarding the consistency of the Standard Model and the energy scale of new physics.", "generated_text": "The top quark, discovered in 1995, remains a focal point of particle physics research due to its unique properties and potential connections to new physics. This review examines the current state of top quark physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and outlines future prospects. We discuss recent advancements in measuring top quark production cross sections, both in strong and electroweak interactions, and their implications for Standard Model precision tests. The top quark's role in Higgs boson physics is explored, highlighting its significance in constraining Yukawa couplings. We also review the search for beyond Standard Model phenomena in the top quark sector, including rare decays and potential new particles. The paper emphasizes the importance of improved theoretical predictions and experimental techniques in pushing the boundaries of top quark physics. Finally, we present an outlook on the exciting possibilities that future LHC runs and proposed colliders may offer in unraveling the mysteries surrounding the top quark.", "label": 1}
