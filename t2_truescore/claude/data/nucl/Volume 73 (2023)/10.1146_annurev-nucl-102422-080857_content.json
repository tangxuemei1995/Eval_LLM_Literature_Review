{"grounding": "Neutron captures produce the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron in the Universe. Beyond the classical slow (s) and rapid (r) processes, there is observational evidence for neutron-capture processes that operate at neutron densities in between, at different distances from the valley of \u03b2 stability. Here, we review the main properties of the s process within the general context of neutron-capture processes and the nuclear physics input required to investigate it. We describe massive stars and asymptotic giant branch stars as the s-process astrophysical sites and discuss the related physical uncertainties. We also present current observational evidence for the s process and beyond, which ranges from stellar spectroscopic observations to laboratory analysis of meteorites.", "generated_text": "The s-process, responsible for synthesizing about half of the elements heavier than iron, has been a cornerstone of nuclear astrophysics for decades. This review examines recent advancements in our understanding of the s-process and explores its implications beyond traditional models. We discuss new insights from stellar spectroscopy, meteoritic anomalies, and theoretical models of AGB and massive stars. Recent observations have challenged long-held assumptions about neutron sources and nucleosynthesis sites. We highlight the interplay between nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations in refining s-process models. Furthermore, we explore how the s-process connects to other nucleosynthesis mechanisms, providing a more comprehensive picture of elemental production in the universe. This synthesis of current research underscores the continuing importance of s-process studies in unraveling cosmic chemical evolution.", "label": 1}
