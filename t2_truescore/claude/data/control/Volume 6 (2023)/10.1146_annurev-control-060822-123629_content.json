{"grounding": "This review aims to present recent developments in modeling and control of multiagent systems. A particular focus is set on crowd dynamics characterized by complex interactions among agents, also called social interactions, and large-scale systems. Specifically, in a crowd each individual agent interacts with a field generated by the other agents and the environment. These systems can be modeled at the microscopic scale by ordinary differential equations, while an alternative description at the mesoscopic scale is given by a partial differential equation for the propagation of the probability density of the agents. Control actions can be applied at the individual level as well as at the level of the corresponding fields. This article presents and compares different control types, and the specific application to multilane, multiclass traffic is developed in some detail, showing the main tools at work in a hybrid setting with relevant impacts on autonomous driving.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the modeling and control of large-scale multiagent systems, with a focus on crowd dynamics and autonomous vehicle networks. We employ mean-field theory to analyze the collective behavior of interacting agent systems as the number of agents approaches infinity. The research develops a novel framework for describing the macroscopic properties of these systems, incorporating both local interactions and global feedback control mechanisms. We derive analytical expressions for the mean-field limit and propose efficient control strategies that can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as traffic management and crowd control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various settings, including pedestrian flow in urban environments and coordinated movement of autonomous vehicle fleets. The findings contribute to the understanding of complex multiagent systems and offer practical solutions for their control and optimization.", "label": 1}
