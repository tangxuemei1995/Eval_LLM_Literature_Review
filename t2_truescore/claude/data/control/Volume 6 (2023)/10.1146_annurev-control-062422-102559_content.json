{"grounding": "Surface tension effects are known to be dominant at the submillimeter scale. Within this context, the literature has extensively described the underlying physics (e.g., surface tension, wetting, surface texturation, and coatings), and capillary forces have been exploited in a variety of applications (e.g., capillary picking, self-alignment, capillary sealing, and capillary bearings). As several stimuli can be used to control liquid menisci, these forces have been used mainly in microrobotics in open loop (i.e., without real-time feedback). However, at least two major sources of uncertainty hinder these forces from working properly in open loop: the variability due to contact-angle hysteresis (the difference between wetting and unwetting) and the variability in the involved volume of liquid. To be able to reject these disturbances, successful sensor integration and associated advanced control schemes need to be embedded in capillary microrobotic microsystems. This article analyzes research contributions in this field from three different perspectives: the stimulus action of the surface tension effect (light, B-field, etc.), the application field (actuation, picking, sealing, etc.), and the sensing and control schemes. Technologically complex developments coexist with elegant and straightforward engineering solutions. Biological aspects of surface tension are not included in this review.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the innovative use of liquid surface tension in the field of microrobotics, focusing on its potential for precise micromanipulations. Surface tension and capillary forces, which become dominant at the microscale, are harnessed to develop novel microrobotic systems and techniques. We present a comprehensive review of recent advancements in exploiting these phenomena for micromanipulation tasks, including object transport, assembly, and sorting. The study investigates various liquid-mediated microrobotic platforms, such as droplet-based actuators and capillary grippers, highlighting their unique capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of surface tension-driven mechanisms with other microrobotic technologies to enhance functionality and control. The paper also addresses challenges in implementing these systems, including environmental sensitivity and scalability issues. Finally, we propose future research directions and potential applications in fields such as microfluidics, biomedical engineering, and micro-manufacturing. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on utilizing physical phenomena at the microscale for advanced robotic applications.", "label": 0}
