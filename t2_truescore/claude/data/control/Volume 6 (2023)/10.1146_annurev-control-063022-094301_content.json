{"grounding": "Embodiment is a crucial concept for the autonomy and adaptivity of systems working in the physical world with high degrees of uncertainty and complexity. The physical bodies of autonomous adaptive systems heavily influence the information flow from the environment to the central processing (and vice versa), requiring us to consider the full triad of brain, body, and environment to investigate intelligent behavior. This article provides a structured review of embodied intelligence with a special emphasis on the concept of timescales and their role in self-organization and the emergence of complex behavior. We classify embodied interactions into three types\u2014cross-timescale matching, separation, and nontemporal sequences\u2014and discuss how these interactions were studied in the past as well as how they can contribute to the systematic investigation of complex autonomous and adaptive systems in both biological and artificial entities.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the critical role of embodiment in autonomous adaptive systems, focusing on the timescales at which intelligent behaviors emerge. We investigate how physical embodiment influences the development of adaptive capabilities across multiple temporal scales, from rapid sensorimotor interactions to long-term learning and evolution. Drawing inspiration from biological systems, we analyze cross-timescale interactions in bioinspired robotics and their impact on system performance. Our findings reveal that the integration of fast and slow processes within embodied agents leads to more robust and flexible behaviors. We propose a framework for designing autonomous systems that leverage these multi-timescale dynamics, highlighting the importance of considering embodiment in the context of temporal adaptation. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied intelligence and offers insights for developing more effective and adaptable autonomous systems.", "label": 1}
