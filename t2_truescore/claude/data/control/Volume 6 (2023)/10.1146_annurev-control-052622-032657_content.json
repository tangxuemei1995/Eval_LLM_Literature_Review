{"grounding": "Electric power systems are undergoing an unprecedented transition from fossil fuel\u2013based power plants to low-inertia systems that rely predominantly on power electronics and renewable energy resources. This article reviews the resulting control challenges and modeling fallacies, at both the device and system level, and focuses on novel aspects or classical concepts that need to be revised in light of the transition to low-inertia systems. To this end, we survey the literature on modeling of low-inertia systems, review research on the control of grid-connected power converters, and discuss the frequency dynamics of low-inertia systems. Moreover, we discuss system-level services from a control perspective. Overall, we conclude that the system-theoretic mindset is essential to bridge different research communities and understand the complex interactions of power electronics, electric machines, and their controls in large-scale low-inertia power systems.", "generated_text": "The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and power electronic converters in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, posing challenges for grid stability and control. This paper presents a comprehensive review of control strategies for low-inertia power systems, focusing on grid-forming control techniques and dynamic virtual power plant concepts. We analyze the limitations of conventional control methods and explore innovative approaches to maintain system stability and reliability. The study investigates the potential of advanced control algorithms, such as model predictive control and distributed control, to enhance the performance of low-inertia grids. Additionally, we discuss the role of energy storage systems and demand-side management in supporting grid stability. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive and coordinated control strategies in ensuring the resilience of future power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources.", "label": 1}
