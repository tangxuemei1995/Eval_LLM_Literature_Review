{"grounding": "Cost, efficiency, and emissions concerns have motivated the application of advanced control techniques to multiple carrier energy systems. Research in energy management and control over the last two decades has shown that significant energy and CO2 emissions reductions can be achieved. Within the last decade, this work has expanded to the domain of interconnected energy systems. The interconnection control of multiple energy carriers, conversion devices, and energy storage provides increased flexibility and energy/CO2 reduction potential. The focus of this article is on outlining the control methods required for these systems over a range of energy consumption and timescales. Dynamic interactions between multicarrier systems occur over timescales ranging from 15 minutes to seasons. The constrained nature of the resulting control problems favors optimization-based approaches.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a comprehensive review and analysis of control strategies for multicarrier energy systems, spanning from individual buildings to large-scale networks. The study focuses on the integration of energy hubs, which facilitate the coordination of various energy carriers and conversion technologies. We examine advanced control techniques, including distributed, cooperative, and predictive control methods, and their applications in optimizing energy efficiency, reliability, and flexibility. The review highlights the challenges and opportunities in implementing these control strategies at different scales, from building-level energy management to network-wide coordination. Furthermore, we discuss the role of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and Internet of Things, in enhancing the performance of multicarrier energy systems. The findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of sustainable energy management.", "label": 1}
