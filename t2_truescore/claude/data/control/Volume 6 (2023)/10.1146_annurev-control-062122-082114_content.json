{"grounding": "Space-mounted robotics is becoming increasingly mainstream for many space missions. The aim of this article is threefold: first, to give a broad and quick overview of the importance of spacecraft-mounted robotics for future in-orbit servicing missions; second, to review the basic current approaches for modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic systems; and third, to introduce some new developments in terms of modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators using the language of hypercomplex numbers (dual quaternions). Some outstanding research questions and potential future directions in the field are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of spacecraft-mounted robotics for in-orbit servicing missions. We investigate advanced control strategies and trajectory tracking techniques using dual quaternions to represent the combined dynamics and kinematics of the spacecraft-manipulator system. The research focuses on developing robust algorithms for precise manipulation in the challenging space environment, addressing issues such as zero-gravity effects and orbital dynamics. Our findings demonstrate improved performance in trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, contributing to the advancement of autonomous robotic systems for space applications. The proposed methods show promise for enhancing the capabilities of future in-orbit servicing missions.", "label": 1}
