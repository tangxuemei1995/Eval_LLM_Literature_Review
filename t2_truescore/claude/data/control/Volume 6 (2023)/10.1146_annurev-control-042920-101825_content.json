{"grounding": "While noise is generally associated with uncertainties and often has a negative connotation in engineering, living organisms have evolved to adapt to (and even exploit) such uncertainty to ensure the survival of a species or implement certain functions that would have been difficult or even impossible otherwise. In this article, we review the role and impact of noise in systems and synthetic biology, with a particular emphasis on its role in the genetic control of biological systems, an area we refer to as cybergenetics. The main modeling paradigm is that of stochastic reaction networks, whose applicability goes beyond biology, as these networks can represent any population dynamics system, including ecological, epidemiological, and opinion dynamics networks. We review different ways to mathematically represent these systems, and we notably argue that the concept of ergodicity presents a particularly suitable way to characterize their stability. We then discuss noise-induced properties and show that noise can be both an asset and a nuisance in this setting. Finally, we discuss recent results on (stochastic) cybergenetics and explore their relationships to noise. Along the way, we detail the different technical and biological constraints that need to be respected when designing synthetic biological circuits. Finally, we discuss the concepts, problems, and solutions exposed in the article; raise criticisms and concerns about current ideas and approaches; suggest current (open) problems with potential solutions; and provide some ideas for future research directions.", "generated_text": "Noise is an inherent feature of biomolecular systems, arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions and the small number of molecules involved. This review explores the modeling, analysis, and control implications of noise in biological systems, with a focus on cybergenetics and synthetic biology applications. We discuss various approaches to modeling stochastic processes in reaction networks, including the chemical master equation, stochastic differential equations, and moment closure methods. The analysis of noise propagation and its effects on system behavior is examined, highlighting the importance of understanding noise-induced phenomena such as bistability, oscillations, and state transitions. We review recent advances in control strategies for managing noise in biomolecular systems, including feedback control, noise-induced stabilization, and robust design principles. The implications of noise for synthetic biology applications are discussed, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities in engineering reliable biological circuits and devices. Furthermore, we explore the emerging field of cybergenetics, which combines control theory with synthetic biology to develop novel approaches for manipulating cellular behavior. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on noise in biomolecular systems and its implications for the design and control of synthetic biological systems, offering insights for researchers in systems biology, synthetic biology, and control engineering.", "label": 1}
