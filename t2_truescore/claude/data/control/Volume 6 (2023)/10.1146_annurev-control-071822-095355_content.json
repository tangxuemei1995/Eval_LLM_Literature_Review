{"grounding": "Approximately 1.1. billion people worldwide live with some form of disability, and assistive technology has the potential to increase their overall quality of life. However, the end users\u2019 perspective and needs are often not sufficiently considered during the development of this technology, leading to frustration and nonuse of existing devices. Since its first competition in 2016, CYBATHLON has aimed to drive innovation in the field of assistive technology by motivating teams to involve end users more actively in the development process and to tailor novel devices to their actual daily-life needs. Competition tasks therefore represent unsolved daily-life challenges for people with disabilities and serve the purpose of benchmarking the latest developments from research laboratories and companies from around the world. This review describes each of the competition disciplines, their contributions to assistive technology, and remaining challenges in the user-centered development of this technology.", "generated_text": "The CYBATHLON competition has emerged as a catalyst for innovation in assistive technologies, promoting user-centered design and inclusion for people with disabilities. This review examines the impact of CYBATHLON on advancing assistive devices and their real-world applications. By challenging teams to develop technologies that address daily-life obstacles, the competition has fostered collaboration between engineers, researchers, and individuals with disabilities. The unique format of CYBATHLON, which combines competitive events with practical tasks, has led to significant improvements in prosthetics, exoskeletons, and brain-computer interfaces. Moreover, the competition has raised public awareness about the challenges faced by people with disabilities and the potential of assistive technologies to enhance their quality of life. This paper analyzes the technological advancements stemming from CYBATHLON and discusses their implications for future developments in the field of assistive technology.", "label": 1}
