{"grounding": "Networked control systems, where feedback loops are closed over communication networks, arise in several domains, including smart energy grids, autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and many industrial and robotic systems active in service, production, agriculture, and smart homes and cities. In these settings, the two main layers of the system, control and communication, strongly affect each other's performance, and they also reveal the interaction between a cyber-system component, represented by information-based computing and communication technologies, and a physical-system component, represented by the environment that needs to be controlled. The information access and distribution constraints required to achieve reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems have been intensively studied over the course of roughly two decades. This article reviews some of the cornerstone results in this area, draws a map for what we have learned over these years, and describes the new challenges that we will face in the future. Rather than simply listing different results, we present them in a coherent fashion using a uniform notation, and we also put them in context, highlighting both their theoreticalinsights and their practical significance. Particular attention is given to recent developments related to decentralized estimation in distributed sensing and communication systems and the information-theoretic value of event timing in the context of networked control.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the multifaceted role of information in networked estimation and control systems, with a focus on cyber-physical systems and control under communication constraints. We investigate how various forms of information, including timing, event-triggered data, and decentralized inference, impact system performance and design. The study begins by examining the fundamental trade-offs between communication resources and control performance in networked control systems. We then analyze the potential of timing information and event-triggered mechanisms to enhance system efficiency and reduce communication overhead. The paper also delves into decentralized inference techniques, exploring how distributed agents can collaboratively estimate system states with limited information exchange. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by cyber-physical systems, where the integration of computational and physical processes introduces new complexities in information management. Our findings reveal that a holistic approach to information utilization, encompassing both traditional sensor data and auxiliary information sources, can significantly improve the robustness and efficiency of networked estimation and control systems. This work provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize the design and implementation of complex networked systems in various domains, including industrial automation, smart grids, and autonomous vehicle networks.", "label": 1}
