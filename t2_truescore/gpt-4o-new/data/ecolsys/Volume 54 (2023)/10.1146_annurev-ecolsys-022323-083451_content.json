{"grounding": "Pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon of one gene or one mutation affecting multiple phenotypic traits. While the concept of pleiotropy is as old as Mendelian genetics, functional genomics has finally allowed the first glimpses of the extent of pleiotropy for a large fraction of genes in a genome. After describing conceptual and operational difficulties in quantifying pleiotropy and the pros and cons of various methods for measuring pleiotropy, I review empirical data on pleiotropy, which generally show an L-shaped distribution of the degree of pleiotropy (i.e., the number of traits affected), with most genes having low pleiotropy. I then review the current understanding of the molecular basis of pleiotropy. In the rest of the review, I discuss evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on advances in topics including the cost of complexity, regulatory versus coding evolution, environmental pleiotropy and adaptation, evolution of ageing and other seemingly harmful traits, and evolutionary resolution of pleiotropy.", "generated_text": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits, plays a critical role in evolutionary biology. This study explores the patterns and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on its implications for adaptation and the cost of complexity. Through a comprehensive review of genetic and phenotypic data, we examine how pleiotropy can lead to antagonistic effects, where beneficial mutations for one trait may be detrimental to others. This antagonistic pleiotropy is particularly relevant in the context of disease, where mutations that confer resistance to pathogens may simultaneously increase susceptibility to other conditions. Our findings suggest that pleiotropy can constrain evolutionary trajectories by limiting the range of adaptive mutations, thereby influencing the pace and direction of evolution. Additionally, the study highlights the cost of complexity, where organisms with highly interconnected genetic networks may face greater challenges in adapting to environmental changes. These insights underscore the importance of pleiotropy in shaping evolutionary outcomes and biodiversity.", "label": 1}
