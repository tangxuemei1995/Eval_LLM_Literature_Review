{"grounding": "The way in which terrestrial organisms use the acoustic realm is fundamentally important and shapes behavior, populations, and communities, but how background acoustics, or noise, influence the patterns and processes in ecology is still relatively understudied. In this review, we summarize how background acoustics have traditionally been studied from the signaling perspective, discuss what is known from a receiver's perspective, and explore what is known about population- and community-level responses to noise. We suggest that there are major gaps linking animal physiology and behavior in noise to fitness; that there is a limited understanding of variation in hearing within and across species, especially in the context of real-world acoustic conditions; and that many puzzling responses to noise could be clarified with a community-level lens that considers indirect effects. Failing to consider variation in acoustic conditions, and the many ways organisms use and interact via this environmental dimension, risks a limited understanding of natural systems.", "generated_text": "The study of background acoustics in terrestrial ecology is pivotal for understanding the complex interactions within ecological communities. This research explores how ambient soundscapes influence animal behavior and community dynamics through both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects include the impact of acoustic environments on animal hearing and communication, where masking by background noise can alter predator-prey interactions and mating calls. Indirectly, soundscapes can affect habitat selection and resource availability, thereby influencing community structure and species distribution. By integrating concepts from behavior and community ecology, this study highlights the importance of acoustic environments in shaping ecological interactions. The findings underscore the need for conservation strategies that consider acoustic habitats, especially in the face of increasing anthropogenic noise. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how soundscapes function as a critical component of terrestrial ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and ecological resilience.", "label": 1}
