{"grounding": "Parenting is considered a key evolutionary innovation that contributed to the diversification and expansion of vertebrates. However, we know little about how such diversity evolved. Amphibians are an ideal group in which to identify the ecological factors that have facilitated or constrained the evolution of different forms of parental care. Among, but also within, the three amphibian orders\u2014Anura, Caudata, and Gymnophiona\u2014there is a high level of variation in habitat use, fertilization mode, mating systems, and parental sex roles. Recent work using broad phylogenetic, experimental, and physiological approaches has helped to uncover the factors that have selected for the evolution of care and transitions between different forms of parenting. Here, we highlight the exceptional diversity of amphibian parental care, emphasize the unique opportunities this group offers for addressing key questions about the evolution of parenting, and give insights into promising novel directions of research.", "generated_text": "Amphibians offer a unique perspective on the evolution of parental care due to their diverse reproductive strategies and life histories. This study explores how variations in fertilization mode, terrestriality, and parental sex roles influence the development of parental care behaviors in amphibians. By examining species with different modes of fertilization, we assess how these reproductive strategies impact the necessity and evolution of parental protection, transport, and nutrition. The transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments is highlighted as a significant factor driving the evolution of complex parental care behaviors, as terrestriality often necessitates increased protection and resource allocation to offspring. Additionally, the study investigates how parental sex roles are shaped by ecological and evolutionary pressures, leading to diverse care strategies across species. Understanding these dynamics in amphibians provides broader insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that shape parental care across vertebrates, highlighting the adaptive significance of these behaviors in response to environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
