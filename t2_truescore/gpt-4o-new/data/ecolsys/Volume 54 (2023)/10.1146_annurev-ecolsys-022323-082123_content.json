{"grounding": "Greenhouse gas emissions are warming the ocean with profound consequences at all levels of organization, from organismal rates to ecosystem processes. The proximate driver is an interplay between anthropogenic warming (the trend) and natural fluctuations in local temperature. These two properties cause anomalously warm events such as marine heatwaves to occur with increasing frequency and magnitude. Because warming and variance are not uniform, there is a large degree of geographic variation in temporal temperature variability. We review the underappreciated interaction between trend and variance in the ocean and how it modulates ecological responses to ocean warming. For example, organisms in more thermally variable environments are often more acclimatized and/or adapted to temperature extremes and are thus less sensitive to anthropogenic heatwaves. Considering both trend and variability highlights the importance of processes like legacy effects and extinction debt that influence the rate of community transformation.", "generated_text": "Marine ecosystems are increasingly impacted by climate change, with both gradual shifts in mean conditions and abrupt events like heatwaves posing significant threats. This study explores the dual role of variability\u2014both smooth and spiky\u2014in shaping ecological responses to these changes. We examine how variability influences species' acclimation processes and the potential for depth refuges to mitigate impacts. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both mean changes and variability in predicting ecological outcomes. We also investigate legacy effects, where past exposure to variable conditions affects future resilience. By integrating these factors, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of marine species' adaptive capacities. This research underscores the need for conservation strategies that account for the complex interplay between mean conditions and variability, offering insights into enhancing ecosystem resilience in the face of ongoing climate change.", "label": 1}
