{"grounding": "Over 70% of soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored at a depth greater than 20 cm belowground. A portion of this deep SOC actively cycles on annual to decadal timescales and is sensitive to global change. However, deep SOC responses to global change likely differ from surface SOC responses because biotic controls on SOC cycling become weaker as mineral controls predominate with depth. Here, we synthesize the current information on deep SOC responses to the global change drivers of warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. Most deep SOC responses can only be hypothesized because few global change studies measure deep soils, and even fewer global change experiments manipulate deep soils. We call on scientists to incorporate deep soils into their manipulations, measurements, and models so that the response of deep SOC can be accounted for in projections of nature-based climate solutions and terrestrial feedbacks to climate change.", "generated_text": "Deep soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, acting as a significant carbon sink. This study investigates the response of deep SOC to global change factors, including climate change, elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, and land use and land cover changes. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and meta-analyses, we assess the mechanisms by which these factors influence deep SOC dynamics. Our findings indicate that elevated CO2 can enhance root biomass and exudation, potentially increasing deep SOC storage. However, climate change, particularly rising temperatures, may accelerate SOC decomposition, offsetting these gains. Land use changes, such as deforestation and agricultural expansion, significantly disturb deep SOC stocks, often leading to carbon losses. Understanding these interactions is critical for predicting future SOC dynamics and developing strategies to mitigate climate change. This research underscores the need for integrated management practices to preserve deep SOC under changing global conditions.", "label": 1}
