{"grounding": "Sky islands are unique geologic formations, home to populations of organisms that have weathered climate change since the Pleistocene. Long-term isolation and climatic differences between sky islands and adjacent mountain chains result in natural laboratories well suited for examining the direct effects of climate change. Here, we review the global sky island literature to examine how taxa have responded to climate change. Results show lineage formation, reduced genetic variation, and trait evolution across taxa driven by genetic drift and natural selection. These effects continue today due to ongoing habitat reduction and steep selective gradients on sky islands relative to mountain chains. Comparative studies and experimental manipulations are needed to build broad inference into how past climate change has shaped the structure and function of whole ecosystems. The next era of sky island research is poised to create a model for climate change responses and eco-evolutionary dynamics, with profound conservation implications.", "generated_text": "Sky islands, isolated mountain ecosystems surrounded by radically different lowland environments, serve as natural laboratories for studying the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. These unique habitats provide insights into ecological and evolutionary processes due to their distinct environmental gradients and isolated populations. As climate change alters temperature and precipitation patterns, sky islands offer a predictive model for understanding species' responses, including shifts in distribution, genetic variation, and convergent evolution. Relict populations on sky islands, which have persisted through past climatic fluctuations, are particularly valuable for examining the resilience and adaptability of species. By analyzing genetic variation within and between these populations, researchers can infer potential evolutionary trajectories and identify conservation priorities. This study underscores the importance of sky islands as a global tool for predicting the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change, highlighting their role in informing conservation strategies and enhancing our understanding of biodiversity dynamics in a rapidly changing world.", "label": 1}
