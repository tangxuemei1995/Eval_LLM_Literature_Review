{"grounding": "The origin of life entails a continuum from simple prebiotic chemistry to cells with genes and molecular machines. Using life as a guide to this continuum, we consider how selection could promote increased complexity before the emergence of genes. Structured, far-from-equilibrium environments such as hydrothermal systems drive the reaction between CO2 and H2 to form organics that self-organize into protocells. CO2 fixation within protocells generates a reaction network with a topology that prefigures the universal core of metabolism. Positive feedback loops amplify flux through this network, giving a metabolic heredity that promotes growth. Patterns in the genetic code show that genes and proteins arose through direct biophysical interactions between amino acids and nucleotides in this protometabolic network. Random genetic sequences template nonrandom peptides, producing selectable function in growing protocells. This context-dependent emergence of information gives rise seamlessly to an autotrophic last universal common ancestor.", "generated_text": "The origin of life remains one of the most profound questions in science, with recent advances suggesting a complex interplay of chemical and environmental factors. This study explores the hypothesis that life itself provides clues to its origins, focusing on key processes such as CO2 fixation and the emergence of protocells. Central to this exploration is the role of metabolism, particularly the proton-motive force and FeS clusters, which may have driven early biochemical pathways. The RNA world hypothesis is revisited, highlighting RNA's dual role as both genetic material and catalyst, potentially bridging the gap between chemistry and biology. Additionally, the evolution of the genetic code is examined as a pivotal step in life's development. By integrating these elements, the research aims to construct a coherent narrative of life's emergence, offering insights into the conditions and processes that may have facilitated the transition from chemistry to biology.", "label": 1}
