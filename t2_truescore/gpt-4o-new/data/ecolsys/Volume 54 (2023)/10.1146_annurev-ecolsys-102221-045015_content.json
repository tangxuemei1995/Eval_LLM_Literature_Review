{"grounding": "Plants and herbivores are remarkably variable in space and time, and variability has been considered a defining feature of their interactions. Empirical research, however, has traditionally focused on understanding differences in means and overlooked the theoretically significant ecological and evolutionary roles of variability itself. We review the literature with the goal of showing how variability-explicit research expands our perspective on plant\u2013herbivore ecology and evolution. We first clarify terminology for describing variation and then review patterns, causes, and consequences of variation in herbivory across scales of space, time, and biological organization. We consider how incorporating variability improves existing hypotheses and leads to new ones. We conclude by suggesting future work that reports full distributions, integrates effects of variation across scales, describes nonlinearities, and considers how stochastic and deterministic variation combine to determine herbivory distributions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamic nature of plant\u2013herbivore interactions, emphasizing the variability inherent in these ecological relationships. Herbivory, a critical ecological process, influences plant community structure and ecosystem function. The research examines how plant defense mechanisms, both constitutive and induced, vary across different species and environmental conditions, affecting herbivore feeding patterns and preferences. By analyzing a range of plant and herbivore species, the study highlights the role of ecological variability in shaping these interactions. The findings underscore the importance of species-specific traits and environmental factors in determining the outcomes of plant\u2013herbivore interactions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexity and adaptability of ecological systems, providing insights into the evolutionary pressures that drive the diversification of defense strategies in plants and feeding strategies in herbivores.", "label": 1}
