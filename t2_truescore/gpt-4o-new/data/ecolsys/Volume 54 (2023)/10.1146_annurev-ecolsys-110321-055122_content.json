{"grounding": "Large Old World fruit bats (LOWFBs), species of Pteropus, Acerodon, and related genera of large bats in the pteropodid subfamily Pteropodinae, play important roles as agents of dispersal and pollination across the Paleotropics. LOWFBs are also collectively the most threatened group of bats in the world, with 71% of extant species assessed as threatened by International Union for Conservation of Nature. As highlighted here, contrary to other bats, the vast majority of LOWFBs face multiple simultaneous threats. Most importantly, biological and ecological traits, in particular life history characteristics, diet, movement, social ecology, and physiology, intensify threats and accelerate species declines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LOWFBs are to be considered keystone species and express concern about the erosion of this role and the cascading effects expected on native ecosystems. In response to this alarming situation, we advance general recommendations and identify overarching research and conservation actions.", "generated_text": "Large Old World fruit bats, particularly those of the genus Pteropus, are facing an alarming risk of extinction due to a confluence of anthropogenic and environmental factors. These keystone species, commonly known as flying foxes, play a critical role in island ecosystems through pollination and seed dispersal. However, their populations are severely threatened by unsustainable hunting practices, habitat destruction, and the escalating impacts of climate change. The loss of these bats could lead to significant ecological consequences, including the disruption of plant regeneration and biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts are urgently needed to address these threats, with a focus on habitat protection, sustainable hunting regulations, and climate adaptation strategies. This study underscores the importance of island conservation initiatives and highlights the need for global awareness and action to preserve these vital species and the ecosystems they support.", "label": 1}
