{"grounding": "Diet is an important determinant of health and consequently is often implicated in the development of disease, particularly gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, given the high prevalence of meal-related symptoms. The mechanisms underlying diet-driven pathophysiology are not well understood, but recent studies suggest that gut microbiota may mediate the effect of diet on GI physiology. In this review, we focus primarily on two distinct GI diseases where the role of diet has been best studied: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. We discuss how the concurrent and sequential utilization of dietary nutrients by the host and gut microbiota determines the eventual bioactive metabolite profiles in the gut and the biological effect of these metabolites on GI physiology. We highlight several concepts that can be gleaned from these findings, such as how distinct effects of an individual metabolite can influence diverse GI diseases, the effect of similar dietary interventions on multiple disease states, and the need for extensive phenotyping and data collection to help make personalized diet recommendations.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between diet and the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and management of gastrointestinal disorders. This review explores the mechanisms by which dietary components influence microbiota composition and function, impacting the gut\u2013brain axis and contributing to inflammation. Advances in metabolomics have elucidated the metabolic pathways through which microbiota-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids from fermentation, modulate host physiology and immune responses. Understanding these interactions provides a foundation for developing microbiome-targeted therapies aimed at restoring microbial balance and alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms. Strategies such as prebiotics, probiotics, and dietary interventions are evaluated for their efficacy in modulating the microbiome to reduce inflammation and improve gut health. The potential of personalized nutrition, guided by microbiome profiling, is also discussed as a promising approach to tailor interventions for individual patients. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of integrating diet and microbiome research to devise effective therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal disorders, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
