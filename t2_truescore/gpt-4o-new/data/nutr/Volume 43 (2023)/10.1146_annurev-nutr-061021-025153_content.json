{"grounding": "As dietary guidance for populations shifts from preventing deficiency disorders to chronic disease risk reduction, the biology supporting such guidance becomes more complex due to the multifactorial risk profile of disease and inherent population heterogeneity in the diet\u2013disease relationship. Diet is a primary driver of chronic disease risk, and population-based guidance should account for individual responses. Cascading effects on evidentiary standards for population-based guidance are not straightforward. Precision remains a consideration for dietary guidance to prevent deficiency through the identification of population subgroups with unique nutritional needs. Reducing chronic disease through diet requires greater precision in (a) establishing essential nutrient needs throughout the life cycle in both health and disease; (b) considering effects of nutrients and other food substances on metabolic, immunological, inflammatory, and other physiological responses supporting healthy aging; and (c) considering healthy eating behaviors. Herein we provide a template for guiding population-based eating recommendations for reducing chronic diseases in heterogenous populations.", "generated_text": "Precision nutrition, a burgeoning field promising personalized dietary recommendations based on individual genetic, phenotypic, and environmental factors, is gaining significant attention. However, the scientific foundation supporting its application in public health remains underdeveloped. This review critically examines the current state of precision nutrition, highlighting the disparity between its potential and the existing evidentiary standards required to inform public health policies effectively. While precision nutrition offers a tailored approach to nutrient requirements, the biological variation among individuals poses challenges in establishing universally applicable dietary guidelines. The hype surrounding precision nutrition often surpasses the scientific validation necessary for its integration into nutrition policy aimed at chronic disease prevention. This paper underscores the need for rigorous research to substantiate precision nutrition's claims and to develop robust frameworks that can translate individual variability into actionable public health recommendations. Addressing these gaps is crucial for harnessing precision nutrition's promise in improving population health outcomes.", "label": 1}
