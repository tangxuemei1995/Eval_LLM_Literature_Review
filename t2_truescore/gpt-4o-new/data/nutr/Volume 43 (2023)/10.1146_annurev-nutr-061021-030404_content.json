{"grounding": "Pregnancy entails a large negative balance of iron, an essential micronutrient. During pregnancy, iron requirements increase substantially to support both maternal red blood cell expansion and the development of the placenta and fetus. As insufficient iron has long been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, universal iron supplementation is common practice before and during pregnancy. However, in high-resource countries with iron fortification of staple foods and increased red meat consumption, the effects of too much iron supplementation during pregnancy have become a concern because iron excess has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we address physiologic iron homeostasis of the mother, placenta, and fetus and discuss perturbations in iron homeostasis that result in pathological pregnancy. As many mechanistic regulatory systems have been deduced from animal models, we also discuss the principles learned from these models and how these may apply to human pregnancy.", "generated_text": "Iron homeostasis during pregnancy is a critical aspect of maternal and fetal health, influenced by complex regulatory mechanisms involving the mother, placenta, and fetus. This review explores the dynamic interplay of these systems, focusing on the role of hepcidin, a key hormone in iron regulation. During pregnancy, maternal iron requirements increase significantly to support fetal development and placental function. The placenta acts as a mediator, modulating iron transfer to the fetus while responding to maternal iron status and inflammatory signals. Iron deficiency and inflammation can disrupt this balance, leading to adverse outcomes such as anemia and impaired fetal growth. Understanding the regulatory pathways, including hepcidin's modulation by maternal and fetal signals, is essential for developing strategies to manage iron deficiency and optimize pregnancy outcomes. This review highlights recent advances in the field, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to ensure adequate iron supply during pregnancy.", "label": 1}
