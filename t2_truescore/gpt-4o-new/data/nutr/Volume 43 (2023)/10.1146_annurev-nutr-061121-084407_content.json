{"grounding": "Riboflavin, in its cofactor forms flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), plays fundamental roles in energy metabolism, cellular antioxidant potential, and metabolic interactions with other micronutrients, including iron, vitamin B6, and folate. Severe riboflavin deficiency, largely confined to low-income countries, clinically manifests as cheilosis, angular stomatitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and severe anemia with erythroid hypoplasia. Subclinical deficiency may be much more widespread, including in high-income countries, but typically goes undetected because riboflavin biomarkers are rarely measured in human studies. There are adverse health consequences of low and deficient riboflavin status throughout the life cycle, including anemia and hypertension, that could contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. This review considers the available evidence on causes, detection, and consequences of riboflavin deficiency, ranging from clinical deficiency signs to manifestations associated with less severe deficiency, and the related research, public health, and policy priorities.", "generated_text": "Riboflavin deficiency, though rare in developed countries, remains a significant nutritional concern globally, particularly in regions with limited access to diverse diets. This deficiency is primarily caused by inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption syndromes, and increased physiological demands. The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac) is a reliable biomarker for assessing riboflavin status, with elevated EGRac values indicating deficiency. Clinical sequelae of riboflavin deficiency include anemia, due to impaired iron metabolism, and potential exacerbation of hypertension, as riboflavin is crucial for maintaining normal blood pressure levels. The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) provide guidelines to prevent deficiency, yet awareness and adherence remain suboptimal in at-risk populations. Addressing riboflavin deficiency requires a multifaceted approach, including dietary diversification, supplementation, and public health initiatives to improve nutritional education and access to riboflavin-rich foods. Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of clinical implications associated with riboflavin deficiency.", "label": 0}
