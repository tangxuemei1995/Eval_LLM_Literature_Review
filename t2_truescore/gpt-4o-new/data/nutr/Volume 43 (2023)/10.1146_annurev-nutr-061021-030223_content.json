{"grounding": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic fatty liver disease worldwide, particularly in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals. Currently, there are no therapies for NAFLD that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Herein, we examine the rationale for using \u03c93 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in NAFLD therapy. This focus is based on the finding that NAFLD severity is associated with a reduction of hepatic C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs. Because C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs are pleiotropic regulators of cell function, loss of C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs has the potential to significantly impact hepatic function. We describe NAFLD prevalence and pathophysiology as well as current NAFLD therapies. We also present evidence from clinical and preclinical studies that evaluated the capacity of C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs to treat NAFLD. Given the clinical and preclinical evidence, dietary C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFA supplementation has the potential to decrease human NAFLD severity by reducing hepatosteatosis and liver injury.", "generated_text": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent condition characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, which can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have emerged as potential therapeutic agents due to their anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties. This review explores the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids influence hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate lipid metabolism by enhancing fatty acid oxidation and reducing lipogenesis, thereby decreasing hepatic fat accumulation. Additionally, they exert anti-inflammatory effects by altering eicosanoid production and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Clinical studies have demonstrated that omega-3 supplementation can improve liver histology in patients with NAFLD, particularly in reducing steatosis and inflammation. However, the impact on fibrosis remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to optimize dosing strategies and to fully elucidate the long-term benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in NAFLD management.", "label": 1}
