{"grounding": "The prenatal and early postnatal periods are stages during which dynamic changes and the development of the brain and gut microbiota occur, and nutrition is one of the most important modifiable factors that influences this process. Given the bidirectional cross talk between the gut microbiota and the brain through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA), there is growing interest in evaluating the potential effects of nutritional interventions administered during these critical developmental windows on gut microbiota composition and function and their association with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We review recent preclinical and clinical evidence from animal studies and infant/child populations. Although further research is needed, growing evidence suggests that different functional nutrients affect the establishment and development of the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis and could have preventive and therapeutic use in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, more in-depth knowledge regarding the effect of nutrition on the MGBA during critical developmental windows may enable the prevention of later neurocognitive and behavioral disorders and allow the establishment of individualized nutrition-based programs that can be used from the prenatal to the early and middle stages of life.", "generated_text": "The microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis is a complex communication network that plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and overall health. Recent research highlights the significant impact of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of this axis. Key nutritional components such as milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), as well as prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics, have been identified as influential factors. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation can shape the infant's gut microbiota, which in turn affects brain development and function. MFGM and HMOs, present in breast milk, are particularly important for cognitive development and immune function. LC-PUFAs are essential for brain structure and function, while prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics contribute to a balanced gut microbiota, supporting the gut-brain communication. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how these nutritional elements influence the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize maternal and infant nutrition strategies for improved neurodevelopmental outcomes.", "label": 1}
