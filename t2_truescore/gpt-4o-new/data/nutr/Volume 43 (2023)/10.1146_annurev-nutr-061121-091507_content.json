{"grounding": "Gluconeogenesis is a critical biosynthetic process that helps maintain whole-body glucose homeostasis and becomes altered in certain medical diseases. We review gluconeogenic flux in various medical diseases, including common metabolic disorders, hormonal imbalances, specific inborn genetic errors, and cancer. We discuss how the altered gluconeogenic activity contributes to disease pathogenesis using data from experiments using isotopic tracer and spectroscopy methodologies. These in vitro, animal, and human studies provide insights into the changes in circulating levels of available gluconeogenesis substrates and the efficiency of converting those substrates to glucose by gluconeogenic organs. We highlight ongoing knowledge gaps, discuss emerging research areas, and suggest future investigations. A better understanding of altered gluconeogenesis flux may ultimately identify novel and targeted treatment strategies for such diseases.", "generated_text": "Gluconeogenesis, a critical metabolic pathway for glucose production, plays a pivotal role in maintaining blood sugar levels, especially during fasting. This study investigates the alterations in gluconeogenesis flux in the context of metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance and enzyme deficiencies. We explore how hormonal imbalances, particularly involving insulin and glucagon, modulate gluconeogenic activity. Additionally, the research examines the implications of altered gluconeogenesis in cancer metabolism, where increased glucose production supports tumor growth. By employing advanced metabolic flux analysis, we identify key regulatory enzymes and potential therapeutic targets. Our findings suggest that modulating gluconeogenesis could offer novel strategies for managing metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting the need for further investigation into the complex interplay between metabolic pathways and disease states.", "label": 1}
