{"grounding": "Childhood undernutrition is a major global health burden that is only partially resolved by nutritional interventions. Both chronic and acute forms of child undernutrition are characterized by derangements in multiple biological systems including metabolism, immunity, and endocrine systems. A growing body of evidence supports a role of the gut microbiome in mediating these pathways influencing early life growth. Observational studies report alterations in the gut microbiome of undernourished children, while preclinical studies suggest that this can trigger intestinal enteropathy, alter host metabolism, and disrupt immune-mediated resistance against enteropathogens, each of which contribute to poor early life growth. Here, we compile evidence from preclinical and clinical studies and describe the emerging pathophysiological pathways by which the early life gut microbiome influences host metabolism, immunity, intestinal function, endocrine regulation, and other pathways contributing to child undernutrition. We discuss emerging microbiome-directed therapies and consider future research directions to identify and target microbiome-sensitive pathways in child undernutrition.", "generated_text": "Child undernutrition, manifesting as stunting and wasting, remains a critical global health challenge. Recent research highlights the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in influencing nutritional outcomes. This study explores the complex interactions between host and microbiota in the context of child undernutrition. We examine how microbial composition and function are altered in malnourished children and the subsequent impact on nutrient absorption and immune function. The findings suggest that undernutrition is associated with a dysbiotic microbiome, characterized by reduced microbial diversity and altered metabolic pathways. These microbial imbalances may exacerbate nutrient deficiencies and impair growth. Furthermore, interventions targeting microbiome restoration, such as probiotics and prebiotics, show promise in improving nutritional status and growth metrics. This review underscores the necessity of integrating microbiome-focused strategies into nutritional interventions to combat child undernutrition effectively. Future research should aim to elucidate the precise mechanisms of host-microbiome interactions and develop targeted therapies to restore microbial health in malnourished children.", "label": 1}
