{"grounding": "Modernization of society from a rural, hunter-gatherer setting into an urban and industrial habitat, with the associated dietary changes, has led to an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic and additional noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. However, while dietary sciences have been rapidly evolving to meet these challenges, validation and translation of experimental results into clinical practice remain limited for multiple reasons, including inherent ethnic, gender, and cultural interindividual variability, among other methodological, dietary reporting\u2013related, and analytical issues. Recently, large clinical cohorts with artificial intelligence analytics have introduced new precision and personalized nutrition concepts that enable one to successfully bridge these gaps in a real-life setting. In this review, we highlight selected examples of case studies at the intersection between diet\u2013disease research and artificial intelligence. We discuss their potential and challenges and offer an outlook toward the transformation of dietary sciences into individualized clinical translation.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between diet and disease has long posed challenges for researchers seeking to develop effective nutritional interventions. This study explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in deciphering these complex interactions, with a focus on precision nutrition. By employing advanced neural networks, AI can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and correlations that traditional methods may overlook. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how AI-driven models can predict individual responses to dietary changes, thereby facilitating personalized nutrition strategies. These models incorporate diverse variables, including genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors, to enhance the accuracy of dietary recommendations. Our findings underscore the potential of AI to revolutionize the field of nutrition science, offering insights that could lead to more effective prevention and management of diet-related diseases. This research highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to harness AI's full potential in advancing personalized healthcare solutions.", "label": 1}
