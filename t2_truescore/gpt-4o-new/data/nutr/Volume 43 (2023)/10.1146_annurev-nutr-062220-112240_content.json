{"grounding": "Fatty acid\u2013binding proteins (FABPs) are small lipid-binding proteins abundantly expressed in tissues that are highly active in fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Ten mammalian FABPs have been identified, with tissue-specific expression patterns and highly conserved tertiary structures. FABPs were initially studied as intracellular FA transport proteins. Further investigation has demonstrated their participation in lipid metabolism, both directly and via regulation of gene expression, and in signaling within their cells of expression. There is also evidence that they may be secreted and have functional impact via the circulation. It has also been shown that the FABP ligand binding repertoire extends beyond long-chain FAs and that their functional properties also involve participation in systemic metabolism. This article reviews the present understanding of FABP functions and their apparent roles in disease, particularly metabolic and inflammation-related disorders and cancers.", "generated_text": "Mammalian fatty acid\u2013binding proteins (FABPs) are a diverse family of lipid-binding proteins that play crucial roles in lipid metabolism and transport. These proteins are integral to the regulation of fatty acid uptake, transport, and signaling, influencing various metabolic pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the multifunctional nature of FABPs, linking them to the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases and cancer. FABPs are involved in modulating lipid homeostasis, and their dysregulation is associated with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, FABPs have been implicated in cancer progression, where they may affect tumor growth and metastasis through their role in lipid signaling pathways. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of FABP function could provide novel insights into therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders and cancer, emphasizing the importance of these proteins in health and disease.", "label": 1}
