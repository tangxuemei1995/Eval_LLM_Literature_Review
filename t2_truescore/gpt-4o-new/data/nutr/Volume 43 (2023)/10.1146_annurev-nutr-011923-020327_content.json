{"grounding": "Precise dietary assessment is critical for accurate exposure classification in nutritional research, typically aimed at understanding how diet relates to health. Dietary supplement (DS) use is widespread and represents a considerable source of nutrients. However, few studies have compared the best methods to measure DSs. Our literature review on the relative validity and reproducibility of DS instruments in the United States [e.g., product inventories, questionnaires, and 24-h dietary recalls (24HR)] identified five studies that examined validity (n = 5) and/or reproducibility (n = 4). No gold standard reference method exists for validating DS use; thus, each study's investigators chose the reference instrument used to measure validity. Self-administered questionnaires agreed well with 24HR and inventory methods when comparing the prevalence of commonly used DSs. The inventory method captured nutrient amounts more accurately than the other methods. Reproducibility (over 3 months to 2.4 years) of prevalence of use estimates on the questionnaires was acceptable for common DSs. Given the limited body of research on measurement error in DS assessment, only tentative conclusions on these DS instruments can be drawn at present. Further research is critical to advancing knowledge in DS assessment for research and monitoring purposes.", "generated_text": "The utilization of dietary supplements has become increasingly prevalent, yet significant gaps remain in our understanding of their role in health and disease. This review highlights the critical issues surrounding the validity and reproducibility of dietary supplement data, which are often compromised by methodological challenges. Key among these challenges is the accurate dietary assessment, which is frequently plagued by measurement errors that can obscure true associations between supplement use and health outcomes. The lack of standardized methodologies further complicates the ability to draw reliable conclusions from existing research. This paper underscores the necessity for improved methodological approaches that enhance the precision and accuracy of dietary supplement data collection and analysis. By addressing these gaps, future research can better elucidate the complex interactions between dietary supplements and health, ultimately informing public health recommendations and policy. The review calls for a concerted effort to develop and implement robust, standardized tools for dietary assessment, which are essential for advancing our understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with dietary supplement use. Such advancements are crucial for translating scientific findings into practical guidance for consumers and healthcare providers.", "label": 1}
