{"grounding": "Together, loss- and gain-of-function experiments have identified the bone-derived secreted molecule osteocalcin as a hormone with a broad reach in rodents and primates. Following its binding to one of three receptors, osteocalcin exerts a profound influence on various aspects of energy metabolism as well as steroidogenesis, neurotransmitter biosynthesis and thereby male fertility, electrolyte homeostasis, cognition, the acute stress response, and exercise capacity. Although this review focuses mostly on the regulation of energy metabolism by osteocalcin, it also touches on its other functions. Lastly, it proposes what could be a common theme between the functions of osteocalcin and between these functions and the structural functions of bone.", "generated_text": "Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes beyond its traditional function in bone mineralization. Recent studies highlight its involvement in energy metabolism, where undercarboxylated osteocalcin enhances insulin secretion and sensitivity, thus influencing glucose homeostasis. Additionally, osteocalcin acts as a 'danger repellent,' modulating the body's response to stress and injury. This multifaceted hormone's ability to interact with multiple systems underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders and stress-related conditions. Understanding the mechanisms governing osteocalcin's diverse functions could pave the way for novel interventions in metabolic and bone health, emphasizing its significance in endocrinology and beyond.", "label": 1}
