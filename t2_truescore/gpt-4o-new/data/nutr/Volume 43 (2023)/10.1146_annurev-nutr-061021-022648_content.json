{"grounding": "Amino acid dysregulation has emerged as an important driver of disease progression in various contexts. l-Serine lies at a central node of metabolism, linking carbohydrate metabolism, transamination, glycine, and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism to protein synthesis and various downstream bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways. l-Serine is produced locally in the brain but is sourced predominantly from glycine and one-carbon metabolism in peripheral tissues via liver and kidney metabolism. Compromised regulation or activity of l-serine synthesis and disposal occurs in the context of genetic diseases as well as chronic disease states, leading to low circulating l-serine levels and pathogenesis in the nervous system, retina, heart, and aging muscle. Dietary interventions in preclinical models modulate sensory neuropathy, retinopathy, tumor growth, and muscle regeneration. A serine tolerance test may provide a quantitative readout of l-serine homeostasis that identifies patients who may be susceptible to neuropathy or responsive to therapy.", "generated_text": "Serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a pivotal role in various metabolic pathways, influencing both health and disease states. This review explores the sources and sinks of serine in human nutrition and its metabolic interconversion with glycine, highlighting the significance of serine in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. The study delves into the metabolic flux of serine, examining its contribution to cellular processes such as nucleotide synthesis, phospholipid production, and neurotransmitter regulation. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of serine metabolism in neuropathy and diabetes, conditions where altered serine levels have been observed. Utilizing metabolomics, the research identifies biomarkers and pathways affected by serine dysregulation, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the balance of serine sources and sinks is crucial for developing nutritional and pharmacological strategies to mitigate disease progression and enhance health outcomes.", "label": 1}
