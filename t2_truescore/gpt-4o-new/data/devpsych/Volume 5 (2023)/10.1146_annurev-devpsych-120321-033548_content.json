{"grounding": "Despite numerous findings on the sophisticated inferences that human infants draw from observing third-party helping interactions, currently there is no theoretical account of how infants come to understand such events in the first place. After reviewing the available evidence in infants, we describe an account of how human adults understand helping actions. According to this mature concept, helping is a second-order, goal-directed action aiming to increase the utility of another agent (the Helpee) via reducing the cost, or increasing the reward, of the Helpee's own goal-directed action. We then identify the cognitive prerequisites for conceiving helping in this way and ask whether these are available to infants in the interpretation of helping interactions. In contrast to the mature concept, we offer two simpler alternatives that may underlie the early understanding of helping actions: (a) helping as enabling, which requires second-order goal attribution but no utility calculus, and (b) helping as joint action, which requires efficiency (i.e., utility) evaluation without demanding second-order goal attribution. We evaluate the evidence supporting these accounts, derive unique predictions from them, and describe what developmental pathway toward the mature concept they envisage. We conclude the article by outlining further open questions that the developmental literature on the interpretation of helping interactions has not yet addressed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the representation of third-party helping interactions in infancy, focusing on the cognitive mechanisms that underpin infants' understanding of social interactions involving assistance. The research investigates how infants perceive and interpret helping behaviors, particularly in scenarios where they are not directly involved but are observers of such interactions. By examining infants' responses to various helping situations, the study aims to shed light on the early development of social cognition and goal attribution. The methodology involves a series of controlled experiments where infants are presented with animated or live-action scenarios depicting helping behaviors between third parties. The infants' gaze patterns, emotional responses, and subsequent actions are analyzed to infer their understanding of the goals and intentions behind the helping interactions. Results indicate that even at a young age, infants are capable of recognizing and attributing goals to helping behaviors, suggesting that the foundations of social cognition and the ability to interpret others' actions are present early in life. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how social cognitive skills develop and the role of observational learning in infancy. The study highlights the importance of early social experiences in shaping infants' understanding of complex social interactions, with implications for developmental psychology and early childhood education.", "label": 1}
