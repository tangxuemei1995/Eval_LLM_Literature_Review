{"grounding": "Adolescence is a period of life that encompasses biological maturation and profound change in social roles. It is also a period associated with the onset of mental health problems. The field of developmental cognitive neuroscience has advanced our understanding of the development of the brain within its immediate social and cultural context. In a time of rising rates of mental health problems among adolescents across the globe, it is important to understand how the wider societal, structural, and cultural contexts of young people are impacting their biological and social-cognitive maturation. In this article, we review the landscape of youth mental health and brain development during adolescence and consider the potential role of brain research in understanding the effects of current social determinants of adolescent mental health, including socioeconomic inequality, city living, and eco-anxiety about the climate crisis.", "generated_text": "This study explores adolescent development through a neuroecosocial lens, integrating neurological, ecological, and social dimensions to understand the multifaceted challenges faced by youth today. By employing youth-led methods, the research emphasizes the importance of adolescent voices in shaping interventions and policies. The study examines how mental health is influenced by social inequalities, urbanicity, and the ongoing climate crisis, highlighting the interconnectedness of these factors. Findings suggest that urban environments and socio-economic disparities significantly impact adolescent mental health, while the climate crisis exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. The research advocates for holistic approaches that address these complex interactions, promoting resilience and well-being among adolescents. This perspective underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary strategies to foster supportive environments that mitigate the adverse effects of these global challenges on young people\u2019s development.", "label": 0}
