{"grounding": "Research on early biomarkers and behavioral precursors of autism has led to interventions initiated during the infant period that could potentially change the course of infant brain and behavioral development in autism. This article integrates neuroscience and clinical perspectives to explore how knowledge of infant brain and behavioral development can inform the design of infant autism interventions. Focusing on infants \u226412 months, we review studies on behavioral precursors of autism and their neural correlates and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of infant autism interventions. We then consider how contemporary developmental social neuroscience theories of autism can shed light on the therapeutic strategies used in infant autism interventions and offer a new perspective that emphasizes improving child outcome and well-being by enhancing infant\u2013environment fit. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research that incorporates brain-based measures to inform individualized approaches to intervention and discuss ethical issues raised by infant autism interventions. Readers are referred to \nSupplemental Table 1\n for a glossary of terms used in this article.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of developmental social neuroscience and early intervention strategies for infants at risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). By integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and early childhood development, the research aims to enhance understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying social and cognitive development in infants. The focus is on identifying critical periods of brain plasticity and the potential for targeted interventions to modify developmental trajectories. Through a review of current literature and recent empirical findings, the study highlights the role of early social experiences in shaping neural circuits associated with social cognition and communication. It also examines the efficacy of various intervention approaches, such as parent-mediated therapies and sensory integration techniques, in promoting adaptive neural and behavioral outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of early detection and personalized intervention strategies, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to optimize developmental outcomes for infants at risk of ASD. This perspective offers a promising framework for future research and clinical practice.", "label": 1}
