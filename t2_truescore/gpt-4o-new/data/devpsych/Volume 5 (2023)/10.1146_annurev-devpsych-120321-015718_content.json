{"grounding": "In the United States, race is a critical factor in determining how children experience and navigate their social worlds. Developmental scientists have examined the complexities and nuances of how children develop an understanding of what race means for them and others as well as their attitudes toward people of other racial groups. We provide an overview of the literature on two approaches to understanding children's racial learning\u2014sociocognitive approaches, which focus on various aspects of children's understanding of, beliefs about, and attitudes toward race and racial groups, and socialization perspectives, which examine the messages that socialization agents transmit to children about race. Throughout, we highlight the ways in which the persistence of structural and interpersonal racism in the United States forms the background context for children's racial learning.", "generated_text": "This study synthesizes research on the cognitive mechanisms and socialization processes that underpin children's racial learning. By integrating findings from developmental psychology, sociology, and education, we explore how ethnic-racial socialization influences children's understanding of race. The review highlights the role of family, peers, and media in shaping racial attitudes and identities, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between individual cognitive development and social context. We discuss how children internalize racial norms and stereotypes through direct and indirect socialization practices, and how these processes vary across different cultural and socio-economic environments. The paper calls for a more nuanced understanding of racial learning, advocating for interventions that promote positive racial identity and intergroup relations from an early age. Future research directions are proposed to further elucidate these complex interactions.", "label": 1}
