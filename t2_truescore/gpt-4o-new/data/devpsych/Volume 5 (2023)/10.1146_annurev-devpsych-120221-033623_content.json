{"grounding": "Life-course epidemiologists have developed sophisticated models for how exposures throughout life\u2014from gestation to old age\u2014shape health, sometimes years after the exposure occurred. The field, however, has been slow to adopt robust causal inference methods, including quasi-experimental designs. This reflects, at least in part, a tension between (a) study designs that maximize our ability to make causal claims and (b) exposure operationalizations that correspond with life-course theories. In this narrative review, we attempt to mitigate that tension. We first discuss the unique challenges for causal inference in life-course epidemiology. We then outline how quasi-experimental methods have already contributed to testing life-course theories, as well as the limitations of the quasi-experimental methods therein. We close with solutions that bridge the gap between modern developments in causal inference and life-course epidemiology, including redefined estimands to maximize public health impact; marginal structural and structural nested models; longitudinal instrumental variables approaches; leveraging new data linkages, such as with detailed residential histories; and triangulation across methods, including adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference.", "generated_text": "The intersection of life-course epidemiology and causal inference presents a unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of health trajectories and their determinants. This paper explores the methodological tensions that arise when integrating these two fields, particularly focusing on the challenges and opportunities in applying causal inference techniques to life-course data. We examine the potential of quantitative methods, such as natural experiments, to address these challenges and provide robust insights into the causal pathways influencing health outcomes over time. By critically analyzing existing literature and case studies, we identify key areas where life-course epidemiology can benefit from the rigorous application of causal inference methods. Furthermore, we propose a framework for bridging the divide between these disciplines, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and methodological innovation. Our findings suggest that a more integrated approach can lead to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between biological, social, and environmental factors across the lifespan, ultimately informing more effective public health interventions and policies.", "label": 1}
