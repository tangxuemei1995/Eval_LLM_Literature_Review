{"grounding": "Cognitive control is defined as a set of processes required for the organization of goal-directed thoughts and actions. It is linked to success throughout life including health, wealth, and social capital. How to support the development of cognitive control is therefore an intensively discussed topic. Progress in understanding how this critical life skill can be optimally scaffolded in long-lasting ways has been disappointing. I argue that this effort has been hampered by the predominant perspective that cognitive control is a competence or ability, the development of which is driven by predetermined maturational sequences. I propose that this traditional view needs to be overhauled in light of a growing body of evidence suggesting that cognitive control allocation is a both highly dynamic and rational process subject to cost\u2013benefit analyses from early in development. I discuss the ramifications of shifting our perspective on cognitive control mechanisms in relation to how we design interventions. I close by spelling out new avenues for scientific inquiry.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development of cognitive control in childhood through a rational account framework, emphasizing the interplay between competence and maturation. Cognitive control, the ability to regulate thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals, is crucial for adaptive behavior and undergoes significant development during childhood. We propose that this development can be understood as a rational adaptation to the expected value of control in varying contexts. By integrating theories of cognitive maturation with models of rational decision-making, we provide a comprehensive account of how children optimize their cognitive resources. Our analysis suggests that the observed improvements in cognitive control are not merely a result of increased competence but also reflect strategic adaptations to environmental demands. This perspective offers new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive control development and highlights the importance of considering both biological maturation and experiential factors. The findings have implications for educational strategies and interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive control in children.", "label": 1}
