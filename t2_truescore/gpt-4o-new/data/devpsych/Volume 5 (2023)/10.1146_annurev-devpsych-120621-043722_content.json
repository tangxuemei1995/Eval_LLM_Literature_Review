{"grounding": "Four decades of research have examined the antecedents and consequences of behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament profile associated with heightened reactivity to sensory stimuli in infancy, reticence toward social cues in childhood, and the later emergence of social anxiety in adolescence. This review proposes that a two-hit model can supplement prior work to better understand these developmental pathways. Specifically, time limited experiences (\u201chits\u201d) centered in infancy and adolescence stress idiosyncratic BI-linked processes that uniquely trigger the developmental pathway from temperament to disorder. To illustrate, we focus on caregiver distress in infancy (including fetal development), social reorientation in adolescence, and their impact on malleable attentional and cognitive systems. These are developmental challenges and processes that go to the heart of the BI phenotype. Finally, we note open questions in this conceptual model, potential caveats, and needed future research.", "generated_text": "The two-hit model of behavioral inhibition and anxiety posits that the interplay between early-life temperament and later environmental stressors contributes to the development of anxiety disorders. This study explores the developmental origins of anxiety by examining the role of behavioral inhibition in infancy and its interaction with stressors during adolescence. Behavioral inhibition, characterized by heightened sensitivity to novelty and withdrawal from unfamiliar situations, is identified as a potential first 'hit' that predisposes individuals to anxiety. The second 'hit' involves environmental challenges or stressors encountered during adolescence, a critical period for emotional and cognitive development. By integrating findings from longitudinal studies and neurobiological research, this model provides a framework for understanding how early temperament and later experiences jointly influence anxiety trajectories. The implications for early intervention and prevention strategies targeting at-risk populations are discussed, highlighting the importance of addressing both genetic and environmental factors in anxiety development.", "label": 1}
