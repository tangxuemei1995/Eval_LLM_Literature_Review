{"grounding": "Cognitive flexibility, or the ability to mentally switch between tasks according to changing environmental demands, supports optimal life outcomes, making it an important executive function to study across development. Here we review the literature examining the development of cognitive flexibility, with an emphasis on studies using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The neuroimaging literature suggests that key brain regions important for cognitive flexibility include the inferior frontal junction and regions within the midcingulo-insular network, including the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices. We further discuss challenges surrounding studying cognitive flexibility during neurodevelopment, including inconsistent terminology, the diversity of fMRI task paradigms, difficulties with isolating cognitive flexibility from other executive functions, and accounting for developmental changes in cognitive strategy. Future directions include assessing how developmental changes in brain network dynamics enable cognitive flexibility and examining potential modulators of cognitive flexibility including physical activity and bilingualism.", "generated_text": "Cognitive flexibility, a core component of executive function, is crucial for adaptive behavior and problem-solving. This review synthesizes recent advancements in developmental neuroimaging studies focusing on cognitive flexibility, particularly through task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We explore how neural substrates supporting cognitive flexibility evolve from childhood through adolescence, highlighting the maturation of prefrontal and parietal cortices. Emerging evidence suggests that these regions undergo significant structural and functional changes, facilitating improved cognitive flexibility. We also discuss methodological advancements in task fMRI that enhance our understanding of the dynamic neural processes underlying cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, we identify gaps in current research, such as the need for longitudinal studies and the integration of multimodal imaging techniques. Future directions include exploring the impact of environmental and genetic factors on the neurodevelopment of cognitive flexibility, aiming to inform interventions that support optimal cognitive development.", "label": 1}
