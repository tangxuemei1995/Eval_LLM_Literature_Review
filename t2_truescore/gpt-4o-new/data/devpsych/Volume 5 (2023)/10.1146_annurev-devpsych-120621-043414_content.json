{"grounding": "This is an evaluative review of the field of prenatal substance exposure, with a focus on neurobiological and behavioral outcomes from infancy to young adulthood. We provide an overall evaluation of the state of the field and comment on current conceptual and methodological issues in need of attention. Although there are many studies of prenatal substance exposure, developmental frameworks that incorporate and reflect the lived experiences of children and families have seldom been employed in this field. In addition, although there are some common effects (e.g., on fetal growth) between major substances, there are also unique effects. Thus, we discuss the role of specific substances but note that polysubstance exposure is common, and models and methods used to date may not be sufficient to advance understanding of coexposure or polyexposure effects. We discuss these conceptual and methodological weaknesses and provide suggestions for future directions.", "generated_text": "Prenatal substance exposure is a critical area of research due to its significant implications for developmental outcomes. This study examines the impact of prenatal adversity, particularly focusing on substance use during pregnancy, on early childhood development. The research synthesizes findings from recent literature to explore how exposure to substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs can affect fetal development and lead to long-term cognitive, behavioral, and health challenges. By analyzing data from various cohort studies, the research highlights the mechanisms through which prenatal substance exposure contributes to early adversity and its subsequent effects on developmental trajectories. The findings underscore the importance of early intervention and support for pregnant individuals to mitigate adverse outcomes. This study aims to inform healthcare policies and practices to better address the needs of affected populations, ultimately improving developmental outcomes for children exposed to prenatal substance use.", "label": 0}
