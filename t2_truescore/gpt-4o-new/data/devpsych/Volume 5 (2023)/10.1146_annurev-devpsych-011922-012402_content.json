{"grounding": "Poverty is associated with changes in brain development and elevates the risk for psychopathology in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Although the field is rapidly expanding, there are methodological challenges that raise questions about the validity of current findings. These challenges include the interrelated issues of reliability, effect size, interindividual heterogeneity, and replicability. To address these issues, we propose a multipronged approach that spans short-, medium-, and long-term solutions, including changes to data pipelines along with more comprehensive data acquisition of environment, brain, and mental health. Additional suggestions are to use open science approaches, more robust statistical analyses, and replication testing. Furthermore, we propose increased integration between advanced analytical approaches using large samples and neuroscience models in intervention research to enhance the interpretability of findings. Collectively, these approaches will expand the application of neuroimaging findings and provide a foundation for eventual policy changes designed to improve conditions for children in poverty.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intricate relationship between poverty, brain development, and mental health, emphasizing recent advancements and ongoing challenges in the field. Adversity, often stemming from socioeconomic deprivation, has been shown to significantly impact neurodevelopmental trajectories, as evidenced by neuroimaging studies. These studies reveal alterations in brain structures and functions associated with developmental psychopathology, including anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairments. Despite these insights, the field faces challenges related to replicability and reproducibility of findings, which are crucial for establishing robust scientific evidence. Methodological improvements and larger, more diverse sample sizes are needed to enhance the reliability of research outcomes. The review also highlights potential paths forward, including interdisciplinary approaches and policy interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of poverty on brain development. By addressing these challenges, the research community can better inform strategies to promote mental health and resilience in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.", "label": 1}
