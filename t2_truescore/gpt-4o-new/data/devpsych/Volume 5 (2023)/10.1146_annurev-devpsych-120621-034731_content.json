{"grounding": "All human societies are permeated by collectively shared entities that govern daily social interactions and promote coordination and cooperation: norms. While the study of norm development is not new to developmental psychology, it has only recently been the target of an interdisciplinary wave of research using new methodologies and (often) complementary theoretical accounts to describe and explain the origins and potentially species-unique aspects of human norm psychology. Here we review recent developmental research showing that young children swiftly acquire and infer norms in a variety of social contexts. Moreover, children actively enforce these norms, even as unaffected bystanders, when third parties do things the wrong way. This research suggests that the foundations of human norm psychology can be found in early childhood. Deeper insights into the ontogenetic roots of norm psychology may contribute to understanding the evolutionary emergence of human cooperation and its maintenance in the contemporary world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate process by which young children acquire and apply social norms, a fundamental aspect of norm psychology and social-cognitive development. By examining the mechanisms through which children internalize and enact norms, the research highlights the interplay between normativity and morality in early childhood. The study employs a multi-method approach, integrating observational data, experimental tasks, and parental reports to assess children's understanding and application of norms in various social contexts. Findings suggest that children as young as three years old demonstrate a sophisticated grasp of normative concepts, which they apply to guide their behavior and evaluate the actions of others. The results underscore the role of social interactions and cultural context in shaping children's normative understanding. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the developmental trajectory of norm acquisition and its implications for moral development, offering insights into the foundational aspects of human social behavior.", "label": 1}
