{"grounding": "This review aims to present recent developments in modeling and control of multiagent systems. A particular focus is set on crowd dynamics characterized by complex interactions among agents, also called social interactions, and large-scale systems. Specifically, in a crowd each individual agent interacts with a field generated by the other agents and the environment. These systems can be modeled at the microscopic scale by ordinary differential equations, while an alternative description at the mesoscopic scale is given by a partial differential equation for the propagation of the probability density of the agents. Control actions can be applied at the individual level as well as at the level of the corresponding fields. This article presents and compares different control types, and the specific application to multilane, multiclass traffic is developed in some detail, showing the main tools at work in a hybrid setting with relevant impacts on autonomous driving.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the modeling and control of multiagent systems, with a focus on crowd dynamics. By examining interacting agent systems, we explore the mean-field limit as a powerful tool for understanding the collective behavior of large populations of agents. The research highlights the importance of feedback control mechanisms in managing and directing the flow of autonomous vehicles within these systems. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and computational simulations, we demonstrate how feedback control can be effectively employed to enhance system stability and efficiency. The findings provide insights into optimizing the movement and coordination of autonomous vehicles, which are increasingly prevalent in modern transportation networks. This work contributes to the broader understanding of crowd dynamics and offers practical solutions for the control of complex multiagent systems, paving the way for advancements in autonomous vehicle technology and smart city infrastructure.", "label": 1}
