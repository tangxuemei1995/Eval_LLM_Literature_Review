{"grounding": "While noise is generally associated with uncertainties and often has a negative connotation in engineering, living organisms have evolved to adapt to (and even exploit) such uncertainty to ensure the survival of a species or implement certain functions that would have been difficult or even impossible otherwise. In this article, we review the role and impact of noise in systems and synthetic biology, with a particular emphasis on its role in the genetic control of biological systems, an area we refer to as cybergenetics. The main modeling paradigm is that of stochastic reaction networks, whose applicability goes beyond biology, as these networks can represent any population dynamics system, including ecological, epidemiological, and opinion dynamics networks. We review different ways to mathematically represent these systems, and we notably argue that the concept of ergodicity presents a particularly suitable way to characterize their stability. We then discuss noise-induced properties and show that noise can be both an asset and a nuisance in this setting. Finally, we discuss recent results on (stochastic) cybergenetics and explore their relationships to noise. Along the way, we detail the different technical and biological constraints that need to be respected when designing synthetic biological circuits. Finally, we discuss the concepts, problems, and solutions exposed in the article; raise criticisms and concerns about current ideas and approaches; suggest current (open) problems with potential solutions; and provide some ideas for future research directions.", "generated_text": "The study of noise in biomolecular systems has emerged as a pivotal area of research, bridging the gap between theoretical modeling and practical applications in synthetic biology. This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of noise within reaction networks, employing stochastic processes to model the inherent variability observed in biological systems. By integrating principles from systems and control theory, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing and mitigating the effects of noise in biomolecular circuits. The concept of cybergenetics is introduced as a novel approach to harnessing feedback control mechanisms, enabling the precise regulation of gene expression and other cellular processes. Through a series of computational simulations and experimental validations, we demonstrate the potential of these methodologies to enhance the robustness and reliability of synthetic biological systems. Our findings underscore the importance of considering noise not merely as a challenge but as an integral component that can be strategically manipulated to achieve desired outcomes in synthetic biology. The implications of this research extend to the design of more efficient and adaptable biological circuits, with potential applications in biotechnology, medicine, and environmental engineering. By advancing our understanding of noise in biomolecular systems, this study lays the groundwork for future innovations in the field, highlighting the critical role of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex biological phenomena.", "label": 1}
