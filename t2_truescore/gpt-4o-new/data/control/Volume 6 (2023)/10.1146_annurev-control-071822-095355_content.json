{"grounding": "Approximately 1.1. billion people worldwide live with some form of disability, and assistive technology has the potential to increase their overall quality of life. However, the end users\u2019 perspective and needs are often not sufficiently considered during the development of this technology, leading to frustration and nonuse of existing devices. Since its first competition in 2016, CYBATHLON has aimed to drive innovation in the field of assistive technology by motivating teams to involve end users more actively in the development process and to tailor novel devices to their actual daily-life needs. Competition tasks therefore represent unsolved daily-life challenges for people with disabilities and serve the purpose of benchmarking the latest developments from research laboratories and companies from around the world. This review describes each of the competition disciplines, their contributions to assistive technology, and remaining challenges in the user-centered development of this technology.", "generated_text": "The CYBATHLON competition has emerged as a pivotal platform for advancing assistive technologies through its unique focus on user-centered design and real-world applicability. By challenging teams to develop devices that address daily-life obstacles faced by people with disabilities, the competition fosters innovation that prioritizes inclusivity and practical utility. This paper examines the impact of CYBATHLON on the evolution of assistive technologies, highlighting how the event encourages collaboration between engineers, designers, and end-users. The competition's emphasis on real-world scenarios ensures that the technologies developed are not only technically advanced but also tailored to the specific needs of users, promoting greater independence and quality of life. Through case studies and analysis of past competitions, this study underscores the role of CYBATHLON in driving technological advancements and fostering a more inclusive society, where assistive devices are seamlessly integrated into the daily lives of individuals with disabilities.", "label": 1}
