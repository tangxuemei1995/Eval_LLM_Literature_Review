{"grounding": "Surface tension effects are known to be dominant at the submillimeter scale. Within this context, the literature has extensively described the underlying physics (e.g., surface tension, wetting, surface texturation, and coatings), and capillary forces have been exploited in a variety of applications (e.g., capillary picking, self-alignment, capillary sealing, and capillary bearings). As several stimuli can be used to control liquid menisci, these forces have been used mainly in microrobotics in open loop (i.e., without real-time feedback). However, at least two major sources of uncertainty hinder these forces from working properly in open loop: the variability due to contact-angle hysteresis (the difference between wetting and unwetting) and the variability in the involved volume of liquid. To be able to reject these disturbances, successful sensor integration and associated advanced control schemes need to be embedded in capillary microrobotic microsystems. This article analyzes research contributions in this field from three different perspectives: the stimulus action of the surface tension effect (light, B-field, etc.), the application field (actuation, picking, sealing, etc.), and the sensing and control schemes. Technologically complex developments coexist with elegant and straightforward engineering solutions. Biological aspects of surface tension are not included in this review.", "generated_text": "The burgeoning field of microrobotics has witnessed significant advancements, yet the manipulation and control of micro-scale entities remain challenging due to the dominance of surface forces over inertial forces at such scales. This study explores the potential of exploiting liquid surface tension and capillary forces to enhance micromanipulation techniques in microrobotics. By leveraging the inherent properties of surface tension, microrobots can achieve precise control and movement, facilitating tasks such as assembly, transport, and positioning of micro-objects. The research delves into the theoretical underpinnings of capillary interactions and their practical applications in microrobotic systems. Experimental setups demonstrate how microrobots can utilize surface tension to navigate complex environments, manipulate objects with high precision, and perform tasks that are otherwise challenging with traditional methods. The findings suggest that integrating surface tension-based strategies can significantly improve the efficiency and versatility of microrobots, opening new avenues for applications in biomedical engineering, micro-assembly, and environmental monitoring. This study not only highlights the potential of surface tension as a tool for microrobotic innovation but also sets the stage for future research into harnessing other micro-scale forces for advanced robotic functionalities.", "label": 0}
