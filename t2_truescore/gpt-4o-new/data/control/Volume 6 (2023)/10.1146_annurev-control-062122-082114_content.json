{"grounding": "Space-mounted robotics is becoming increasingly mainstream for many space missions. The aim of this article is threefold: first, to give a broad and quick overview of the importance of spacecraft-mounted robotics for future in-orbit servicing missions; second, to review the basic current approaches for modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic systems; and third, to introduce some new developments in terms of modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators using the language of hypercomplex numbers (dual quaternions). Some outstanding research questions and potential future directions in the field are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of robotics on spacecraft for enhanced in-orbit servicing capabilities. Focusing on manipulators, we address the challenges of control and trajectory tracking using dual quaternions to model dynamics and kinematics. Our approach improves precision in robotic movements, essential for tasks such as satellite repair and debris removal. By leveraging advanced control algorithms, we demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of robotic operations in space environments. This research contributes to the development of autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks in the challenging conditions of outer space.", "label": 0}
