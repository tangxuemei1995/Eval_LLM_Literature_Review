{"grounding": "Networked control systems, where feedback loops are closed over communication networks, arise in several domains, including smart energy grids, autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and many industrial and robotic systems active in service, production, agriculture, and smart homes and cities. In these settings, the two main layers of the system, control and communication, strongly affect each other's performance, and they also reveal the interaction between a cyber-system component, represented by information-based computing and communication technologies, and a physical-system component, represented by the environment that needs to be controlled. The information access and distribution constraints required to achieve reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems have been intensively studied over the course of roughly two decades. This article reviews some of the cornerstone results in this area, draws a map for what we have learned over these years, and describes the new challenges that we will face in the future. Rather than simply listing different results, we present them in a coherent fashion using a uniform notation, and we also put them in context, highlighting both their theoreticalinsights and their practical significance. Particular attention is given to recent developments related to decentralized estimation in distributed sensing and communication systems and the information-theoretic value of event timing in the context of networked control.", "generated_text": "In the realm of networked control systems (NCS), the interplay between information and control is pivotal, especially under the constraints imposed by communication networks. This paper delves into the multifaceted role of information in the estimation and control of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where communication constraints pose significant challenges. We explore how decentralized inference can be optimized by leveraging timing information and event-triggered mechanisms to enhance system performance. The study highlights the importance of timing information as a critical component in the design of control strategies, enabling more efficient use of limited communication resources. Event triggering is examined as a method to reduce unnecessary data transmission, thereby conserving bandwidth and energy while maintaining system stability and performance. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate how these strategies can be integrated into NCS to achieve robust control and estimation despite the inherent limitations of networked environments. The findings underscore the necessity of a holistic approach that considers the intricate balance between information flow and control actions, paving the way for more resilient and efficient CPS. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on optimizing control under communication constraints, offering insights that are crucial for the development of next-generation networked systems.", "label": 1}
