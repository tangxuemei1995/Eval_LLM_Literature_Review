{"grounding": "Soft robots\u2019 flexibility and compliance give them the potential to outperform traditional rigid-bodied robots while performing multiple tasks in unexpectedly changing environments and conditions. However, soft robots are yet to reveal their full potential; nature is still far more advanced in several areas, such as locomotion and manipulation. To understand what limits their performance and hinders their transition from laboratory to real-world conditions, future studies should focus on understanding the principles behind the design and operation of soft robots. Such studies should also consider the major challenges with regard to complex materials, accurate modeling, advanced control, and intelligent behaviors. As a starting point for such studies, this review provides a current overview of the field by examining the working mechanisms of advanced actuation and sensing modalities, modeling techniques, control strategies, and learning architectures for soft robots. Next, we summarize how these approaches can be applied to create sophisticated soft robots and examine their application areas. Finally, we provide future perspectives on what key challenges should be tackled first to advance soft robotics to truly add value to our society.", "generated_text": "Soft robotics is an emerging field that focuses on the design and development of robots constructed from highly compliant materials, enabling them to perform tasks in unstructured environments with enhanced adaptability and safety. This overview examines the key components of soft robotics, including actuation, sensing, and control, which are crucial for achieving complex manipulation and locomotion. The integration of advanced materials and novel design principles allows for the creation of soft actuators that mimic biological systems, offering unique advantages in robotic interaction. Simulation and modeling play a pivotal role in predicting the behavior of soft robots, facilitating the optimization of their design and functionality. Machine learning techniques are increasingly employed to enhance the control strategies of soft robots, enabling them to learn from their environment and improve their performance over time. This paper also explores the challenges and future directions in the field, emphasizing the potential of soft robotics to revolutionize applications in healthcare, search and rescue, and human-robot interaction. The synergy between interdisciplinary approaches is essential for advancing the capabilities and applications of soft robotic systems.", "label": 1}
