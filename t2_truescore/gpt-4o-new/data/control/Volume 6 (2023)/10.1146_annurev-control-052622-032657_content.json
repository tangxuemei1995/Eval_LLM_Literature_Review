{"grounding": "Electric power systems are undergoing an unprecedented transition from fossil fuel\u2013based power plants to low-inertia systems that rely predominantly on power electronics and renewable energy resources. This article reviews the resulting control challenges and modeling fallacies, at both the device and system level, and focuses on novel aspects or classical concepts that need to be revised in light of the transition to low-inertia systems. To this end, we survey the literature on modeling of low-inertia systems, review research on the control of grid-connected power converters, and discuss the frequency dynamics of low-inertia systems. Moreover, we discuss system-level services from a control perspective. Overall, we conclude that the system-theoretic mindset is essential to bridge different research communities and understand the complex interactions of power electronics, electric machines, and their controls in large-scale low-inertia power systems.", "generated_text": "The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and power electronics in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, posing challenges for grid stability and control. This study explores advanced control strategies for low-inertia power systems, focusing on grid-forming control and dynamic virtual power plants. By leveraging power electronics control, these strategies aim to enhance system resilience and maintain frequency stability. The research investigates the dynamic interactions between grid-forming units and conventional generators, proposing novel control algorithms to optimize performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in mitigating frequency deviations and improving overall system reliability. The findings contribute to the development of robust control frameworks essential for the transition towards sustainable and resilient power systems in the face of increasing renewable penetration.", "label": 1}
