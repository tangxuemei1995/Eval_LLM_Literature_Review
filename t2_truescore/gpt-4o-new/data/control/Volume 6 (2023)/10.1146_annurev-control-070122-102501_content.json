{"grounding": "Early research on physical human\u2013robot interaction (pHRI) has necessarily focused on device design\u2014the creation of compliant and sensorized hardware, such as exoskeletons, prostheses, and robot arms, that enables people to safely come in contact with robotic systems and to communicate about their collaborative intent. As hardware capabilities have become sufficient for many applications, and as computing has become more powerful, algorithms that support fluent and expressive use of pHRI systems have begun to play a prominent role in determining the systems\u2019 usefulness. In this review, we describe a selection of representative algorithmic approaches that regulate and interpret pHRI, describing the progression from algorithms based on physical analogies, such as admittance control, to computational methods based on higher-level reasoning, which take advantage of multimodal communication channels. Existing algorithmic approaches largely enable task-specific pHRI, but they do not generalize to versatile human\u2013robot collaboration. Throughout the review and in our discussion of next steps, we therefore argue that emergent embodied dialogue\u2014bidirectional, multimodal communication that can be learned through continuous interaction\u2014is one of the next frontiers of pHRI.", "generated_text": "The study of embodied communication in human\u2013robot collaboration is gaining traction as robots become increasingly integrated into daily life and work environments. This research explores the dynamics of physical interaction between humans and assistive robots, emphasizing the role of embodied communication in enhancing collaborative efficiency and user experience. By analyzing various interaction scenarios, the study identifies key factors that influence successful communication, such as the robot's ability to interpret human gestures, postures, and tactile feedback. The findings suggest that effective embodied communication can significantly improve task performance and user satisfaction, particularly in assistive contexts where physical interaction is paramount. The research also highlights the importance of designing robots with advanced sensory and processing capabilities to facilitate intuitive and seamless interactions. This work contributes to the broader understanding of human\u2013robot collaboration by providing insights into the mechanisms of physical communication and offering guidelines for the development of more responsive and adaptive robotic systems. Future research directions include exploring the impact of cultural and individual differences on embodied communication and further refining interaction models for diverse applications.", "label": 0}
