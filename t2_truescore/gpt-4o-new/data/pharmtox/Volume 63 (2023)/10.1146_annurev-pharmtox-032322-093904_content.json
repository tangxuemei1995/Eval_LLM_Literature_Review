{"grounding": "The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, which comprises 22 structurally related proteins, plays diverse roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and metabolism. Among them, two classical members (FGF1 and FGF4) and two endocrine members (FGF19 and FGF21) are important regulators of whole-body energy homeostasis, glucose/lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of these FGFs for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Several genetically engineered FGF19 and FGF21 analogs with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties have been developed and progressed into various stages of clinical trials. These FGF analogs are effective in alleviating hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients, whereas their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects are mildand vary greatly in different clinical trials. This review summarizes recent advances in biopharmaceutical development of FGF-based therapies against obesity-related metabolic complications, highlights major challenges in clinical implementation, and discusses possible strategies to overcome these hurdles.", "generated_text": "Obesity and its associated metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, represent a significant global health challenge. Recent advances in understanding the role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in metabolic regulation have opened new avenues for therapeutic interventions. FGFs, particularly FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, have shown promise in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism, offering potential benefits for obesity-related conditions. This review explores the development of FGF-based pharmacotherapies, including recombinant proteins and agonistic antibodies, which aim to harness the metabolic regulatory properties of FGFs. These protein therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials, showing improvements in insulin sensitivity, weight reduction, and lipid profiles. However, challenges remain in optimizing their pharmacokinetics and minimizing adverse effects. Continued research is essential to fully elucidate the mechanisms of FGFs and to develop safe, effective treatments for obesity and its metabolic complications. This paper highlights the potential of FGF-based therapies as a novel approach in obesity management.", "label": 1}
