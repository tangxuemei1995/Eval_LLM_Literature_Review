{"grounding": "Early human life is considered a critical window of susceptibility to external exposures. Infants are exposed to a multitude of environmental factors, collectively referred to as the exposome. The chemical exposome can be summarized as the sum of all xenobiotics that humans are exposed to throughout a lifetime. We review different exposure classes and routes that impact fetal and infant metabolism and the potential toxicological role of mixture effects. We also discuss the progress in human biomonitoring and present possiblemodels for studying maternal\u2013fetal transfer. Data gaps on prenatal and infant exposure to xenobiotic mixtures are identified and include natural biotoxins, in addition to commonly reported synthetic toxicants, to obtain a more holistic assessment of the chemical exposome. We highlight the lack of large-scale studies covering a broad range of xenobiotics. Several recommendations to advance our understanding of the early-life chemical exposome and the subsequent impact on health outcomes are proposed.", "generated_text": "The chemical exposome encompasses the totality of environmental chemical exposures that individuals encounter throughout their lifetime, with significant implications during fetal development and early childhood. This review synthesizes current research on the chemical exposome, focusing on prenatal exposure to xenobiotics and natural contaminants. Human biomonitoring studies reveal that the placenta, while a partial barrier, allows the transfer of various chemicals, potentially affecting fetal development. The review highlights the critical windows of susceptibility during gestation and early childhood, where exposure to environmental chemicals can lead to adverse health outcomes. It also discusses methodological advancements in biomonitoring and analytical techniques that enhance our understanding of the exposome. By integrating data from epidemiological studies and mechanistic research, this review underscores the need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate exposure risks and protect vulnerable populations. Future research directions include refining exposure assessment methods and elucidating the complex interactions between chemical exposures and biological systems.", "label": 1}
