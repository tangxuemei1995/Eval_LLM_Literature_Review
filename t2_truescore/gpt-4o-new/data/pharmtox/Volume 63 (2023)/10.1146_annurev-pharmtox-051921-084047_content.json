{"grounding": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are endogenous lipid mediators that are synthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during the acute phase or resolution phase of inflammation. Synthetic SPMs possess broad safety profiles and exhibit potent actions in resolving inflammation in preclinical models. Accumulating evidence in the past decade has demonstrated powerful analgesia of exogenous SPMs in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain. Furthermore, endogenous SPMs are produced by sham surgery and neuromodulation (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation). SPMs produce their beneficial actions through multiple G protein\u2013coupled receptors, expressed by immune cells, glial cells, and neurons. Notably, loss of SPM receptors impairs the resolution of pain. I also highlight the emerging role of SPMs in the control of itch. Pharmacological targeting of SPMs or SPM receptors has the potential to lead to novel therapeutics for pain and itch as emerging approaches in resolution pharmacology.", "generated_text": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, represent a novel class of bioactive lipids with potential therapeutic applications in pain and itch management. This study explores the role of SPMs, including resolvins and neuroprotectins, in modulating neuroimmune interactions and their impact on nociceptive sensory neurons. By targeting transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, SPMs offer a unique mechanism for attenuating pain and itch, distinct from traditional anti-inflammatory drugs. The research highlights the ability of SPMs to promote resolution pharmacology, facilitating the return to homeostasis without immunosuppression. Through neuroimmune modulation, SPMs can effectively reduce the activation and sensitization of nociceptive pathways, offering a promising strategy for chronic pain and itch conditions. This review underscores the therapeutic potential of SPMs in clinical settings, advocating for further investigation into their mechanisms and applications in neuroimmune-related disorders.", "label": 1}
