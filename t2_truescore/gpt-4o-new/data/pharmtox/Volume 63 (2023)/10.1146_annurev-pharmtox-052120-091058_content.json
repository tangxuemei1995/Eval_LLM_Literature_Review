{"grounding": "In ligand bias different agonist drugs are thought to produce distinct signaling outputs when activating the same receptor. If these signaling outputs mediate therapeutic versus adverse drug effects, then agonists that selectively activate the therapeutic signaling pathway would be extremely beneficial. It has long been thought that \u03bc-opioid receptor agonists that selectively activate G protein\u2013 over \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways would produce effective analgesia without the adverse effects such as respiratory depression. However, more recent data indicate that most of the therapeutic and adverse effects of agonist-induced activation of the \u03bc-opioid receptor are actually mediated by the G protein\u2013dependent signaling pathway, and that a number of drugs described as G protein biased in fact may not be biased, but instead may be low-intrinsic-efficacy agonists. In this review we discuss the current state of the field of bias at the \u03bc-opioid receptor and other opioid receptor subtypes.", "generated_text": "Biased agonism at opioid receptors represents a promising avenue for developing analgesics with reduced side effects. This concept involves the preferential activation of specific signaling pathways by different ligands binding to the same receptor. In the context of opioid receptors, ligand bias typically refers to the differential activation of G protein versus \u03b2-arrestin pathways. Studies have shown that G protein-biased agonists can provide effective pain relief while minimizing adverse effects such as respiratory depression and constipation, which are often associated with \u03b2-arrestin pathway activation. Recent advances in structural biology and pharmacology have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand bias, offering insights into receptor conformational changes and signaling dynamics. This review synthesizes current findings on opioid receptor biased agonism, highlighting the therapeutic potential and challenges in designing selective ligands that exploit this phenomenon for improved clinical outcomes.", "label": 1}
