{"grounding": "The actions of estrogens and related estrogenic molecules are complex and multifaceted in both sexes. A wide array of natural, synthetic, and therapeutic molecules target pathways that produce and respond to estrogens. Multiple receptors promulgate these responses, including the classical estrogen receptors of the nuclear hormone receptor family (estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2), which function largely as ligand-activated transcription factors, and the 7-transmembrane G protein\u2013coupled estrogen receptor, GPER, which activates a diverse array of signaling pathways. The pharmacology and functional roles of GPER in physiology and disease reveal important roles in responses to both natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds in numerous physiological systems. These functions have implications in the treatment of myriad disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. This review focuses on the complex pharmacology of GPER and summarizes major physiological functions of GPER and the therapeutic implications and ongoing applications of GPER-targeted compounds.", "generated_text": "The G protein\u2013coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has emerged as a pivotal player in the non-genomic signaling pathways of estrogen, influencing a wide array of physiological processes. This review delves into the molecular pharmacology of GPER, highlighting its role in modulating cellular responses across various systems. In cancer, GPER's involvement in tumor progression and metastasis presents novel therapeutic targets. Cardiovascular research underscores GPER's protective effects against atherosclerosis and hypertension, while in the endocrine system, it mediates metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, GPER's influence on immune responses suggests potential in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The receptor's diverse roles in metabolism, immunity, and disease pathogenesis underscore its therapeutic potential. This comprehensive analysis of GPER's molecular mechanisms and pharmacological applications aims to inform future research and clinical strategies, advancing the development of GPER-targeted therapies for a range of conditions.", "label": 1}
