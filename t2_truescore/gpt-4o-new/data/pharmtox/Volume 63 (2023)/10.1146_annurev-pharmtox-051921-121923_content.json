{"grounding": "Phosphatases and kinases maintain an equilibrium of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins, respectively, that are required for critical cellular functions. Imbalance in this equilibrium or irregularity in their function causes unfavorable cellular effects that have been implicated in the development of numerous diseases. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) catalyze the dephosphorylation of protein substrates on tyrosine residues, and their involvement in cell signaling and diseases such as cancer and inflammatory and metabolic diseases has made them attractive therapeutic targets. However, PTPs have proved challenging in therapeutics development, garnering them the unfavorable reputation of being undruggable. Nonetheless, great strides have been made toward the inhibition of PTPs over the past decade. Here, we discuss the advancement in small-molecule inhibition for the PTP subfamily known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs). We review strategies and inhibitor discovery tools that have proven successful for small-molecule inhibition of the MKPs and discuss what the future of MKP inhibition potentially might yield.", "generated_text": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs), a subset of dual specificity protein phosphatases, play a crucial role in the regulation of cell signaling pathways by deactivating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Historically considered 'undruggable' due to their highly conserved active sites and the challenge of achieving specificity, recent advances have shifted this paradigm. This review explores the emerging strategies targeting MKPs, focusing on the identification of allosteric sites that offer new avenues for the development of selective small molecule inhibitors. These inhibitors have the potential to modulate MKP activity with high specificity, thereby influencing MAPK-driven cellular processes implicated in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorders. The discovery of these allosteric sites, coupled with advances in computational modeling and high-throughput screening, has revitalized interest in MKPs as viable therapeutic targets. This progress underscores the potential of MKP inhibitors to become a new class of drugs, offering promising therapeutic benefits in disease modulation.", "label": 1}
