{"grounding": "Modern antiretroviral therapy safely, potently, and durably suppresses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that, if left untreated, predictably causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which has been responsible for tens of millions of deaths globally since it was described in 1981. In one of the most extraordinary medical success stories in modern times, a combination of pioneering basic science, innovative drug development, and ambitious public health programming resulted in access to lifesaving, safe drugs, taken as an oral tablet daily, for most of the world. However, substantial challenges remain in the fields of prevention, timely access to diagnosis, and treatment, especially in pediatric and adolescent patients. As HIV-positive adults age, treating their comorbidities will require understanding the course of different chronic diseases complicated by HIV-related and antiretroviral toxicities and finding potential treatments. Finally, new long-acting antiretrovirals on the horizon promise exciting new options in both the prevention and treatment fields.", "generated_text": "The global fight against HIV/AIDS has made significant strides with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet achieving universal access remains a formidable challenge. This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap to attain universal antiretroviral treatment, aligning with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets: 90% of people living with HIV knowing their status, 90% of diagnosed individuals receiving sustained ART, and 90% of those on ART achieving viral suppression. Key strategies include enhancing diagnostic capabilities, optimizing ART regimens for efficacy and tolerability, and addressing socio-economic barriers to access. The roadmap emphasizes the importance of health system strengthening, community engagement, and innovative financing mechanisms. Additionally, it highlights the role of reconstitution of immune function as a critical outcome of effective ART. By integrating these approaches, the roadmap aims to not only curb the HIV epidemic but also improve the quality of life for millions affected by the disease globally.", "label": 0}
