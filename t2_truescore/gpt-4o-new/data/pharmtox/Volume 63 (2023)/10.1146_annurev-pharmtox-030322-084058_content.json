{"grounding": "The coordinated movement of organic anions (e.g., drugs, metabolites, signaling molecules, nutrients, antioxidants, gut microbiome products) between tissues and body fluids depends, in large part, on organic anion transporters (OATs) [solute carrier 22 (SLC22)], organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) [solute carrier organic (SLCO)], and multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) [ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C (ABCC)]. Depending on the range of substrates, transporters in these families can be considered multispecific, oligospecific, or (relatively) monospecific. Systems biology analyses of these transporters in the context of expression patterns reveal they are hubs in networks involved in interorgan and interorganismal communication. The remote sensing and signaling theory explains how the coordinated functions of drug transporters, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and regulatory proteins play a role in optimizing systemic and local levels of important endogenous small molecules. We focus on the role of OATs, OATPs, and MRPs in endogenous metabolism and how their substrates (e.g., bile acids, short chain fatty acids, urate, uremic toxins) mediate interorgan and interorganismal communication and help maintain and restore homeostasis in healthy and disease states.", "generated_text": "The remote sensing and signaling theory posits that drug transporters play a crucial role in inter-organ communication, influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This study explores the involvement of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP2, MRP4) in this theory. These transporters, encoded by genes such as SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, ABCC2, and ABCC4, are integral to the movement of endogenous and exogenous compounds across cellular membranes. Additionally, the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) is examined for its role in drug disposition and resistance. By analyzing the expression and function of these transporters, we aim to elucidate their contribution to the remote sensing and signaling network, which may impact drug efficacy and toxicity. This research underscores the importance of understanding transporter-mediated processes in drug development and personalized medicine, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for optimizing drug delivery and minimizing adverse effects.", "label": 1}
