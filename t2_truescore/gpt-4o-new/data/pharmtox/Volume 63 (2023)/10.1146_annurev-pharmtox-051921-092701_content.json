{"grounding": "Antiplatelet therapy is used in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Clopidogrel is the most widely used antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitor in clinical practice. Genetic variation in CYP2C19 may influence its enzymatic activity, resulting in individuals who are carriers of loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles and thus have reduced active clopidogrel metabolites, high on-treatment platelet reactivity, and increased ischemic risk. Prospective studies have examined the utility of CYP2C19 genetic testing to guide antiplatelet therapy, and more recently published meta-analyses suggest that pharmacogenetics represents a key treatment strategy to individualize antiplatelet therapy. Rapid genetic tests, including bedside genotyping platforms that are validated and have high reproducibility, are available to guide selection of P2Y12 inhibitors in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the background and rationale for the role of a guided antiplatelet approach to enhance patient care.", "generated_text": "The field of pharmacogenetics has significantly advanced our understanding of individual variability in response to antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This review focuses on the role of pharmacogenomics in guiding antiplatelet therapy, with an emphasis on the CYP2C19 gene, which is crucial for the metabolism of clopidogrel, a commonly used antiplatelet drug. Variants in CYP2C19 can lead to altered drug metabolism, impacting therapeutic efficacy and safety. Precision medicine approaches, incorporating genetic testing, have the potential to optimize antiplatelet therapy by tailoring treatment to the genetic profile of the patient, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing adverse events. This paper discusses the current state of pharmacogenetic testing in clinical practice, the challenges in its implementation, and future directions for research. The integration of pharmacogenomics into clinical decision-making represents a promising step towards more personalized and effective antiplatelet therapy.", "label": 1}
