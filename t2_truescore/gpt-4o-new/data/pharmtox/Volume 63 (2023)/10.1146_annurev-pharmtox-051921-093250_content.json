{"grounding": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to poor functional outcomes. Methods for assessment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are now well established. In addition, there has been increasing appreciation in recent years of the additional role of social cognitive impairment in driving functional outcomes and of the contributions of sensory-level dysfunction to higher-order impairments. At the neurochemical level, acute administration of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists reproduces the pattern of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia, encouraging the development of treatments targeted at both NMDAR and its interactome. At the local-circuit level, an auditory neurophysiological measure, mismatch negativity, has emerged both as a veridical index of NMDAR dysfunction and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in schizophrenia and as a critical biomarker for early-stage translational drug development. Although no compounds have yet been approved for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, several candidates are showing promise in early-phase testing.", "generated_text": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia, significantly impacting functional outcomes and quality of life. This review explores the pathophysiological underpinnings of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, focusing on the roles of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmitter systems. Dysregulation of the NMDA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor, is implicated in the cognitive dysfunction observed in schizophrenia, with evidence suggesting that NMDA receptor hypofunction contributes to impaired synaptic plasticity and neurocognitive deficits. Mismatch negativity, an event-related potential reflecting automatic auditory processing, serves as a biomarker for NMDA receptor function and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Additionally, dopamine dysregulation, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, exacerbates cognitive deficits by disrupting executive function and working memory. Current treatment strategies targeting these pathways, including pharmacological agents modulating NMDA receptor activity and dopamine transmission, are discussed. Future research directions aim to develop more effective interventions to ameliorate cognitive deficits and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
