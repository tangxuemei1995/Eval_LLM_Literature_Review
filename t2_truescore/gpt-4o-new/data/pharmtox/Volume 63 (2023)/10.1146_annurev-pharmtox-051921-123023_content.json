{"grounding": "Ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cellular metabolism to electrical activity in multiple tissues; their unique assembly as four Kir6 pore-forming subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits has resulted in a large armory of selective channel opener and inhibitor drugs. The spectrum of monogenic pathologies that result from gain- or loss-of-function mutations in these channels, and the potential for therapeutic correction of these pathologies, is now clear. However, while available drugs can be effective treatments for specific pathologies, cross-reactivity with the other Kir6 or SUR subfamily members can result in drug-induced versions of each pathology and may limit therapeutic usefulness. This review discusses the background to KATP channel physiology, pathology, and pharmacology and considers the potential for more specific or effective therapeutic agents.", "generated_text": "Personalized therapeutics targeting KATP-dependent pathologies hold promise for conditions such as congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant\u00fa syndrome. These disorders are linked to mutations in the KATP channel subunits, including Kir6.2, Kir6.1, SUR1, and SUR2, which regulate insulin secretion and vascular tone. Advances in genetic profiling and molecular biology have enabled the development of targeted therapies that address the specific mutations in these subunits. This review explores the current landscape of personalized medicine approaches, highlighting the potential of pharmacological agents and gene therapies tailored to individual genetic profiles. By focusing on the underlying molecular mechanisms, these strategies aim to improve clinical outcomes and reduce adverse effects, paving the way for more effective management of KATP-related diseases.", "label": 1}
