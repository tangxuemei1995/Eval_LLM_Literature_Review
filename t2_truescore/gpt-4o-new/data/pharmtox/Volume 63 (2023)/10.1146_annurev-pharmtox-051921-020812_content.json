{"grounding": "Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and particulate matter, with adsorbed organic and inorganic contaminants, to which exposure is lifelong. Epidemiological studies increasingly associate air pollution with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, findings supported by experimental animal models. This breadth of neurotoxicity across these central nervous system diseases and disorders likely reflects shared vulnerability of their inflammatory and oxidative stress\u2013based mechanisms and a corresponding ability to produce brain metal dyshomeo-stasis. Future research to define the responsible contaminants of air pollution underlying this neurotoxicity is critical to understanding mechanisms of these diseases and disorders and protecting public health.", "generated_text": "Air pollution, particularly ultrafine particles and PM2.5, poses significant risks to neurological health across the life span. This review examines the impact of air pollution on neurodevelopmental disorders in children and neurodegenerative diseases in adults. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to these pollutants can lead to brain metal dyshomeostasis, contributing to neurotoxicity. The mechanisms involve oxidative stress, inflammation, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which may exacerbate or initiate neurological conditions. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing preventive strategies and public health policies to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on brain health.", "label": 1}
