{"grounding": "With the worldwide increase in life span, surgical patients are becoming older and have a greater propensity for postoperative cognitive impairment, either new onset or through deterioration of an existing condition; in both conditions, knowledge of the patient's preoperative cognitive function and postoperative cognitive trajectory is imperative. We describe the clinical utility of a tablet-based technique for rapid assessment of the memory and attentiveness domains required for executive function. The pathogenic mechanisms for perioperative neurocognitive disorders have been investigated in animal models in which excessive and/or prolonged postoperative neuroinflammation has emerged as a likely contender. The cellular and molecular species involved in postoperative neuroinflammation are the putative targets for future therapeutic interventions that are efficacious and do not interfere with the surgical patient's healing process.", "generated_text": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), including postoperative delirium, are prevalent in the aging population, posing significant challenges to perioperative brain health. This review synthesizes current experimental models and identifies potential druggable targets to mitigate PNDs. Neuroinflammation emerges as a critical factor in the pathophysiology of these disorders, with animal models elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Cognitive assessment tools are essential for early detection and management, guiding the development of tailored care pathways. Recent advances in pharmacological interventions targeting neuroinflammatory pathways offer promising avenues for therapeutic strategies. This study underscores the importance of integrating experimental findings into clinical practice to enhance perioperative care and improve cognitive outcomes in elderly patients. Future research should focus on refining these models and exploring novel targets to optimize perioperative brain health.", "label": 1}
