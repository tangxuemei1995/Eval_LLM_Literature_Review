{"grounding": "Pharmacology and toxicology are part of a much broader effort to understand the relationship between chemistry and biology. While biomedicine has necessarily focused on specific cases, typically of direct human relevance, there are real advantages in pursuing more systematic approaches to characterizing how health and disease are influenced by small molecules and other interventions. In this context, the zebrafish is now established as the representative screenable vertebrate and, through ongoing advances in the available scale of genome editing and automated phenotyping, is beginning to address systems-level solutions to some biomedical problems. The addition of broader efforts to integrate information content across preclinical model organisms and the incorporation of rigorous analytics, including closed-loop deep learning, will facilitate efforts to create systems pharmacology and toxicology with the ability to continuously optimize chemical biological interactions around societal needs. In this review, we outline progress toward this goal.", "generated_text": "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a prominent model organism in the fields of systems pharmacology and toxicology due to their scalability and relevance to human biology. This review highlights the advantages of zebrafish as an alternative in vivo model, emphasizing their genetic tractability, rapid development, and transparent embryos, which facilitate real-time observation of physiological processes. Zebrafish models offer a cost-effective and high-throughput platform for drug screening and toxicological assessments, bridging the gap between in vitro studies and mammalian models. Their genetic and physiological similarities to humans enable the study of complex biological pathways and disease mechanisms. Recent advancements in zebrafish research, including CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and high-resolution imaging techniques, have further solidified their role in mainstream pharmacological and toxicological research. This paper underscores the potential of zebrafish to revolutionize drug discovery and safety evaluation, promoting more ethical and efficient research methodologies.", "label": 1}
