{"grounding": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a chemically diverse group of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) that target the endocannabinoid system, triggering a plethora of actions (e.g., elevated mood sensation, relaxation, appetite stimulation) that resemble, but are more intense than, those induced by cannabis. Although some of these effects have been explored for therapeutic applications, anticipated stronger psychoactive effects than cannabis and reduced risk perception have increased the recreational use of SCs, which have dominated the NPS market in the United States and Europe over the past decade. However, rising SC-related intoxications and deaths represent a major public health concern and embody a major challenge for policy makers.\nHere, we review the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs. A thorough characterization of SCs\u2019 pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics is important to better understand the main mechanisms underlying acute and chronic effects of SCs, interpret the clinical/pathological findings related to SC use, and improve SC risk awareness.", "generated_text": "Synthetic cannabinoids, often marketed as 'Spice' or 'K2', represent a significant category of new psychoactive substances (NPS) that mimic the effects of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. These designer drugs are engineered to interact with the endocannabinoid system, often exhibiting higher potency and efficacy than natural cannabinoids. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological and toxicological profiles of synthetic cannabinoids, highlighting their impact on public health. The rapid evolution of these compounds poses challenges for detection and regulation, contributing to their widespread abuse and association with severe adverse effects, including acute intoxication, psychosis, and substance use disorders. Understanding the mechanisms of action and the potential risks associated with synthetic cannabinoids is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. This paper underscores the need for continued research and policy development to address the growing concerns surrounding these potent and unpredictable substances.", "label": 1}
