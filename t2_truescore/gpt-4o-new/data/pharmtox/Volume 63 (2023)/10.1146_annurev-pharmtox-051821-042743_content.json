{"grounding": "Chronic diseases that affect our society are made more complex by comorbidities and are poorly managed by the current pharmacology. While all present inflammatory etiopathogeneses, there is an unmet need for better clinical management of these diseases and their multiple symptoms. We discuss here an innovative approach based on the biology of the resolution of inflammation. Studying endogenous pro-resolving peptide and lipid mediators, how they are formed, and which target they interact with, can offer innovative options through augmenting the expression or function of pro-resolving pathways or mimicking their actions with novel targeted molecules. In all cases, resolution offers innovation for the treatment of the primary cause of a given disease and/or for the management of its comorbidities, ultimately improving patient quality of life. By implementing resolution pharmacology, we harness the whole physiology of inflammation, with the potential to bring a marked change in the management of inflammatory conditions.", "generated_text": "Resolution pharmacology represents a paradigm shift in therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the active resolution of inflammation rather than merely suppressing it. This approach leverages specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and proteins such as annexin A1 to restore tissue homeostasis. Annexin A1 and its peptides play a pivotal role in modulating inflammatory responses, promoting the clearance of inflammatory cells, and enhancing tissue repair. Concurrently, SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, orchestrate the resolution phase of inflammation by dampening pro-inflammatory signals and facilitating the return to homeostasis. This review highlights recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of annexin A1 and SPMs, underscoring their potential as innovative therapeutic agents. By targeting the resolution pathways, these mediators offer promising avenues for treating chronic inflammatory diseases, where traditional anti-inflammatory drugs fall short. Future research should focus on optimizing delivery systems and elucidating the long-term effects of these pro-resolving agents in clinical settings.", "label": 1}
