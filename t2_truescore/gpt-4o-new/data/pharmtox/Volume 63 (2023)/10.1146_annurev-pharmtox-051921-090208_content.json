{"grounding": "The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are found in seafood, supplements, and concentrated pharmaceutical preparations. Prospective cohort studies demonstrate an association between higher intakes of EPA+DHA or higher levels of EPA and DHA in the body and lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and of cardiovascular mortality in the general population. The cardioprotective effect of EPA and DHA is due to the beneficial modulation of a number of risk factors for CVD. Some large trials support the use of EPA+DHA (or EPA alone) in high-risk patients, although the evidence is inconsistent. This review presents key studies of EPA and DHA in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD, briefly describes potential mechanisms of action, and discusses recently published RCTs and meta-analyses. Potential adverse aspects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in relation to CVD are discussed.", "generated_text": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are widely recognized for their potential benefits in cardiovascular health. This review examines the dualistic nature of LC-PUFAs, highlighting both their advantages and limitations in heart disease management. Numerous studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce triglyceride levels, lower blood pressure, and exert anti-inflammatory effects, thereby mitigating several risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, recent meta-analyses and clinical trials present mixed results, questioning the extent of their efficacy in reducing major cardiovascular events. Potential drawbacks include the risk of bleeding, particularly in individuals on anticoagulant therapy, and the variability in response among different populations. This paper underscores the need for personalized approaches in omega-3 supplementation and calls for further research to delineate optimal dosages and formulations to maximize cardiovascular benefits while minimizing adverse effects.", "label": 1}
