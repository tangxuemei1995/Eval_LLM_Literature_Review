{"grounding": "Leukotrienes are potent immune-regulating lipid mediators with patho-genic roles in inflammatory and allergic diseases, particularly asthma. These autacoids also contribute to low-grade inflammation, a hallmark of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, metabolic, and tumor diseases. Biosynthesis of leukotrienes involves release and oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid and proceeds via a set of cytosolic and integral membrane enzymes that are typically expressed by cells of the innate immune system. In activated cells, these enzymes traffic and assemble at the endoplasmic and perinuclear membrane, together comprising a biosynthetic complex. Here we describe recent advances in our molecular understanding of the protein components of the leukotriene-synthesizing enzyme machinery and also briefly touch upon the leukotriene receptors. Moreover, we discuss emerging opportunities for pharmacological intervention and development of new therapeutics.", "generated_text": "Leukotrienes, derived from arachidonic acid, play a pivotal role in inflammatory responses and are implicated in various endemic diseases. Understanding the structures of leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutics. This study reviews the structural biology of key enzymes involved in leukotriene synthesis, including 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase, highlighting their active sites and conformational dynamics. Advances in structure-based drug design have facilitated the identification of novel inhibitors that can modulate leukotriene pathways, offering potential therapeutic strategies for conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cardiovascular diseases. By integrating structural insights with medicinal chemistry, this research aims to accelerate the development of effective anti-inflammatory agents, addressing unmet medical needs in managing chronic inflammatory disorders.", "label": 1}
