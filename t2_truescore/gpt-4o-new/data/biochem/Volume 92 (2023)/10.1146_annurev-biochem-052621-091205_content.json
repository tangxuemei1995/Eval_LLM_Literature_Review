{"grounding": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and other genotoxic stresses induce bulky DNA lesions, which threaten genome stability and cell viability. Cells have evolved two main repair pathways to remove such lesions: global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The modes by which these subpathways recognize DNA lesions are distinct, but they converge onto the same downstream steps for DNA repair. Here, we first summarize the current understanding of these repair mechanisms, specifically focusing on the roles of stalled RNA polymerase II, Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), CSA and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) in TC-NER. We also discuss the intriguing role of protein ubiquitylation in this process. Additionally, we highlight key aspects of the effect of UV irradiation on transcription and describe the role of signaling cascades in orchestrating this response. Finally, we describe the pathogenic mechanisms underlying xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, the two main diseases linked to mutations in NER factors.", "generated_text": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a critical cellular mechanism that rectifies DNA lesions, particularly those induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can impede transcription by RNA polymerase II. This study explores the interplay between TC-NER and the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage, highlighting the distinct roles of TC-NER and global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER). While GG-NER operates throughout the genome, TC-NER specifically targets lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes, ensuring rapid resumption of transcription. The research delves into the molecular dynamics of TC-NER, examining its impact on transcriptional fidelity and cellular recovery post-UV exposure. Furthermore, the study investigates the implications of TC-NER deficiencies, as observed in disorders like Cockayne syndrome, which manifest heightened sensitivity to UV and impaired transcriptional recovery. These findings underscore the importance of TC-NER in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for related genetic disorders.", "label": 1}
