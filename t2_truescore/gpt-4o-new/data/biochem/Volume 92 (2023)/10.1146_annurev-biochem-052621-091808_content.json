{"grounding": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translational efficiency are two crucial aspects of the post-transcriptional process that profoundly impact protein production in a cell. While it is widely known that ribosomes produce proteins, studies during the past decade have surprisingly revealed that ribosomes also control mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner, a process referred to as codon optimality. Therefore, codons, the three-nucleotide words read by the ribosome, have a potent effect on mRNA stability and provide cis-regulatory information that extends beyond the amino acids they encode. While the codon optimality molecular mechanism is still unclear, the translation elongation rate appears to trigger mRNA decay. Thus, transfer RNAs emerge as potential master gene regulators affecting mRNA stability. Furthermore, while few factors related to codon optimality have been identified in yeast, the orthologous genes in vertebrates do not necessary share the same functions. Here, we discuss codon optimality findings and gene regulation layers related to codon composition in different eukaryotic species.", "generated_text": "The interplay between translation and mRNA stability is a critical aspect of gene expression regulation, influenced significantly by codon optimality. Codon usage, determined by the frequency of synonymous codons, affects translation elongation rates and mRNA decay. Optimal codons, which are efficiently recognized by abundant tRNAs, enhance translation elongation and stabilize mRNA, whereas non-optimal codons can lead to slower translation and increased mRNA degradation. This study explores the mechanisms by which codon optimality influences mRNA stability, focusing on the role of tRNA availability and its impact on translation elongation. We examine how variations in codon usage can modulate mRNA half-life and the implications for cellular protein synthesis. Additionally, we discuss the potential for codon usage to serve as a regulatory mechanism in response to cellular conditions, thereby affecting gene expression profiles. Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the fundamental processes of mRNA turnover and the broader implications for cellular homeostasis and adaptation.", "label": 1}
