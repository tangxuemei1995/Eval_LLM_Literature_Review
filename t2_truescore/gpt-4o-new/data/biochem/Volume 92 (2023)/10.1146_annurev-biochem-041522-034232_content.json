{"grounding": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR), discovered as preferential nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers located in transcribed mammalian genes compared to those in nontranscribed regions of the genome, is defined as faster repair of the transcribed strand versus the nontranscribed strand in transcribed genes. The phenomenon, universal in model organisms including Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, mice, and humans, involves a translocase that interacts with both RNA polymerase stalled at damage in the transcribed strand and nucleotide excision repair proteins to accelerate repair. Drosophila, a notable exception, exhibits TCR but lacks an obvious TCR translocase. Mutations inactivating TCR genes cause increased damage-induced mutagenesis in E. coli and severe neurological and UV sensitivity syndromes in humans. To date, only E. coli TCR has been reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins. Detailed investigations of TCR using genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, cryo\u2013electron microscopy, single-molecule analysis, and other approaches have revealed fascinating mechanisms.", "generated_text": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a specialized sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that specifically targets and rectifies DNA lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes. This process is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutagenesis. Key players in TCR include the transcription-repair coupling factors Mfd in prokaryotes and CSB in eukaryotes, which facilitate the recognition and removal of transcription-blocking lesions. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which these factors interact with the transcription machinery and recruit repair proteins to the site of damage. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests a link between TCR and the circadian clock, indicating that DNA repair efficiency may be modulated by circadian rhythms. Understanding these intricate molecular interactions provides insights into the prevention of mutagenesis and the potential development of therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with defective DNA repair mechanisms.", "label": 1}
