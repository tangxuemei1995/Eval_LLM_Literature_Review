{"grounding": "According to the endosymbiotic theory, most of the DNA of the original bacterial endosymbiont has been lost or transferred to the nucleus, leaving a much smaller (\u223c16 kb in mammals), circular molecule that is the present-day mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The ability of mtDNA to escape mitochondria and integrate into the nuclear genome was discovered in budding yeast, along with genes that regulate this process. Mitochondria have emerged as key regulators of innate immunity, and it is now recognized that mtDNA released into the cytoplasm, outside of the cell, or into circulation activates multiple innate immune signaling pathways. Here, we first review the mechanisms through which mtDNA is released into the cytoplasm, including several inducible mitochondrial pores and defective mitophagy or autophagy. Next, we cover how the different forms of released mtDNA activate specific innate immune nucleic acid sensors and inflammasomes. Finally, we discuss how intracellular and extracellular mtDNA release, including circulating cell-free mtDNA that promotes systemic inflammation, are implicated in human diseases, bacterial and viral infections, senescence and aging.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release into the cytosol is increasingly recognized as a pivotal event in the activation of innate immune signaling pathways. This process is implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases, where mtDNA acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that is sensed by cytosolic DNA sensors. The release of mtDNA is often facilitated by the formation of mitochondrial pores, which can be induced by cellular stress or damage. Once in the cytosol, mtDNA can engage with pattern recognition receptors such as cGAS-STING, leading to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review explores the mechanisms underlying mtDNA release, the role of mitochondrial pores in this process, and the subsequent activation of DNA sensing pathways. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of mtDNA-mediated inflammation in disease contexts, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating mtDNA release and its downstream signaling. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing interventions to mitigate inflammation-driven pathologies.", "label": 1}
