{"grounding": "The insulin receptor (IR) is a type II receptor tyrosine kinase that plays essential roles in metabolism, growth, and proliferation. Dysregulation of IR signaling is linked to many human diseases, such as diabetes and cancers. The resolution revolution in cryo\u2013electron microscopy has led to the determination of several structures of IR with different numbers of bound insulin molecules in recent years, which have tremendously improved our understanding of how IR is activated by insulin. Here, we review the insulin-induced activation mechanism of IR, including (a) the detailed binding modes and functions of insulin at site 1 and site 2 and (b) the insulin-induced structural transitions that are required for IR activation. We highlight several other key aspects of the activation and regulation of IR signaling and discuss the remaining gaps in our understanding of the IR activation mechanism and potential avenues of future research.", "generated_text": "The insulin receptor (IR) plays a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis, and its activation mechanism is crucial for understanding insulin signaling pathways. This study employs cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate the structural dynamics of IR upon insulin binding. We focus on the conformational changes at insulin-binding sites 1 and 2, which are essential for receptor activation. Our findings reveal that insulin binding induces a significant rearrangement in the extracellular domain, facilitating the transmembrane signaling cascade. The structural insights highlight the allosteric modulation between the two binding sites, providing a detailed map of the activation process. These results enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of insulin action and offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention in insulin resistance and diabetes. This study underscores the importance of structural biology in unraveling complex biochemical processes and paves the way for future research into receptor-ligand interactions.", "label": 0}
