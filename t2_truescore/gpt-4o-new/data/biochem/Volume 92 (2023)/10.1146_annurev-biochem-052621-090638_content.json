{"grounding": "Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes use a site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] cluster and SAM to initiate radical reactions through liberation of the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl (5\u2032-dAdo\u2022) radical. They form the largest enzyme superfamily, with more than 700,000 unique sequences currently, and their numbers continue to grow as a result of ongoing bioinformatics efforts. The range of extremely diverse, highly regio- and stereo-specific reactions known to be catalyzed by radical SAM superfamily members is remarkable. The common mechanism of radical initiation in the radical SAM superfamily is the focus of this review. Most surprising is the presence of an organometallic intermediate, \u03a9, exhibiting an Fe\u2013C5\u2032-adenosyl bond. Regioselective reductive cleavage of the SAM S\u2013C5\u2032 bond produces 5\u2032-dAdo\u2022 to form \u03a9, with the regioselectivity originating in the Jahn\u2013Teller effect. \u03a9 liberates the free 5\u2032-dAdo\u2022 as the catalytically active intermediate through homolysis of the Fe\u2013C5\u2032 bond, in analogy to Co\u2013C5\u2032 bond homolysis in B12, which was once viewed as biology's choice of radical generator.", "generated_text": "The radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme superfamily is pivotal in catalyzing a diverse array of radical-mediated transformations, crucial for various biological processes. Central to their function is the generation of a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical, initiated by the reductive cleavage of SAM. This study delves into the mechanistic intricacies of radical initiation within this enzyme superfamily, emphasizing the role of organometallic intermediates. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling, we elucidate the electron transfer pathways and the structural dynamics that facilitate the homolytic cleavage of the S-C bond in SAM. Our findings highlight the critical involvement of iron-sulfur clusters in stabilizing radical intermediates and orchestrating the precise control of radical generation. This research not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental biochemical principles governing radical SAM enzymes but also opens avenues for engineering these enzymes for biotechnological applications, including natural product biosynthesis and novel therapeutic development.", "label": 0}
