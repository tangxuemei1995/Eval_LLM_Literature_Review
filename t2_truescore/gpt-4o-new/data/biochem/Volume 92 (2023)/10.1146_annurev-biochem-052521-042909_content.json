{"grounding": "Muscles are essential for movement and heart function. Contraction and relaxation of muscles rely on the sliding of two types of filaments\u2014the thin filament and the thick myosin filament. The thin filament is composed mainly of filamentous actin (F-actin), tropomyosin, and troponin. Additionally, several other proteins are involved in the contraction mechanism, and their malfunction can lead to diverse muscle diseases, such as cardiomyopathies. We review recent high-resolution structural data that explain the mechanism of action of muscle proteins at an unprecedented level of molecular detail. We focus on the molecular structures of the components of the thin and thick filaments and highlight the mechanisms underlying force generation through actin\u2013myosin interactions, as well as Ca2+-dependent regulation via the dihydropyridine receptor, the ryanodine receptor, and troponin. We particularly emphasize the impact of cryo\u2013electron microscopy and cryo\u2013electron tomography in leading muscle research into a new era.", "generated_text": "Muscle contraction is a complex process driven by the intricate interplay of structural proteins and regulatory mechanisms. This study delves into the structural biochemistry of muscle contraction, focusing on the roles of actin, myosin, the ryanodine receptor, and troponin. Utilizing advanced cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques, we elucidate the conformational changes and interactions that underpin muscle contraction at the molecular level. Our findings reveal detailed insights into the actin-myosin cross-bridge cycle and the regulatory function of troponin in response to calcium ion fluctuations mediated by the ryanodine receptor. These structural insights enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of muscle function and have implications for addressing muscle-related diseases. This research underscores the power of cryo-EM and cryo-ET in resolving dynamic protein structures, providing a comprehensive view of the molecular machinery driving muscle contraction.", "label": 1}
