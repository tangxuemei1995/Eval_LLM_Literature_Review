{"grounding": "Chemical modifications on mRNA represent a critical layer of gene expression regulation. Research in this area has continued to accelerate over the last decade, as more modifications are being characterized with increasing depth and breadth. mRNA modifications have been demonstrated to influence nearly every step from the early phases of transcript synthesis in the nucleus through to their decay in the cytoplasm, but in many cases, the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes remain mysterious. Here, we highlight recent work that has elucidated the roles of mRNA modifications throughout the mRNA life cycle, describe gaps in our understanding and remaining open questions, and offer some forward-looking perspective on future directions in the field.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications have emerged as pivotal regulators of mRNA metabolism, influencing various posttranscriptional processes. This study delves into the epitranscriptome, highlighting the dynamic nature of RNA modifications such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine, and 5-methylcytosine. These modifications modulate mRNA stability, splicing, translation, and localization, thereby orchestrating gene expression in response to cellular signals. By integrating high-throughput sequencing technologies and biochemical assays, we elucidate the mechanisms by which these modifications impact mRNA function. Our findings underscore the complexity of posttranscriptional regulation and suggest potential therapeutic targets for diseases linked to dysregulated RNA modification patterns. This research advances our understanding of the intricate layers of gene expression control mediated by the epitranscriptome.", "label": 1}
