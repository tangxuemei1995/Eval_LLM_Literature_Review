{"grounding": "In this autobiographical article, I reflect on my Swedish background. Then I discuss endogenous DNA alterations and the base excision repair pathway and alternative repair strategies for some unusual DNA lesions. Endogenous DNA damage, such as loss of purine bases and cytosine deamination, is proposed as a major source of cancer-causing mutations.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical account explores the intricate dynamics of endogenous DNA damage and repair mechanisms, focusing on base excision repair and DNA glycosylases. It highlights personal insights into the role of these processes in cancer mutations, offering a unique perspective on the evolution of DNA repair research and its implications for cancer biology.", "label": 0}
