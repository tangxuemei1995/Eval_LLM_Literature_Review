{"grounding": "Thiolases are CoA-dependent enzymes that catalyze the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA, as well as its reverse reaction, which is the thioester-dependent Claisen condensation reaction. Thiolases are dimers or tetramers (dimers of dimers). All thiolases have two reactive cysteines: (a) a nucleophilic cysteine, which forms a covalent intermediate, and (b) an acid/base cysteine. The best characterized thiolase is the Zoogloea ramigera thiolase, which is a bacterial biosynthetic thiolase belonging to the CT-thiolase subfamily. The thiolase active site is also characterized by two oxyanion holes, two active site waters, and four catalytic loops with characteristic amino acid sequence fingerprints. Three thiolase subfamilies can be identified, each characterized by a unique sequence fingerprint for one of their catalytic loops, which causes unique active site properties. Recent insights concerning the thiolase reaction mechanism, as obtained from recent structural studies, as well as from classical and recent enzymological studies, are addressed, and open questions are discussed.", "generated_text": "Thiolase enzymes are pivotal biocatalysts that facilitate the formation and cleavage of carbon-carbon (C\u2013C) bonds through coenzyme A (CoA)\u2013thioester chemistry. This study explores the intricate mechanisms by which thiolases employ a sophisticated hydrogen-bond network and proton wire to stabilize reaction intermediates, particularly focusing on the oxyanion hole's role in Claisen condensation reactions. The enzyme's active site architecture, characterized by its ability to accommodate CoA-thioesters, is crucial for catalyzing reversible reactions that are essential in metabolic pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and degradation. By elucidating the structural and functional dynamics of thiolases, this research highlights their versatility and potential applications in synthetic biology and industrial biocatalysis. The findings underscore the importance of the enzyme's conformational flexibility and the strategic positioning of catalytic residues, which collectively enhance the efficiency and specificity of C\u2013C bond transformations, offering insights into the design of novel biocatalysts.", "label": 1}
