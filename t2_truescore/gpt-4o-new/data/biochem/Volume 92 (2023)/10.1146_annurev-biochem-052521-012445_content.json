{"grounding": "Formation of the 3\u2032 end of a eukaryotic mRNA is a key step in the production of a mature transcript. This process is mediated by a number of protein factors that cleave the pre-mRNA, add a poly(A) tail, and regulate transcription by protein dephosphorylation. Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) in humans, or cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) in yeast, coordinates these enzymatic activities with each other, with RNA recognition, and with transcription. The site of pre-mRNA cleavage can strongly influence the translation, stability, and localization of the mRNA. Hence, cleavage site selection is highly regulated. The length of the poly(A) tail is also controlled to ensure that every transcript has a similar tail when it is exported from the nucleus. In this review, we summarize new mechanistic insights into mRNA 3\u2032-end processing obtained through structural studies and biochemical reconstitution and outline outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "The 3\u2032-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, involving the precise cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. This process is orchestrated by a complex machinery comprising endonucleases, poly(A) polymerases, and a host of regulatory proteins. The addition of a poly(A) tail is essential for mRNA stability, nuclear export, and translation efficiency. Regulation of 3\u2032-end processing is tightly linked to transcription, with factors such as the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II playing a pivotal role. Recent advances have elucidated the dynamic interactions between processing components and their impact on alternative polyadenylation, which can generate mRNA isoforms with distinct regulatory and functional properties. Understanding the nuances of 3\u2032-end processing not only provides insights into fundamental cellular processes but also highlights its implications in diseases where these mechanisms are disrupted. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the machinery, regulation, and biological significance of mRNA 3\u2032-end processing.", "label": 1}
