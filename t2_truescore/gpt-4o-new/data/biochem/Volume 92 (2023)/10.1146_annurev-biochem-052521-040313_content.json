{"grounding": "Ligands of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway are paracrine signaling molecules that coordinate tissue development in metazoans. A remarkable feature of HH signaling is the repeated use of cholesterol in steps spanning ligand biogenesis, secretion, dispersal, and reception on target cells. A cholesterol molecule covalently attached to HH ligands is used as a molecular baton by transfer proteins to guide their secretion, spread, and reception. On target cells, a signaling circuit composed of a cholesterol transporter and sensor regulates transmission of HH signals across the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The repeated use of cholesterol in signaling supports the view that the HH pathway likely evolved by coopting ancient systems to regulate the abundance or organization of sterol-like lipids in membranes.", "generated_text": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, with its activity intricately linked to cholesterol. This review explores the multifaceted relationship between cholesterol and Hh signaling, emphasizing the role of cholesterol in modulating the function of primary cilia and biological membranes, which are essential for Hh pathway activation. Cholesterol's influence extends to the regulation of G protein\u2013coupled receptors and cell surface receptors, which are pivotal in transducing Hh signals. Recent studies highlight cholesterol's dual role as a structural component and a signaling molecule, underscoring its importance in the spatial and temporal control of Hh signaling. Understanding this relationship offers insights into developmental biology and potential therapeutic targets for Hh-related pathologies.", "label": 1}
