{"grounding": "Carbon fixation is the process by which CO2 is converted from a gas into biomass. The Calvin\u2013Benson\u2013Bassham cycle (CBB) is the dominant carbon-consuming pathway on Earth, driving >99.5% of the \u223c120 billion tons of carbon that are converted to sugar by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The carboxylase enzyme in the CBB, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), fixes one CO2 molecule per turn of the cycle into bioavailable sugars. Despite being critical to the assimilation of carbon, rubisco's kinetic rate is not very fast, limiting flux through the pathway. This bottleneck presents a paradox: Why has rubisco not evolved to be a better catalyst? Many hypothesize that the catalytic mechanism of rubisco is subject to one or more trade-offs and that rubisco variants have been optimized for their native physiological environment. Here, we review the evolution and biochemistry of rubisco through the lens of structure and mechanism in order to understand what trade-offs limit its improvement. We also review the many attempts to improve rubisco itself and thereby promote plant growth.", "generated_text": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is a pivotal enzyme in the Calvin cycle, facilitating the conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic compounds through carbon fixation. Despite its essential role in photosynthesis, Rubisco is characterized by a relatively slow catalytic rate and a propensity for oxygenation, which leads to photorespiration and reduced photosynthetic efficiency. This has spurred extensive research into the enzyme's function, evolutionary history, and potential for engineering to enhance its performance. Evolutionary studies reveal that Rubisco has undergone significant diversification across different photosynthetic organisms, adapting to varying environmental CO2 and O2 concentrations. Recent advances in enzyme engineering have focused on improving Rubisco's catalytic efficiency and specificity for CO2 over O2, employing techniques such as directed evolution, rational design, and synthetic biology. These efforts aim to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and increase crop yields, addressing global food security and climate change challenges. This review synthesizes current understanding of Rubisco's biochemical properties, evolutionary adaptations, and the latest strategies in enzyme engineering to enhance its function.", "label": 1}
