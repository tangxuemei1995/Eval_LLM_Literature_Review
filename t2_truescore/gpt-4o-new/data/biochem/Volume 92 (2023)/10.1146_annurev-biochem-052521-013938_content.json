{"grounding": "DNA-editing enzymes perform chemical reactions on DNA nucleobases. These reactions can change the genetic identity of the modified base or modulate gene expression. Interest in DNA-editing enzymes has burgeoned in recent years due to the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems, which can be used to direct their DNA-editing activity to specific genomic loci of interest. In this review, we showcase DNA-editing enzymes that have been repurposed or redesigned and developed into programmable base editors. These include deaminases, glycosylases, methyltransferases, and demethylases. We highlight the astounding degree to which these enzymes have been redesigned, evolved, and refined and present these collective engineering efforts as a paragon for future efforts to repurpose and engineer other families of enzymes. Collectively, base editors derived from these DNA-editing enzymes facilitate programmable point mutation introduction and gene expression modulation by targeted chemical modification of nucleobases.", "generated_text": "The advent of DNA-editing enzymes, particularly base editors, has revolutionized genetic engineering by enabling precise nucleotide modifications without inducing double-strand breaks. This study explores the design and application of base editors, focusing on the integration of deaminases, methyltransferases, demethylases, and glycosylases. Through protein engineering, these enzymes are tailored to achieve targeted base conversions, offering a versatile toolkit for genomic modifications. Deaminases facilitate C-to-T and A-to-G transitions, while methyltransferases and demethylases modulate epigenetic marks, expanding the scope of base editing beyond simple nucleotide changes. Glycosylases further enhance specificity by excising mismatched bases, reducing off-target effects. The application of these engineered enzymes in therapeutic contexts, such as correcting pathogenic mutations and modulating gene expression, underscores their potential in precision medicine. This research highlights the ongoing advancements in base editor technology, emphasizing the importance of enzyme design in achieving efficient and accurate genome editing.", "label": 0}
