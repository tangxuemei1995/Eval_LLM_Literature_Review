{"grounding": "Over the past decade, mRNA modifications have emerged as important regulators of gene expression control in cells. Fueled in large part by the development of tools for detecting RNA modifications transcriptome wide, researchers have uncovered a diverse epitranscriptome that serves as an additional layer of gene regulation beyond simple RNA sequence. Here, we review the proteins that write, read, and erase these marks, with a particular focus on the most abundant internal modification, N\n6-methyladenosine (m6A). We first describe the discovery of the key enzymes that deposit and remove m6A and other modifications and discuss how our understanding of these proteins has shaped our views of modification dynamics. We then review current models for the function of m6A reader proteins and how our knowledge of these proteins has evolved. Finally, we highlight important future directions for the field and discuss key questions that remain unanswered.", "generated_text": "The dynamic landscape of RNA modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular function. Among these modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent and has been extensively studied. This review focuses on the proteins involved in the m6A modification process, categorized as writers, readers, and erasers. Writers, primarily methyltransferases, catalyze the addition of m6A marks, while reader proteins recognize and bind to these modifications, influencing RNA stability, translation, and splicing. Erasers, or demethylases, remove m6A marks, allowing for dynamic regulation of RNA function. Understanding the interplay between these proteins provides insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and highlights potential therapeutic targets for diseases linked to aberrant RNA modifications. This review synthesizes recent advances in the field, emphasizing the molecular mechanisms and biological implications of m6A and its associated proteins.", "label": 1}
