{"grounding": "The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are abundant polycations of vital importance in mammalian cells. Their cellular levels are tightly regulated by degradation and synthesis, as well as by uptake and export. Here, we discuss the delicate balance between the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of polyamines in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyamine levels decline with aging and are altered in patients with PD, whereas recent mechanistic studies on ATP13A2 (PARK9) demonstrated a driving role of a disturbed polyamine homeostasis in PD. Polyamines affect pathways in PD pathogenesis, such as \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, and influence PD-related processes like autophagy, heavy metal toxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and lysosomal/mitochondrial dysfunction. We formulate outstanding research questions regarding the role of polyamines in PD, their potential as PD biomarkers, and possible therapeutic strategies for PD targeting polyamine homeostasis.", "generated_text": "Polyamines, small organic cations, play a dual role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), oscillating between neurotoxicity and neuroprotection. This study explores the intricate balance of polyamines within the cellular environment, particularly focusing on their interactions with endo/lysosomal and mitochondrial pathways. The accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein, a hallmark of PD, is influenced by polyamine levels, which can modulate its aggregation and clearance. Astrocytes, crucial for maintaining neuronal health, are also affected by polyamine dynamics, impacting their ability to support neurons and manage oxidative stress. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which polyamines contribute to both the progression and potential mitigation of PD symptoms could unveil novel therapeutic targets. This research underscores the importance of a nuanced approach to polyamine regulation, aiming to harness their protective properties while minimizing their detrimental effects.", "label": 1}
