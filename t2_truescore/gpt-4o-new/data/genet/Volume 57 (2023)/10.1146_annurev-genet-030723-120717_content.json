{"grounding": "Despite accumulating evidence implicating noncoding variants in human diseases, unraveling their functionality remains a significant challenge. Systematic annotations of the regulatory landscape and the growth of sequence variant data sets have fueled the development of tools and methods to identify causal noncoding variants and evaluate their regulatory effects. Here, we review the latest advances in the field and discuss potential future research avenues to gain a more in-depth understanding of noncoding regulatory variants.", "generated_text": "Uncovering noncoding regulatory variants is crucial for understanding complex traits. This study explores strategies integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with rare-variant association tests to identify potential enhancers. Machine learning models are employed to predict variant functionality, while functional assays validate their regulatory roles. By combining computational and experimental approaches, this research advances the identification of noncoding variants, offering insights into their contributions to phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility.", "label": 0}
