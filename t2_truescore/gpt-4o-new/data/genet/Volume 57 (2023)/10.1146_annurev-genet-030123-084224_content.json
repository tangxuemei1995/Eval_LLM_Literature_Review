{"grounding": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by excess activation of the innate immune system in an antigen-independent manner. Starting with the discovery of the causal gene for familial Mediterranean fever, more than 50\u00a0monogenic SAIDs have been described. These discoveries, paired with advances in immunology and genomics, have allowed our understanding of these diseases to improve drastically in the last decade. The genetic causes of SAIDs are complex and include both germline and somatic pathogenic variants that affect various inflammatory signaling pathways. We provide an overview of the acquired SAIDs from a genetic perspective and summarize the clinical phenotypes and mechanism(s) of inflammation, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a group of disorders characterized by dysregulated innate immune responses, often driven by genetic factors. This review explores the genetic underpinnings of SAIDs, highlighting the roles of monogenic, digenic, and polygenic contributions to disease pathogenesis. Recent advances in genomics have elucidated key mutations in genes such as NLRP3, MEFV, and TNFRSF1A, which are pivotal in monogenic SAIDs. Additionally, digenic and polygenic models reveal complex interactions between multiple genetic loci, contributing to disease variability and severity. Epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations further complicate the genetic landscape, influencing gene expression and immune function. Understanding these genetic mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving diagnostic precision in SAIDs.", "label": 1}
