{"grounding": "Programmed cell death (self-induced) is intrinsic to all cellular life forms, including unicellular organisms. However, cell death research has focused on animal models to understand cancer, degenerative disorders, and developmental processes. Recently delineated suicidal death mechanisms in bacteria and fungi have revealed ancient origins of animal cell death that are intertwined with immune mechanisms, allaying earlier doubts that self-inflicted cell death pathways exist in microorganisms. Approximately 20 mammalian death pathways have been partially characterized over the last 35 years. By contrast, more than 100 death mechanisms have been identified in bacteria and a few fungi in recent years. However, cell death is nearly unstudied in most human pathogenic microbes that cause major public health burdens. Here, we consider how the current understanding of programmed cell death arose through animal studies and how recently uncovered microbial cell death mechanisms in fungi and bacteria resemble and differ from mechanisms of mammalian cell death.", "generated_text": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a crucial biological process traditionally associated with multicellular organisms, where it plays a vital role in development, homeostasis, and defense mechanisms. However, recent studies have revealed that PCD also occurs in unicellular organisms, challenging the conventional understanding of its evolutionary origins and functions. This review explores the mechanisms and evolutionary significance of PCD in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, highlighting the similarities and differences in their regulatory pathways. In unicellular organisms, PCD may serve as a population control mechanism, enhance genetic diversity, or provide a competitive advantage under stress conditions. In contrast, multicellular organisms utilize PCD for tissue sculpting, immune responses, and the elimination of damaged cells. Understanding the diverse roles of PCD across different life forms not only provides insights into the evolution of complex life but also opens new avenues for biotechnological and medical applications targeting microbial and cellular processes.", "label": 1}
