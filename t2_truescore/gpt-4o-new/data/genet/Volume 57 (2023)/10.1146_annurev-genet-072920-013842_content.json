{"grounding": "Assigning functions to genes and learning how to control their expression are part of the foundation of cell biology and therapeutic development. An efficient and unbiased method to accomplish this is genetic screening, which historically required laborious clone generation and phenotyping and is still limited by scale today. The rapid technological progress on modulating gene function with CRISPR-Cas and measuring it in individual cells has now relaxed the major experimental constraints and enabled pooled screening with complex readouts from single cells. Here, we review the principles and practical considerations for pooled single-cell CRISPR screening. We discuss perturbation strategies, experimental model systems, matching the perturbation to the individual cells, reading out cell phenotypes, and data analysis. Our focus is on single-cell RNA sequencing and cell sorting\u2013based readouts, including image-enabled cell sorting. We expect this transformative approach to fuel biomedical research for the next several decades.", "generated_text": "The advent of CRISPR technology has revolutionized functional genomics, enabling precise genome editing at an unprecedented scale. This study explores the integration of pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens with single-cell analysis to enhance our understanding of gene function. By employing high-throughput cell sorting techniques, we can isolate and analyze individual cells that have undergone specific genetic modifications. This approach allows for the dissection of complex genetic interactions and the identification of novel gene functions within heterogeneous cell populations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining CRISPR screens with single-cell genomics to uncover intricate cellular pathways and regulatory networks. This methodology not only accelerates the discovery of gene function but also provides insights into cellular heterogeneity and its implications in health and disease. The integration of these cutting-edge technologies marks a significant advancement in the field of genomics, offering new avenues for research and therapeutic development.", "label": 1}
