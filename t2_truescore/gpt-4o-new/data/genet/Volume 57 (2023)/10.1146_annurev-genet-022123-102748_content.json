{"grounding": "Coral reefs are both exceptionally biodiverse and threatened by climate change and other human activities. Here, we review population genomic processes in coral reef taxa and their importance for understanding responses to global change. Many taxa on coral reefs are characterized by weak genetic drift, extensive gene flow, and strong selection from complex biotic and abiotic environments, which together present a fascinating test of microevolutionary theory. Selection, gene flow, and hybridization have played and will continue to play an important role in the adaptation or extinction of coral reef taxa in the face of rapid environmental change, but research remains exceptionally limited compared to the urgent needs. Critical areas for future investigation include understanding evolutionary potential and the mechanisms of local adaptation, developing historical baselines, and building greater research capacity in the countries where most reef diversity is concentrated.", "generated_text": "Coral reefs are facing unprecedented challenges due to climate change, necessitating a deeper understanding of their adaptive potential. This study explores the population genomics of coral reef species, focusing on local adaptation, dispersal, and evolutionary rescue mechanisms. By analyzing genetic variation across multiple fish populations, we aim to identify genomic regions associated with resilience to environmental stressors. Our findings highlight the role of gene flow in facilitating adaptive responses, while also emphasizing the importance of local adaptation in maintaining population viability. The interplay between dispersal and selection pressures is crucial for predicting the evolutionary trajectories of coral reef species under changing climatic conditions. This research provides insights into the genetic basis of adaptation, offering potential strategies for conservation and management efforts aimed at preserving coral reef biodiversity in the face of global change.", "label": 1}
