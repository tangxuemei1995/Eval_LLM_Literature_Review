{"grounding": "The ease and throughput of single-cell genomics have steadily improved, and its current trajectory suggests that surveying single-cell populations will become routine. We discuss the merger of quantitative genetics with single-cell genomics and emphasize how this synergizes with advantages intrinsic to plants. Single-cell population genomics provides increased detection resolution when mapping variants that control molecular traits, including gene expression or chromatin accessibility. Additionally, single-cell population genomics reveals the cell types in which variants act and, when combined with organism-level phenotype measurements, unveils which cellular contexts impact higher-order traits. Emerging technologies, notably multiomics, can facilitate the measurement of both genetic changes and genomic traits in single cells, enabling single-cell genetic experiments. The implementation of single-cell genetics will advance the investigation of the genetic architecture of complex molecular traits and provide new experimental paradigms to study eukaryotic genetics.", "generated_text": "The integration of single-cell genomics with quantitative genetics offers a powerful approach to unravel the genetic underpinnings of complex traits. This study explores the potential of single-cell technologies to dissect gene expression and chromatin accessibility at unprecedented resolution, providing insights into the cellular heterogeneity underlying phenotypic diversity. By analyzing mutants and natural populations, we aim to identify genetic variants that influence cellular phenotypes, thereby linking genotype to phenotype at the single-cell level. Our approach leverages population genetics frameworks to interpret the effects of genetic variation on cellular function, facilitating the discovery of novel regulatory elements and pathways. This research not only enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits but also paves the way for precision medicine applications by identifying cell-type-specific genetic determinants of disease.", "label": 1}
