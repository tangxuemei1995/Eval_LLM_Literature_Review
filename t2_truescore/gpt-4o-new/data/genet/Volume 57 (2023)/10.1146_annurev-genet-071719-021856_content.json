{"grounding": "Enzymes that phosphorylate, dephosphorylate, and ligate RNA 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were discovered more than half a century ago and were eventually shown to repair purposeful site-specific endonucleolytic breaks in the RNA phosphodiester backbone. The pace of discovery and characterization of new candidate RNA repair activities in taxa from all phylogenetic domains greatly exceeds our understanding of the biological pathways in which they act. The key questions anent RNA break repair in vivo are (a) identifying the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage and (b) determining whether RNA repair results in restoration of the original RNA, modification of the RNA (by loss or gain at the ends), or rearrangements of the broken RNA segments (i.e., RNA recombination). This review provides a perspective on the discovery, mechanisms, and physiology of purposeful RNA break repair, highlighting exemplary repair pathways (e.g., tRNA restriction-repair and tRNA splicing) for which genetics has figured prominently in their elucidation.", "generated_text": "RNA repair mechanisms, particularly those involving tRNA, have long been overshadowed by the more extensively studied DNA repair processes. This review delves into the intricate processes of tRNA restriction and splicing, highlighting the critical roles of end healing and end sealing in maintaining RNA integrity. Central to these processes are the enzymes polynucleotide kinase\u2013phosphatase and RNA ligase, which facilitate the precise rejoining of RNA strands. Recent advancements in enzyme discovery have shed light on the sophisticated nature of these repair systems, revealing their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention. By exploring the molecular intricacies of tRNA repair, this study underscores the importance of RNA maintenance in cellular homeostasis and the potential for novel biotechnological applications. The findings suggest that RNA repair, though often overlooked, is a fundamental aspect of cellular biology, with significant implications for understanding genetic regulation and developing innovative treatments for RNA-related disorders.", "label": 0}
