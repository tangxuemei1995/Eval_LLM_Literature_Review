{"grounding": "Augmented reality (AR) systems aim to alter our view of the world and enable us to see things that are not actually there. The resulting discrepancy between perception and reality can create compelling entertainment and can support innovative approaches to education, guidance, and assistive tools. However, building an AR system that effectively integrates with our natural visual experience is hard. AR systems often suffer from visual limitations and artifacts, and addressing these flaws requires basic knowledge of perception. At the same time, AR system development can serve as a catalyst that drives innovative new research in perceptual science. This review describes recent perceptual research pertinent to and driven by modern AR systems, with the goal of highlighting thought-provoking areas of inquiry and open questions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the perceptual science underlying augmented reality (AR) and its implications for display systems. By integrating digital information with the physical world, AR enhances user interaction and perception. The research examines how visual perception is influenced by AR technologies, focusing on the alignment of virtual and real-world elements. Key factors such as depth perception, spatial awareness, and user interface design are analyzed to optimize AR experiences. The study also addresses challenges in achieving seamless integration and minimizing perceptual discrepancies. Findings suggest that advancements in display systems can significantly enhance the effectiveness of AR applications across various fields, including education, healthcare, and entertainment. This research contributes to the development of more intuitive and immersive AR environments, improving user engagement and satisfaction.", "label": 1}
