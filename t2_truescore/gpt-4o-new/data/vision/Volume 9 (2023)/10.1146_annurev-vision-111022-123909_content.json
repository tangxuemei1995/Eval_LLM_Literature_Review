{"grounding": "This review examines the concept of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in patients with macular diseases. Considering monocular and binocular viewing, we (a) explain how to identify the PRL and discuss the pitfalls associated with its measurement, (b) review the current hypotheses for PRL development, (c) assess whether the PRL is the new reference point of the ocular motor system, and discuss (d) the functional and (e) the clinical implications of the PRL. We conclude that the current definition of the PRL is probably incomplete and should incorporate the need to evaluate the PRL in the framework of binocular viewing. We emphasize the need for more research.", "generated_text": "The preferred retinal locus (PRL) is a critical concept in understanding visual adaptation following central vision loss, such as that caused by macular degeneration. It refers to the area of the retina that individuals use for fixation when the fovea is compromised. This study explores the characteristics and development of PRL, emphasizing its role in maintaining fixation stability and visual function under binocular viewing conditions. By examining the mechanisms behind PRL formation and its impact on visual performance, the research provides insights into rehabilitation strategies for individuals with central vision impairment, aiming to enhance their quality of life through improved visual adaptation.", "label": 0}
