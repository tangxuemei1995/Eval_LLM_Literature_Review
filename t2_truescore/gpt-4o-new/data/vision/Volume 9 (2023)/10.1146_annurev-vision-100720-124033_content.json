{"grounding": "Using natural scenes is an approach to studying the visual and eye movement systems approximating how these systems function in everyday life. This review examines the results from behavioral and neurophysiological studies using natural scene viewing in humans and monkeys. The use of natural scenes for the study of cerebral cortical activity is relatively new and presents challenges for data analysis. Methods and results from the use of natural scenes for the study of the visual and eye movement cortex are presented, with emphasis on new insights that this method provides enhancing what is known about these cortical regions from the use of conventional methods.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the cerebral cortex's involvement in visual search by examining rhesus monkeys' responses to natural scenes. By analyzing saccadic eye movements, we aim to elucidate the roles of the visual cortex and frontal eye field in processing complex visual stimuli. Our findings suggest that natural scenes provide a more ecologically valid context for understanding cortical mechanisms compared to artificial stimuli. The results highlight the intricate interplay between different cortical areas in guiding visual attention and decision-making processes. This research advances our comprehension of the cerebral cortex's functional architecture, offering insights into the neural basis of visual search behaviors in primates.", "label": 0}
