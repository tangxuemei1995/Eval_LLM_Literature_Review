{"grounding": "Global health security threats and the public health impact resulting from emerging infectious diseases including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent Ebola virus disease outbreaks continuously emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to preparedness, management of disease outbreaks, and health sequelae associated with emergent pathogens. A spectrum of associated ophthalmic manifestations, along with the potential persistence of emerging viral pathogens in ocular tissues, highlight the importance of an ophthalmic approach to contributing to efforts in the response to public health emergencies from disease outbreaks. This article summarizes the ophthalmic and systemic findings, epidemiology, and therapeutics for emerging viral pathogens identified by the World Health Organization as high-priority pathogens with epidemic potential.", "generated_text": "Emerging pathogenic viral infections pose significant threats to ocular health, with viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus demonstrating notable ophthalmic manifestations. This review explores the mechanisms of viral persistence in ocular tissues and the resultant conditions, including uveitis. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential for systemic viral infections to impact eye health, necessitating a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis in ocular contexts. Similarly, Ebola virus disease has been associated with severe uveitis, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring and management of eye complications in viral outbreaks. This study emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in diagnosing and treating viral-induced eye diseases, aiming to mitigate long-term visual impairment.", "label": 1}
