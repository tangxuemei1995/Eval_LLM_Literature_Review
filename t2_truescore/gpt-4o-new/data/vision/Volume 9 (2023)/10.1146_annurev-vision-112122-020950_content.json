{"grounding": "Because the central nervous system is largely nonrenewing, neurons and their synapses must be maintained over the lifetime of an individual to ensure circuit function. Age is a dominant risk factor for neural diseases, and declines in nervous system function are a common feature of aging even in the absence of disease. These alterations extend to the visual system and, in particular, to the retina. The retina is a site of clinically relevant age-related alterations but has also proven to be a uniquely approachable system for discovering principles that govern neural aging because it is well mapped, contains diverse neuron types, and is experimentally accessible. In this article, we review the structural and molecular impacts of aging on neurons within the inner and outer retina circuits. We further discuss the contribution of non-neuronal cell types and systems to retinal aging outcomes. Understanding how and why the retina ages is critical to efforts aimed at preventing age-related neural decline and restoring neural function.", "generated_text": "The aging retina undergoes significant structural and functional changes, impacting visual acuity and overall ocular health. This study explores the molecular landscapes that underpin these alterations, focusing on the synaptic and neuronal components of the retina. As the retina ages, synaptic connections between photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells exhibit morphological and functional decline, contributing to impaired signal transmission. Neuronal populations, particularly retinal ganglion cells, experience a reduction in density and synaptic plasticity, which are critical for maintaining visual processing. Molecular analyses reveal age-associated shifts in gene expression and protein profiles, highlighting pathways involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and cellular senescence. These molecular changes are implicated in the deterioration of synaptic integrity and neuronal function. Understanding the interplay between structural changes and molecular mechanisms in the aging retina is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related visual decline. This research underscores the importance of targeting synaptic and neuronal health to preserve retinal function in the aging population.", "label": 1}
