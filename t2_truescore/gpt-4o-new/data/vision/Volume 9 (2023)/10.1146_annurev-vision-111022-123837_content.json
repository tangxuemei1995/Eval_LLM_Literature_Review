{"grounding": "The pervasiveness of mobile devices and other associated technologies has affected all aspects of our daily lives. People with visual impairments are no exception, as they increasingly tend to rely on mobile apps for assistance with various visual tasks in daily life. Compared to dedicated visual aids, mobile apps offer advantages such as affordability, versatility, portability, and ubiquity. We have surveyed hundreds of mobile apps of potential interest to people with vision impairments, either released as special assistive apps claiming to help in tasks such as text or object recognition (n = 68), digital accessibility (n = 84), navigation (n = 44), and remote sighted service (n = 4), among others, or marketed as general camera magnification apps that can be used for visual assistance (n = 77). While assistive apps as a whole received positive feedback from visually impaired users, as reported in various studies, evaluations of the usability of every app were typically limited to user reviews, which are often not scientifically informative. Rigorous evaluation studies on the effect of vision assistance apps on daily task performance and quality of life are relatively rare. Moreover, evaluation criteria are difficult to establish, given the heterogeneity of the visual tasks and visual needs of the users. In addition to surveying literature on vision assistance apps, this review discusses the feasibility and necessity of conducting scientific research to understand visual needs and methods to evaluate real-world benefits.", "generated_text": "The advent of mobile technology has revolutionized the landscape of assistive devices for individuals with visual impairments, offering unprecedented opportunities for enhanced accessibility and independence. This study explores the impact of mobile applications designed as assistive tools for visually impaired persons, focusing on their role in vision rehabilitation and daily life facilitation. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and user feedback, this research identifies key functionalities of these apps, such as object recognition, navigation assistance, and text-to-speech conversion, which significantly contribute to improving the quality of life for users. The study also examines the challenges faced in the adoption and usability of these applications, including issues related to user interface design, device compatibility, and the need for personalized features. Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of collaboration between app developers, healthcare professionals, and end-users to ensure that these digital solutions are both effective and user-friendly. The findings suggest that while mobile apps hold great potential as assistive devices, ongoing advancements in technology and increased awareness are crucial for maximizing their benefits. This study underscores the need for continued innovation and research in the field of mobile accessibility to address the diverse needs of the visually impaired community, ultimately fostering greater inclusion and empowerment. The implications of this research extend to policymakers, developers, and educators aiming to enhance the accessibility and functionality of assistive technologies.", "label": 1}
