{"grounding": "The basal ganglia (BG) make up a prominent nexus between visual and motor-related brain regions. In contrast to the BG's well-established roles in movement control and value-based decision making, their contributions to the transformation of visual input into an action remain unclear, especially in the context of perceptual decisions based on uncertain visual evidence. This article reviews recent progress in our understanding of the BG's contributions to the formation, evaluation, and adjustment of such decisions. From theoretical and experimental perspectives, the review focuses on four key stations in the BG network, namely, the striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons, which can have different roles and together support the decision process.", "generated_text": "The basal ganglia, particularly the striatum and pallidum, play a crucial role in visual perceptual decision-making processes. This study investigates their contributions by examining saccadic choices and reaction times in decision tasks. Utilizing sequential analysis and signal detection theory, we explore how these subcortical structures influence the integration of sensory information and the execution of motor responses. Our findings suggest that the striatum is involved in the accumulation of evidence leading to a decision, while the pallidum modulates the threshold for action initiation. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making and have implications for disorders characterized by impaired perceptual decision processes, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.", "label": 0}
