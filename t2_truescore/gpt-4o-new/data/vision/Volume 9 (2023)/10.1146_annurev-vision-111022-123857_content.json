{"grounding": "The visual system must reconstruct the dynamic, three-dimensional (3D) world from ambiguous two-dimensional (2D) retinal images. In this review, we synthesize current literature on how the visual system of nonhuman primates performs this transformation through multiple channels within the classically defined dorsal (where) and ventral (what) pathways. Each of these channels is specialized for processing different 3D features (e.g., the shape, orientation, or motion of objects, or the larger scene structure). Despite the common goal of 3D reconstruction, neurocomputational differences between the channels impose distinct information-limiting constraints on perception. Convergent evidence further points to the little-studied area V3A as a potential branchpoint from which multiple 3D-fugal processing channels diverge. We speculate that the expansion of V3A in humans may have supported the emergence of advanced 3D spatial reasoning skills. Lastly, we discuss future directions for exploring 3D information transmission across brain areas and experimental approaches that can further advance the understanding of 3D vision.", "generated_text": "Understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying three-dimensional (3D) vision in nonhuman primates is crucial for elucidating the evolution and functionality of complex visual processing. This study investigates the neural representations that support 3D vision, focusing on stereopsis, perspective, depth perception, orientation, and motion. By employing advanced neuroimaging techniques and electrophysiological recordings, we identify specific brain regions and neuronal circuits involved in processing 3D visual information. Our findings reveal that neurons in the visual cortex exhibit specialized responses to binocular disparity, which is essential for stereopsis, and are finely tuned to detect depth cues and motion parallax. Additionally, we observe that these neurons integrate perspective and orientation information to construct a coherent 3D representation of the environment. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural basis of 3D vision and provide a foundation for further research into visual perception and its applications in artificial intelligence and robotics. This study underscores the complexity and sophistication of primate visual systems.", "label": 1}
