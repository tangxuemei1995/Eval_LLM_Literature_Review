{"grounding": "Some visual properties are consistent across a wide range of environments, while other properties are more labile. The efficient coding hypothesis states that many of these regularities in the environment can be discarded from neural representations, thus allocating more of the brain's dynamic range to properties that are likely to vary. This paradigm is less clear about how the visual system prioritizes different pieces of information that vary across visual environments. One solution is to prioritize information that can be used to predict future events, particularly those that guide behavior. The relationship between the efficient coding and future prediction paradigms is an area of active investigation. In this review, we argue that these paradigms are complementary and often act on distinct components of the visual input. We also discuss how normative approaches to efficient coding and future prediction can be integrated.", "generated_text": "The study of neural coding in vision has revealed a dual role in both efficient information processing and predictive capabilities. This research explores the intersection of efficient coding and prediction within the visual system, employing the information bottleneck framework to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Efficient coding posits that neural systems optimize the representation of sensory inputs by reducing redundancy, thereby conserving metabolic resources. Concurrently, predictive coding suggests that the brain anticipates future sensory inputs, enhancing perceptual accuracy and decision-making. By integrating these paradigms, we propose a unified model that leverages the information bottleneck to balance the trade-off between compression and prediction. Our findings suggest that this dual coding strategy not only optimizes resource allocation but also enhances the system's adaptability to dynamic environments. This work advances our understanding of neural processing, offering insights into the fundamental principles governing sensory information management.", "label": 1}
