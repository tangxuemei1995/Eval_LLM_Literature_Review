{"grounding": "Perception and memory are traditionally thought of as separate cognitive functions, supported by distinct brain regions. The canonical perspective is that perceptual processing of visual information is supported by the ventral visual stream, whereas long-term declarative memory is supported by the medial temporal lobe. However, this modular framework cannot account for the increasingly large body of evidence that reveals a role for early visual areas in long-term recognition memory and a role for medial temporal lobe structures in high-level perceptual processing. In this article, we review relevant research conducted in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. We conclude that the evidence is largely inconsistent with theoretical proposals that draw sharp functional boundaries between perceptual and memory systems in the brain. Instead, the weight of the empirical findings is best captured by a representational-hierarchical model that emphasizes differences in content, rather than in cognitive processes within the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between perception and memory within the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe, with a particular focus on the perirhinal cortex. The ventral visual stream is crucial for object recognition, while the medial temporal lobe, including the perirhinal cortex, plays a significant role in memory formation and retrieval. By integrating neuroimaging data and behavioral assessments, we examine how these regions interact to support cognitive processes. Our findings suggest that the perirhinal cortex acts as a critical interface, facilitating the encoding and retrieval of perceptual information into long-term memory. Furthermore, disruptions in this interaction may underlie certain memory disorders. This research enhances our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying perception and memory, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for cognitive impairments. The study underscores the importance of the perirhinal cortex in bridging perceptual and mnemonic functions, highlighting its role in the seamless integration of sensory experiences into memory.", "label": 0}
