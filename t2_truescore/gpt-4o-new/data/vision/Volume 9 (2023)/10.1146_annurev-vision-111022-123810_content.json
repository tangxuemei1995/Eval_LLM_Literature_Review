{"grounding": "Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) is clinically diagnosed as a vascular disease, many studies find retinal neuronal and visual dysfunction before the onset of vascular DR. This suggests that DR should be viewed as a neurovascular disease. Prior to the onset of DR, human patients have compromised electroretinograms that indicate a disruption of normal function, particularly in the inner retina. They also exhibit reduced contrast sensitivity. These early changes, especially those due to dysfunction in the inner retina, are also seen in rodent models of diabetes in the early stages of the disease. Rodent models of diabetes exhibit several neuronal mechanisms, such as reduced evoked GABA release, increased excitatory glutamate signaling, and reduced dopamine signaling, that suggest specific neuronal deficits. This suggests that understanding neuronal deficits may lead to early diabetes treatments to ameliorate neuronal dysfunction.", "generated_text": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that significantly impacts visual function, primarily through its effects on the retina. This review explores the physiological changes in retinal neurons in both human and rodent models, including mice and rats, to understand the mechanisms underlying visual dysfunction in diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, a common complication, is characterized by alterations in retinal blood vessels and neuronal damage. The study highlights the role of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in disrupting retinal physiology. Rodent models provide valuable insights into the progression of retinal changes, offering a platform for testing potential therapeutic interventions. Understanding the neuronal and vascular interactions in the diabetic retina is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or mitigate visual impairment in diabetic patients. This research underscores the importance of early detection and management of diabetes to preserve visual function.", "label": 1}
