{"grounding": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are machine learning algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision due to their remarkable successes in tasks like object classification and segmentation. The success of DNNs as computer vision algorithms has led to the suggestion that DNNs may also be good models of human visual perception. In this article, we review evidence regarding current DNNs as adequate behavioral models of human core object recognition. To this end, we argue that it is important to distinguish between statistical tools and computational models and to understand model quality as a multidimensional concept in which clarity about modeling goals is key. Reviewing a large number of psychophysical and computational explorations of core object recognition performance in humans and DNNs, we argue that DNNs are highly valuable scientific tools but that, as of today, DNNs should only be regarded as promising\u2014but not yet adequate\u2014computational models of human core object recognition behavior. On the way, we dispel several myths surrounding DNNs in vision science.", "generated_text": "The advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has revolutionized the field of computer vision, offering unprecedented performance in object recognition tasks. This study investigates the adequacy of DNNs as behavioral models of human visual perception, particularly in the context of visual psychophysics. By comparing the performance of DNNs with human subjects across a range of object recognition tasks, we aim to assess the extent to which these computational models can replicate human perceptual processes. Our analysis reveals that while DNNs excel in recognizing objects under controlled conditions, discrepancies arise in scenarios involving occlusions, noise, and novel viewpoints, where human perception remains robust. Furthermore, we explore the underlying neural mechanisms and architectural differences that contribute to these variations. The findings suggest that although DNNs provide valuable insights into the computational aspects of vision, they fall short of capturing the full complexity of human visual perception. This highlights the need for integrating insights from cognitive neuroscience to enhance the fidelity of DNN-based models.", "label": 1}
