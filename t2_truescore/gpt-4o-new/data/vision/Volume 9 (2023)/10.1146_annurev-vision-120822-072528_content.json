{"grounding": "As we navigate and behave in the world, we are constantly deciding, a few times per second, where to look next. The outcomes of these decisions in response to visual input are comparatively easy to measure as trajectories of eye movements, offering insight into many unconscious and conscious visual and cognitive processes. In this article, we review recent advances in predicting where we look. We focus on evaluating and comparing models: How can we consistently measure how well models predict eye movements, and how can we judge the contribution of different mechanisms? Probabilistic models facilitate a unified approach to fixation prediction that allows us to use explainable information explained to compare different models across different settings, such as static and video saliency, as well as scanpath prediction. We review how the large variety of saliency maps and scanpath models can be translated into this unifying framework, how much different factors contribute, and how we can select the most informative examples for model comparison. We conclude that the universal scale of information gain offers a powerful tool for the inspection of candidate mechanisms and experimental design that helps us understand the continual decision-making process that determines where we look.", "generated_text": "The study of visual fixations is pivotal in understanding human attention and perception. This research aims to advance the field by developing a comprehensive framework for predicting visual fixations, integrating insights from eye movements, saliency models, and information theory. We propose a unifying framework that consolidates existing models and introduces a novel taxonomy for categorizing fixation prediction approaches. Our methodology involves a rigorous model comparison, leveraging a diverse set of benchmarks to evaluate performance across different contexts and datasets. By employing transfer learning techniques, we enhance model adaptability and generalization, facilitating the application of fixation prediction models to varied visual environments. The study also explores the role of information theory in quantifying the efficiency and effectiveness of fixation predictions, providing a robust metric for model evaluation. Our findings suggest that a unified approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also offers a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of visual attention. This research contributes to the field by offering a standardized benchmarking protocol and a comprehensive taxonomy, paving the way for future advancements in fixation prediction models. The implications of this work extend to applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction, and cognitive neuroscience.", "label": 1}
