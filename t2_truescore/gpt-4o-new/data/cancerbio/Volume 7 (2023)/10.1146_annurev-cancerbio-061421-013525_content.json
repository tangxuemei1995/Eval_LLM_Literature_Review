{"grounding": "Estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 is expressed in the vast majority of breast cancers and is one of the most successfully prosecuted drug targets in oncology, with multiple classes of endocrine therapies approved for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer. These existing agents are highly active, both as single agents and as combination partners for other targeted therapies, and have significantly benefited patients. However, each of these standard-of-care (SOC) therapies has liabilities that allow for the reengagement of ER signaling as a mechanism of resistance. Data supporting the continued dependence of tumors on ER signaling following exposure to SOC agents have underpinned an extraordinary reenergizing of academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical groups pursuing next-generation ER-targeted therapies. The hypothesis that there remains an opportunity to bring further meaningful benefit to patients through fully optimized ER-targeted therapies is currently being investigated in the clinic.", "generated_text": "The development of next-generation estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted therapeutics represents a promising frontier in breast cancer treatment. This review explores the advancements in selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs), which are designed to overcome resistance mechanisms associated with traditional endocrine therapies. SERMs, such as tamoxifen, have been pivotal in modulating ER activity, while SERDs offer a novel approach by promoting ER degradation, thereby reducing receptor-mediated signaling. Recent innovations in these therapeutic classes aim to enhance efficacy and minimize adverse effects, addressing the limitations of current treatments. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the potential of these agents to improve outcomes in ER-positive breast cancer patients, particularly those with metastatic disease. This paper highlights the molecular mechanisms, clinical progress, and future directions of ER-targeted therapies, underscoring their critical role in personalized cancer treatment strategies.", "label": 1}
