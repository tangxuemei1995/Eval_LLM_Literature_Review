{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a new opportunity for cancer treatment; however, resistance can occur due to intrinsic (T cells), extrinsic (tumors), or acquired (tumors) factors. In many cases, the knowledge of these mechanisms comes from clinical observations of patients treated with CAR T cells. In addition, the structure of the CAR molecule and the manufacturing process can impact CAR T cell efficacy. Extrinsic factors such as the mutations in the tumor cell, or cells in the tumor microenvironment, can also play a role. Tumor cells may exhibit acquired antigen loss or heterogeneity that enables resistance to CAR T cell killing; additionally, myeloid cells, T regulatory cells, and fibroblasts can exert an immunosuppressive effect and abrogate CAR T cell antitumor efficacy. We will discuss these mechanisms of resistance and the novel approaches being used to overcome them to improve the widespread use of this promising cancer therapy.", "generated_text": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, offering promising outcomes for hematological malignancies. However, resistance to CAR T cell therapies remains a significant challenge, limiting their efficacy. This review explores the mechanisms underlying resistance to CAR T cell therapies, categorizing them into intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic resistance involves tumor cell-intrinsic factors such as antigen loss, antigen modulation, and the upregulation of inhibitory pathways. Extrinsic resistance encompasses the tumor microenvironment's role, including immunosuppressive cells, cytokines, and metabolic barriers that hinder CAR T cell function. Understanding these resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to enhance CAR T cell efficacy. Potential solutions include engineering CAR T cells with enhanced persistence, multi-targeting capabilities, and resistance to immunosuppressive signals. This comprehensive analysis aims to inform future research directions and therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cancer immunotherapy.", "label": 1}
