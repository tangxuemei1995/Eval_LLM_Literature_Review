{"grounding": "Organoid models have revolutionized cancer research through their ability to capture the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of a tumor in 3D culture. Patient-derived organoids can also mirror responses to therapy in vitro, opening the doors to personalized medicine that can direct clinical decision-making. As cancer immunotherapy has flourished and efforts to develop novel immunotherapies have increased, models that incorporate immune cells into organoid coculture to recapitulate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment faithfully are in high demand. To this end, a wide variety of organoid immune coculture methods have been developed, each differing in the source of immune cells used, types of immune cells maintained in culture, and their specific utility. This review aims to organize these methods into a framework that will aid researchers in choosing the appropriate system for their experimental needs. We also highlight several nonimmune cell types that have been successfully incorporated into organoid culture and the biology these coculture models are poised to interrogate.", "generated_text": "The development of organoid models that accurately recapitulate the tumor immune microenvironment is crucial for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. This study explores the engineering of immune microenvironments within tumor organoids, focusing on the integration of patient-derived organoids with immune cells in coculture systems. By incorporating immune components such as T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells into these organoids, we aim to mimic the complex interactions present in the tumor microenvironment. Our approach leverages advanced coculture techniques to maintain the viability and functionality of both tumor and immune cells, providing a more physiologically relevant model for studying tumor-immune interactions. Preliminary results demonstrate that coculture organoids exhibit enhanced immune cell infiltration and activation, offering insights into immune evasion mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. This innovative model holds promise for high-throughput drug screening and the development of immunotherapies tailored to individual patient profiles, ultimately contributing to more effective cancer treatment strategies.", "label": 1}
