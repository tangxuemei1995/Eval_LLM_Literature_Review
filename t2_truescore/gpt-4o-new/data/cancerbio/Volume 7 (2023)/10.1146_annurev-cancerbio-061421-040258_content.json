{"grounding": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors induce significant and durable treatment responses in about 20% of all cancers, but many patients have natural resistance to current immunotherapies. The past decade of technological advances has resulted in large-scale profiling of many cancers and their tumor microenvironments, rapidly expanding our understanding of the mechanisms utilized by tumors to create immune-resistant microenvironments. In this review, we discuss key factors that create immune resistance and emerging concepts that are redefining how we view immune resistance, as well as highlight novel strategies that aim to convert immune-resistant into immune-sensitive tumors.", "generated_text": "Cold tumors, characterized by low immune cell infiltration, present a significant challenge to effective immunotherapy. This study explores strategies to modify the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. By integrating approaches such as cytokine therapy, oncolytic viruses, and targeted radiation, we aim to convert cold tumors into hot, immunologically active ones. Recent clinical trials demonstrate promising results, indicating improved patient responses and survival rates. Our findings underscore the potential of these strategies to revolutionize cancer treatment, offering new hope for patients with previously unresponsive tumors.", "label": 0}
