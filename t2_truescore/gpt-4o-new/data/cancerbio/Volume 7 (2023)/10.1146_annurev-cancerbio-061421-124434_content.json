{"grounding": "Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that promotes tissue homeostasis by identifying damaged cells for immune-mediated clearance. Thus, the ability to evade senescence and the ensuing immune surveillance is a hallmark of cancer. Reactivation of senescence programs can result in profound immune-mediated tumor regressions or sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, although the aberrant persistence of senescent cells can promote tissue decline and contribute to the side effects of some cancer therapies. In this review, we first briefly describe the discovery of senescence as a tumor-suppressive program. Next, we highlight the dueling good and bad effects of the senescence-associated secretory program (SASP) in cancer, including SASP-dependent immune effects. We then summarize the beneficial and deleterious effects of senescence induction by cancer therapies and strategies in development to leverage senescence therapeutically. Finally, we highlight challenges and unmet needs in understanding senescence in cancer and developing senescence-modulating therapies.", "generated_text": "Cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest, plays a dual role in cancer biology, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter of tumor progression. This paradoxical nature is largely mediated by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can enhance immune surveillance to eliminate senescent cells but also create a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) is a promising strategy to halt cancer cell proliferation, yet the persistence of senescent cells can lead to adverse effects. The emerging 'one-two punch' therapy aims to first induce senescence in cancer cells and subsequently eliminate them using senolytic agents, thereby mitigating the negative consequences of SASP. This review explores the complex biology of senescence in cancer, highlighting the potential of targeting senescent cells to improve therapeutic outcomes and the challenges that remain in harnessing this approach effectively.", "label": 1}
