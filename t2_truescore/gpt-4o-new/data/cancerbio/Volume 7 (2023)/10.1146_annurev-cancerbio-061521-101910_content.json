{"grounding": "Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with tumor progression in several clinical and experimental settings and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Its relation to cancer immunosurveillance is complex. Clonally heterogeneous tumors are associated with decreased immunosurveillance and are less responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition, but the mechanistic basis underlying these observations remains unclear. One possibility is that tumors that are under active immunosurveillance are relatively homogeneous because immunosurveillance prevents the outgrowth of immunogenic subclones. Alternatively, high ITH might directly impair immunosurveillance due to lower dosages of subclonal antigens, competition between antigens and immunodominance, the induction of detrimental T cell differentiation programs, or negative feedback loops. Here we review the evidence for these scenarios and outline hypotheses that could underlie the negative association between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance.", "generated_text": "Clonal heterogeneity within tumors presents a significant challenge to effective cancer immunosurveillance and immunotherapy. This study explores the impact of intratumor heterogeneity on the immune system's ability to detect and eliminate cancer cells. By analyzing diverse clonal populations within tumors, we demonstrate that heterogeneity can lead to immune evasion, as different clones may express varying levels of neoantigens and immune checkpoint molecules. Our findings suggest that clonal diversity can undermine the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, a cornerstone of modern immunotherapy. We propose that strategies to address clonal heterogeneity, such as combination therapies targeting multiple clones or enhancing neoantigen presentation, could improve patient outcomes. This research underscores the need for personalized approaches in cancer treatment, considering the unique clonal architecture of each tumor.", "label": 1}
