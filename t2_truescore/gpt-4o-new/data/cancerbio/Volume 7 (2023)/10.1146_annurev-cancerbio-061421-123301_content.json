{"grounding": "During tumor evolution, cancer cells can acquire the ability to proliferate, invade neighboring tissues, evade the immune system, and spread systemically. Tracking this process remains challenging, as many key events occur stochastically and over long times, which could be addressed by studying the phylogenetic relationships among cancer cells. Several lineage tracing approaches have been developed and employed in many tumor models and contexts, providing critical insights into tumor evolution. Recent advances in single-cell lineage tracing have greatly expanded the resolution, scale, and readout of lineage tracing toolkits. In this review, we provide an overview of static lineage tracing methods, and then focus on evolving lineage tracing technologies that enable reconstruction of tumor phylogenies at unprecedented resolution. We also discuss in vivo applications of these technologies to profile subclonal dynamics, quantify tumor plasticity, and track metastasis. Finally, we highlight outstanding questions and emerging technologies for building comprehensive cancer evolution roadmaps.", "generated_text": "Lineage tracing has emerged as a pivotal technique in cancer biology, offering insights into tumor evolution and metastasis. Recent advancements in single-cell analysis and cell barcoding have revolutionized our ability to track cancer cell lineages in vivo with unprecedented resolution. This review highlights the latest tools and methodologies developed for lineage tracing in cancer research. We discuss the integration of CRISPR-based barcoding systems and high-throughput sequencing technologies, which enable the reconstruction of clonal dynamics and the identification of rare metastatic events. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these technologies in understanding tumor heterogeneity and the evolutionary trajectories of cancer cells. By providing a comprehensive overview of current innovations, this paper underscores the potential of lineage tracing to unravel the complexities of cancer progression and to inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. These tools promise to enhance our understanding of cancer biology and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
