{"grounding": "T cell reactivity to tumor-specific neoantigens can drive endogenous and therapeutically induced antitumor immunity. However, most tumor-specific neoantigens are unique to each patient (private) and targeting them requires personalized therapy. A smaller subset of neoantigens includes epitopes that span recurrent mutation hotspots, translocations, or gene fusions in oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors, as well as epitopes that arise from viral oncogenic proteins. Such antigens are likely to be shared across patients (public), uniformly expressed within a tumor, and required for cancer cell survival and fitness. Although a limited number of these public neoantigens are naturally immunogenic, recent studies affirm their clinical utility. In this review, we highlight efforts to target mutant KRAS, mutant p53, and epitopes derived from oncogenic viruses using T cells engineered with off-the-shelf T cell receptors. We also discuss the challenges and strategies to achieving more effective T cell therapies, particularly in the context of solid tumors.", "generated_text": "The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, with adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) emerging as a promising approach. This study explores the potential of targeting driver oncogenes and public neoantigens using T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular therapy. Driver oncogenes, which are critical for tumor growth and survival, present unique targets for TCR-based interventions. Public neoantigens, shared across different patients, offer an opportunity for broad-spectrum therapeutic strategies. We discuss the identification and validation of TCRs specific to these targets, emphasizing the importance of high-affinity interactions for effective tumor eradication. The integration of advanced genomic and proteomic technologies facilitates the discovery of these neoantigens, enhancing the precision of TCR-based therapies. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrate promising outcomes, with significant tumor regression and minimal off-target effects. This research underscores the potential of TCR-based ACT in providing personalized and effective cancer treatments, paving the way for future innovations in oncological immunotherapy.", "label": 0}
