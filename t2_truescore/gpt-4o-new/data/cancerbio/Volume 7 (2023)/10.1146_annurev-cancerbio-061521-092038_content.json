{"grounding": "Histopathology plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and subtyping of solid tumors and has become a cornerstone of modern precision oncology. Histopathological evaluation is typically performed manually by expert pathologists due to the complexity of visual data. However, in the last ten years, new artificial intelligence (AI) methods have made it possible to train computers to perform visual tasks with high performance, reaching similar levels as experts in some applications. In cancer histopathology, these AI tools could help automate repetitive tasks, making more efficient use of pathologists\u2019 time. In research studies, AI methods have been shown to have an astounding ability to predict genetic alterations and identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers directly from routine tissue slides. Here, we give an overview of these recent applications of AI in computational pathology, focusing on new tools for cancer research that could be pivotal in identifying clinical biomarkers for better treatment decisions.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into computational pathology is revolutionizing cancer diagnostics by enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of histopathological evaluations. This study explores the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in oncology, focusing on their role in identifying tumor characteristics and biomarkers from histopathological images. AI-driven models have demonstrated significant potential in improving diagnostic workflows by automating routine tasks, reducing human error, and providing quantitative insights that are often beyond human capability. These advancements not only streamline the diagnostic process but also contribute to personalized treatment strategies by identifying specific tumor subtypes and predicting patient outcomes. The research highlights the transformative impact of AI in clinical settings, emphasizing its potential to improve clinical outcomes through more precise and timely diagnoses. Future directions include the integration of AI with multi-omics data to further enhance the predictive power and clinical utility of computational pathology in cancer care.", "label": 1}
