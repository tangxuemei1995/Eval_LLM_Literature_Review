{"grounding": "With the significant successes of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cellular therapy, immunotherapy has now become an established treatment option to effectively treat cancer. However, the full potential of this treatment modality has yet to be realized, as there are many additional mechanisms whereby tumors continue to evade immune destruction. To this end, metabolic reprogramming by cancer cells serves not only to promote their own growth but also to create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The tumor metabolic microenvironment not only inhibits antitumor effector function but also supports the differentiation and function of suppressive immune cells. In this review, we delineate the major metabolic programs of cancer cells and immune cells. Furthermore, we discuss the role of so-called metabolic checkpoints that promote immune evasion and tumor growth. Finally, we review current and potential future strategies to target metabolism in order to not simply inhibit tumor growth but also enhance antitumor immune responses. Such strategies have the great potential to enhance the breadth and depth of immunotherapy for cancer by targeting metabolic checkpoints.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between immune cell metabolism and tumor microenvironment dynamics is pivotal in shaping the immune response against cancer. Recent advances in immuno-oncology have highlighted the significance of immunometabolism as a critical determinant of immune cell function and efficacy in tumor eradication. This review explores the metabolic pathways that govern immune cell activity, focusing on how these pathways are altered within the tumor microenvironment. Key metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism, are examined for their roles in modulating immune cell phenotypes and functions. Furthermore, the potential of targeting metabolic pathways to enhance anti-tumor immunity is discussed, with an emphasis on novel therapeutic strategies that aim to reprogram immune cell metabolism. By understanding the metabolic demands and adaptations of immune cells in cancer, we can develop more effective immunotherapeutic approaches. This research underscores the importance of integrating metabolic insights into the design of next-generation cancer immunotherapies, offering promising avenues for improving patient outcomes in oncology.", "label": 0}
