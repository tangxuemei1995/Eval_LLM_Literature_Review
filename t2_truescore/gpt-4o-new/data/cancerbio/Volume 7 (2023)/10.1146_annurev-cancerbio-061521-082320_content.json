{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been a great success in CD19+ hematological diseases. Natural killer (NK) CAR cells offer an alternative to CAR T cells with an intrinsic potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. The choice of cell type and the choice of CAR are both relevant for the feasibility, effectivity, engraftment, persistence, side effects, and safety of the cell therapy. Until recently CAR NK cells have proven difficult to develop into therapeutic products. Here, we give an overview of the source of CAR NK cells, gene transfer methods, and the manufacture of CAR NK cells for clinical application. We discuss improvements, as well as future options and problems that need to be addressed.", "generated_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cells represent a promising frontier in cancer immunotherapy, offering a novel approach to cell therapy. Unlike CAR T cells, CAR NK cells provide an 'off-the-shelf' product, potentially overcoming limitations such as manufacturing complexity and patient-specific customization. NK cells possess innate cytotoxic abilities, which, when enhanced with CAR technology, can target and eliminate cancer cells more effectively. Recent advancements in genetic engineering have enabled the development of CAR NK cells with improved persistence, specificity, and safety profiles. This review explores the current state of CAR NK cell research, highlighting their potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and discussing the challenges that remain in translating these therapies from bench to bedside.", "label": 1}
