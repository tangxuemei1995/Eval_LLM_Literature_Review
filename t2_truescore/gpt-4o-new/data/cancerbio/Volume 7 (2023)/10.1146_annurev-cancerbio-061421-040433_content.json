{"grounding": "The blood-brain barrier is critically important for the treatment of both primary and metastatic cancers of the central nervous system (CNS). Clinical outcomes for patients with primary CNS tumors are poor and have not significantly improved in decades. As treatments for patients with extracranial solid tumors improve, the incidence of CNS metastases is on the rise due to suboptimal CNS exposure of otherwise systemically active agents. Despite state-of-the art surgical care and increasingly precise radiation therapy, clinical progress is limited by the ability to deliver an effective dose of a therapeutic agent to all cancerous cells. Given the tremendous heterogeneity of CNS cancers, both across cancer subtypes andwithin a single tumor, and the range of diverse therapies under investigation, a nuanced examination of CNS drug exposure is needed. With a shared goal, common vocabulary, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the field is poised for renewed progress in the treatment of CNS cancers.", "generated_text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a formidable challenge in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, significantly impacting the development and efficacy of experimental cancer therapeutics. This review explores the intricate structure and function of the BBB, emphasizing its role in limiting drug delivery to CNS tumors. We discuss recent advances in understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents designed to penetrate the BBB, highlighting innovative strategies such as nanoparticle carriers, focused ultrasound, and receptor-mediated transport. Furthermore, we examine the implications of BBB permeability on therapeutic outcomes and the potential for personalized medicine approaches to enhance treatment efficacy. By integrating insights from recent preclinical and clinical studies, this paper underscores the necessity of overcoming BBB-related obstacles to improve the prognosis for patients with CNS malignancies. Future research directions are proposed to optimize drug delivery systems and enhance the therapeutic index of anticancer agents targeting brain tumors.", "label": 1}
