{"grounding": "The principle of independent drug action proposes that responses to drug combinations result from responses to one or the other of two combining agents, but not both. Explorations of biological pathway interactions in signal transduction and immunobiology as synergy have not been connected to mathematical demonstrations of above\u2013independent action activity, which would define pharmacologic synergy. We review independent action as the explanation for cancer drug combinations and find no evidence for pharmacologic synergy. Rather, a measure of correlation of response (\u03c1) when positive can explain below\u2013independent action results, and negative correlation can explain above\u2013independent action results. Anticorrelated responses may be a mathematical demonstration of collateral sensitivity, which can achieve above\u2013independent action activity. Inappropriate use of biological concepts of synergy may be contributing to high failure rates for immuno-oncology clinical trials, indicating a need for more rigorous applications of independent action to the development of cancer drug combination therapy.", "generated_text": "The exploration of combination therapies in cancer treatment has gained momentum, driven by the need to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance. This study examines the rationales behind combining therapies, focusing on independent action, response correlation, collateral sensitivity, and synergy. Independent action assumes that each drug contributes additively to the therapeutic effect, while response correlation considers the interdependence of drug responses. Collateral sensitivity exploits vulnerabilities in cancer cells that arise from resistance to one drug, potentially enhancing the efficacy of another. Synergy, the most sought-after outcome, occurs when combined therapies produce a greater effect than the sum of their individual effects. The role of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in combination therapies is highlighted, given their success in clinical trials. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for designing effective combination regimens, optimizing clinical trial outcomes, and ultimately improving patient survival rates. This research underscores the importance of strategic therapeutic combinations in advancing cancer treatment.", "label": 1}
