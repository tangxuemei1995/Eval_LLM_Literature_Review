{"grounding": "Ultrahigh\u2013dose rate FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a potentially paradigm-shifting treatment modality that holds the promise of expanding the therapeutic index for nearly any cancer. At the heart of this exciting technology comes the capability to ameliorate major normal tissue complications without compromising the efficacy of tumor killing. This combination of benefits has now been termed the FLASH effect and relies on an in vivo validation to rigorously demonstrate the absence of normal tissue toxicity. The FLASH effect occurs when the overall irradiation time is extremely short (<500 ms), and in this review we attempt to understand how FLASH-RT can kill tumors but spare normal tissues\u2014likely the single most pressing question confronting the field today.", "generated_text": "FLASH radiotherapy, characterized by ultrahigh dose rates, represents a paradigm shift in radiobiology, offering potential advantages over conventional radiotherapy. This innovative approach has demonstrated the ability to spare normal tissues while maintaining isoefficient tumor killing, challenging traditional radiobiological models. The underlying mechanisms of FLASH radiotherapy, including differential oxygen consumption and unique DNA damage responses, are under intense investigation. This review synthesizes current findings, highlighting the potential of FLASH to revolutionize cancer treatment by reducing side effects and improving patient outcomes. Future research directions are proposed to optimize clinical protocols and understand the molecular basis of FLASH effects, aiming to integrate this promising modality into standard oncological practice.", "label": 1}
