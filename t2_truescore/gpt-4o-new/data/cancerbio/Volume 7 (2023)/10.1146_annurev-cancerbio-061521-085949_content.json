{"grounding": "Myeloid cells represent a dominant cellular compartment of tumor lesions and play key roles in tumor inception, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), which include dendritic cells and macrophages, are unique among myeloid cells, as they not only shape both the broader composition and state of the tumor microenvironment but can also specifically instruct cancer-specific, T cell\u2013mediated tumor cell killing, making them especially attractive targets for cancer treatment. Although MNPs remain difficult to modulate therapeutically, our understanding of MNP biology in the antitumor immune response has expanded significantly, offering hope for new possibilities in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the recent advances in our study of the cellular identity, molecular diversity, and spatial organization of MNPs in tumors, and we discuss the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to incorporate these new insights into cancer treatment design.", "generated_text": "The tumor microenvironment is a complex network where mononuclear phagocytes, including macrophages and dendritic cells, play pivotal roles in cancer progression and immune modulation. This review explores the biology of these cells, highlighting their dual roles in promoting and inhibiting tumor growth. Macrophages, often polarized into tumor-associated macrophages, can support tumorigenesis through immunosuppression and angiogenesis, while dendritic cells are crucial for antigen presentation and initiating anti-tumor immunity. Recent advances in therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram these cells to enhance anti-cancer responses. Approaches such as targeting macrophage polarization, enhancing dendritic cell function, and modulating their interactions within the tumor microenvironment are discussed. Understanding the intricate biology of these cells and their potential for therapeutic modulation offers promising avenues for innovative cancer treatments, aiming to shift the balance towards effective immune-mediated tumor eradication.", "label": 1}
