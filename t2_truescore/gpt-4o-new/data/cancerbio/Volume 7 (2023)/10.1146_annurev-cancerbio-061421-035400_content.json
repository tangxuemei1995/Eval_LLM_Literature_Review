{"grounding": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are present in all malignancies. Arguably, in none are they as prevalent as they are in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where they often outnumber cancer cells. The origin and function of CAFs are still not completely understood, and attempts to target this cell population as a component of combination therapy have so far not succeeded. Our understanding of pancreatic CAFs is in rapid evolution. Heterogeneity of CAFs is the key concept to understand this cell population. We discuss heterogeneity of origin, with recent findings challenging the notion that CAFs uniformly derive from pancreatic stellate cells, and instead suggesting that multiple types of resident fibroblasts contribute to CAF expansion. Heterogeneity in gene expression divides CAFs in different subpopulations. Most importantly, heterogeneity in function underlies the complexity of CAFs. CAFs deposit components of the extracellular matrix, contributing to the high interstitial pressure in pancreatic cancer. CAFs serve as \u201cfeeder\u201d cells for cancer cells by providing metabolites, thus mitigating the effect of the low-nutrient environment of PDAC. At the same time, CAFs regulate the function of the immune system, inhibiting antitumor immune responses. Understanding the functional role of different CAF populations and the drivers of each of their functional roles is key to devising new ways to target this cell population in PDAC.", "generated_text": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by a dense stromal environment that significantly contributes to its aggressive nature and resistance to therapy. Central to this stromal architecture are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by promoting desmoplasia, a hallmark of pancreatic cancer. This review synthesizes current insights into the multifaceted roles of CAFs in pancreatic cancer, highlighting their contribution to tumor heterogeneity and progression. CAFs interact with cancer cells and other stromal components, modulating the extracellular matrix and influencing immune cell infiltration, thereby creating a supportive niche for tumor growth and metastasis. Recent studies have elucidated the heterogeneity within CAF populations, revealing distinct subtypes with diverse functions, ranging from tumor-promoting to tumor-restraining activities. Understanding the dynamic interactions between CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells offers potential therapeutic avenues, such as targeting specific CAF subtypes or disrupting their signaling pathways to enhance treatment efficacy. This review underscores the necessity of integrating CAF biology into the broader context of pancreatic cancer research, aiming to develop novel strategies that can effectively modulate the TME and improve patient outcomes. Future research directions include the identification of biomarkers for CAF subtypes and the development of CAF-targeted therapies.", "label": 1}
