{"grounding": "Fusion oncoproteins (FOs) resulting from in-frame chromosomal translocations are associated with many aggressive cancers with poor patient outcomes. Several FOs are now understood to perform their oncogenic functions within biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Two classes of phase-separating FOs have emerged, those that form nuclear condensates and alter chromatin biology, including gene expression, and those that form cytoplasmic condensates and promote aberrant signaling, including RAS/MAPK signaling. The amino acid sequences of the FOs within these classes display LLPS-prone intrinsically disordered regions and folded domains that synergistically interact with themselves and other biomolecules to promote condensate formation. This review summarizes the roles of LLPS in the oncogenic functions of these two FO classes, provides examples of FOs that inhibit physiological LLPS in normal cells, and discusses the sequence features commonly associated with LLPS and their enrichment in many FOs.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in cancer biology have highlighted the significance of phase-separated condensates in the pathogenesis of fusion oncoprotein-driven cancers. These biomolecular condensates, formed through liquid-liquid phase separation, play a crucial role in modulating transcriptional and signaling pathways. Intrinsically disordered regions and specific sequence features of fusion oncoproteins facilitate the formation of these condensates, which can aberrantly recruit transcriptional machinery and kinases, leading to dysregulated gene expression and oncogenic signaling. This review synthesizes current findings on the molecular mechanisms by which phase-separated condensates contribute to cancer progression, emphasizing the interplay between condensate dynamics and cellular signaling networks. Understanding these processes offers novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting the unique properties of biomolecular condensates in cancer. Future research directions include elucidating the precise sequence determinants and structural characteristics that govern condensate formation and function in oncogenesis.", "label": 1}
