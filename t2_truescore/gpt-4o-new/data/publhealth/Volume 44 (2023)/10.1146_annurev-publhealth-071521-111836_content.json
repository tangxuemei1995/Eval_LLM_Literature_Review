{"grounding": "Housing quality is essential for population health and broader well-being. The World Health Organization Housing and health guidelines highlight interventions that protect occupants from cold and hot temperatures, injuries, and other hazards. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of ventilation standards. Housing standards are unevenly developed, implemented, and monitored globally, despite robust research demonstrating that retrofitting existing houses and constructing high-quality new ones can reduce respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and people with low incomes face cumulative disadvantages that are exacerbated by poor-quality housing. These can be partially ameliorated by community-based programs to improve housing quality, particularly for children and older people, who are hospitalized more often for housing-related illnesses. There is renewed interest among policy makers and researchers in the health and well-being of people in public and subsidized housing, who are disproportionately disadvantaged by avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries. Improving the overall quality of new and existing housing and neighborhoods has multiple cobenefits, including reducing carbon emissions.", "generated_text": "This review examines the intricate relationship between housing quality and disparities in health and well-being, emphasizing the critical role of indoor environments. Housing quality, encompassing structural integrity, ventilation, thermal comfort, and exposure to pollutants, significantly influences physical and mental health outcomes. Poor housing conditions are disproportionately experienced by marginalized populations, exacerbating health inequalities. The review synthesizes current guidelines and standards for healthy housing, highlighting their potential to mitigate adverse health effects and promote well-being. It also explores the cobenefits of improved housing quality, such as enhanced social cohesion and economic productivity. By integrating findings from recent studies, the review underscores the necessity for comprehensive policies that address housing quality as a determinant of health. It advocates for interdisciplinary approaches that involve stakeholders from public health, urban planning, and social services to develop and implement effective interventions. Ultimately, the review calls for a paradigm shift towards recognizing housing as a fundamental component of public health strategy, essential for reducing health disparities and enhancing overall well-being.", "label": 0}
