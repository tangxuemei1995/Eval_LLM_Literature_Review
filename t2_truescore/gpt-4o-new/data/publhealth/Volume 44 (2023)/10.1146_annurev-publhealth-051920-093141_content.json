{"grounding": "Public health surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data and is closely integrated with the timely dissemination of information that the public needs to know and upon which the public should act. Public health surveillance is central to modern public health practice by contributing data and information usually through a national notifiable disease reporting system (NNDRS). Although early identification and prediction of future disease trends may be technically feasible, more work is needed to improve accuracy so that policy makers can use these predictions to guide prevention and control efforts. In this article, we review the advantages and limitations of the current NNDRS in most countries, discuss some lessons learned about prevention and control from the first wave of COVID-19, and describe some technological innovations in public health surveillance, including geographic information systems (GIS), spatial modeling, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the digital twin method. We conclude that the technology-driven innovative public health surveillance systems are expected to further improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of case reporting during outbreaks and also enhance feedback and transparency, whereby all stakeholders should receive actionable information on control and be able to limit disease risk earlier than ever before.", "generated_text": "The rapid emergence and global spread of infectious diseases, exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, underscore the critical need for innovative public health surveillance systems. This study explores advancements in public health surveillance, focusing on the integration of spatial modeling and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the national notifiable disease reporting system. Traditional surveillance methods often struggle with timeliness and accuracy, limiting their effectiveness in early detection and response. By leveraging AI, particularly machine learning algorithms, public health systems can process vast amounts of data from diverse sources, including social media, electronic health records, and environmental sensors, to identify patterns indicative of emerging infections. Spatial modeling further augments these capabilities by providing geospatial analysis that can predict disease spread and identify hotspots, enabling targeted interventions. The integration of these technologies into existing frameworks promises to transform public health surveillance, offering real-time insights and predictive analytics that can inform policy decisions and resource allocation. This paper reviews current innovations, evaluates their effectiveness in recent outbreaks, and discusses challenges such as data privacy, interoperability, and the need for robust validation frameworks. Ultimately, these advancements hold the potential to significantly improve the agility and responsiveness of public health systems in managing infectious disease threats.", "label": 1}
