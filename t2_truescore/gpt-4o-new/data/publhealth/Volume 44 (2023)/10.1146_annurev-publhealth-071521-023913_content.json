{"grounding": "Current digital health approaches have not engaged diverse end users or reduced health or health care inequities, despite their promise to deliver more tailored and personalized support to individuals at the right time and the right place. To achieve digital health equity, we must refocus our attention on the current state of digital health uptake and use across the policy, system, community, individual, and intervention levels. We focus here on (a) outlining a multilevel framework underlying digital health equity; (b) summarizingfive types of interventions/programs (with example studies) that hold promise for advancing digital health equity; and (c) recommending future steps for improving policy, practice, and research in this space.", "generated_text": "This literature synthesis explores the multilevel determinants influencing digital health equity, emphasizing the intersection of health technology and social determinants of health. By analyzing existing research, the study identifies key barriers and facilitators impacting equitable access to digital health resources. The findings highlight the role of socioeconomic status, education, and geographic location in shaping digital health disparities. Additionally, the synthesis underscores the importance of policy interventions and community engagement in promoting inclusive digital health solutions. This work aims to advance the field by providing a comprehensive understanding of the complex factors affecting digital health equity, ultimately guiding future research and policy development to bridge the digital divide in healthcare.", "label": 1}
