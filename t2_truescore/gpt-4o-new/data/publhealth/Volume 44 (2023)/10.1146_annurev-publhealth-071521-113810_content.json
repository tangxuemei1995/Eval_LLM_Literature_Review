{"grounding": "Public health researchers are increasingly questioning the consequences of gentrification for population health and health equity, as witnessed in the rapid increase in public health publications on the health (equity) effects of gentrification. Despite methodological challenges, and mixed results from existing quantitative research, qualitative evidence to date points to the role of gentrification processes in exacerbating health inequities. Here we discuss past methodological and theoretical challenges in integrating the study of gentrification with public health research. We suggest taking an interdisciplinary approach, considering the conceptualization of gentrification in measurement techniques and conceiving this process as a direct exposure or as a part of broader neighborhood changes. Finally, we discuss existingpolicy approaches to mitigating and preventing gentrification and how these could be evaluated for effectiveness and as public health promotion and specifically as interventions to promote health equity.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical and methodological framework for addressing health equity in the context of urban gentrification. Gentrification, often characterized by urban regeneration and displacement, poses significant challenges to health equity, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. By synthesizing existing literature and empirical studies, this guide explores the multifaceted impacts of gentrification on urban health, emphasizing the need for equitable urban planning and policy interventions. It proposes innovative strategies to prevent or mitigate adverse health outcomes associated with displacement, including community engagement, policy advocacy, and cross-sector collaboration. The guide also outlines methodological approaches for assessing health impacts and evaluating interventions, providing a roadmap for researchers and policymakers to foster inclusive urban environments. Ultimately, this work aims to bridge the gap between urban development and public health, promoting sustainable and equitable cities for all residents.", "label": 0}
