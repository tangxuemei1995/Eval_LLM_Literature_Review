{"grounding": "Rapid randomized controlled trials have been surprisingly rare in health care quality improvement (QI) and systems interventions. Applying clinical trials methodology QI work brings two distinct fields together, applying the robustness of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to the practical, operational learnings of the well-established QI field. Rapid trials also add a third element\u2014speed\u2014that enables health care systems to rapidly test multiple variations of an intervention in much the same way that A/B testing is done in the technology sector. When performed well, these rapid trials free researchers and health care systems from the requirement to be correct the first time (because it is low cost and quick to try something else) while offering a standard of evidence often absent in QI. Here we outline the historical underpinnings of this approach, provide guidance about how best to implement it, and describe lessons learned from running more than 20 randomized projects in the NYU Langone Health system.", "generated_text": "The integration of rapid randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into health care systems presents a promising approach to enhancing quality improvement and safety. This study explores the application of rapid RCTs as a methodological innovation to address the dynamic challenges faced by health care systems. By leveraging the agility of rapid RCTs, health care providers can swiftly evaluate interventions, leading to timely and evidence-based decision-making. The research highlights the potential of these trials to generate robust data that inform policy and practice, ultimately improving patient outcomes and system efficiency. Key considerations include the design and implementation of trials that are both scientifically rigorous and adaptable to the fast-paced health care environment. The findings suggest that rapid RCTs can serve as a catalyst for continuous improvement, fostering a culture of safety and quality within health care systems. This approach underscores the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to ensure the successful integration of rapid RCTs into routine practice.", "label": 1}
