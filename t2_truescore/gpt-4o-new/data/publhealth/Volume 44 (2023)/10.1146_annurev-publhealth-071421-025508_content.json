{"grounding": "Heat is a dangerous hazard that causes acute heat illness, chronic disease exacerbations, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a range of injuries. Risks are highest during extreme heat events (EHEs), which challenge the capacity of health systems and other critical infrastructure. EHEs are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is driving an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality, necessitating more investment in health protection. Climate-resilient health systems are better positioned for EHEs, and EHE preparedness is a form of disaster risk reduction. Preparedness activities commonly take the form of heat action plans (HAPs), with many examples at various administrative scales. HAP activities can be divided into primary prevention, most important in the pre-event phase; secondary prevention, key to risk reduction early in an EHE;and tertiary prevention, important later in the event phase. After-action reports and other postevent evaluation activities are central to adaptive management of this climate-sensitive hazard.", "generated_text": "As climate change intensifies, extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and severe, posing significant public health challenges. This study examines the effectiveness of heat action plans as a critical component of disaster risk reduction strategies. By analyzing case studies from various regions, we identify best practices and common pitfalls in public health preparedness for extreme heat. Our findings highlight the importance of early warning systems, community engagement, and inter-agency collaboration in mitigating the adverse health impacts of heatwaves. We also explore the role of urban planning and infrastructure improvements in enhancing resilience to extreme temperatures. The research underscores the need for adaptive strategies that incorporate climate projections and socio-economic factors to protect vulnerable populations. Ultimately, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers and public health officials to develop comprehensive and sustainable heat action plans in the face of escalating climate risks.", "label": 1}
