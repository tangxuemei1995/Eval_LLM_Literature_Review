{"grounding": "Several peer-reviewed papers and reviews have examined the relationship between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 spread and severity. However, many of the existing reviews on this topic do not extensively present the statistical challenges associated with this field, do not provide comprehensive guidelines for future researchers, and review only the results of a relatively small number of papers. We reviewed 139 papers, 127 of which reported a statistically significant positive association between air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes. Here, we summarize the evidence, describe the statistical challenges, and make recommendations for future research. To summarize the 139 papers with data from geographical locations around the world, we also present anopen-source data visualization tool that summarizes these studies and allows the research community to contribute evidence as new research papers are published.", "generated_text": "This literature review examines the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes globally, highlighting statistical challenges and the role of data visualization in evidence synthesis. The review synthesizes findings from diverse studies, revealing that exposure to pollutants such as PM2.5 and NO2 may exacerbate COVID-19 severity and mortality. However, the complexity of isolating air pollution effects from confounding variables presents significant statistical challenges. The review discusses methodologies employed to address these challenges, including advanced statistical models and machine learning techniques. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of data visualization in enhancing the interpretability of complex datasets, facilitating clearer communication of findings to policymakers and the public. This synthesis underscores the need for robust, interdisciplinary approaches to better understand and mitigate the compounded health impacts of air pollution and COVID-19.", "label": 1}
