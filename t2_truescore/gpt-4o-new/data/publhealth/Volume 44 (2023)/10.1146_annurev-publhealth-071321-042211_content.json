{"grounding": "Given its origins in high-income countries, the field of physical activity and public health research and promotion has broadly followed a choice-based model. However, a substantial amount of the physical activity occurring routinely in many settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is the result of economic necessity and is not due to true, free choices. We propose the \u201cnecessity- versus choice-based physical activity models\u201d framework as a conceptual tool to ground physical activity and public health research and promotion efforts in LMICs, helping ensurethat these efforts are relevant, ethical, responsive, and respectful to local contexts. Identifying ways to ensure that LMIC populations can maintain high levels of active transport while increasing opportunities for active leisure must be prioritized. To promote equity, physical activity research, programs, and policies in LMICs must focus on improving the conditions under which necessity-driven physical activity occurs for a vast majority of the population.", "generated_text": "In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), physical activity often arises from necessity rather than choice, with active transport being a primary mode of movement. This study explores the implications of necessity-driven physical activity on global health, health equity, and social justice. By examining the socio-economic and infrastructural factors that compel individuals to engage in active transport, we aim to understand the barriers and facilitators of physical activity in these regions. The research highlights the disparity in physical activity opportunities between high-income and LMICs, emphasizing the need for policies that promote equitable access to safe and sustainable active transport options. Addressing these disparities is crucial for enhancing public health outcomes and achieving social justice. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on improving infrastructure, increasing awareness, and fostering environments that support voluntary physical activity, thereby transforming necessity into choice and promoting overall well-being in LMICs.", "label": 1}
