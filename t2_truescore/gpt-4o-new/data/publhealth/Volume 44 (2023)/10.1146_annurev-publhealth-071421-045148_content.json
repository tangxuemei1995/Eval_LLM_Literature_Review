{"grounding": "The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events, are expected to increase and alter human migration and mobility. Climate-related mobility is not inherently a crisis; it can provide a pathway for adaptation to climate change. However, a growing body of research identifies health risks and some opportunities associated with climate-related mobility. This review examines recent research (published since 2018) on the climate change\u2013mobility\u2013health nexus; this research focuses largely on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. It considers the links between human mobility and anthropogenic climate change and documents the findings of empirical research that addresses the health consequences of displacement, planned relocation, migration, and migration into sites of climate risk. The findings highlight the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health care in a heating world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationships between climatic and environmental changes, human migration, and health outcomes. As climate change intensifies, it exacerbates environmental stressors, leading to increased displacement and migration. This research examines how these forced movements impact health, considering both physical and mental health dimensions. By analyzing case studies and empirical data, the study identifies patterns of mobility triggered by climate-induced events such as floods, droughts, and rising sea levels. It further investigates the health challenges faced by displaced populations, including access to healthcare, nutrition, and mental health services. The findings underscore the need for integrated policies that address the root causes of climate-induced migration and prioritize health interventions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between environmental change, migration, and health, offering insights for policymakers and stakeholders.", "label": 1}
