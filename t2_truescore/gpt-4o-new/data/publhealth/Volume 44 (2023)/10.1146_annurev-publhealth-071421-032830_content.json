{"grounding": "Between the 2009 Great Recession and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US state and local governmental public health workforce lost 40,000 jobs. Tens of thousands of workers also left during the pandemic and continue to leave. As governmental health departments are now receiving multimillion-dollar, temporary federal investments to replenish their workforce, this review synthesizes the evidence regarding major challenges that preceded the pandemic and remain now. These include the lack of the field's ability to readily enumerate and define the governmental public health workforce as well as challenges with the recruitment and retention of public health workers. This review finds that many workforce-related challenges identified more than 20 years ago persist in the field today. Thus, it is critical that we look back to be able to then move forward to successfully rebuild the workforce and assure adequate capacity to protect the public's health and respond to public health emergencies.", "generated_text": "The US public health workforce is facing significant challenges that threaten its capacity to effectively respond to current and future public health needs. This study examines the ongoing issues of recruitment and retention, workforce development, and training within the public health sector. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and workforce enumeration data, we identify critical gaps in workforce capacity and highlight the need for strategic interventions. The findings underscore the importance of enhancing recruitment efforts and implementing robust retention strategies to maintain a skilled and diverse workforce. Additionally, the study emphasizes the necessity for continuous workforce development and training programs to equip public health professionals with the skills required to address emerging health threats. Future directions include policy recommendations aimed at strengthening workforce infrastructure and fostering a sustainable public health workforce. This research provides a foundation for stakeholders to develop targeted strategies that ensure the resilience and effectiveness of the public health workforce in the United States.", "label": 1}
