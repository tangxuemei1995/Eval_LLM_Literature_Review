{"grounding": "Taking stock of environmental justice (EJ) is daunting. It is at once a scholarly field, an ongoing social movement, and an administrative imperative adopted by government agencies and incorporated into legislation. Moreover, within academia, it is multidisciplinary and multimethodological, comprising scholars who do not always speak to one another. Any review of EJ is thus necessarily restrictive.\nThis article explores several facets of EJ activism. One is its coalitional and \u201cinside-outside\u201d orientation. EJ activists are constantly forming alliances with other stakeholders, but these coalitions do not flout the importance of engaging with formal institutions. The review next turns to one set of such institutions\u2014the courts and regulatory agencies\u2014to see how well EJ claims have fared there. I then survey scientific findings that have been influenced by EJ. The review concludes with future directions for activists and scholars to consider: the changing nature of EJ coalitions, fragmentation within EJ and with other fields, the historical roots of environmental injustice, and opportunities for stronger infusion of the EJ lens.", "generated_text": "Environmental justice has emerged as a critical framework for addressing the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities, particularly those of racial and ethnic minorities. This paper explores the historical evolution of environmental justice, highlighting its roots in the civil rights movement and its development through grassroots activism. The concept of environmental racism is examined, emphasizing how structural racism contributes to racial health disparities by situating hazardous waste sites and polluting industries in minority neighborhoods. The paper also discusses the role of health advocacy and activism in advancing environmental justice, showcasing successful campaigns that have led to policy changes and improved health outcomes. Looking forward, the paper considers potential directions for the environmental justice movement, including the integration of climate justice and the use of digital tools for community mobilization. By analyzing past achievements and future challenges, this study underscores the importance of sustained advocacy and interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving equitable environmental health outcomes for all communities.", "label": 1}
