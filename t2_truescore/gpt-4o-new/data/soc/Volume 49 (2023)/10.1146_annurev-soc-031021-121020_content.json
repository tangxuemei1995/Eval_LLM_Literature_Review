{"grounding": "Age as an individual characteristic is ubiquitous in social science research because it has important associations with numerous outcomes of interest. Yet age is rarely treated as a phenomenon that requires explanation or theoretical attention. To advance research in sociology and beyond, we bring together previously siloed literatures on the conceptualization and measurement of age. Our framework presents age as a system of inequality that can be understood through concepts and processes that operate at multiple levels of analysis. At the individual level, we argue age is best conceptualized and operationalized as multidimensional. We review a range of measures, from birth cohort to physical appearance, that can be fruitfully combined in empirical research to account for this complexity. The multidimensionality of age also highlights how it is \u201cdone\u201d in interactions, connecting the social construction of age to the intersectional production of inequality.", "generated_text": "This study explores the social construction of age, emphasizing its dynamic nature across the life course and its intersection with various social stratifications. By integrating intersectionality into the analysis, the research highlights how age interacts with other social categories such as gender, race, and class, influencing individual experiences and societal expectations. Methodologically, the study critiques traditional demographic approaches to measuring age, advocating for more nuanced and context-sensitive tools that capture the complexity of aging processes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, the research underscores the importance of understanding age not merely as a biological marker but as a socially constructed phenomenon that shapes and is shaped by cultural, economic, and political forces. The findings call for a re-evaluation of age-related policies and practices, promoting a more inclusive and equitable approach to aging in diverse societies.", "label": 0}
