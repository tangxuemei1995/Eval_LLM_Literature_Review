{"grounding": "Robust literatures separately estimate school effects and neighborhood effects on children's educational, economic, health, and other outcomes that measure well-being. A growing body of research acknowledges that both contexts matter and considers neighborhoods and schools jointly. In this review, we synthesize the array of results that emerge from these studies and critique the tendency for researchers to evaluate which matters more, neighborhoods versus schools. We propose a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes. We argue that contextual effects research would be enriched by considering local neighborhood\u2013school structures: the ways that families choose neighborhoods and schools and that neighborhoods and schools mutually and cyclically constitute one another. We conclude with recommendations for bringing neighborhood\u2013school structures to bear on both outcomes-oriented studies of neighborhood and school effects as well as studies of contextual selection and segregation.", "generated_text": "This study introduces a novel framework for examining the intertwined social contexts of neighborhoods and schools, emphasizing their combined impact on individual outcomes. Traditional research often isolates neighborhood effects from school effects, potentially overlooking the complex interactions between these environments. By integrating data on neighborhood demographics, school resources, and segregation patterns, this approach provides a comprehensive analysis of how these contexts jointly influence educational and social outcomes. The study employs advanced statistical models to assess the relative contributions of neighborhood and school characteristics, revealing significant interactions that suggest a need for policies addressing both domains simultaneously. Findings indicate that segregation within and between neighborhoods and schools exacerbates inequalities, underscoring the importance of coordinated interventions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of social contexts, offering insights for educators, policymakers, and community leaders aiming to foster equitable environments for youth development.", "label": 1}
