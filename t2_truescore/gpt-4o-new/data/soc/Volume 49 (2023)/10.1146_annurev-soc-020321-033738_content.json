{"grounding": "This article considers the large range of empirical research that has emerged under the broad aegis of ethnomethodology, in the period between the publication of Studies in Ethnomethodology (1967) and the present day. Starting with a brief overview of Garfinkel's intellectual career, we discuss the relation of ethnomethodology to Sch\u00fctz's phenomenology, Parsons's systems theory, and Weber's concern with meaning construction. A central concern was with the problem of contextuality, which Garfinkel initially addressed by drawing on, while fashioning in his own way, Mannheim's concern with the documentary method of interpretation. Ethnomethodologically-related studies have proliferated in a variety of domains, including conversation analysis, membership categorization analysis, and (related to Garfinkel's own early work) empirical initiatives in the study of everyday life involving racial, gender and other minoritized groups. Further ethnomethodological studies emerged from legal environments, from social problems and deviance, and in relation to ability differences. Still other investigations concerned instructed action and its ramifications for the sciences, technology and organizations, including the workplace. A longstanding concern for ethnomethodology has been with the conduct of social sciences\u2014how coding is done, how surveys are conducted, and how standardization is achieved. Many of these areas have given rise to thriving subfields, have dedicated journals, and resulted in applications. Few initiatives in sociological theory have resulted in a wider range of innovative research than Garfinkel's and successor studies showing, explicating, and demonstrating the organization of details in social life and their consequences for social order.", "generated_text": "Ethnomethodology, since its inception by Harold Garfinkel, has profoundly influenced the study of social interactions, particularly through its focus on the methods and practices individuals use to construct and understand their social worlds. This paper explores the legacies and future prospects of ethnomethodology, emphasizing its impact on conversation analysis, studies of science, organizational research, and workplace studies. Ethnomethodology's distinctive approach to social inquiry, which prioritizes the detailed examination of everyday interactions, has provided valuable insights into the tacit rules and instructed actions that underpin social order. By examining the mundane activities of individuals, ethnomethodologists have revealed the complex, yet often invisible, structures that govern social life. The paper highlights key contributions of ethnomethodology to the understanding of scientific practices, illustrating how scientific knowledge is constructed through routine interactions and negotiations. In organizational contexts, ethnomethodology has shed light on the informal practices and rules that shape workplace dynamics, offering a nuanced perspective on organizational behavior. Furthermore, the paper discusses the methodological innovations introduced by ethnomethodology, such as the use of naturalistic data and the focus on participants' perspectives, which have enriched qualitative research methodologies. Looking forward, the paper identifies emerging areas of interest, including the integration of digital technologies in social interactions and the global dissemination of ethnomethodological approaches. By reflecting on its past achievements and future directions, this paper underscores ethnomethodology's enduring relevance and potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of social phenomena in an increasingly complex world.", "label": 1}
