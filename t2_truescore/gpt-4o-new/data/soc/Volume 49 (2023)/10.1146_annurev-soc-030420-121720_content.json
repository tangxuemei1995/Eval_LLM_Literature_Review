{"grounding": "The global dimensions of diasporic politics and state response have generated a large, interdisciplinary literature. Yet, scholars struggle to find the most productive conceptual tools, as one literature, at point of origin, studies emigration and the other, at point of destination, studies immigration. The transnational turn in the social sciences four decades ago propelled scholars to study cross-border political mobilization by viewing immigration and emigration as two sides of the same coin. This article provides a guide to this scholarship. We show how the political nature of cross-border movements creates and circumscribes conditions for diasporic political mobilization. We then identify the different types of cross-border political activities and the modalities of corresponding home state policies. We conclude by reflecting how the world today has changed since the geopolitical moment in which the transnational turn was born and what these changes mean for studying immigrant and emigrant cross-border politics.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of diasporic mobilization and state responses within the context of cross-border politics. By examining the transnational activities of diaspora communities, the research highlights how these groups influence geopolitical landscapes and contribute to the reconfiguration of national identities. The analysis focuses on the dual role of diasporas as both agents of change and subjects of state control, emphasizing the complex interplay between emigrant politics and homeland nationalism. Through a comparative approach, the study investigates various case studies where diasporic communities have actively engaged in political processes, either supporting or challenging their countries of origin. The findings reveal that state responses to diasporic mobilization are shaped by a combination of strategic interests, historical ties, and contemporary geopolitical considerations. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of transnationalism in shaping modern political landscapes and the evolving nature of state-diaspora relations.", "label": 1}
