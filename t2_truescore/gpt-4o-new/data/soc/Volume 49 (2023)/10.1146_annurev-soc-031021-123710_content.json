{"grounding": "The term \u201cWhite privilege\u201d has been used to denote specific privileges that White groups possess due to their Whiteness and White identity. In this article, firstly, I outline how, as a conceptual tool, White privilege can only be understood in relation to Critical Race Theory, specifically the notion that racism is central and endemic, through Whiteness as property and interest convergence. Secondly, I analyze the development of White privilege and provide ways forward for the use of the term, and thirdly, I use examples from higher education to outline how White privilege works in terms of the construction of knowledge, the prioritization of gender above race, and the fact that policy making is designed to protect White identities to uphold a hegemonic system of White supremacy.", "generated_text": "This study delves into Critical Race Theory (CRT) as a framework for examining and challenging the pervasive influence of white privilege and whiteness in contemporary society. By critically analyzing the historical and socio-political constructs that sustain racial hierarchies, this research highlights the systemic nature of racial inequities. It explores how CRT provides a lens to confront and rethink the entrenched norms that privilege whiteness, thereby perpetuating racial disparities. Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and empirical evidence, the study underscores the necessity of re-evaluating institutional practices and cultural narratives that uphold white dominance. Ultimately, this research advocates for transformative approaches that foster racial equity and justice, urging a reimagining of societal structures to dismantle the privileges associated with whiteness.", "label": 1}
