{"grounding": "I got hooked on sociology as a 20-year-old. Engaging with the world as a sociologist, together with colleagues, comrades, and students, has been immensely rewarding for six decades. My work has centered primarily on what were once called developing countries and now comprise the Global South. This article recounts my sociological adventures, from efforts to understand the world as I found it in the early 1960s to my responses to current reactionary trends. I start with my earlier work\u2014Dependent Development (1979) and Embedded Autonomy (1995)\u2014and then move to more recent efforts to construct paradigms of progressive twenty-first-century possibilities. I discuss, first, how a 21st century developmental state might incorporate deliberation and state-society synergies to expand human capabilities, and second, how an amalgam of global and national labor movements together with transnational advocacy networks might pursue a counter-hegemonic globalization capable of confronting global neoliberal capitalism.", "generated_text": "This paper traces a 60-year intellectual journey through the evolving landscape of comparative political economy, focusing on key concepts such as embedded autonomy, dependent development, and state-society synergy. It examines the role of the developmental state in fostering economic growth and social transformation, while also addressing the challenges posed by globalization. The study highlights the emergence of counter-hegemonic globalization, emphasizing the significance of transnational advocacy networks in reshaping global power dynamics. Through an autobiographical lens, the author reflects on the theoretical and empirical contributions that have shaped the field, offering insights into the interplay between state structures and societal forces. By integrating historical analysis with contemporary debates, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions that define political and economic development across diverse contexts. The paper ultimately calls for a renewed focus on collaborative strategies to address global inequalities and promote sustainable development.", "label": 1}
