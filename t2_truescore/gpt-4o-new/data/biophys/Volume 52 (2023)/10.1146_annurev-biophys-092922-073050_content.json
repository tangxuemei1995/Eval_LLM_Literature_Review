{"grounding": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are critical intracellular immune receptors in both animals and plants. Perception of pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals induces NLR oligomerization to form multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes in animals or resistosomes in plants to mediate host immune response. Significant progress has been made during the past few years in our understanding of NLR biology, particularly the structural perspective of these two types of NLR-containing complexes. In this article, we review the latest advances in our structural knowledge of how NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are activated and assembled and how the structural information provides insight into their distinct mechanisms of action. Commonalities and differences between NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are also discussed.", "generated_text": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are pivotal in immune responses, forming resistosomes and inflammasomes upon activation. This study delves into the structural assembly and architecture of these complexes, focusing on the mechanisms of autoinhibition and ligand recognition. We explore the transition from inactive to active states, highlighting the role of NLRs in forming NADase holoenzymes and resistosome channels. The findings reveal intricate molecular interactions that govern the activation and function of these immune complexes, providing insights into their roles in pathogen defense and inflammatory diseases. Understanding these processes offers potential therapeutic targets for modulating immune responses and treating related disorders.", "label": 0}
