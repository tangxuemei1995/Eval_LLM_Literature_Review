{"grounding": "Large biomolecular systems are at the heart of many essential cellular processes. The dynamics and energetics of an increasing number of these systems are being studied by computer simulations. Pushing the limits of length- and timescales that can be accessed by current hard- and software has expanded the ability to describe biomolecules at different levels of detail. We focus in this review on the ribosome, which exemplifies the close interplay between experiment and various simulation approaches, as a particularly challenging and prototypic nanomachine that is pivotal to cellular biology due to its central role in translation. We sketch widely used simulation methods and demonstrate how the combination of simulations and experiments advances our understanding of the function of the translation apparatus based on fundamental physics.", "generated_text": "The ribosome, a pivotal molecular machine in cellular translation, presents a formidable challenge for computational simulations due to its size and complexity. Recent advancements in molecular dynamics and computer simulations have enabled more detailed studies of ribosomal function and interactions. This paper reviews the integration of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data with simulation techniques to enhance the accuracy of ribosomal models. By simulating the dynamic processes of translation, researchers can gain insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic action and resistance. The synergy between cryo-EM and molecular dynamics offers a powerful approach to unravel the intricate workings of the ribosome, providing a platform for the development of novel antibiotics. This study underscores the potential of computational methods to address biological questions at the molecular level, particularly in the context of complex biomolecular systems.", "label": 1}
