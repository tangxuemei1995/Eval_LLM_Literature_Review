{"grounding": "Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have marked only the beginning of the potential of this technique. To bring structure into cell biology, the modality of cryo-electron tomography has fast developed into a bona fide in situ structural biology technique where structures are determined in their native environment, the cell. Nearly every step of the cryo-focused ion beam-assisted electron tomography (cryo-FIB-ET) workflow has been improved upon in the past decade, since the first windows were carved into cells, unveiling macromolecular networks in near-native conditions. By bridging structural and cell biology, cryo-FIB-ET is advancing our understanding of structure\u2013function relationships in their native environment and becoming a tool for discovering new biology.", "generated_text": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is revolutionizing cell biology by providing unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture of cells in their native state. This technique enables in situ structural biology, allowing researchers to visualize complex cellular environments at near-atomic resolution. By integrating cryo-ET with quantitative cell biology and biophysical modeling, scientists can elucidate the spatial organization and interactions of macromolecular complexes within cells. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cellular processes but also facilitates the development of predictive models of cellular behavior. Cryo-ET thus represents a powerful tool for advancing our knowledge of cell biology, bridging the gap between molecular structures and cellular function.", "label": 1}
