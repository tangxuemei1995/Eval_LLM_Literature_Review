{"grounding": "Many proteins contain large structurally disordered regions or are entirely disordered under physiological conditions. The functions of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often involve interactions with other biomolecules. An important emerging effort has thus been to identify the molecular mechanisms of IDP interactions and how they differ from the textbook notions of biomolecular binding for folded proteins. In this review, we summarize how the versatile tool kit of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy can aid the investigation of these conformationally heterogeneous and highly dynamic molecular systems. We discuss the experimental observables that can be employed and how they enable IDP complexes to be probed on timescales from nanoseconds to hours. Key insights include the diverse structural and dynamic properties of bound IDPs and the kinetic mechanisms facilitated by disorder, such as fly-casting; disorder-mediated encounter complexes; and competitive substitution via ternary complexes, which enables rapid dissociation even for high-affinity complexes. We also discuss emerging links to aggregation, liquid\u2013liquid phase separation, and cellular processes, as well as current technical advances to further expand the scope of single-molecule spectroscopy.", "generated_text": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play crucial roles in cellular processes through their ability to form dynamic and transient complexes. This study investigates the interaction dynamics of IDPs using single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to elucidate their binding mechanisms and kinetics. By employing smFRET, we capture real-time conformational changes and binding events at the single-molecule level, providing insights into the heterogeneity and flexibility of disordered complexes. Our findings reveal that IDPs exhibit a broad spectrum of binding affinities and kinetics, influenced by their conformational plasticity. Molecular simulations complement the experimental data, offering a detailed view of the energy landscapes and interaction pathways. The integration of smFRET with computational models allows for a comprehensive understanding of the transient nature of IDP interactions, highlighting the role of disorder in facilitating rapid and reversible binding. This research advances our knowledge of IDP function and their potential as therapeutic targets, emphasizing the importance of disorder in protein-protein interactions and cellular regulation.", "label": 1}
