{"grounding": "Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has matured into a robust method for the determination of biological macromolecule structures in the past decade, complementing X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Constant methodological improvements in both cryo-EM hardware and image processing software continue to contribute to an exponential growth in the number of structures solved annually. In this review, we provide a historical view of the many steps that were required to make cryo-EM a successful method for the determination of high-resolution protein complex structures. We further discuss aspects of cryo-EM methodology that are the greatest pitfalls challenging successful structure determination to date. Lastly, we highlight and propose potential future developments that would improve the method even further in the near future.", "generated_text": "High-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a transformative tool for elucidating the 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes at near-atomic resolution. This technique offers significant advantages over traditional methods, such as X-ray crystallography, by allowing the study of biomolecules in their native states without the need for crystallization. Recent advancements in detector technology and image processing algorithms have pushed the boundaries of achievable resolution, enabling detailed insights into molecular mechanisms. However, challenges remain, including the correction of optical aberrations and the need for improved sample preparation techniques to enhance image quality and resolution. This review explores the current prospects of cryo-EM, addressing its limitations and potential future developments in achieving true atomic resolution.", "label": 1}
