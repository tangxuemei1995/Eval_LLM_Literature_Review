{"grounding": "Hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods have become indispensable tools for the study of biomolecules. In this article, we briefly review the basic methodological details of QM/MM approaches and discuss their applications to various energy transduction problems in biomolecular machines, such as long-range proton transports, fast electron transfers, and mechanochemical coupling. We highlight the particular importance for these applications of balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Using several recent examples, we illustrate the value and limitations of QM/MM methodologies for both ground and excited states, as well as strategies for calibrating them in specific applications. We conclude with brief comments on several areas that can benefit from further efforts to make QM/MM analyses more quantitative and applicable to increasingly complex biological problems.", "generated_text": "Hybrid Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) methods have emerged as powerful tools for investigating energy transduction in biomolecular machines. These methods enable the detailed study of complex processes such as proton and electron transfers, and nucleotide hydrolysis, which are fundamental to the function of biomolecular machines. By integrating quantum mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of molecular mechanics, QM/MM approaches provide insights into the mechanistic pathways and energetic landscapes of these processes.
