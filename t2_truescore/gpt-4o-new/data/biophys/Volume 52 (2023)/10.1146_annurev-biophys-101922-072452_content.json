{"grounding": "Faithful translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein is essential to maintain protein homeostasis in the cell. Spontaneous translation errors are very rare due to stringent selection of cognate aminoacyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the tight control of the mRNA reading frame by the ribosome. Recoding events, such as stop codon readthrough, frameshifting, and translational bypassing, reprogram the ribosome to make intentional mistakes and produce alternative proteins from the same mRNA. The hallmark of recoding is the change of ribosome dynamics. The signals for recoding are built into the mRNA, but their reading depends on the genetic makeup of the cell, resulting in cell-specific changes in expression programs. In this review, I discuss the mechanisms of canonical decoding and tRNA\u2013mRNA translocation; describe alternative pathways leading to recoding; and identify the links among mRNA signals, ribosome dynamics, and recoding.", "generated_text": "The ribosome is a complex molecular machine responsible for translating mRNA sequences into functional proteins, a process that is finely regulated by various factors including tRNA, EF-Tu, and EF-G. This study explores the mechanisms of mRNA decoding and recoding, focusing on frameshifting and stop codon readthrough events. These phenomena are critical for understanding how the ribosome maintains fidelity and flexibility during translation. We employ kinetic analyses to elucidate the roles of elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G in modulating the accuracy and efficiency of translation. Our findings reveal that specific interactions between tRNA and the ribosome can induce frameshifting, while certain sequences promote stop codon readthrough, highlighting the dynamic nature of mRNA translation. This research advances our understanding of the molecular intricacies of ribosomal function and its implications for protein synthesis and cellular regulation.", "label": 1}
