{"grounding": "Efforts to combine theory and experiment to advance our knowledge of molecular processes relevant to biophysics have been considerably enhanced by the contribution of statistical-mechanics simulations. Key to the understanding of such molecular processes is the underlying free-energy change. Being able to accurately predict this change from first principles represents an appealing prospect. Over the past decades, the synergy between steadily growing computational resources and unrelenting methodological developments has brought free-energy calculations into the arsenal of tools commonly utilized to tackle important questions that experiment alone has left unresolved. The continued emergence of new options to determine free energies has also bred confusion amid the community of users, who may find it difficult to choose the best-suited algorithm to address the problem at hand. In an attempt to clarify the current landscape, this review recounts how the field has been shaped and how the broad gamut of methods available today is rooted in a few foundational principles laid down many years ago.Three examples of molecular processes central to biophysics illustrate where free-energy calculations stand and what are the conceptual and practical obstacles that we must overcome to increase their predictive power.", "generated_text": "The accurate description of molecular processes is crucial for understanding biological systems and designing novel materials. Free energy methods, which quantify the thermodynamic potential of molecular systems, are essential tools in this endeavor. This review explores the application of free energy methods in computer simulations, focusing on their role in elucidating molecular recognition and association, permeation, and conformational transitions. Importance sampling and enhanced sampling techniques are highlighted as pivotal strategies for overcoming the challenges associated with the high-dimensional energy landscapes of molecular systems. These methods improve the efficiency and accuracy of free energy calculations by selectively sampling relevant configurations and enhancing the exploration of rare events. The review discusses recent advancements in these techniques, including metadynamics, umbrella sampling, and adaptive biasing force methods, which have significantly expanded the scope of molecular simulations. By providing insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of molecular processes, free energy methods facilitate the prediction and manipulation of molecular behavior, offering profound implications for drug design, biomolecular engineering, and material science. The integration of these methods with experimental data further enhances their predictive power, paving the way for a deeper understanding of complex molecular phenomena.", "label": 1}
