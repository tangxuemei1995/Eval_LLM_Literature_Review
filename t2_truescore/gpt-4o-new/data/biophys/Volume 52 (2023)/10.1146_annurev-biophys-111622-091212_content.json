{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy allows the investigation of cellular structures at nanoscale resolution using light. Current developments in super-resolution microscopy have focused on reliable quantification of the underlying biological data. In this review, we first describe the basic principles of super-resolution microscopy techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), and then give a broad overview of methodological developments to quantify super-resolution data, particularly those geared toward SMLM data. We cover commonly used techniques such as spatial point pattern analysis, colocalization, and protein copy number quantification but also describe more advanced techniques such as structural modeling, single-particle tracking, and biosensing. Finally, we provide an outlook on exciting new research directions to which quantitative super-resolution microscopy might be applied.", "generated_text": "Quantitative Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has emerged as a pivotal technique in super-resolution nanoscopy, enabling unprecedented insights into cellular structures at the nanoscale. This method surpasses the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy by precisely localizing individual fluorescent molecules, thus facilitating the quantitative analysis of complex biological systems. Recent advancements in SMLM have enhanced its applicability in quantitative cell biology, allowing for the detailed mapping of molecular distributions and interactions within cells. This review highlights the latest developments in SMLM techniques, including improvements in localization precision, data analysis algorithms, and their integration with complementary imaging modalities. The potential of SMLM to transform our understanding of cellular processes through quantitative measurements is underscored, paving the way for novel discoveries in molecular and cellular biology.", "label": 1}
