{"grounding": "Rhodopsin is the photoreceptor in human rod cells responsible for dim-light vision. The visual receptors are part of the large superfamily of G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate signal transduction in response to diverse diffusible ligands. The high level of sequence conservation within the transmembrane helices of the visual receptors and the family A GPCRs has long been considered evidence for a common pathway for signal transduction. I review recent studies that reveal a comprehensive mechanism for how light absorption by the retinylidene chromophore drives rhodopsin activation and highlight those features of the mechanism that are conserved across the ligand-activated GPCRs.", "generated_text": "Rhodopsin, a prototypical G protein\u2013coupled receptor (GPCR), plays a crucial role in vision by converting light into a biochemical signal. This study elucidates the activation mechanism of rhodopsin, focusing on its structural dynamics. Using advanced spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques, we reveal conformational changes upon photon absorption, leading to the activation of the G protein transducin. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of retinal isomerization and subsequent helix movements in signal transduction. Understanding rhodopsin's activation provides insights into GPCR function, offering potential therapeutic targets for visual disorders and expanding knowledge of GPCR-mediated signaling pathways.", "label": 1}
