{"grounding": "An ideal biosensor material at room temperature, with an extremely large surface area per unit mass combined with the possibility of harnessing quantum mechanical attributes, would be comprised of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials. The sensing of a variety of sizes and types of biomolecules involves modulation of the electrical charge density of (current through) the 2D material and manifests through specific components of the capacitance (resistance). While sensitive detection at the single-molecule level, i.e., at zeptomolar concentrations, may be achieved, specificity in a complex mixture is more demanding. Attention should be paid to the influence of inevitably present defects in the 2D materials on the sensing, as well as calibration of obtained results with acceptable standards. The consequent establishment of a roadmap for the widespread deployment of 2D material\u2013based biosensors in point-of-care platforms has the potential to revolutionize health care.", "generated_text": "Graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for biomolecule sensing due to their exceptional specific surface area (SSA) and tunable electronic properties, such as density of states (DOS). These materials, when integrated into field effect transistor (FET) configurations, exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting biomolecules. The unique electronic properties of 2D materials, influenced by defects and edge states, play a crucial role in enhancing sensor performance. Impedance models are employed to understand the interaction mechanisms between biomolecules and the sensor surface, providing insights into optimizing sensor design. However, the variability in material quality and device fabrication necessitates the development of standardized protocols to ensure reproducibility and reliability in sensor performance. This review highlights recent advancements in the use of graphene and 2D materials for biomolecule sensing, emphasizing the need for standardization to fully realize their potential in practical applications.", "label": 1}
