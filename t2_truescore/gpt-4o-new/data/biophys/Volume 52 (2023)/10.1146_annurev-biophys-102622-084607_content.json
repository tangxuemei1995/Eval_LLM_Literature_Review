{"grounding": "Advances in a scientific discipline are often measured by small, incremental steps. In this review, we report on two intertwined disciplines in the protein structure prediction field, modeling of single chains and modeling of complexes, that have over decades emulated this pattern, as monitored by the community-wide blind prediction experiments CASP and CAPRI. However, over the past few years, dramatic advances were observed for the accurate prediction of single protein chains, driven by a surge of deep learning methodologies entering the prediction field. We review the mainscientific developments that enabled these recent breakthroughs and feature the important role of blind prediction experiments in building up and nurturing the structure prediction field. We discuss how the new wave of artificial intelligence\u2013based methods is impacting the fields of computational and experimental structural biology and highlight areas in which deep learning methods are likely to lead to future developments, provided that major challenges are overcome.", "generated_text": "The accurate prediction of protein structures and their interactions is a pivotal challenge in computational biology, with significant implications for drug discovery and understanding biological processes. This study critically assesses the current methodologies employed in predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins and protein complexes, focusing on the contributions of the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and the Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) initiatives. These biennial competitions have driven advancements in the field by benchmarking the performance of various prediction algorithms. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning techniques, have revolutionized the accuracy of these predictions, as evidenced by the success of models like AlphaFold. This review synthesizes the progress made in the field, evaluates the strengths and limitations of existing methods, and discusses future directions for improving prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The integration of AI-driven approaches with traditional methods holds promise for further breakthroughs in understanding protein interactions.", "label": 1}
