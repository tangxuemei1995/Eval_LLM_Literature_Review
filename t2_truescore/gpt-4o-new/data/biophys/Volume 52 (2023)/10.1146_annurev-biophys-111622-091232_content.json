{"grounding": "ABC transporters are essential for cellular physiology. Humans have 48 ABC genes organized into seven distinct families. Of these genes, 44 (in five distinct families) encode for membrane transporters, of which several are involved in drug resistance and disease pathways resulting from transporter dysfunction. Over the last decade, advances in structural biology have vastly expanded our mechanistic understanding of human ABC transporter function, revealing details of their molecular arrangement, regulation, and interactions, facilitated in large part by advances in cryo-EM that have rendered hitherto inaccessible targets amenable to high-resolution structural analysis. As a result, experimentally determined structures of multiple members of each of the five families of ABC transporters in humans are now available. Here we review this recent progress, highlighting the physiological relevance of human ABC transporters and mechanistic insights gleaned from their direct structure determination. We also discuss the impact and limitations of model systems and structure prediction methods in understanding human ABC transporters and discuss current challenges and future research directions.", "generated_text": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the translocation of various substrates across cellular membranes, impacting processes such as drug extrusion and lipid homeostasis. These transporters are implicated in numerous human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and multidrug resistance in cancer, making them significant targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided unprecedented insights into the structural dynamics and mechanistic functions of human ABC transporters. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the architecture of these transporters, highlighting the conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis that drive substrate translocation. We discuss the implications of these structural insights for understanding the molecular basis of transporter-related diseases and for the development of novel pharmacological strategies. By elucidating the structure-function relationships of ABC transporters, this research underscores the potential for cryo-EM to advance our understanding of membrane protein mechanisms and to inform the design of targeted therapies for conditions linked to transporter dysfunction.", "label": 1}
