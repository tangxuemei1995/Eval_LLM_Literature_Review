{"grounding": "Mitochondria are involved in multiple cellular tasks, such as ATP synthesis, metabolism, metabolite and ion transport, regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, signaling, and inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. The majority of the correct functioning of mitochondria is based on the large electrochemical proton gradient, whose component, the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, is strictly controlled by ion transport through mitochondrial membranes. Consequently, mitochondrial function is critically dependent on ion homeostasis, the disturbance of which leads to abnormal cell functions. Therefore, the discovery of mitochondrial ion channels influencing ion permeability through the membrane has defined a new dimension of the function of ion channels in different cell types, mainly linked to the important tasks that mitochondrial ion channels perform in cell life and death. This review summarizes studies on animal mitochondrial ion channels with special focus on their biophysical properties, molecular identity, and regulation. Additionally, the potential of mitochondrial ion channels as therapeutic targets for several diseases is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial ion channels play a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism, influencing processes such as ATP production, apoptosis, and calcium signaling. This review explores the diverse types of ion channels present in the mitochondrial membranes, including calcium channels, potassium channels, chloride channels, and the mitochondrial megachannel, also known as the permeability transition pore. Calcium channels are crucial for regulating mitochondrial calcium uptake, impacting metabolic activity and cell death pathways. Potassium channels contribute to mitochondrial volume regulation and protection against ischemic damage. Chloride channels are involved in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and ionic balance. Additionally, the mitochondrial megachannel is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition, a key event in apoptosis. The role of porins, which facilitate the transport of metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane, is also discussed. Understanding the function and regulation of these channels is essential for elucidating their contributions to mitochondrial physiology and their potential as therapeutic targets in various diseases.", "label": 1}
