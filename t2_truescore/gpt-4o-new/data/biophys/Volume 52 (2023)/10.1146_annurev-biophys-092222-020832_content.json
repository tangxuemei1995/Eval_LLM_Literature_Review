{"grounding": "The advent of biotechnology has enabled metabolic engineers to assemble heterologous pathways in cells to produce a variety of products of industrial relevance, often in a sustainable way. However, many pathways face challenges of low product yield. These pathways often suffer from issues that are difficult to optimize, such as low pathway flux and off-target pathway consumption of intermediates. These issues are exacerbated by the need to balance pathway flux with the health of the cell, particularly when a toxic intermediate builds up. Nature faces similar challenges and has evolved spatial organization strategies to increase metabolic pathway flux and efficiency. Inspired by these strategies, bioengineers have developed clever strategies to mimic spatial organization in nature. This review explores the use of spatial organization strategies, including protein scaffolding and protein encapsulation inside of proteinaceous shells, toward overcoming bottlenecks in metabolic engineering efforts.", "generated_text": "The organization and encapsulation of multienzyme systems are pivotal in enhancing metabolic efficiency and specificity, offering significant potential in metabolic engineering. This study explores both theoretical frameworks and practical applications of multienzyme complexes, focusing on protein scaffolds and bacterial microcompartments. Protein scaffolds provide a modular approach to enzyme organization, facilitating substrate channeling and reducing diffusion limitations. Bacterial microcompartments, on the other hand, offer a natural encapsulation strategy, creating distinct microenvironments that can optimize reaction conditions and protect sensitive intermediates. By integrating these strategies, we can design synthetic pathways with improved yields and reduced by-products. This paper reviews recent advances in the field, highlighting innovative techniques for scaffold design and compartmentalization, and discusses their implications for industrial biotechnology. The findings underscore the importance of structural and functional considerations in the development of efficient multienzyme systems for diverse applications.", "label": 0}
