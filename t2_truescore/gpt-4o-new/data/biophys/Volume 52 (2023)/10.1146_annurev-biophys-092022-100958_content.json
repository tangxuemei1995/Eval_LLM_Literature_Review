{"grounding": "The recent proliferation of cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques has led to the cryo-ET resolution revolution. Meanwhile, significant efforts have been made to improve the identification of targets in the cellular context and the throughput of cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Together, these developments led to a surge of in situ discoveries on how enveloped viruses are assembled and how viruses interact with cells in infected hosts. In this article, we review the recent advances in cryo-ET, high-resolution insights into virus assembly, and the findings from inside infected eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.", "generated_text": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling high-resolution visualization of viruses in their native states. The integration of cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling has further enhanced sample preparation, allowing for precise thinning of cellular specimens. This technological advancement has led to a surge in in situ virological discoveries, providing unprecedented insights into viral architecture and host interactions. Cryo-ET's ability to capture dynamic processes at near-atomic resolution is transforming our understanding of viral pathogenesis and informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
