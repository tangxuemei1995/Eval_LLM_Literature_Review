{"grounding": "This review explores the interface between circadian timekeeping and the regulation of brain function by astrocytes. Although astrocytes regulate neuronal activity across many time domains, their cell-autonomous circadian clocks exert a particular role in controlling longer-term oscillations of brain function: the maintenance of sleep states and the circadian ordering of sleep and wakefulness. This is most evident in the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where the molecular clock of astrocytes suffices to drive daily cycles of neuronal activity and behavior. In Alzheimer's disease, sleep impairments accompany cognitive decline. In mouse models of the disease, circadian disturbances accelerate astroglial activation and other brain pathologies, suggesting that daily functions in astrocytes protect neuronal homeostasis. In brain cancer, treatment in the morning has been associated with prolonged survival, and gliomas have daily rhythms in gene expression and drug sensitivity. Thus, circadian time is fast becoming critical to elucidating reciprocal astrocytic-neuronal interactions in health and disease.", "generated_text": "Circadian rhythms, the intrinsic 24-hour cycles governing physiological processes, are crucial for maintaining homeostasis. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, have emerged as significant players in the regulation of these rhythms, influencing both neuronal activity and overall brain function. This review explores the dualistic roles of astrocytes in circadian regulation, highlighting their beneficial contributions to calcium signaling and gliotransmitter release, which are essential for sleep regulation and cognitive function. However, dysregulation of astrocytic circadian rhythms can lead to detrimental outcomes, such as exacerbating neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease and promoting the progression of gliomas. The complex interplay between astrocytic function and circadian rhythms presents both therapeutic opportunities and challenges. Understanding these dynamics is critical for developing interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of circadian disruption in neurological disorders. This review underscores the need for further research into astrocyte-specific circadian mechanisms to harness their potential in clinical applications.", "label": 1}
