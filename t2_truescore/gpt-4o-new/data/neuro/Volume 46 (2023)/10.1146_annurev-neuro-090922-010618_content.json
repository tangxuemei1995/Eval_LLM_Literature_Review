{"grounding": "In mammals, the activity of neurons in the entorhinal-hippocampal network is modulated by the animal's position and its movement through space. At multiple stages of this distributed circuit, distinct populations of neurons can represent a rich repertoire of navigation-related variables like the animal's location, the speed and direction of its movements, or the presence of borders and objects. Working together, spatially tuned neurons give rise to an internal representation of space, a cognitive map that supports an animal's ability to navigate the world and to encode and consolidate memories from experience. The mechanisms by which, during development, the brain acquires the ability to create an internal representation of space are just beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we examine recent work that has begun to investigate the ontogeny of circuitry, firing patterns, and computations underpinning the representation of space in the mammalian brain.", "generated_text": "The development of cognitive maps, essential for spatial navigation and memory, involves intricate neural circuits and computations within the brain. This study explores the formation and maturation of these maps, focusing on the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, key regions implicated in spatial representation. We examine the ontogeny of grid cells, place cells, and their interactions, elucidating how these neural elements contribute to the encoding and retrieval of spatial information. Through a synthesis of developmental neuroscience and computational modeling, we highlight the role of experience and environmental interactions in shaping these circuits. Our findings suggest that the integration of sensory inputs and intrinsic neural dynamics is crucial for the emergence of a functional cognitive map. This research advances our understanding of the neural basis of navigation and memory, offering insights into how spatial representations are constructed and maintained in the brain.", "label": 1}
