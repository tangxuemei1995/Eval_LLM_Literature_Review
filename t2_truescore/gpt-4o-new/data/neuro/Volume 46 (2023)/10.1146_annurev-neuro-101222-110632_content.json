{"grounding": "Examination of cognition has historically been approached from language and introspection. However, human language\u2013dependent definitions ignore the evolutionary roots of brain mechanisms and constrain their study in experimental animals. We promote an alternative view, namely that cognition, including memory, can be explained by exaptation and expansion of the circuits and algorithms serving bodily functions. Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states. Exaptation of such circuits was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche. We illustrate that exploration gives rise to a cognitive map, and in turn, environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning). Such brain-body interactions not only occur during waking but also persist during sleep. These exaptation steps are illustrated by the dual, endocrine-homeostatic and memory, contributions of the hippocampal system, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between the body and brain in the context of memory, focusing on the exaptation of memory processes. Central to this investigation is the hippocampus, a critical structure for memory consolidation, and its role in sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), which are believed to facilitate memory replay and integration. We examine how these neural processes are influenced by physiological states, particularly through mechanisms of homeostasis and allostasis, which maintain internal stability and adapt to external demands, respectively. The research highlights the bidirectional influence between body control systems, such as glucose regulation, and cognitive functions, suggesting that metabolic states can modulate hippocampal activity and memory performance. By integrating insights from neuroscience and physiology, this study proposes a model where memory processes are not only brain-dependent but also significantly shaped by bodily states, offering a comprehensive understanding of cognition as a dynamic body-brain partnership.", "label": 1}
