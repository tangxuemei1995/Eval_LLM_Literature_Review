{"grounding": "The field of stereotactic neurosurgery developed more than 70 years ago to address a therapy gap for patients with severe psychiatric disorders. In the decades since, it has matured tremendously, benefiting from advances in clinical and basic sciences. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe, treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders is currently poised to transition from a stage of empiricism to one increasingly rooted in scientific discovery. Current drivers of this transition are advances in neuroimaging, but rapidly emerging ones are neurophysiological\u2014as we understand more about the neural basis of these disorders, we will more successfully be able to use interventions such as invasive stimulation to restore dysfunctional circuits to health. Paralleling this transition is a steady increase in the consistency and quality of outcome data. Here, we focus on obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, two topics that have received the most attention in terms of trial volume and scientific effort.", "generated_text": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising neuromodulatory intervention for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, particularly Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and depression. This review synthesizes current research on the efficacy and mechanisms of DBS in these conditions, highlighting its role in psychiatric neurosurgery. DBS involves the implantation of electrodes in specific brain regions, such as the subthalamic nucleus and ventral capsule/ventral striatum, to modulate dysfunctional neural circuits. Clinical trials and case studies demonstrate significant symptom reduction in patients with severe OCD and depression, who have not responded to conventional therapies. Despite its potential, DBS presents challenges, including patient selection, optimal target identification, and long-term effects. Advances in neuroimaging and personalized medicine are expected to enhance DBS outcomes. This paper underscores the need for further research to refine DBS protocols and improve understanding of its neuromodulatory mechanisms in psychiatric disorders.", "label": 1}
