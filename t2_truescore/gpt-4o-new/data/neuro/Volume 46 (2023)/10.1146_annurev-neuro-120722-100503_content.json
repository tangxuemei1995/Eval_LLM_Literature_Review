{"grounding": "Despite increasing evidence of its involvement in several key functions of the cerebral cortex, the vestibular sense rarely enters our consciousness. Indeed, the extent to which these internal signals are incorporated within cortical sensory representation and how they might be relied upon for sensory-driven decision-making, during, for example, spatial navigation, is yet to be understood. Recent novel experimental approaches in rodents have probed both the physiological and behavioral significance of vestibular signals and indicate that their widespread integration with vision improves both the cortical representation and perceptual accuracy of self-motion and orientation. Here, we summarize these recent findings with a focus on cortical circuits involved in visual perception and spatial navigation and highlight the major remaining knowledge gaps. We suggest that vestibulo-visual integration reflects a process of constant updating regarding the status of self-motion, and access to such information by the cortex is used for sensory perception and predictions that may be implemented for rapid, navigation-related decision-making.", "generated_text": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues is crucial for effective spatial navigation, visual processing, and perception. This study explores the mechanisms by which the cerebral cortex synthesizes these multisensory inputs to facilitate coherent self-motion perception and navigation. By examining neural pathways and cortical regions involved in processing vestibular and visual information, we aim to elucidate how these systems interact to maintain spatial orientation and balance. Our findings suggest that specific cortical areas, such as the parietal and temporal lobes, play pivotal roles in integrating sensory inputs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of motion perception and navigation. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of multisensory integration in adapting to dynamic environments, suggesting that disruptions in these processes may contribute to navigational and perceptual deficits. This research advances our understanding of the neural basis of multisensory integration and its implications for developing interventions for disorders affecting balance and spatial awareness.", "label": 1}
