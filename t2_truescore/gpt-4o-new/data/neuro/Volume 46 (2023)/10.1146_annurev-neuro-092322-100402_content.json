{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires the creation, updating, and expression of memories to depend on context. While the neural underpinnings of each of these processes have been intensively studied, recent advances in computational modeling revealed a key challenge in context-dependent learning that had been largely ignored previously: Under naturalistic conditions, context is typically uncertain, necessitating contextual inference. We review a theoretical approach to formalizing context-dependent learning in the face of contextual uncertainty and the core computations it requires. We show how this approach begins to organize a large body of disparate experimental observations, from multiple levels of brain organization (including circuits, systems, and behavior) and multiple brain regions (most prominently the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and motor cortices), into a coherent framework. We argue that contextual inference may also be key to understanding continual learning in the brain. This theory-driven perspective places contextual inference as a core component of learning.", "generated_text": "Context-dependent learning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables organisms to adaptively respond to varying environmental cues. This study explores the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this form of learning, emphasizing the roles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortex. By integrating principles of Bayesian inference, we propose a model of continual learning that accounts for the dynamic updating of memory representations in response to contextual changes. Our findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex orchestrates context-dependent learning by modulating neural computations across the hippocampus and thalamus, facilitating the encoding and retrieval of context-specific information. Additionally, the motor cortex is implicated in translating these neural computations into adaptive behavioral responses. This research advances our understanding of the neural substrates of learning and memory, offering insights into how the brain efficiently manages and utilizes contextual information to guide behavior in complex environments.", "label": 1}
