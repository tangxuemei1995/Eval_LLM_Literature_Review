{"grounding": "All mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol to maintain membrane integrity. The transport of this hydrophobic lipid is mediated by lipoproteins. Cholesterol is especially enriched in the brain, particularly in synaptic and myelin membranes. Aging involves changes in sterol metabolism in peripheral organs and also in the brain. Some of those alterations have the potential to promote or to counteract the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of general principles of sterol metabolism in humans and mice, the most widely used model organism in biomedical research. We discuss changes in sterol metabolism that occur in the aged brain and highlight recent developments in cell type\u2013specific cholesterol metabolism in the fast-growing research field of aging and age-related diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. We propose that cell type\u2013specific cholesterol handling and the interplay between cell types critically influence age-related disease processes.", "generated_text": "Cholesterol metabolism plays a crucial role in the aging process and the pathogenesis of age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. This review explores the intricate relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and neuronal function, emphasizing the impact of dysregulated cholesterol metabolism on microglia and neurons. As the brain ages, alterations in cholesterol transport and synthesis can lead to neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, contributing to cognitive decline. In Alzheimer's disease, aberrant cholesterol metabolism is linked to amyloid-beta accumulation and tau pathology, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cholesterol dysregulation in aging brains may reveal novel therapeutic targets for mitigating age-related cognitive impairments. This study highlights the need for further research into cholesterol-modulating strategies to preserve neuronal health and function in the elderly, potentially offering new avenues for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other age-associated neurological conditions.", "label": 1}
