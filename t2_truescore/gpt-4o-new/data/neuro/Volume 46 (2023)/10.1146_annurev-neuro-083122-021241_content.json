{"grounding": "Radial cell columns are a hallmark feature of cortical architecture in many mammalian species. It has long been held, based on the lack of orientation columns, that such functional units are absent in rodent primary visual cortex (V1). These observations led to the view that rodent visual cortex has a fundamentally different network architecture than that of carnivores and primates. While columns may be lacking in rodent V1, we describe in this review that modular clusters of inputs to layer 1 and projection neurons in the layers below are prominent features of the mouse visual cortex. We propose that modules organize thalamocortical inputs, intracortical processing streams, and transthalamic communications that underlie distinct sensory and sensorimotor functions.", "generated_text": "The integration of feedforward and feedback information streams is crucial for understanding the modular architecture of the mouse visual cortex. This study investigates the role of patchy connections and layer 1 in facilitating these interactions within the processing hierarchy. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques, we explore how M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors modulate these connections, influencing visual processing streams. Our findings reveal that layer 1 serves as a critical hub for integrating diverse information streams, with patchy connections providing a structural basis for this integration. The results suggest that M2 receptors play a significant role in modulating the strength and efficacy of these connections, offering insights into the dynamic processing capabilities of the visual cortex.", "label": 0}
