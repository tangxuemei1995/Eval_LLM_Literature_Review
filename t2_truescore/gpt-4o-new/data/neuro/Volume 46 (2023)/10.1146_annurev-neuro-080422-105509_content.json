{"grounding": "Migraine is a complex neurovascular pain disorder linked to the meninges, a border tissue innervated by neuropeptide-containing primary afferent fibers chiefly from the trigeminal nerve. Electrical or mechanical stimulation of this nerve surrounding large blood vessels evokes headache patterns as in migraine, and the brain, blood, and meninges are likely sources of headache triggers. Cerebrospinal fluid may play a significant role in migraine by transferring signals released from the brain to overlying pain-sensitive meningeal tissues, including dura mater. Interactions between trigeminal afferents, neuropeptides, and adjacent meningeal cells and tissues cause neurogenic inflammation, a critical target for current prophylactic and abortive migraine therapies. Here we review the importance of the cranial meninges to migraine headaches, explore the properties of trigeminal meningeal afferents, and briefly review emerging concepts, such as meningeal neuroimmune interactions, that may one day prove therapeutically relevant.", "generated_text": "Migraine, a prevalent and debilitating neurological disorder, is intricately linked to the meningeal structures and their associated mechanisms. This review explores the role of the meninges in migraine pathophysiology, focusing on the activation and sensitization of meningeal afferents. The trigeminal nerve, a key player in headache disorders, innervates the meninges and is implicated in the transmission of nociceptive signals. Neurogenic inflammation within the meninges, characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, contributes to the sensitization of these afferents, exacerbating migraine symptoms. Additionally, cortical spreading depression, a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, is proposed to trigger meningeal nociception, linking cortical events to headache onset. Understanding these complex interactions offers insights into potential therapeutic targets for migraine management, emphasizing the need for further research into meningeal contributions to migraine pathogenesis.", "label": 1}
