{"grounding": "Primates have evolved diverse cognitive capabilities to navigate their complex social world. To understand how the brain implements critical social cognitive abilities, we describe functional specialization in the domains of face processing, social interaction understanding, and mental state attribution. Systems for face processing are specialized from the level of single cells to populations of neurons within brain regions to hierarchically organized networks that extract and represent abstract social information. Such functional specialization is not confined to the sensorimotor periphery but appears to be a pervasive theme of primate brain organization all the way to the apex regions of cortical hierarchies. Circuits processing social information are juxtaposed with parallel systems involved in processing nonsocial information, suggesting common computations applied to different domains. The emerging picture of the neural basis of social cognition is a set of distinct but interacting subnetworks involved in component processes such as face perception and social reasoning, traversing large parts of the primate brain.", "generated_text": "The primate brain exhibits specialized networks that underpin social cognition, a critical aspect of navigating complex social environments. This study explores the functional brain organization related to social cognition, emphasizing the role of the 'social brain' in processing social information. We investigate the neural substrates involved in face processing and social interaction analysis, which are essential for recognizing and interpreting social cues. By integrating findings from neuroimaging studies and behavioral analyses, we delineate the distinct neural circuits that facilitate social knowledge acquisition and application. Our results highlight the interconnectedness of regions such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and superior temporal sulcus, which collectively support the perception and interpretation of social stimuli. This research advances our understanding of how specialized networks in the primate brain contribute to social cognition, offering insights into the evolutionary adaptations that enable complex social behaviors. These findings have implications for understanding social cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders.", "label": 1}
