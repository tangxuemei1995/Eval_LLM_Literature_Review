{"grounding": "Mechano-bactericidal (MB) nanopatterns have the ability to inactivate bacterial cells by rupturing cellular envelopes. Such biocide-free, physicomechanical mechanisms may confer lasting biofilm mitigation capability to various materials encountered in food processing, packaging, and food preparation environments. In this review, we first discuss recent progress on elucidating MB mechanisms, unraveling property\u2013activity relationships, and developing cost-effective and scalable nanofabrication technologies. Next, we evaluate the potential challenges that MB surfaces may face in food-related applications and provide our perspective on the critical research needs and opportunities to facilitate their adoption in the food industry.", "generated_text": "Mechano-bactericidal surfaces offer a promising approach to enhancing food safety by physically disrupting bacterial cells. This review explores the underlying mechanisms of bactericidal action, focusing on the role of nanoscale topographies. Advances in nanofabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting their potential to create effective antimicrobial surfaces for food-contact applications. The integration of these surfaces into food processing and packaging systems is examined, emphasizing their ability to reduce microbial contamination. Future prospects include optimizing surface designs for specific food industry needs, thereby improving food safety and extending shelf life while minimizing chemical preservatives.", "label": 1}
