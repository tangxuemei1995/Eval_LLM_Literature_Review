{"grounding": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a bioactive phytochemical abundant in cruciferous vegetables. One of its main in vivo metabolites is 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM), formed by the condensation of two molecules of I3C. Both I3C and DIM alter multiple signaling pathways and related molecules controlling diverse cellular events, including oxidation, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity. There is a growing body of evidence from both in vitro and in vivo models that these compounds possess strong potential to prevent several forms of chronic disease such as inflammation, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, neurodegenerative diseases, and osteoporosis. This article reviews current knowledge of the occurrence of I3C in nature and foods, along with the beneficial effects of I3C and DIM concerning prevention and treatment of human chronic diseases, focusing on preclinical studies and their mechanisms of action at cellular and molecular levels.", "generated_text": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a naturally occurring compound found in cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. Upon ingestion, I3C is converted into various bioactive compounds, including 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM), which have been associated with numerous health benefits. This review explores the occurrence of I3C in dietary sources and its potential health-promoting properties, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these benefits are examined, highlighting I3C's role in modulating estrogen metabolism, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting cell proliferation. Additionally, the review discusses the impact of I3C and DIM on signaling pathways, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), which contribute to their therapeutic potential. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the development of I3C-based interventions for disease prevention and health promotion.", "label": 1}
