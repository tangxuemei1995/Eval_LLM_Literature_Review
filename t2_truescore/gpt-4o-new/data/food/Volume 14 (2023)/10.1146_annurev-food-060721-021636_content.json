{"grounding": "It is important to have larger proportions of health-beneficial polyunsaturated lipids in foods, but these nutrients are particularly sensitive to oxidation, and dedicated strategies must be developed to prevent this deleterious reaction. In food oil-in-water emulsions, the oil\u2013water interface is a crucial area when it comes to the initiation of lipid oxidation. Unfortunately, most available natural antioxidants, such as phenolic antioxidants, do not spontaneously position at this specific locus. Achieving such a strategic positioning has therefore been an active research area, and various routes have been proposed: lipophilizing phenolic acids to confer them with an amphiphilic character; functionalizing biopolymer emulsifiers through covalent or noncovalent interactions with phenolics; or loading Pickering particles with natural phenolic compounds to yield interfacial antioxidant reservoirs. We herein review the principles and efficiency of these approaches to counteract lipid oxidation in emulsions as well as their advantages and limitations.", "generated_text": "The strategic positioning of phenolic antioxidants at the oil\u2013water interface in emulsions is crucial for enhancing their efficacy in inhibiting lipid oxidation. This study explores various methodologies to optimize the interfacial localization of phenolic compounds, including the use of phenolipids and the creation of antioxidant reservoirs. By focusing on the interface, these antioxidants can more effectively scavenge free radicals and chelate metal ions, thereby prolonging the shelf life and nutritional quality of emulsion-based products. The research highlights the benefits of modifying the physicochemical properties of phenolic antioxidants to improve their affinity for the interface, thus maximizing their protective effects. The findings suggest that targeted delivery of antioxidants at the interface not only enhances their performance but also reduces the required concentration, offering economic and sensory advantages. This approach presents a promising avenue for the development of more stable and health-promoting emulsion systems.", "label": 1}
