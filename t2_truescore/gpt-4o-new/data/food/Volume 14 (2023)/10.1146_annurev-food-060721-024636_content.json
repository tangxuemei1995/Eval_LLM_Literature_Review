{"grounding": "Microgreens are edible young plants that have recently attracted interest because of their color and flavor diversity, phytonutrient abundance, short growth cycle, and minimal space and nutrient requirements. They can be cultivated in a variety of systems from simple home gardens to sophisticated vertical farms with automated irrigation, fertilizer delivery, and lighting controls. Microgreens have also attracted attention from space agencies hoping that their sensory qualities can contribute to the diet of astronauts in microgravity and their cultivation might help maintain crew physical and psychological health on long-duration spaceflight missions. However, many technical challenges and data gaps for growing microgreensboth on and off Earth remain unaddressed. This review summarizes recent studies on multiple aspects of microgreens, including nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, cultivation systems, operative conditions, innovative treatments, autonomous facilities, and potential space applications. It also provides the authors\u2019 perspectives on the challenges to stimulating more extensive interdisciplinary research.", "generated_text": "Microgreens, young edible plants harvested at the cotyledon stage, have gained significant attention due to their rich nutritional profile and potential to enhance food security. This review provides a comprehensive update on recent advancements in microgreen production systems, emphasizing their application in home, commercial, and space farming. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has revolutionized microgreen cultivation, enabling precise monitoring and control of growth conditions, thus optimizing yield and quality. In the context of space farming, microgreens offer a viable solution for sustainable food production in extraterrestrial environments, addressing the challenges of limited space and resources. The review also explores the role of microgreens in diversifying diets and improving nutritional intake, highlighting their potential to contribute to global food security. By synthesizing the latest research, this paper aims to inform future developments in microgreen cultivation and their broader implications for sustainable agriculture.", "label": 1}
