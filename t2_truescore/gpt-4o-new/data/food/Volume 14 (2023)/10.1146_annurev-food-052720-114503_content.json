{"grounding": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides are of particular interest in recent years because of their unique prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. Among different types of strategies for the production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, enzymatic methods are preferred owing to the predictability and controllability of the structure and composition of the reaction products. Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have been proved to show excellent prebiotic effects as well as other benefits to intestinal health. They have exhibited great application potential as functional food ingredients for various food products with improved quality and physicochemical characteristics. This article reviews the research progress on the enzymatic production of several typical nondigestible functional oligosaccharides in the food industry, including galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, chito-oligosaccharides, and human milk oligosaccharides. Moreover, their physicochemical properties and prebiotic activities are discussed as well as their contributions to intestinal health and applications in foods.", "generated_text": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have garnered significant attention for their prebiotic effects and potential to enhance intestinal health. This review explores the enzymatic production of these oligosaccharides, highlighting the advantages of enzymatic methods over traditional chemical synthesis, including specificity, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. The paper delves into various enzymes utilized in the production process, such as glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, and discusses their roles in tailoring oligosaccharide structures to optimize prebiotic activity. Furthermore, the review examines the incorporation of functional oligosaccharides into food products, emphasizing their ability to modulate gut microbiota, enhance nutrient absorption, and improve overall gastrointestinal function. By integrating recent advancements in enzymatic technology and food science, this study underscores the potential of functional oligosaccharides as a versatile ingredient in functional foods aimed at promoting intestinal health and preventing gastrointestinal disorders. Future research directions and challenges in commercial applications are also discussed.", "label": 1}
