{"grounding": "In contrast to traditional breeding, which relies on the identification of mutants, metabolic engineering provides a new platform to modify the oil composition in oil crops for improved nutrition. By altering endogenous genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways, it is possible to modify edible plant oils to increase the content of desired components or reduce the content of undesirable components. However, introduction of novel nutritional components such as omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids needs transgenic expression of novel genes in crops. Despite formidable challenges, significant progress in engineering nutritionally improved edible plant oils has recently been achieved, with some commercial products now on the market.", "generated_text": "The engineering of nutritionally improved edible plant oils is a promising approach to enhance human health. This study explores the application of metabolic engineering and gene editing techniques to increase the content of beneficial compounds such as high oleic acids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E in seed oils. By manipulating specific biosynthetic pathways, we aim to produce oils with enhanced nutritional profiles. The integration of advanced genetic tools allows for precise modifications, offering a sustainable solution to meet dietary needs. This research highlights the potential of biofortified plant oils in addressing global nutritional challenges and improving public health outcomes.", "label": 0}
