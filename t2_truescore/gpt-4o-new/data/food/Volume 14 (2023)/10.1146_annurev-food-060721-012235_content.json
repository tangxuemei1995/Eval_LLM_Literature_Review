{"grounding": "The in vitro digestion model developed by the INFOGEST international consortium is widely used to simulate the physicochemical processes occurring inside the human gastrointestinal tract (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) during the digestion of foods. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the INFOGEST method and the procedures used to measure the digestion of macronutrients (lipids, proteins, and starch), the bioaccessibility of bioactive agents (vitamins, minerals, and nutraceuticals), and the changes in the structure and physical properties of foods under gastrointestinal conditions (particle size, charge, and location). We then review the application of the INFOGEST method for monitoring the gastrointestinal fate of different kinds of foods and beverages, including dairy, egg, meat, seafood, fruit, vegetable, cereal, and emulsified products. We also discuss the application of this method for studying the digestibility of next-generation plant-based foods, such as meat, seafood, dairy, and egg analogs. Finally, the benefits and limitations of this standardized in vitro digestion model are assessed.", "generated_text": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has emerged as a pivotal tool for simulating human gastrointestinal processes, offering insights into the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of nutrients and bioactive compounds in foods. This review synthesizes recent advancements in the application of the INFOGEST model to various food matrices, highlighting its role in evaluating the nutritional and functional properties of foods. By mimicking the physiological conditions of the human digestive tract, the model provides a standardized approach to assess how different food components are released, transformed, and absorbed. The review discusses the model's utility in studying functional foods, which are designed to deliver health benefits beyond basic nutrition. It also addresses the challenges and limitations of the model, such as its inability to fully replicate the complexity of in vivo digestion. Overall, the INFOGEST model is a valuable tool for researchers aiming to optimize food formulations and enhance the health-promoting properties of dietary products.", "label": 1}
