{"grounding": "With the rising problems of food shortages, energy costs, and raw materials, the food industry must reduce its environmental impact. We present an overview of more resource-efficient processes to produce food ingredients, describing their environmental impact and the functional properties obtained. Extensive wet processing yields high purities but also has the highest environmental impact, mainly due to heating for protein precipitation and dehydration. Milder wet alternatives exclude, for example, low pH\u2013driven separation and are based on salt precipitation or water only. Drying steps are omitted during dry fractionation using air classification or electrostatic separation. Benefits of milder methods are enhanced functional properties. Therefore, fractionation and formulation should be focused on the desired functionality instead of purity. Environmental impact is also strongly reduced by milder refining. Antinutritional factors and off-flavors remain challenges in more mildly produced ingredients. The benefits of less refining motivate the increasing trend toward mildly refined ingredients.", "generated_text": "The growing demand for sustainable food production necessitates innovative approaches to ingredient processing. This study explores mild fractionation techniques, including dry fractionation and mild wet separation, to enhance the sustainability of plant protein extraction. By minimizing energy and water consumption, these methods offer a more resource-efficient alternative to conventional processes. The research focuses on optimizing the functionality of plant proteins, ensuring that the nutritional and sensory qualities are maintained or improved. Through a comparative analysis, the study evaluates the efficiency of these mild fractionation techniques in terms of yield, purity, and environmental impact. Results indicate that mild fractionation not only reduces resource use but also enhances the functional properties of plant proteins, making them suitable for a wider range of food applications. This approach aligns with the goals of sustainable food systems by reducing waste and promoting the use of plant-based ingredients, thereby contributing to a more sustainable food supply chain.", "label": 1}
