{"grounding": "Despite the almost universal acceptance of the phrase \u201cyou are what you eat,\u201d investment in understanding diet-based nutrition to address human health has been dwarfed compared to that for medicine-based interventions. Moreover, traditional breeding has focused on yield to the detriment of nutritional quality, meaning that although caloric content has remained high, the incidence of nutritional deficiencies and accompanying diseases (so-called hidden hunger) has risen dramatically. We review how genome sequencing coupled with metabolomics can facilitate the screening of genebank collections in the search for superior alleles related to the nutritional quality of crops. We argue that the first examples are very promising, suggesting that this approach could benefit broader ranges of crops and compounds with known relevance for human health. We argue that this represents anapproach complementary to metabolic engineering by transgenesis or gene editing that could be used to reverse some of the losses incurred through a recent focus on breeding for yield, although we caution that ensuring such approaches are not (re)introducing antinutrients is also necessary.", "generated_text": "The exploration of genebank collections offers a promising avenue for enhancing human health through the identification of metabolic signatures associated with phytonutrients. These collections, which house a vast array of plant genetic diversity, remain an underexploited resource in the quest to improve nutrition and health outcomes. By leveraging plant metabolomics, researchers can uncover the natural variance in phytonutrient profiles across different plant species and varieties. This study aims to highlight the potential of genebank collections in identifying unique metabolic signatures that could contribute to human health. Through advanced analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, the metabolic profiles of diverse plant accessions can be characterized, revealing bioactive compounds with potential health benefits. The integration of these findings into nutritional science could lead to the development of novel dietary strategies and functional foods. Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of preserving and studying plant genetic resources to unlock their potential in addressing global health challenges.", "label": 1}
