{"grounding": "Food proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols are natural ingredients with different functional attributes. For instance, many proteins are good emulsifiers and gelling agents, many polysaccharides are good thickening and stabilizing agents, and many polyphenols are good antioxidants and antimicrobials. These three kinds of ingredients can be combined into protein, polysaccharide, and/or polyphenol conjugates or complexes using covalent or noncovalent interactions to create novel multifunctional colloidal ingredients with new or improved properties. In this review, the formation, functionality, and potential applications of protein conjugates and complexes are discussed. In particular, the utilization of these colloidal ingredients to stabilize emulsions, control lipid digestion, encapsulate bioactive ingredients, modify textures, and form films is highlighted. Finally, future research needs in this area are briefly proposed. The rational design of protein complexes and conjugates may lead to the development of new functional ingredients that can be used to create more nutritious, sustainable, and healthy foods.", "generated_text": "The development of novel colloidal food ingredients through the formation of protein complexes and conjugates presents a promising avenue for enhancing food quality and functionality. This study explores the interactions between proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols to form stable complexes and conjugates that can be utilized as innovative colloidal ingredients. By leveraging the unique properties of these biopolymers, such as their ability to form gels, emulsions, and foams, the research aims to improve the texture, stability, and nutritional profile of food products. The synergistic effects of protein-polysaccharide and protein-polyphenol interactions are examined, highlighting their potential to enhance antioxidant activity and bioavailability of nutrients. Advanced characterization techniques are employed to elucidate the structural and functional properties of these complexes and conjugates. The findings suggest that these novel colloidal ingredients could play a significant role in the development of healthier and more sustainable food systems, meeting the growing consumer demand for functional foods.", "label": 1}
