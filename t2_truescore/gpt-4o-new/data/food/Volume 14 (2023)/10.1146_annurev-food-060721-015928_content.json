{"grounding": "Bacteriophages (or phages) represent one of the most persistent threats to food fermentations, particularly large-scale commercial dairy fermentations. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are used as starter cultures in dairy fermentations are well studied, and in recent years there have been significant advances in defining the driving forces of LAB\u2013phage coevolution. The means by which different starter bacterial species defend themselves against phage predation and the chromosomal or plasmid location of the genes encoding these defense mechanisms have dictated the technological approaches for the development of robust starter cultures. In this review, we highlight recent advances in defining phage\u2013host interactions and how phage resistance occurs in different bacterial species. Furthermore, we discuss how these insights continue to transform the dairy fermentation industry and how they also are anticipated to guide food fermentations involving plant-based alternatives in the future.", "generated_text": "The dairy industry has long grappled with the challenges posed by bacteriophages, which can disrupt fermentation processes by infecting and lysing bacterial cultures essential for product consistency and quality. This review examines recent advancements in understanding phage\u2013host interactions and the development of phage resistance strategies. Key innovations include the identification of phage-resistant bacterial strains and the application of genetic tools to enhance bacterial resilience. Conjugation, a natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer, has emerged as a promising method to disseminate phage resistance genes across bacterial populations. Additionally, the integration of phage monitoring systems and adaptive management practices has significantly reduced the incidence of phage-related disruptions in food fermentations. While challenges remain, these developments suggest that the dairy industry is moving towards a more controlled and predictable fermentation environment, potentially solving the longstanding issue of bacteriophage interference.", "label": 1}
