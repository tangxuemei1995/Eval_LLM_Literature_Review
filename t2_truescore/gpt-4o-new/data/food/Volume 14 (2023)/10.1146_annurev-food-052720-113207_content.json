{"grounding": "Microbubbles are largely unused in the food industry yet have promising capabilities as environmentally friendly cleaning and supporting agents within products and production lines due to their unique physical behaviors. Their small diameters increase their dispersion throughout liquid materials, promote reactivity because of their high specific surface area, enhance dissolution of gases into the surrounding liquid phase, and promote the generation of reactive chemical species. This article reviews techniques to generate microbubbles, their modes of action to enhance cleaning and disinfection, their contributions to functional and mechanical properties of food materials, and their use in supporting the growth of living organisms in hydroponics or bioreactors. The utility and diverse applications of microbubbles, combined with their low intrinsic ingredient cost, strongly encourage their increased adoption within the food industry in coming years.", "generated_text": "Microbubbles, characterized by their small size and high surface area, are emerging as a transformative technology in the food industry. This review explores their potential applications in enhancing sustainability, food safety, and food security. Microbubbles can improve the efficiency of food processing by reducing energy consumption and enhancing mass transfer processes, thus contributing to more sustainable practices. Their role in novel food production, such as in the creation of foams and emulsions, offers innovative solutions for texture and flavor enhancement. Additionally, microbubbles can aid in the removal of contaminants and pathogens, thereby improving food safety. The integration of microbubble technology in food systems presents a promising avenue for addressing global challenges in food security, offering a pathway to more resilient and efficient food production systems.", "label": 1}
