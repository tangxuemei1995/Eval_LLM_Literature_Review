{"grounding": "Lipids are a large group of essential nutrients in daily diets that provide energy and maintain various physiological functions. As the global population is rapidly expanding, there is an urgent need to enhance the production and quality of food lipids. The development of modern biotechnology allows the manipulation of oil production in plants and microorganisms and the improvement of the nutritional value of food lipids. Various metabolic engineering strategies have been exploited to increase oil production and produce value-added oils in traditional oil crops and other novel lipid sources (e.g., plant vegetative tissues, microalgae, and oleaginous microorganisms). Furthermore, natural lipid structures can be modified by lipases to prepare functional lipids, e.g., diacylglycerols, medium\u2013long\u2013medium-type structured triacylglycerols, human milk-fat substitutes, and structuralphospholipids, for specific nutritional demands. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in metabolic engineering of lipid production in plants and microorganisms, and the preparation of functional lipids via biocatalysis.", "generated_text": "The burgeoning field of biotechnology presents transformative opportunities for the development of future food lipids, addressing both nutritional and sustainability challenges. This review explores the potential of microbial lipids, which are produced through metabolic engineering, as a sustainable alternative to traditional lipid sources. Advances in enzymatic modification techniques allow for the precise tailoring of lipid structures, enhancing their functional and nutritional properties. Structural lipids, including phospholipids, are highlighted for their critical roles in food texture and health benefits, with biotechnological innovations enabling their efficient production and modification. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, such as optimizing production processes for scalability and cost-effectiveness, and ensuring regulatory compliance and consumer acceptance. The integration of biotechnology in lipid production promises to revolutionize the food industry, offering healthier and more sustainable lipid options. Future research should focus on overcoming current limitations and exploring novel applications of engineered lipids in food systems.", "label": 1}
