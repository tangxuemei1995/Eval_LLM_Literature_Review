{"grounding": "Ferritins represent a class of iron storage proteins with detoxification functions. The importance of these proteins is reflected by their wide distribution throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. Ferritin has two forms: holo and apo. Holo ferritin can act as an efficient and safe factor for iron supplementation, whereas apo ferritin is able to serve as a promising delivery nanovehicle for nutrients and bioactive compounds. So far, the dual functions of ferritins from animal and plant sources have been extensively studied in several fields, such as food, nutrition, medicine, and materials. This review outlines the structure of animal and plant ferritin, the iron supplementation function of holo ferritin, and the delivery function of apo ferritin. Recent advances in iron supplementation and nutrient encapsulation and delivery are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future developments for multifunctional applications of ferritins are discussed.", "generated_text": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous iron-storage protein, exhibits dual functionality in its holo and apo forms, offering promising applications in both iron supplementation and delivery systems. The holo form of ferritin, rich in iron, serves as an efficient vehicle for iron supplementation, addressing deficiencies in both animal and plant systems. This form ensures bioavailability and controlled release, enhancing nutritional outcomes. Conversely, the apo form, devoid of iron, presents a versatile platform for delivery systems. Its hollow structure allows encapsulation of various therapeutic agents, facilitating targeted delivery and controlled release. This dual functionality underscores ferritin's potential in biotechnological and medical applications, offering a sustainable approach to iron supplementation and innovative delivery solutions. This review explores the structural and functional dynamics of ferritin, highlighting its role in advancing nutritional and therapeutic strategies across diverse biological systems.", "label": 1}
