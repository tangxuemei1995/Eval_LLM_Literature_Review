{"grounding": "With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the development and implementation of digital food systems are becoming increasingly possible. There is tremendous interest in using different AI applications, such as machine learning models, natural language processing, and computer vision to improve food safety. Possible AI applications are broad and include, but are not limited to, (a) food safety risk prediction and monitoring as well as food safety optimization throughout the supply chain, (b) improved public health systems (e.g., by providing early warning of outbreaks and source attribution), and (c) detection, identification, and characterization of foodborne pathogens. However, AI technologies in food safety lag behind in commercial development because of obstacles such as limited data sharing and limited collaborative research and development efforts. Future actions should be directed toward applying data privacy protection methods, improving data standardization, and developing a collaborative ecosystem to drive innovations in AI applications to food safety.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into food safety protocols presents a transformative opportunity to enhance public health outcomes. This study explores the application of machine learning, computer vision, and predictive analytics in identifying and mitigating risks within the food supply chain. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast datasets to predict potential contamination events, while computer vision systems can automate the inspection of food products, ensuring compliance with safety standards. Predictive analytics further aids in forecasting supply chain disruptions, allowing for proactive measures to prevent foodborne illnesses. By leveraging these AI technologies, stakeholders can improve the detection of hazards, optimize resource allocation, and enhance traceability from farm to table. This research underscores the potential of AI to revolutionize food safety practices, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and secure food system. Future work should focus on integrating these technologies into existing frameworks to maximize their impact on public health.", "label": 1}
