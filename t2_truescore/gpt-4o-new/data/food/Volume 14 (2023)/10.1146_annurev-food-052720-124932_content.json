{"grounding": "Meats are rich in lipids and proteins, exposing them to rapid oxidative changes. Proteins are essential to the human diet, and changes in the structure and functional attributes can greatly influence the quality and nutritional value of meats. In this article, we review the molecular changes of proteins during processing, their impact on the nutritional value of fresh and processed meat, the digestibility and bioavailability of meat proteins, the risks associated with high meat intake, and the preventive strategies employed to mitigate these risks. This information provides new research directions to reduce or prevent oxidative processes that influence the quality and nutritional values of meat.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the molecular changes in meat proteins during various processing methods and their subsequent effects on quality and nutritional values. Processing techniques, such as heating, curing, and fermentation, induce structural modifications in proteins, influencing texture, flavor, and digestibility. These alterations can enhance or diminish the nutritional profile, impacting essential amino acid availability and bioactive compound retention. Additionally, certain processing methods may introduce health risks through the formation of harmful compounds. Understanding these molecular transformations is crucial for optimizing processing conditions to maintain or improve meat quality while minimizing potential health risks. This research provides insights into developing healthier and more nutritious meat products.", "label": 1}
