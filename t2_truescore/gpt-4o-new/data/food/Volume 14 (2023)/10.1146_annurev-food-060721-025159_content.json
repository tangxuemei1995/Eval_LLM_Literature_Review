{"grounding": "Edible nanoparticles are being developed for the oral delivery of nutrients to improve human health and well-being. Because of the extremely demanding conditions foods experience within the gastrointestinal tract, fundamental knowledge about the biological fate of encapsulated nutrients must be constantly revised. In this review, we first provide an overview of the fundamental absorption pathways of ingested foods and then discuss the evaluation models available to test and predict the biological fate of nutrient-loaded nanoparticles. Then, owing to their importance for human health, the impacts of nanoparticles on the gut microbiota are evaluated. Lastly, the limitations of current evaluation methods are highlighted and future research directions on the study and application of edible nanoparticles for the oral delivery of bioactive food compounds are discussed.", "generated_text": "This review explores the burgeoning field of food nanotechnology, focusing on the use of nanoparticles for oral delivery. It delves into the biological fate of these nanoparticles, examining their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes. The review highlights various evaluation models used to assess the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle-based delivery systems. Special attention is given to the interaction between nanoparticles and gut microbiota, considering how these interactions can influence both the functionality of the nanoparticles and the health of the host. By synthesizing current research, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential and challenges of using nanoparticles in food applications, offering insights into future directions for research and development in this innovative field.", "label": 1}
