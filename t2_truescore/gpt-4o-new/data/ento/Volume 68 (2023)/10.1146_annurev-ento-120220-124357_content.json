{"grounding": "Conservation biological control aims to enhance populations of natural enemies of insect pests in crop habitats, typically by intentional provision of flowering plants as food resources. Ideally, these flowering plants should be inherently attractive to natural enemies to ensure that they are frequently visited. We review the chemical ecology of floral resources in a conservation biological control context, with a focus on insect parasitoids. We highlight the role of floral volatiles as semiochemicals that attract parasitoids to the food resources. The discovery that nectar-inhabiting microbes can be hidden players in mediating parasitoid responses to flowering plants has highlighted the complexity of the interactions between plants and parasitoids. Furthermore, because food webs in agroecosystems do not generally stop at the third trophic level, we also consider responses of hyperparasitoids to floral resources. We thus provide an overview of floral compounds as semiochemicals from a multitrophic perspective, and we focus on the remaining questions that need to be addressed to move the field forward.", "generated_text": "The integration of chemical ecology into conservation biological control offers promising avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of parasitoids in agroecosystems. This study explores the multifaceted interactions between floral resources and parasitoids, focusing on the roles of floral volatiles and nectar-associated microorganisms. Floral volatiles serve as critical cues for parasitoids, aiding in host location and enhancing foraging efficiency. Additionally, nectar-associated microorganisms can influence the nutritional quality of floral resources, thereby affecting parasitoid fitness and longevity. The presence of hyperparasitoids, however, complicates these interactions by potentially disrupting parasitoid populations. Understanding the chemical ecology of these interactions is crucial for optimizing floral resource management in conservation biological control strategies. By selecting and managing floral resources that enhance parasitoid performance while minimizing hyperparasitoid impacts, agroecosystems can achieve more sustainable pest control. This research underscores the importance of a holistic approach to agroecosystem management, integrating chemical cues and microbial interactions to bolster the ecological services provided by parasitoids.", "label": 1}
