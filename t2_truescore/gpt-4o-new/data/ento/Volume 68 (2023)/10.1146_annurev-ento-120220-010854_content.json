{"grounding": "The economic and environmental threats posed by non-native forest insects are ever increasing with the continuing globalization of trade and travel; thus, the need for mitigation through effective biosecurity is greater than ever. However, despite decades of research and implementation of preborder, border, and postborder preventative measures, insect invasions continue to occur, with no evidence of saturation, and are even predicted to accelerate. In this article, we review biosecurity measures used to mitigate the arrival, establishment, spread, and impacts of non-native forest insects and possible impediments to the successful implementation of these measures. Biosecurity successes are likely under-recognized because they are difficult to detect and quantify, whereas failures are more evident in the continued establishment of additional non-native species. There are limitations in existing biosecurity systems at global and country scales (for example, inspecting all imports is impossible, no phytosanitary measures are perfect, knownunknowns cannot be regulated against, and noncompliance is an ongoing problem). Biosecurity should be a shared responsibility across countries, governments, stakeholders, and individuals.", "generated_text": "The increasing globalization of trade and travel has heightened the risk of biological invasions by non-native forest insects, posing significant threats to forest ecosystems and economies. This study examines the processes and patterns of these invasions, emphasizing the critical role of pathways in the introduction and spread of invasive species. We explore the effectiveness of current phytosanitary measures and surveillance strategies in mitigating these risks, highlighting both successes and challenges. Predictive models are discussed as tools for anticipating future invasions, yet their application is often hindered by data limitations and ecological complexities. The study identifies key pitfalls in current biosecurity practices, such as inadequate international cooperation and insufficient funding for eradication efforts. By synthesizing recent research, we propose a framework for enhancing forest insect biosecurity, advocating for integrated approaches that combine improved surveillance, rapid response mechanisms, and public awareness campaigns. This comprehensive analysis aims to inform policymakers and stakeholders, fostering more resilient forest management strategies against the backdrop of increasing biological invasions.", "label": 1}
