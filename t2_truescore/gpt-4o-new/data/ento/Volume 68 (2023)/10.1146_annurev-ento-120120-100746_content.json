{"grounding": "Insect eggs are exposed to a plethora of abiotic and biotic threats. Their survival depends on both an innate developmental program and genetically determined protective traits provided by the parents. In addition, there is increasing evidence that (a) parents adjust the egg phenotype to the actual needs, (b) eggs themselves respond to environmental challenges, and (c) egg-associated microbes actively shape the egg phenotype. This review focuses on the phenotypic plasticity of insect eggs and their capability to adjust themselves to their environment. We outline the ways in which the interaction between egg and environment is two-way, with the environment shaping the egg phenotype but also with insect eggs affecting their environment. Specifically, insect eggs affect plant defenses, host biology (in the case of parasitoid eggs), and insect oviposition behavior. We aim to emphasize that the insect egg, although it is a sessile life stage, actively responds to and interacts with its environment.", "generated_text": "Insect eggs exhibit remarkable adaptive plasticity, enabling them to respond effectively to diverse environmental challenges. This study explores the phenotypic plasticity of insect eggs, focusing on their developmental responses to microbial threats, plant interactions, and environmental stressors. By examining the intricate mechanisms underlying these adaptive responses, we highlight the role of phenotypic plasticity in enhancing egg survival and fitness. The research delves into the influence of microbial communities on egg development, revealing how symbiotic and pathogenic microbes can modulate egg phenotypes. Additionally, the interaction between insect eggs and host plants is scrutinized, emphasizing the defensive strategies employed by eggs to counteract plant defenses. Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and pollutants are also considered, illustrating their impact on egg development and survival. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of adaptive plasticity in insect eggs, providing insights into their evolutionary success and resilience in fluctuating environments.", "label": 1}
