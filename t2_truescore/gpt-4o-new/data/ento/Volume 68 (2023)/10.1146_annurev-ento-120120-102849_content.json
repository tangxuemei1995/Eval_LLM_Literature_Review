{"grounding": "The use of the functional feeding group\u2013damage type system for analyzing arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants has transformed our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages by providing data, analyses, and interpretation of the local, regional, and global patterns of a 420-Myr history. The early fossil record can be used to answer major questions about the oldest evidence for herbivory, the early emergence of herbivore associations on land plants, and later expansion on seed plants. The subsequent effects of the Permian\u2013Triassic ecological crisis on herbivore diversity, the resulting formation of biologically diverse herbivore communities on gymnosperms, and major shifts in herbivory ensuing from initial angiosperm diversification are additional issues that need to be addressed. Studies ofherbivory resulting from more recent transient spikes and longer-term climate trends provide important data that are applied to current global change and include herbivore community responses to latitude, altitude, and habitat. Ongoing paleoecological themes remaining to be addressed include the antiquity of modern interactions, differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms, and origins of modern tropical forests. The expansion of databases that include a multitude of specimens; improvements in sampling strategies; development of new analytical methods; and, importantly, the ability to address conceptually stimulating ecological and evolutionary questions have provided new impetus in this rapidly advancing field.", "generated_text": "The study of arthropod and pathogen damage on both fossil and modern plants provides critical insights into the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. This research examines the patterns and processes of plant damage across significant geological periods, including the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (K\u2013Pg) and Permian\u2013Triassic (P\u2013Tr) ecologic crises, as well as the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). By analyzing damage types and functional feeding groups, this study aims to elucidate the adaptive strategies of arthropods and pathogens in response to environmental changes on a continental scale. The fossil record reveals a complex history of plant-arthropod interactions, highlighting periods of increased herbivory and diversification of feeding strategies. These interactions are crucial for understanding the resilience and adaptability of plant communities during periods of ecological upheaval. The research also explores the continuity and transformation of these interactions from the fossil record to modern ecosystems, providing a comprehensive view of the evolutionary dynamics of herbivory. By integrating paleontological data with modern ecological studies, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the co-evolutionary processes that have shaped terrestrial ecosystems. The findings underscore the importance of historical perspectives in predicting future ecological responses to climate change and other anthropogenic pressures.", "label": 1}
