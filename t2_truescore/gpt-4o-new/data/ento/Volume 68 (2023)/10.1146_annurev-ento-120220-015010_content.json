{"grounding": "Bed bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) are an important group of obligate hematophagous urban insect pests. The global resurgence of bed bugs, involving the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius L., and the tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus (F.), over the past two decades is believed to be primarily due to the development of insecticide resistance, along with global travel and poor pest management, which have contributed to their spread. This review examines and synthesizes the literature on bed bug origins and their global spread and the literature on historical and contemporary control options. This includes bed bug prevention, detection and monitoring, nonchemical and chemical control methodologies (and their limitations), and potential future control options. Future research needs are highlighted, especially the factors behind the modern resurgence, the necessity of identifying differences between the two bed bug species relevant to control, and the need to improve insecticide test protocols and management strategies.", "generated_text": "The resurgence of bed bugs, particularly Cimex hemipterus and Cimex lectularius, has become a significant global concern, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of both historical and contemporary control strategies. This review examines the evolution of bed bug management, highlighting the transition from traditional chemical methods to integrated pest management approaches. Historically, chemical control dominated, with insecticides such as DDT and pyrethroids being extensively used. However, resistance development has prompted a shift towards nonchemical methods, including heat treatments, vacuuming, and encasements. Recent advancements emphasize the integration of chemical and nonchemical strategies, utilizing novel insecticides, biological control agents, and public education to enhance efficacy. The review underscores the importance of adaptive management practices in response to the dynamic challenges posed by bed bug infestations. By synthesizing historical insights with contemporary innovations, this study aims to inform effective, sustainable management practices to mitigate the impact of bed bugs globally.", "label": 1}
