{"grounding": "Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is not only an economic insect but also a model organism for life science research. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) disease is a major infectious disease in the world's sericulture industry. The cocoon loss caused by this disease accounts for more than 60% of the total loss caused by all silkworm diseases. To date, there has been no effective solution for preventing and treating this disease. The most effective measure is to breed disease-resistant varieties. The quickest way to breed disease-resistant varieties is to apply genetic modification. However, this requires that we obtain disease resistance genes and know the mechanism of disease resistance. Since the discovery of disease-resistant resources in 1989, scholars in the sericulture industry around the world have been inspired to search for resistance genes. In the past two decades, with the help of multi-omics technologies, screening of resistance genes, gene localization, protein modification, virus\u2013host interactions, etc., researchers have found some candidate genes that have been proposed to function at the cellular or individual level. Several disease-resistant varieties have been obtained and used in production through hybrid breeding, RNA interference, and genetic modification. This article summarizes and reviews the discovery of and research advances related to silkworm resistance to BmNPV. It is anticipated that the review will inspire scientific researchers to continue searching for disease resistance genes, clarify the molecular mechanism of silkworm disease resistance, and promote disease-resistant silkworm breeding.", "generated_text": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a crucial organism in sericulture, yet its susceptibility to the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) poses significant challenges to silk production. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying silkworm resistance to BmNPV, focusing on the identification and characterization of resistant genes, virus-host interactions, and the genetic basis of resistance. Through comprehensive genetic analysis, we have identified several candidate genes associated with enhanced resistance to BmNPV. These genes are involved in various biological pathways, including immune response modulation and cellular defense mechanisms. Advanced techniques such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been employed to pinpoint the precise locations of these resistance genes within the silkworm genome. Our findings reveal complex interactions between the virus and host, highlighting the role of specific genetic loci in conferring resistance. Furthermore, the study explores the potential for breeding silkworm strains with enhanced antiviral properties by leveraging these genetic insights. By integrating traditional breeding methods with modern genomic tools, we propose a strategic framework for developing silkworm lines that exhibit robust resistance to BmNPV. This research not only advances our understanding of virus-host dynamics in silkworms but also provides a foundation for sustainable sericulture practices through the development of resistant silkworm breeds. The implications of these findings extend to improving silk yield and quality, thereby benefiting the global silk industry.", "label": 1}
