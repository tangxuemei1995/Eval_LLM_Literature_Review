{"grounding": "Communication by substrate-borne mechanical waves is widespread in insects. The specifics of vibrational communication are related to heterogeneous natural substrates that strongly influence signal transmission. Insects generate vibrational signals primarily by tremulation, drumming, stridulation, and tymbalation, most commonly during sexual behavior but also in agonistic, social, and mutualistic as well as defense interactions and as part of foraging strategies. Vibrational signals are often part of multimodal communication. Sensilla and organs detecting substrate vibration show great diversity and primarily occur in insect legs to optimize sensitivity and directionality. In the natural environment, signals from heterospecifics, as well as social and enemy interactions within vibrational communication networks, influence signaling and behavioral strategies. The exploitation of substrate-borne vibrational signaling offers a promising application for behavioral manipulation in pest control.", "generated_text": "Insects exhibit a remarkable array of vibrational signaling systems, which play crucial roles in communication, mating, and survival. This study explores the functional diversity of these systems, focusing on biotremology and substrate-borne communication. By examining various signaling contexts, we highlight the evolutionary adaptations in vibrosensory mechanisms that enable insects to effectively transmit and receive signals through different substrates. The integration of vibrational signals with other modalities, such as visual and chemical cues, underscores the complexity of multimodal signaling strategies. Understanding these systems not only provides insights into the evolutionary biology of insects but also offers potential applications in pest management. By manipulating vibrational signals, novel, environmentally friendly pest control methods could be developed, reducing reliance on chemical pesticides and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.", "label": 0}
