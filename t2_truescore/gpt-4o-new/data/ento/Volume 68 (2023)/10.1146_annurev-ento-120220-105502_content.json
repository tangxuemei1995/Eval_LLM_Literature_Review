{"grounding": "Genetically engineered corn and cotton that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used to manage insect pests in the United States and elsewhere. In some cases, this has led to regional suppression of pest populations and pest eradication within the United States, and these outcomes were associated with reductions in conventional insecticides and increased profits for farmers. In other instances, pests evolved resistance to multiple Bt traits, compromising the capacity of Bt crops to manage pests and leading to increased feeding injury to crops in the field. Several aspects of pest biology and pest\u2013crop interactions were associated with cases where pests remained susceptible versus instances where pests evolved resistance. The viability of future transgenic traits can be improved by learning from these past outcomes. In particular, efforts should be made to delay resistance by increasing the prevalence of refuges and using integrated pest management.", "generated_text": "The adoption of Bt crops in the United States has significantly transformed the management of insect pests, particularly in corn and cotton production. Bt crops, genetically engineered to express Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, target key pest groups such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, reducing reliance on chemical insecticides and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This paper reviews the impact of Bt crops on pest populations, focusing on the effectiveness against major pests and the development of insect resistance. The implementation of insect resistance management (IRM) strategies, including the refuge strategy, is critical to prolonging the efficacy of Bt crops. The refuge strategy, which involves planting non-Bt crop areas to maintain susceptible pest populations, has been a cornerstone in delaying resistance. This review synthesizes current research on the successes and challenges of Bt crop deployment, emphasizing the need for integrated pest management approaches to ensure long-term sustainability and effectiveness in pest control.", "label": 1}
