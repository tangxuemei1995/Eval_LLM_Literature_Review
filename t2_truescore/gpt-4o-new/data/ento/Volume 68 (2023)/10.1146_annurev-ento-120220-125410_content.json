{"grounding": "Wood-boring pests (WBPs) pose an enormous threat to global forest ecosystems because their early stage infestations show no visible symptoms and can result in rapid and widespread infestations at later stages, leading to large-scale tree death. Therefore, early-stage WBP detection is crucial for prompt management response. Early detection of WBPs requires advanced and effective methods like remote sensing. This review summarizes the applications of various remote sensing sensors, platforms, and detection methods for monitoring WBP infestations. The current capabilities, gaps in capabilities, and future potential for the accurate and rapid detection of WBPs are highlighted.", "generated_text": "The early detection of forest wood-boring pests is crucial for effective forest management and conservation. This study explores the use of remote sensing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imagery, to monitor and identify infestations at an early stage. By integrating high-resolution data and advanced image processing techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of pest detection. Our findings suggest that remote sensing offers a promising tool for forest health monitoring, enabling proactive measures to mitigate the impact of these destructive insects on forest ecosystems.", "label": 1}
