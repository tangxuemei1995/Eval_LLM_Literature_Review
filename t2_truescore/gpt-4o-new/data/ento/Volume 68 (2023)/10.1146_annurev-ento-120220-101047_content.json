{"grounding": "Although it is generally more adaptive for insects to produce additional generations than to have longer life cycles, some insects produce one or fewer generations per year (univoltine or semivoltine life cycles, respectively). Some insects with the potential to produce multiple generations per year produce a univoltine life cycle in response to environmental conditions. Obligatory univoltine insects have a single long diapause or multiple diapauses in different seasons. Semivoltine insects have multiple diapauses in different years, a prolonged diapause for more than a year, or diapause controlled by a circannual rhythm. Diapause in these insects greatly varies among species both in the physiological mechanism and in the evolutionary background, and there is no general rule defining it. In this review, we survey the physiological control of univoltine and semivoltine insects\u2019 diapause and discuss the adaptive significance of the long life cycles. Although constraints such as slow development are sometimes responsible for these life cycles, the benefits of these life cycles can be explained by bet-hedging in many cases. We also discuss the effect of climate warming on these life cycles as a future area of research.", "generated_text": "Diapause, a critical adaptive strategy in insects, plays a pivotal role in the survival and reproduction of species with univoltine and semivoltine life cycles. This study explores the mechanisms and evolutionary significance of diapause in these life cycles, focusing on its role as a bet-hedging strategy in response to environmental variability. The circannual rhythm, a key component of diapause regulation, is examined in the context of seasonal adaptation, highlighting its importance in synchronizing life cycle events with favorable environmental conditions. The study also addresses the impact of climate warming on diapause, emphasizing the potential for shifts in phenotypic plasticity and the occurrence of prolonged diapause as adaptive responses. Through a synthesis of recent literature, this research underscores the complexity of diapause as a multifaceted trait influenced by genetic, environmental, and ecological factors. The findings suggest that understanding diapause dynamics is crucial for predicting the responses of insect populations to climate change, with implications for biodiversity conservation and pest management. This study contributes to the broader understanding of how organisms adapt to changing environments through life cycle strategies, offering insights into the resilience and adaptability of insect species.", "label": 1}
