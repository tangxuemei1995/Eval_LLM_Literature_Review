{"grounding": "The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), is a well-known agricultural pest in its native range, North and South America, and has become a major invasive pest around the globe in the past decade. In this review, we provide an overview to update what is known about S. frugiperda in its native geographic ranges. This is followed by discussion of studies from the invaded areas to gain insights into S. frugiperda's ecology, specifically its reproductive biology, host plant use, status of insecticide resistance alleles, and biocontrol methods in native and invasive regions. We show that reference to host strains is uninformative in the invasive populations because multidirectional introduction events likely underpinned its recent rapid spread. Given that recent genomic analyses show that FAW is much more diverse than was previously assumed, and natural selection forces likely differ geographically, region-specific approaches will be needed to control this global pest.", "generated_text": "Spodoptera frugiperda, commonly known as the fall armyworm, is a highly invasive pest with significant agricultural impact worldwide. This review synthesizes current knowledge on its ecology, evolution, and management strategies. Taxonomically, S. frugiperda is divided into two strains, corn and rice, which exhibit distinct host plant preferences and geographical distributions. Population genetics studies reveal complex patterns of gene flow and strain hybridization, complicating management efforts. The pest's adaptability is further enhanced by its diverse host plant use, allowing rapid colonization of new environments. Mate attraction mechanisms, including pheromone communication, play a crucial role in its reproductive success and are potential targets for control strategies. Insecticide resistance is a growing concern, necessitating integrated pest management approaches that combine chemical, biological, and cultural methods. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics and ecological interactions of S. frugiperda is essential for developing sustainable management options to mitigate its impact on global agriculture.", "label": 1}
