{"grounding": "I consider the development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, from late-1980s Gibbs sampling to present-day gradient-based methods and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes. In parallel, I show how these ideas have been implemented in successive generations of statistical software for Bayesian inference. These software packages have been instrumental in popularizing applied Bayesian modeling across a wide variety of scientific domains. They provide an invaluable service to applied statisticians in hiding the complexities of MCMC from the user while providing a convenient modeling language and tools to summarize the output from a Bayesian model. As research into new MCMC methods remains very active, it is likely that future generations of software will incorporate new methods to improve the user experience.", "generated_text": "Simulation-based Bayesian analysis has become a cornerstone in modern statistical inference, leveraging computational techniques to approximate complex posterior distributions. This paper explores the integration of various Bayesian computation methods, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques such as Gibbs sampling, and the use of statistical software like BUGS, Stan, and JAGS. Additionally, we examine the role of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) and Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) in enhancing computational efficiency. The application of these methods within graphical models is highlighted, demonstrating their capacity to handle high-dimensional data. Our analysis underscores the importance of these tools in advancing Bayesian inference, offering insights into their implementation and potential for future research developments.", "label": 1}
