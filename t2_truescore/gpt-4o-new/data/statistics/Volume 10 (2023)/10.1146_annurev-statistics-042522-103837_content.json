{"grounding": "When assessing causal effects, determining the target population to which the results are intended to generalize is a critical decision. Randomized and observational studies each have strengths and limitations for estimating causal effects in a target population. Estimates from randomized data may have internal validity but are often not representative of the target population. Observational data may better reflect the target population, and hence be more likely to have external validity, but are subject to potential bias due to unmeasured confounding. While much of the causal inference literature has focused on addressing internal validity bias, both internal and external validity are necessary for unbiased estimates in a target population. This article presents a framework for addressing external validity bias, including a synthesis of approaches for generalizability and transportability, and the assumptions they require, as well as tests for the heterogeneity of treatment effects and differences between study and target populations.", "generated_text": "This review explores the concepts of generalizability and transportability within the context of causal inference, focusing on their roles in assessing external validity and treatment effect heterogeneity. Generalizability refers to the extent to which findings from a study can be applied to broader populations, while transportability involves adapting causal inferences from one setting to another with potentially different conditions. The review synthesizes recent advancements in methodologies that address these challenges, highlighting the importance of understanding population differences and contextual factors. It discusses frameworks and statistical techniques that enhance the robustness of causal claims across diverse settings. By examining case studies and empirical applications, the review underscores the practical implications of these concepts in policy-making and clinical decision-making. The findings emphasize the need for rigorous design and analysis strategies to ensure that causal inferences are both valid and applicable across various contexts, ultimately contributing to more effective and equitable interventions.", "label": 1}
