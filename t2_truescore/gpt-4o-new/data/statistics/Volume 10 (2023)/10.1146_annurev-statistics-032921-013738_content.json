{"grounding": "We expose the statistical foundations of deep learning with the goal of facilitating conversation between the deep learning and statistics communities. We highlight core themes at the intersection; summarize key neural models, such as feedforward neural networks, sequential neural networks, and neural latent variable models; and link these ideas to their roots in probability and statistics. We also highlight research directions in deep learning where there are opportunities for statistical contributions.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a concise overview of deep learning through a statistical lens, emphasizing its foundational principles and applications in pattern recognition. It explores the architecture of neural networks, highlighting their role in modeling complex data patterns. The discussion includes optimization techniques crucial for training these models effectively. By integrating statistical insights, the paper aims to enhance understanding of deep learning's capabilities and limitations in various domains.", "label": 0}
