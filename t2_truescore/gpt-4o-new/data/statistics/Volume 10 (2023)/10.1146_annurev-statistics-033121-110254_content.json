{"grounding": "Rich data generating mechanisms are ubiquitous in this age of information and require complex statistical models to draw meaningful inference. While Bayesian analysis has seen enormous development in the last 30 years, benefitting from the impetus given by the successful application of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, the combination of big data and complex models conspire to produce significant challenges for the traditional MCMC algorithms. We review modern algorithmic developments addressing the latter and compare their performance using numerical experiments.", "generated_text": "Approximate methods for Bayesian computation, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Bayesian synthetic likelihood, offer efficient alternatives to traditional techniques. These methods address computational challenges by employing strategies like subsampling, coreset construction, and divide-and-conquer approaches. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are often integrated to enhance sampling efficiency. This paper reviews recent advancements in these approximate methods, highlighting their potential to handle complex models and large datasets, thereby broadening the applicability of Bayesian inference in various scientific domains.", "label": 0}
