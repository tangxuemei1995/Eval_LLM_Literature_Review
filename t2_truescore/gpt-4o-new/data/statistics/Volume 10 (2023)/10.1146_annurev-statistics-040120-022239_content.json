{"grounding": "This article reviews recent progress in high-dimensional bootstrap. We first review high-dimensional central limit theorems for distributions of sample mean vectors over the rectangles, bootstrap consistency results in high dimensions, and key techniques used to establish those results. We then review selected applications of high-dimensional bootstrap: construction of simultaneous confidence sets for high-dimensional vector parameters, multiple hypothesis testing via step-down, postselection inference, intersection bounds for partially identified parameters, and inference on best policies in policy evaluation. Finally, we also comment on a couple of future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of bootstrap methods in high-dimensional data settings, focusing on empirical and multiplier bootstrap techniques. We investigate their efficacy in addressing challenges posed by the high-dimensional central limit theorem, particularly in the context of multiple testing and simultaneous inference. Our findings demonstrate that these bootstrap approaches provide robust solutions for accurate inference in complex data environments, enhancing statistical power and control over Type I errors. This work contributes to the development of reliable statistical tools for high-dimensional data analysis.", "label": 1}
