{"grounding": "The Cox model is now 50 years old. The seminal paper of Sir David Cox has had an immeasurable impact on the analysis of censored survival data, with applications in many different disciplines. This work has also stimulated much additional research in diverse areas and led to important theoretical and practical advances. These include semiparametric models, nonparametric efficiency, and partial likelihood. In addition to quickly becoming the go-to method for estimating covariate effects, Cox regression has been extended to a vast number of complex data structures, to all of which the central idea of sampling from the set of individuals at risk at time t can be applied. In this article, we review the Cox paper and the evolution of the ideas surrounding it. We then highlight its extensions to competing risks, with attention to models based on cause-specific hazards, and to hazards associated with the subdistribution or cumulative incidence function. We discuss their relative merits and domains of application. The analysis of recurrent events is another major topic of discussion, including an introduction to martingales and complete intensity models as well as the more practical marginal rate models. We include several worked examples to illustrate the main ideas.", "generated_text": "The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced in 1972, has become a cornerstone in survival analysis, offering a robust framework for examining the relationship between covariates and the hazard function. Over the past fifty years, the model has been extensively developed and adapted to address various complexities in survival data. Key advancements include the handling of competing risks, where the model has been extended to accommodate situations where multiple types of events can occur, influencing the risk of the event of interest. The concept of independent censoring has been crucial in ensuring unbiased estimation of model parameters, while the introduction of time-dependent covariates has allowed for more dynamic modeling of hazard rates over time. The development of partial likelihood methods has facilitated efficient estimation and hypothesis testing without requiring the specification of the baseline hazard function. Additionally, the model has been adapted for recurrent events, enabling the analysis of repeated occurrences of the same event type. The integration of intensity and marginal rate models has further expanded the applicability of the Cox model in complex survival data scenarios. This review highlights these significant contributions and discusses ongoing challenges and future directions in the application of the Cox model in survival analysis.", "label": 1}
