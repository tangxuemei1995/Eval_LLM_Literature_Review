{"grounding": "For real-valued parameters, significance tests can be motivated as three-decision methods, in which we either assert the sign of the parameter above or below a specified null value, or say nothing either way. Tukey viewed this as a \u201csensible formulation\u201d of tests, unlike the widely taught null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) system that is today's default. We review the three-decision framework, collecting the substantial literature on how other statistical tools can be usefully motivated in this way. These tools include close Bayesian analogs of frequentist power calculations, p-values, confidence intervals, and multiple testing corrections. We also show how three-decision arguments can straightforwardly resolve some well-known difficulties in the interpretation and criticism of testing results. Explicit results are shown for simple conjugate analyses, but the methods discussed apply generally to real-valued parameters.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development and application of three-decision methods in statistical significance testing, offering a comprehensive framework that extends beyond traditional binary decision-making. By integrating decision theory principles, the proposed methods enhance the interpretability and robustness of statistical tests. The research emphasizes the importance of considering power and sensitivity analysis in the context of multiple testing scenarios, where conventional approaches often fall short. Through a series of simulations and real-world applications, the study demonstrates how three-decision methods can improve decision-making processes by incorporating an additional decision option, thus reducing the risk of Type I and Type II errors. This approach not only refines the understanding of statistical significance but also provides a more nuanced tool for researchers across various scientific disciplines, promoting more informed and reliable conclusions.", "label": 0}
