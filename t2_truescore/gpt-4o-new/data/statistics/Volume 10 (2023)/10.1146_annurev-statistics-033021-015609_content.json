{"grounding": "Several major global challenges, including climate change and water scarcity, warrant a scientific approach to generating solutions. Developing high quality and robust capacity in (bio)statistics is key to ensuring sound scientific solutions to these challenges, so collaboration between academic and research institutes should be high on university agendas. To strengthen capacity in the developing world, South\u2013North partnerships should be a priority. The ideas and examples of statistical capacity-building presented in this article are the result of several monthly online discussions between a mixedgroup of authors having international experience and formal links with Hasselt University in Belgium. The discussion focuses on statistical capacity-building through education (teaching), research, and societal impact. We have adopted an example-based approach, and in view of the background of the authors, the examples refer mainly to biostatistical capacity-building. Although many universities worldwide have already initiated university collaborations for development, we hope and believe that our ideas and concrete examples can serve as inspiration to further strengthen South\u2013North partnerships on statistical capacity-building.", "generated_text": "This study explores the critical role of biostatistics in enhancing statistical capacity-building across Africa, emphasizing sustainable development through education, consulting, and research. The paper highlights the importance of fostering human capital by developing robust educational programs and training initiatives tailored to the unique needs of African nations. It examines the potential of South\u2013North collaborations to bridge gaps in expertise and resources, facilitating knowledge transfer and capacity enhancement. The research underscores the necessity of integrating biostatistics into public health and policy-making processes, thereby improving data-driven decision-making. By analyzing current challenges and opportunities, the study proposes strategic frameworks for sustainable capacity-building, focusing on long-term partnerships and local empowerment. The findings suggest that a concerted effort in biostatistics education and consulting can significantly contribute to the continent's statistical infrastructure, ultimately supporting broader socio-economic development goals. This paper serves as a call to action for stakeholders to invest in and prioritize biostatistics as a cornerstone of Africa's statistical capacity-building efforts.", "label": 0}
