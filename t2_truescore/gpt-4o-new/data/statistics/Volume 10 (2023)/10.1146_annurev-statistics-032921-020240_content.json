{"grounding": "Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation are closely related tasks, with the former concerning in-sample goodness (or lack) of fit and the latter addressing predictive performance out-of-sample. We review the ubiquitous setting in which forecasts are cast in the form of quantiles or quantile-bounded prediction intervals. We distinguish unconditional calibration, which corresponds to classical coverage criteria, from the stronger notion of conditional calibration, as can be visualized in quantile reliability diagrams. Consistent scoring functions\u2014including, but not limited to, the widely used asymmetricpiecewise linear score or pinball loss\u2014provide for comparative assessment and ranking, and link to the coefficient of determination and skill scores. We illustrate the use of these tools on Engel's food expenditure data, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the diagnostic and evaluative methodologies for quantile forecasts, emphasizing the importance of calibration and reliability. We explore the use of coverage plots and reliability diagrams to assess the accuracy and consistency of quantile predictions. The research further investigates the application of Murphy diagrams as a tool for visualizing and comparing the performance of different quantile regression models. Scoring functions are employed to quantitatively evaluate the predictive accuracy, providing a comprehensive framework for model assessment. Our findings highlight the critical role of these diagnostic tools in enhancing the interpretability and reliability of quantile forecasts, offering valuable insights for practitioners in fields requiring precise probabilistic predictions. This work contributes to the advancement of robust statistical methods for quantile model evaluation, ensuring improved decision-making in various applied contexts.", "label": 1}
