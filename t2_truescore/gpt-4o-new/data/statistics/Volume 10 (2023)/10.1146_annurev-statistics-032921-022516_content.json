{"grounding": "Over the past few years, interest has increased in models defined on positive and negative integers. Several application areas lead to data that are differences between positive integers. Some important examples are price changes measured discretely in financial applications, pre- and posttreatment measurements of discrete outcomes in clinical trials, the difference in the number of goals in sports events, and differencing of count-valued time series. This review aims at bringing together a wide range of models that have appeared in the literature in recent decades. We provide an extensive review on discrete distributions defined for integer data and then consider univariate and multivariate time-series models, including the class of autoregressive models, stochastic processes, and ARCH-GARCH\u2013 (autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic\u2013generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic\u2013) type models.", "generated_text": "This study explores advanced models for integer data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models. We delve into the application of thinning operators, which are instrumental in constructing flexible models for count data. The Skellam distribution, a prominent model for differences between two independent Poisson-distributed variables, is examined for its utility in various statistical contexts. By integrating thinning operators with the Skellam distribution, we propose novel methodologies for modeling integer-valued time series. These models are particularly relevant for fields requiring precise count data analysis, such as epidemiology and finance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of these models to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of integer data analysis, offering significant improvements over traditional approaches. Future research directions include extending these models to multivariate contexts.", "label": 1}
