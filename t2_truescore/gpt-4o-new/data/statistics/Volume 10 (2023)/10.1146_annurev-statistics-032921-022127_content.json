{"grounding": "In the era of precision medicine, time-to-event outcomes such as time to death or progression are routinely collected, along with high-throughput covariates. These high-dimensional data defy classical survival regression models, which are either infeasible to fit or likely to incur low predictability due to overfitting. To overcome this, recent emphasis has been placed on developing novel approaches for feature selection and survival prognostication. In this article, we review various cutting-edge methods that handle survival outcome data with high-dimensional predictors, highlighting recent innovations in machine learning approaches for survival prediction. We cover the statistical intuitions and principles behind these methods and conclude with extensions to more complex settings, where competing events are observed. We exemplify these methods with applications to the Boston Lung Cancer Survival Cohort study, one of the largest cancer epidemiology cohorts investigating the complex mechanisms of lung cancer.", "generated_text": "High-dimensional survival analysis has emerged as a pivotal tool in precision medicine, offering insights into complex datasets characterized by numerous variables. This study explores advanced methodologies and applications of survival analysis in high-dimensional settings, emphasizing the integration of data science and machine learning techniques.
