{"grounding": "Clustering is the task of automatically gathering observations into homogeneous groups, where the number of groups is unknown. Through its basis in a statistical modeling framework, model-based clustering provides a principled and reproducible approach to clustering. In contrast to heuristic approaches, model-based clustering allows for robust approaches to parameter estimation and objective inference on the number of clusters, while providing a clustering solution that accounts for uncertainty in cluster membership. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the theory underpinning model-based clustering, to outline associated inferential approaches, and to highlight recent methodological developments that facilitate the use of model-based clustering for a broad array of data types. Since its emergence six decades ago, the literature on model-based clustering has grown rapidly, and as such, this review provides only a selection of the bibliography in this dynamic and impactful field.", "generated_text": "Model-based clustering is a statistical approach that leverages mixture models to identify subgroups within a dataset. This method assumes that data are generated from a mixture of underlying probability distributions, each representing a distinct cluster. The expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly employed to estimate the parameters of these mixture models, iteratively refining estimates to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. Bayesian inference further enhances model-based clustering by incorporating prior information, allowing for more robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Recent advancements in software development have facilitated the application of model-based clustering, providing user-friendly tools for practitioners to implement these sophisticated techniques. This paper reviews the theoretical underpinnings of model-based clustering, discusses the role of the EM algorithm and Bayesian methods, and highlights the capabilities of contemporary software solutions, underscoring their impact on diverse fields such as bioinformatics, marketing, and social sciences.", "label": 1}
