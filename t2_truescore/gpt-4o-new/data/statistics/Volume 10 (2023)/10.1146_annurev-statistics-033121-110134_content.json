{"grounding": "By linking conceptual theories with observed data, generative models can support reasoning in complex situations. They have come to play a central role both within and beyond statistics, providing the basis for power analysis in molecular biology, theory building in particle physics, and resource allocation in epidemiology, for example. We introduce the probabilistic and computational concepts underlying modern generative models and then analyze how they can be used to inform experimental design, iterative model refinement, goodness-of-fit evaluation, and agent based simulation. We emphasize a modular view of generative mechanisms and discuss how they can be flexibly recombined in new problem contexts. We provide practical illustrations throughout, and code for reproducing all examples is available at \nhttps://github.com/krisrs1128/generative_review\n. Finally, we observe how research in generative models is currently split across several islands of activity, and we highlight opportunities lying at disciplinary intersections.", "generated_text": "Generative models have emerged as a pivotal tool across various scientific disciplines, offering robust frameworks for simulating complex systems and enhancing decision-making processes. This interdisciplinary perspective explores the integration of generative models with agent-based models, emphasizing their utility in experimental design and simulation. The study delves into the application of particle filters for model evaluation, providing a comprehensive approach to assessing model performance and goodness-of-fit. By bridging theoretical constructs with practical applications, this research highlights the versatility of generative models in capturing dynamic phenomena and informing strategic decisions. The synthesis of methodologies from diverse fields underscores the potential of generative models to innovate experimental paradigms and optimize decision-making strategies. This work aims to foster a deeper understanding of the role of generative models in advancing scientific inquiry and their implications for future research directions.", "label": 1}
