{"grounding": "Surrogate markers are often used in clinical trials settings when obtaining a final outcome to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment requires a long wait, is expensive to obtain, or both. Formal definitions of surrogate marker quality resulting from a large variety of estimation approaches have been proposed over the years. I review this work, with a particular focus on approaches that use the causal inference paradigm, as these conceptualize a good marker as one in the causal pathway between the treatment and outcome. I also focus on efforts to evaluate the risk of a surrogate paradox, a damaging situation where the surrogate is positively associated with the outcome, and the causal effect of the treatment on the surrogate is in a helpful direction, but the ultimate causal effect of the treatment on the outcome is harmful. I then review some recent work in robust surrogate marker estimation and conclude with a discussion and suggestions for future research.", "generated_text": "Surrogate endpoints are increasingly utilized in clinical trials to expedite the evaluation of new therapies. These markers, which substitute for direct measures of clinical outcomes, offer potential advantages in terms of time and cost efficiency. However, their validity hinges on robust causal inference, as outlined by the Prentice criteria, which require that the surrogate fully capture the effect of the treatment on the true clinical endpoint. This study explores the complexities of establishing causal effectiveness and association, emphasizing the role of principal stratification in addressing these challenges. We also examine the surrogate paradox, where a surrogate marker may suggest a treatment effect that does not translate into actual clinical benefit. Through a comprehensive review of current methodologies and case studies, we highlight the importance of rigorous validation processes to ensure that surrogate endpoints reliably predict true clinical outcomes. Our findings underscore the need for continued refinement of statistical techniques to enhance the reliability of surrogate markers in clinical research.", "label": 1}
