{"grounding": "Deep neural network models have become ubiquitous in recent years and have been applied to nearly all areas of science, engineering, and industry. These models are particularly useful for data that have strong dependencies in space (e.g., images) and time (e.g., sequences). Indeed, deep models have also been extensively used by the statistical community to model spatial and spatiotemporal data through, for example, the use of multilevel Bayesian hierarchical models and deep Gaussian processes. In this review, we first present an overview of traditional statistical and machine learning perspectives for modeling spatial and spatiotemporal data, and then focus on a variety of hybrid models that have recently been developed for latent process, data, and parameter specifications. These hybrid models integrate statistical modeling ideas with deep neural network models in order to take advantage of the strengths of each modeling paradigm. We conclude by giving an overview of computational technologies that have proven useful for these hybrid models, and with a brief discussion on future research directions.", "generated_text": "The integration of statistical methodologies with deep learning frameworks has emerged as a powerful approach for analyzing spatial and spatiotemporal data. This paper explores the synergy between Bayesian hierarchical models and advanced neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability. We delve into the application of deep Gaussian processes, which offer a flexible, non-parametric alternative for capturing complex spatial dependencies. Additionally, the role of reinforcement learning in optimizing decision-making processes in dynamic environments is examined. A key focus is on the concept of warping, which allows for the transformation of input spaces to better capture underlying data structures. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to address challenges inherent in spatial and spatiotemporal data, such as non-stationarity and high dimensionality. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of these methods can significantly improve model performance, offering robust solutions for real-world applications in fields such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and geostatistics.", "label": 1}
