{"grounding": "Brine contains cations such as K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Li+, B3+, Rb2+, and Cs2+, as well as anions such as SO4\n2\u2212, Cl\u2212, HCO3\n\u2212, CO3\n2\u2212, NO3\n\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212, which are valuable elements. Brines are widely distributed in salt lakes in the world's three enormous plateaus and beyond and are classified into three types: sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines. Sulfate-type brine forms in salt lakes, whereas carbonate-type brine results from magmatic and hydrothermal activity. Chloride-type brine forms in deep basins due to the reduction and transformation of buried brine. Li in brine plays a critical role in clean energy transitions, and K in brine is important for potash production. Recently, new techniques for extracting Li from brine have been developed, and the large-scale, comprehensive development pattern of brines has formed the basis for a recycling economic model, which contributes to the efficient use of brines for potash and Li2CO3 development and CO2 emission reduction. This article reviews the genesis of brines and highlights new utilization techniques, trends, and sustainable development.", "generated_text": "Brine, a highly concentrated solution of salt in water, is a significant natural resource with diverse applications and origins. This study explores the genesis of brine, focusing on its formation in salt lakes and other natural reservoirs. The research delves into the processes that lead to the accumulation of valuable minerals such as potash and lithium, which are critical for various industrial applications. By examining the geochemical and hydrological conditions conducive to brine formation, the study provides insights into the sustainable extraction and utilization of these resources. Advanced processing techniques are evaluated for their efficiency in recovering valuable minerals while minimizing environmental impact. The comprehensive utilization of brine not only addresses the growing demand for minerals like lithium, essential for battery production, but also promotes sustainable practices in resource management. This research underscores the importance of innovative approaches in the processing and recovery of brine-derived resources, contributing to a more sustainable and resource-efficient future. The findings have global implications, offering strategies for optimizing brine resource recovery worldwide.", "label": 1}
