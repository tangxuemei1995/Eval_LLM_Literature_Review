{"grounding": "Urban overheating is the most documented phenomenon of climate change impacting humans. This article presents the most recent developments on the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating and the potential synergies with global climatic change. It analyses the latest qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of higher urban temperatures on buildings\u2019 energy supply and demand, heat-related mortality, morbidity and wellbeing, human productivity, survivability of low-income populations, and environmental quality of cities. It describes the state of the art on the development of innovative mitigation materials, advanced urban greenery, heat dissipation, and evaporative techniques as the main mitigation and adaptation technologies to offset the impact of urban overheating. It also analyses the current knowledge on the impact of each mitigation technology on energy, health, environmental quality, urban economy, and survivability. Finally, this article presents the main future challenges related to urban overheating and proposes a specific research agenda to alleviate and counterbalance its impact on human life.", "generated_text": "Urban overheating, characterized by the urban heat island effect, poses significant challenges to cities worldwide. This phenomenon results from the replacement of natural landscapes with impervious surfaces, leading to increased temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings. The magnitude of urban overheating varies with geographic location, urban design, and local climate conditions, exacerbating heat-related health risks, energy consumption, and environmental degradation. This study explores the characteristics and impacts of urban overheating, emphasizing the need for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Mitigation efforts, such as increasing urban greenery, enhancing building materials, and implementing reflective surfaces, are crucial in reducing heat accumulation. Adaptation strategies, including urban planning and public health interventions, aim to enhance resilience against heat stress. Future challenges involve addressing the compounded effects of climate change, population growth, and urbanization, necessitating integrated approaches to manage urban heat sustainably. This research underscores the urgency of developing comprehensive policies to safeguard urban populations and ecosystems from the adverse effects of overheating.", "label": 1}
