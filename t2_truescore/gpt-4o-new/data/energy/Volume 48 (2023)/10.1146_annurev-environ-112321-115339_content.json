{"grounding": "Polarization in the United States and around the world is of growing concern. Polarization is about more than just differences in opinions in society. It occurs when groups increasingly diverge in either actual or perceived differences in opinion and can involve both disagreements about issues and negative views of other groups. Since most environmental problems are collective action problems, polarization may interfere with the kinds of deliberation and collaborations needed for effective environmental decision-making. In this review, we examine how polarization influences environmental decision-making and what strategies could be useful for preventing or reducing the negative consequences of polarization. Evidence about the extent of polarization among citizens suggests the current situation may be less severe than is sometimes assumed. The coevolution of individual views, network interactions, and social media that cause polarization is complex and subject to rapid change. However, there are interventions that seem to be effective at reducing polarization.", "generated_text": "In an era marked by increasing opinion polarization, understanding its impact on environmental decision-making is crucial. This study explores the dynamics of perceived polarization and its influence on intergroup relations within the context of climate change. By examining how polarized opinions shape environmental policies and individual behaviors, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that either hinder or facilitate consensus-building. Our research employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, to assess the extent to which perceived polarization affects stakeholders' willingness to engage in cooperative decision-making. Findings suggest that heightened perceived polarization exacerbates intergroup tensions, leading to reduced collaboration and suboptimal environmental outcomes. However, the study also identifies potential pathways for mitigating these effects, emphasizing the role of communication strategies and inclusive dialogue in fostering constructive intergroup interactions. This research contributes to the broader discourse on environmental governance, offering insights into navigating decision-making processes amidst societal divisions.", "label": 1}
