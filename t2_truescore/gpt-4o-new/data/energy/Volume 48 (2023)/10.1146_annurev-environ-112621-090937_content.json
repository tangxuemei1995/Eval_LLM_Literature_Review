{"grounding": "Fungi comprise approximately 20% of all eukaryotic species and are connected to virtually all life forms on Earth. Yet, their diversity remains contentious, their distribution elusive, and their conservation neglected. We aim to flip this situation by synthesizing current knowledge. We present a revised estimate of 2\u20133 million fungal species with a \u201cbest estimate\u201d at 2.5 million. To name the unknown >90% of these by the end of this century, we propose recognition of species known only from DNA data and call for large-scale sampling campaigns. We present an updated global map of fungal richness, highlighting tropical and temperate ecoregions of high diversity. We call for further Red List assessments and enhanced management guidelines to aid fungal conservation. Given that fungi play an inseparable role in our lives and in all ecosystems, and considering the fascinating questions remaining to be answered, we argue that fungi constitute the next frontier of biodiversity research.", "generated_text": "Fungi, encompassing diverse groups such as Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, play crucial roles in ecosystems, yet their global diversity and distribution remain underexplored. This study synthesizes recent advancements in fungal biodiversity research, emphasizing the significance of early diverging fungi and endemic species. Utilizing innovative techniques like metabarcoding, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the fungus:plant ratio across various biomes, revealing patterns of fungal endemism and distribution. Our findings highlight the urgent need for conservation strategies, as many fungal species are not yet assessed for the IUCN Red List. We advocate for integrated conservation approaches, combining in situ and ex situ methods, to safeguard these vital organisms. This research underscores the importance of fungi in maintaining ecological balance and the necessity of expanding our understanding to inform global conservation efforts. By pushing the frontiers of biodiversity research, we aim to foster a deeper appreciation and protection of fungal diversity worldwide.", "label": 1}
