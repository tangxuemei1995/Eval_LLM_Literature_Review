{"grounding": "Addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development are the grand challenges for this century. This review assesses how sustainability and green jobs are changing in response to these formidable challenges, with a focus on energy transitions and responsible production and consumption. The energy transition to renewable sources will generate a net increase in employment, although some regions of the world may see net losses. Jobs in responsible consumption and production, motivated by changing consumer demand and savings from circular economy strategies, will increase the number of green and sustainability jobs. Since sustainability and green jobs require higher levels of creative problem-solving, more nonroutine activities, formal education, and on-the-job training than traditional jobs, more training will be necessary to meet skills demands in green and sustainability positions. We review how competency and capacity approaches to learning, credentialing, and on-the-job training have been employed to meet growing demand for sustainability and green jobs.", "generated_text": "The increasing global emphasis on environmental sustainability has led to a surge in demand for sustainability careers, often referred to as green jobs. This paper explores the evolving landscape of sustainability jobs, highlighting the critical transitions required to meet this demand. It examines the essential competencies needed for these roles, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary skills that blend environmental science, policy, and business acumen. The study also investigates current training programs and curricula, assessing their effectiveness in equipping individuals with the necessary skills for sustainability careers. By analyzing existing educational frameworks, the research identifies gaps and proposes enhancements to better align with industry needs. The findings suggest that a more integrated approach to education and training is crucial for preparing a workforce capable of addressing complex environmental challenges. This research contributes to the discourse on sustainable development by providing insights into the alignment of educational pathways with the evolving demands of the green job market.", "label": 1}
