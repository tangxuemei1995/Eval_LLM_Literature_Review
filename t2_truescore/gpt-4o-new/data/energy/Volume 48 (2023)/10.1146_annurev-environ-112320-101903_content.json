{"grounding": "Coastal systems are sensitive to direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Approximately 90% of all coastal areas will be affected by climate change to varying degrees. Nearly half of the world's major cities are located within 50 km of a coast, and coastal population densities are 2.6 times greater than those of inland areas, with a steep rise over the years. While coastal critical infrastructure is expanding, more social and physical systems are increasingly exposed to climate-induced hazards. The interconnectedness and interdependencies of critical infrastructure systems increase their systemic instability and fragility, resulting in greater dynamic risk and cascading impacts. Coastal critical infrastructure systems on several continents are at risk from the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events. Therefore, it is necessary to build and run climate-resilient infrastructure that is planned, designed, implemented, and operated to predict, be prepared for, and adapt to changing climatic circumstances. This review provides an up-to-date, objective, and critical assessment based on the literature to help determine what is known and what needs the future attention of researchers.", "generated_text": "The increasing impacts of climate change pose significant risks to coastal critical infrastructure, which is essential for economic stability, public safety, and environmental health. This study examines the vulnerabilities of such infrastructure to climate-induced hazards, including sea-level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events. By analyzing current resilience strategies, the research identifies gaps in existing frameworks that fail to address the cascading nature of these hazards. The study employs a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating climate science, engineering, and socio-economic analysis to assess the potential for cascading failures that can amplify the impacts of initial disruptions. Findings suggest that traditional risk management practices are insufficient in the face of complex, interconnected threats posed by climate change. The research advocates for a paradigm shift towards adaptive, resilient infrastructure planning that incorporates dynamic risk assessments and cross-sector collaboration. By enhancing the resilience of coastal critical infrastructure, communities can better withstand and recover from climate-related disruptions, thereby safeguarding essential services and reducing long-term economic and social costs. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on climate resilience and offers actionable insights for policymakers and infrastructure planners.", "label": 1}
