{"grounding": "Groundwater deterioration due to enrichment with contaminants of either geogenic or anthropogenic origin has adversely affected safe water supply for drinking and irrigation, with pervasive impacts on human health and ecosystem functions. However, the spatiotemporal evolution and public health effects of groundwater quality remain unclarified, posing a grand challenge for the safe and sustainable supply of global groundwater resources. This article provides a state-of-the-art review of the complexity and dynamics of groundwater quality, as well as the impacts of various groundwater substances on human health. In particular, knowledge is growing about the health impacts of key substances ranging from nutritional elements (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+) to pollutants (e.g., heavy metals/metalloids, persistent organic pollutants, and emerging contaminants) and, further, to pathogenic microorganisms to which the human body can be exposed through multiple patterns of groundwater use. Proliferating concerns at the same time call for enhancing science-based governance directives, economic policies, and management strategies coordinating groundwater quality. We propose that safeguarding groundwater-dependent public health needs concerted efforts in source control, cross-scale rehabilitation, and social hydrology-based groundwater governance.", "generated_text": "Groundwater serves as a critical source of drinking water for a significant portion of the global population, yet its quality is increasingly threatened by both geogenic and emerging contaminants. This study examines the impact of key substances such as arsenic, fluoride, and nitrates, alongside emerging contaminants like pharmaceuticals and personal care products, on human health. The research highlights the pathways through which these contaminants enter groundwater systems and their subsequent effects on public health, including potential chronic diseases and acute health issues. By integrating data from recent studies, this paper underscores the urgent need for sustainable groundwater management practices that prioritize the protection of water quality. It also discusses the role of advanced monitoring technologies and regulatory frameworks in mitigating contamination risks. The findings emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing groundwater quality challenges, advocating for policies that balance human health needs with environmental sustainability. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between groundwater quality and public health, offering insights for future policy development and management strategies.", "label": 1}
