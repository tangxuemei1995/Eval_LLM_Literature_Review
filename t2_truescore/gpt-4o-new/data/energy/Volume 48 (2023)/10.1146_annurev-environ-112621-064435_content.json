{"grounding": "The nuclear waste management and disposal program in the United States for highly radioactive waste (spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste) has thus far been unsuccessful despite an effort that spans 40 years and the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars. Yet, today, there is considerable interest in and promotion of advanced reactor technologies, such as small modular reactors that will expand spent fuel inventories that may very well remain at the site where they are generated, awaiting permanent, geologic disposal. We examine critical elements of the US legal and regulatory framework that have impeded the success of the US program. We make recommendations on steps that are required for a successful nuclear waste program, particularly considering the development of advanced nuclear reactors and their fuel cycles.", "generated_text": "This study examines the current US legal and regulatory framework governing nuclear waste management, focusing on both existing and future reactors and their associated fuel cycles. It highlights the complexities of managing spent nuclear fuel, emphasizing the importance of retrievability and long-term storage solutions. The analysis delves into the Standard Contract's role in shaping obligations and responsibilities for nuclear waste disposal. Additionally, the paper explores regulatory adaptations necessary to accommodate advanced reactor technologies and innovative fuel cycles. By evaluating existing policies and identifying potential gaps, this research aims to inform future legislative and regulatory developments, ensuring safe and efficient nuclear waste management. The findings underscore the need for a dynamic framework that can adapt to technological advancements while maintaining stringent safety and environmental standards.", "label": 1}
