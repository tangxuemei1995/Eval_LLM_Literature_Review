{"grounding": "Getting to net-zero-carbon cities while advancing well-being (W), health (H), social equity (E), and climate resilience (R) (referred to as the WHER outcomes) is critical for local and global sustainability. However, science is nascent on the linkages between zero-carbon pathways and WHER outcomes. This article presents a transboundary urban metabolism framework, rooted in seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems, to connect urban decarbonization strategies with WHER outcomes. Applying the framework along with a literature review, we find the evidence for co-beneficial decarbonization to be strong for health; limited for well-being; uncertain for resilience; and requiring intentional design to advance equity, including distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects. We describe the evidence base, identify key knowledge gaps, and delineate broad parameters of a new urban nexus science to enable zero-carbon urban transitions with WHER co-benefits. We highlight the need for fine-scale data encompassing all seven sectors across scales, along with multiple and multiscale climate risks, accompanied by next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate nexus linkages between decarbonization efforts and their co-benefits for health, climate resilience, and equity within urban environments. By examining urban metabolism and its alignment with sustainable development goals (SDGs), the research highlights the potential for integrated strategies that simultaneously address carbon reduction and enhance urban well-being. The analysis draws on case studies from diverse urban settings, illustrating how targeted interventions can yield multiple benefits, including improved public health outcomes, increased social equity, and strengthened resilience against climate impacts. The findings underscore the importance of a holistic approach to urban planning that prioritizes cross-sectoral collaboration and stakeholder engagement. By leveraging synergies between environmental and social objectives, cities can accelerate their transition toward zero-carbon futures while ensuring that the benefits are equitably distributed across all communities. This research contributes to the growing body of literature advocating for comprehensive urban strategies that align with global sustainability targets, offering a roadmap for policymakers and practitioners aiming to foster sustainable urban transformations.", "label": 1}
