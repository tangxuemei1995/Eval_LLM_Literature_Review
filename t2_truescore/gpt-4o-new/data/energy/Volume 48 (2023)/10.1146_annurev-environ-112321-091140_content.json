{"grounding": "Renewable electricity generation will need to be rapidly scaled to address climate change and other environmental challenges. Doing so effectively will require an understanding of resource availability. We review estimates for renewable electricity of the global technical potential, defined as the amount of electricity that could be produced with current technologies when accounting for geographical and technical limitations as well as conversion efficiencies; economic potential, which also includes cost; and feasible potential, which accounts for societal and environmental constraints. We consider utility-scale and rooftop solar photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind, hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean (wave, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion, and salinity gradient energy) technologies. We find that the reported technical potential for each energy resource ranges over several orders of magnitude across and often within technologies. Therefore, we also discuss the main factors explaining why authors find such different results. According to this review and on the basis of the most robust studies, we find that technical potentials for utility-scale solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore wind, and offshore wind are above 100 PWh/year. Hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean thermal energy conversion have technical potentials above 10 PWh/year. Rooftop solar photovoltaic, wave, and tidal have technical potentials above 1 PWh/year. Salinity gradient has a technical potential above 0.1 PWh/year. The literature assessing the global economic potential of renewables, which considers the cost of each renewable resource, shows that the economic potential is higher than current and near-future electricity demand. Fewer studies have calculated the global feasible potential, which considers societal and environmental constraints. While these ranges are useful for assessing the magnitude of available energy sources, they may omit challenges for large-scale renewable portfolios.", "generated_text": "The transition to renewable energy sources is pivotal in addressing global energy demands and mitigating climate change. This study comprehensively evaluates the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity, focusing on solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. By integrating advanced modeling techniques and extensive datasets, we assess the capacity of these technologies to meet future energy needs. The technical potential is quantified by considering the maximum possible energy output based on available resources and current technological capabilities. Economic potential is evaluated by analyzing cost-competitiveness with conventional energy sources, factoring in technological advancements and market dynamics. Feasible potential is determined by incorporating socio-political, environmental, and infrastructural constraints that may limit deployment.\n\nOur findings reveal that solar PV and wind energy exhibit the highest technical potential due to their widespread availability and rapid technological advancements. CSP, while less widespread, offers significant potential in regions with high solar insolation. Hydropower remains a crucial component, particularly in regions with abundant water resources, though its expansion is limited by environmental and social considerations. Geothermal energy presents substantial potential in tectonically active regions, while ocean energy, though nascent, holds promise for future development.\n\nEconomically, solar PV and onshore wind are increasingly competitive, with costs continuing to decline. However, the feasible potential is often constrained by land use, regulatory frameworks, and grid integration challenges. The study underscores the importance of policy interventions, technological innovation, and international cooperation to unlock the full potential of renewables. By providing a detailed analysis of the global renewable electricity landscape, this research offers valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers aiming to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future.", "label": 1}
