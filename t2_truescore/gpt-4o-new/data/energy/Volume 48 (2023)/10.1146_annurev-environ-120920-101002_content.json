{"grounding": "There are large disparities in access to green technologies between countries and among different demographic groups within countries. Unless carefully managed, the energy transition risks exacerbating some of these inequalities, for example, by burdening those who are excluded from efficient new technologies with the costs of maintaining legacy infrastructure. The energy transition will create new interdependencies between sectors\u2014for example, between buildings, the power sector, and transportation\u2014requiring integrated design of policies and infrastructure in different sectors. The equitable adoption of new technologies is contingent on broadening access to enabling technologies such as the Internet and payment systems. Decisionmakers must focus on new technologies that remove disparities in access to services but do not replicate current inefficiencies in providing those services (e.g., equitable access to mobility\u2014not only to motorized personal vehicles). Data at higher resolutions and with broader coverage are needed to design equitable technology deployment strategies and evaluate their success.", "generated_text": "The transition to green technologies presents both opportunities and challenges for achieving environmental justice. This study explores the implications of electrification, modal shift, and sustainable buildings on distributional justice within the framework of a just transition. Electrification, while reducing carbon emissions, may exacerbate existing inequalities if access to clean energy is unevenly distributed. Similarly, modal shifts in transportation, such as increased reliance on public transit, require careful planning to ensure equitable access across diverse communities. Sustainable building practices offer significant potential for reducing environmental impact, yet they must be implemented in ways that do not disproportionately burden marginalized groups. This research highlights the need for policies that prioritize equitable distribution of benefits and burdens associated with green technologies. By integrating principles of distributional justice, policymakers can ensure that the transition to a sustainable future is inclusive and fair, thereby advancing both environmental and social objectives.", "label": 1}
