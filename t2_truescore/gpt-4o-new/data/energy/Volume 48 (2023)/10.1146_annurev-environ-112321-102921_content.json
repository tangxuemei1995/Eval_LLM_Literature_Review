{"grounding": "Buildings are key in supporting human activities and well-being by providing shelter and other important services to their users. Buildings are, however, also responsible for major energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during their life cycle. Improving the quality of services provided by buildings while reaching low energy demand (LED) levels is crucial for climate and sustainability targets. Building sector models have become essential tools for decision support on strategies to reduce energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet current models have significant limitations in their ability to assess the transformations required for LED. We review building sector models ranging from the subnational to the global scale to identify best practices and critical gaps in representing transformations toward LED futures. We focus on three key dimensions of intervention (socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological), three megatrends (digitalization, sharing economy, and circular economy), and decent living standards. This review recommends the model developments needed to better assess LED transformations in buildings and support decision-making toward sustainability targets.", "generated_text": "The transition towards low energy demand futures in buildings is pivotal for climate change mitigation, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of current trends and future scenarios. This study examines the state of research on energy demand transformation in residential and commercial buildings, highlighting the role of megatrends such as urbanization, technological advancements, and policy shifts. By analyzing existing models and scenarios, we identify key drivers and barriers to achieving energy-efficient buildings that support decent living standards. The research underscores the importance of integrating socio-economic factors and technological innovations in scenario development to accurately predict future energy demands. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address the complex interactions between energy systems and societal changes. Our findings suggest that while significant progress has been made, there are critical research gaps in understanding the long-term impacts of energy policies and the potential of emerging technologies. Addressing these gaps is essential for developing robust strategies to reduce energy consumption and enhance sustainability in the built environment.", "label": 1}
