{"grounding": "After tentative efforts during the 1990s, the past two decades have seen a rapid increase in the number of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation policies, initially in a few frontrunner countries and more recently spreading globally. Over the same period, GHG emissions have continued to rise, but the rate of growth has recently slowed. Are mitigation policies having an effect? To explore this question, we review and synthesize the empirical literature on the impact of mitigation policies on three key outcomes: GHG emissions, proximate emission drivers like energy intensity and land use, and low-carbon technologies. Our key contribution to the available literature lies in establishing an empirically based track record of climate action, focusing on methodologically sound ex post studies. We find that mitigation policies have had a discernible impact on emissions and multiple emission drivers. Most notably, they have led to reductions in energy use, declines in deforestation rates, as well as cost reductions and capacity expansions of low-carbon technologies in many instances. Furthermore, implemented policies to date are likely to have reduced global emissions by several billion tons of CO2eq per year compared to a world without mitigation policies. In the light of current ambitions on climate action falling short of what is required to limit global warming to the Paris temperature goals, we conclude that there is ample evidence of policy instruments with demonstrable impacts, but that efforts need to be hugely strengthened and expanded. Also, far more attention is required to policy monitoring, evaluation, and learning so as to strengthen the basis for future policy and the attribution of its impacts.", "generated_text": "Over the past thirty years, climate mitigation policies have evolved significantly, driven by the urgent need to address global climate change. This literature review critically examines the effectiveness of various policy instruments implemented worldwide to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The study categorizes these instruments into regulatory approaches, market-based mechanisms, and voluntary agreements, assessing their impact on emission abatement and overall policy effectiveness. Regulatory approaches, such as emission standards and mandates, have shown mixed results, often limited by enforcement challenges and economic trade-offs. Market-based mechanisms, including carbon pricing and cap-and-trade systems, have gained prominence for their cost-effectiveness and flexibility, yet their success is contingent on robust market design and political support. Voluntary agreements, while fostering stakeholder engagement, frequently suffer from insufficient ambition and lack of accountability. The review highlights that the integration of multiple policy instruments often yields better outcomes, leveraging the strengths of each approach while mitigating their weaknesses. Furthermore, the analysis underscores the importance of adaptive policy frameworks that can respond to evolving scientific insights and socio-economic contexts. Despite notable progress in some regions, the global mitigation efforts remain insufficient to meet the targets set by international agreements such as the Paris Accord. The study calls for enhanced international cooperation, increased investment in clean technologies, and the alignment of climate policies with broader socio-economic goals to achieve meaningful emission reductions. By synthesizing three decades of policy experiences, this review provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to design more effective climate mitigation strategies in the future.", "label": 1}
