{"grounding": "Global agreement on 30\u00d730 means an unprecedented last push to define how much nature will be left on the planet. At the same time that space for nature is being defined, climate change will be moving nature around. Species are now on the move to track climate change both on land and in the oceans, a process that is accelerating under dramatic new extreme events. This is an opportune time to review conservation recommendations made early in the millennium, to see how many have been taken on board over the past 20 years, and how much is left to be done to adapt to climate change as conservation pushes toward 30\u00d730. The history of Climate Change\u2013Integrated Conservation Strategies begins with two papers published by a group of prominent climate change biologists in 2002. The importance of including adaptation to climate change in conservation was underscored by the first estimates of extinction risk due to climate change in 2004. Subsequent literature has developed concepts such as velocity of climate change and assisted migration. Regional modeling of biodiversity change, expanding protected areas to facilitate species range movements, and managing productive landscapes to facilitate species movements are all now considered \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for conservation planning for climate change. Regional coordination of conservation efforts to ensure that species on the move are managed for climate change consistently across their range, on the other hand, is under-represented in literature and practice. Improving both theory and practice of regional coordination for climate change is an important priority for conservation now and in the future. Conservation for climate change has focused mostly on warming scenarios, but failure to act on climate change emissions reduction means that meeting Paris Agreement targets will almost certainly have to include both warming past those targets and subsequent cooling back to the target. Managing this double transition is a second critical point of emphasis for climate change biology as the world moves to 30\u00d730.", "generated_text": "The 30\u00d730 initiative, which aims to conserve 30% of the planet's land and oceans by 2030, represents a pivotal strategy in addressing the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change. This paper explores the historical development and future potential of climate change-integrated conservation strategies within the framework of the 30\u00d730 target. The initiative is rooted in the recognition that traditional conservation approaches must evolve to incorporate the dynamic nature of ecosystems under climate change, particularly as species distributions shift and new ecological interactions emerge. \n\nThe integration of climate change considerations into conservation planning is essential for enhancing the resilience of ecosystems and the services they provide. This involves systematic conservation planning that accounts for climate change biology, including the identification of climate refugia and corridors that facilitate species movement. The paper reviews the progress made in regional coordination efforts, highlighting successful case studies where cross-border collaboration has enhanced conservation outcomes. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing the 30\u00d730 target, emphasizing the need for adaptive management strategies that are informed by the latest scientific research. It underscores the importance of incorporating indigenous knowledge and local stakeholder engagement in conservation planning to ensure that strategies are culturally appropriate and socially equitable. \n\nThe future of climate change-integrated conservation strategies lies in the ability to leverage technological advancements, such as remote sensing and artificial intelligence, to improve monitoring and decision-making processes. The paper concludes by advocating for a holistic approach that aligns conservation efforts with broader sustainable development goals, ensuring that the 30\u00d730 target contributes to both biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. By fostering a global commitment to these integrated strategies, the 30\u00d730 initiative has the potential to transform conservation practices and secure a sustainable future for both people and nature.", "label": 1}
