{"grounding": "Modifications to land can serve to jointly reduce risks of floods and droughts to people and to ecosystems. Whether land modifications are implemented will depend on the willingness and ability of a diversity of actors. This article reviews the state of knowledge on land modification use in areas exposed to dual hydrologic risks and the land owners, managers, and users who directly make decisions about action on lands they control. The review presents a typology of land modifications and explains how land modifications interact with the hydrological cycle to reduce risks. It then addresses the roles and perspectives of the land owners, managers, and users undertaking land modifications, summarizing theories explaining motivations for, as well as barriers to and enablers of, land modification implementation. The analysis reveals geographical differences in narratives on land modifications as well as knowledge gaps regarding variation across actors and types of land modifications.", "generated_text": "The increasing frequency of concurrent flood and drought events poses significant challenges to land users, necessitating innovative adaptation strategies. This study explores the potential of land modifications as a dual-purpose solution to mitigate these risks. By examining the motivations and perspectives of land users, we identify key factors influencing the adoption of land modification practices. Our research highlights the role of adaptive land management techniques, such as contour farming, wetland restoration, and agroforestry, in enhancing resilience to climate variability. Through a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and interviews with stakeholders, we assess the perceived effectiveness and feasibility of these strategies. Findings suggest that while land users recognize the benefits of land modifications, barriers such as financial constraints and lack of technical knowledge hinder widespread implementation. This study underscores the need for policy support and capacity-building initiatives to facilitate the integration of land modifications into broader climate change adaptation frameworks.", "label": 1}
