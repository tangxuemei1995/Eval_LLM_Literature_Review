{"grounding": "Energy equity and justice have become priority considerations for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars alike. To ensure that energy equity is incorporated into actual decisions and analysis, it is necessary to design, use, and continually improve energy equity metrics. In this article, we review the literature and practices surrounding such metrics. We present a working definition for energy justice and equity, and connect them to both criteria for and frameworks of metrics. We then present a large sampling of energy equity metrics, including those focused on vulnerability, wealth creation, energy poverty, life cycle, and comparative country-level dynamics.We conclude with a discussion of the limitations, gaps, and trade-offs associated with these various metrics and their interactions thereof.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development and application of metrics for decision-making in energy justice, focusing on energy equity. By integrating concepts of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice, the research aims to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating energy policies and projects. The proposed metrics are designed to assess the equitable distribution of energy resources, ensure inclusive decision-making processes, and recognize diverse community needs and identities. Through case studies and empirical analysis, the study demonstrates how these metrics can guide policymakers in creating more just and sustainable energy systems. The findings highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach to energy justice, promoting fairness and inclusivity in the transition to renewable energy sources.", "label": 0}
