{"grounding": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) impact lakes, estuaries, and freshwater reservoirs worldwide. The duration, severity, and spread of CyanoHABs have markedly increased over the past decades and will likely continue to increase. This article addresses the universal phenomena of cyanobacterial blooms occurring in many freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Based on analysis of ecophysiological traits of bloom-forming cyanobacteria and their interactions with environmental processes, we summarize and decipher the driving forces leading to the initiation, outbreak, and persistence of the blooms. Due to the coupling effects of eutrophication, rising CO2 levels and global warming, a multidisciplinary joint research approach is critical for better understanding the CyanoHAB phenomenon and its prediction, remediation, and prevention. There is an urgent need to evaluate and guide proper use of bloom control techniques at large scales, using science-based and environmentally friendly approaches.", "generated_text": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) pose significant ecological and public health risks in freshwater systems worldwide. These blooms are exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication, which enhance the growth conditions for cyanobacteria. Key biological traits, such as buoyancy regulation, nitrogen fixation, and toxin production, enable cyanobacteria to dominate aquatic ecosystems. Cyanotoxins, produced by these blooms, threaten water quality and aquatic life, posing risks to human health through water consumption and recreational exposure. Understanding the mechanisms driving HCBs is crucial for developing effective control strategies. Current approaches include nutrient management, biological control, and advanced water treatment technologies. However, the complexity of HCB dynamics necessitates integrated management strategies that consider local environmental conditions and socio-economic factors. This review synthesizes recent advances in HCB research, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary efforts to mitigate their impacts.", "label": 1}
