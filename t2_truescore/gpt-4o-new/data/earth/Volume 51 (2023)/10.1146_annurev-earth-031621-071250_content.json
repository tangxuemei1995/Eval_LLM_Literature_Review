{"grounding": "The early to mid-Paleoproterozoic Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) is ostensibly the largest magnitude (approximately +5 to +30\u2030), longest duration (ca. 130\u2013250 million years) positive carbon isotope excursion measured in carbonate rocks in Earth history. The LJE has been attributed to large nutrient fluxes, an increase in the size of the biosphere, a reorganization of the global carbon cycle, and oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, significant debate remains about its genesis, synchroneity, global-versus-local extent, and role in atmospheric oxygenation. Here we review existing models and mechanisms suggested for the LJE and analyze a compilation of \u223c9,400 \u03b413Ccarb and associated contextual data. These data call into question the interpretation of the LJE as a globally synchronous carbon isotope excursion and suggest that any model for the LJE must account for both the absence of a clearly defined initiation and termination of the excursion and a facies-dependent expression of 13C-enrichment.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) continues to challenge current understandings of the carbon cycle.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tUnderstanding this excursion is critical for reconstructing biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric oxygenation through Earth history.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSome evidence indicates local rather than global changes in \u03b413CDIC and raises the possibility of asynchronous, local excursions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tResolving whether the LJE was globally synchronous or asynchronous is essential for discriminating between different models.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion represents one of the most significant carbon isotope excursions in Earth's history, occurring during the Paleoproterozoic era, approximately 2.2 to 2.1 billion years ago. This study aims to deconstruct the complex interplay of geological and biological processes that contributed to this prolonged positive carbon isotope excursion, which coincides with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). By synthesizing recent geochemical data and employing advanced isotopic modeling, we explore the potential mechanisms driving the excursion, including enhanced organic carbon burial, changes in volcanic activity, and shifts in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry. Our analysis suggests that the Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion was likely a multifaceted event, influenced by a combination of increased photosynthetic activity and tectonic processes that facilitated the sequestration of organic carbon. Furthermore, the excursion's temporal alignment with the GOE implies a feedback loop where rising oxygen levels may have accelerated organic carbon burial, thereby sustaining elevated \u03b413C values. This research not only elucidates the dynamics of early Earth's carbon cycle but also provides insights into the environmental conditions that fostered the emergence of complex life. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating isotopic data with geological and biological evidence to reconstruct ancient biogeochemical cycles and their impact on Earth's evolutionary trajectory.", "label": 1}
