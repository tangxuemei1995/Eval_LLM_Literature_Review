{"grounding": "An oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals. The early Earth had an anoxic atmosphere, and understanding the rise and maintenance of high O2 levels is critical for investigating what drove our own evolution and for assessing the likely habitability of exoplanets. A growing number of techniques aim to reproduce changes in O2 levels over the Phanerozoic Eon (the past 539 million years). We assess these methods and attempt to draw the reliable techniques together to form a consensus Phanerozoic O2 curve. We conclude that O2 probably made up around 5\u201310% of the atmosphere during the Cambrian and rose in pulses to \u223c15\u201320% in the Devonian, reaching a further peak of greater than 25% in the Permo-Carboniferous before declining toward the present day. Evolutionary radiations in the Cambrian and Ordovician appear consistent with an oxygen driver, and the Devonian \u201cAge of the Fishes\u201d coincides with oxygen rising above 15% atm.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tAn oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals such as humans.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe review the methods for reconstructing past variation in oxygen levels over the past 539 million years (the Phanerozoic Eon).\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe produce a consensus plot of the most likely evolution of atmospheric oxygen levels.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEvolutionary radiations in the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Devonian periods may be linked to rises in oxygen concentration.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels throughout the Phanerozoic eon has been a subject of significant interest due to its profound impact on Earth's climate, biogeochemical cycles, and the evolution of life, particularly animals. This study revisits the fluctuations in atmospheric O2 concentrations over the past 541 million years, integrating recent advancements in geochemical modeling and isotopic analysis. By examining sedimentary records and employing state-of-the-art geochemical proxies, we provide a refined timeline of O2 variations and their correlation with major biological and geological events. Our findings suggest that O2 levels have not only been influenced by the carbon cycle and tectonic activities but also by the evolution and diversification of terrestrial and marine life forms. Notably, periods of significant O2 increase appear to coincide with major evolutionary milestones, such as the Cambrian explosion and the rise of large terrestrial animals. Conversely, declines in O2 levels are associated with mass extinction events, highlighting the intricate link between atmospheric composition and biological evolution. This comprehensive analysis underscores the dynamic nature of Earth's atmosphere and its critical role in shaping the biosphere. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between geochemical processes and evolutionary biology, offering insights into the potential future trajectories of Earth's atmospheric composition in response to ongoing anthropogenic influences.", "label": 1}
