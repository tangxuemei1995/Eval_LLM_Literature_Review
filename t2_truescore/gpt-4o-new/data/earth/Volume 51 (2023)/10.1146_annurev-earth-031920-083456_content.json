{"grounding": "As atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations rise and climate change becomes more destructive, geoengineering has become a subject of serious consideration. By reflecting a fraction of incoming sunlight, solar geoengineering could cool the planet quickly, but with uncertain effects on regional climatology, particularly hydrological patterns. Here, we review recent work on projected hydrologic outcomes of solar geoengineering, in the context of a robust literature on hydrological responses to climate change. While most approaches to solar geoengineering are expected to weaken the global hydrologic cycle, regional effects will vary based on implementation method and strategy. The literature on the hydrologic outcomes and impacts of geoengineering demonstrates that its implications for human welfare will depend on assumptions about underlying social conditions and objectives of intervention as well as the social lens through which projected effects are interpreted. We conclude with suggestions to reduce decision-relevant uncertainties in this novel field of Earth science inquiry.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe expected hydrological effects of reducing insolation are among the most uncertain and consequential impacts of solar geoengineering (SG).\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tTheoretical frameworks from broader climate science can help explain SG's effects on global precipitation, relative humidity, and other aspects of hydroclimate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe state of the knowledge on hydrological impacts of SG is unevenly concentrated among regions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tProjected hydrological impacts from SG are scenario dependent and difficult to characterize as either harmful or beneficial.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Solar geoengineering, a climate intervention strategy aimed at reflecting a portion of solar radiation back into space, has been proposed as a potential method to mitigate the impacts of climate change. This study examines the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering, focusing on its effects on the global hydrologic cycle and precipitation patterns. By employing advanced climate models, we assess how solar radiation modification could alter atmospheric circulation, cloud formation, and regional precipitation. Our findings indicate that while solar geoengineering may effectively reduce global temperatures, it could also lead to significant disruptions in the hydrologic cycle. These disruptions include changes in the intensity and distribution of precipitation, potentially exacerbating droughts in some regions while increasing flood risks in others. The study highlights the complexity of climate systems and the potential for unintended consequences, emphasizing the need for comprehensive risk assessments before the implementation of geoengineering techniques. Furthermore, the research underscores the importance of integrating solar geoengineering strategies with broader climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts to ensure sustainable and equitable outcomes. The results contribute to the growing body of literature on climate intervention, providing critical insights into the potential hydrological impacts of solar geoengineering and informing policy discussions on its feasibility and ethical considerations. Future research should focus on regional impacts and the development of governance frameworks to manage the risks associated with geoengineering interventions.", "label": 1}
