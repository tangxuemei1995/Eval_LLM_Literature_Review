{"grounding": "Large seismogenic faults consist of approximately meter-thick fault cores surrounded by hundreds-of-meters-thick damage zones. Earthquakes are generated by rupture propagation and slip within fault cores and dissipate the stored elastic strain energy in fracture and frictional processes in the fault zone and in radiated seismic waves. Understanding this energy partitioning is fundamental in earthquake mechanics to explain fault dynamic weakening and causative rupture processes operating over different spatial and temporal scales. The energy dissipated in the earthquake rupture propagation along a fault is called fracture energy or breakdown work. Here we review fracture energy estimates from seismological, modeling, geological, and experimental studies and show that fracture energy scales with fault slip. We conclude that although material-dependent constant fracture energies are important at the microscale for fracturing grains of the fault zone, they are negligible with respect to the macroscale processes governing rupture propagation on natural faults.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEarthquake ruptures propagate on geological faults and dissipate energy in fracture and frictional processes from micro- (less than a millimeter) to macroscale (centimeters to kilometers).\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe energy dissipated in earthquake rupture propagation is called fracture energy (G) or breakdown work (W\nb) and scales with coseismic slip.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFor earthquake ruptures in natural faults, the estimates of G and W\nb are consistent with a macroscale description of causative processes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe energy budget of an earthquake remains controversial, and contributions from different disciplines are required to unravel this issue.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Understanding the energy dynamics during earthquakes is crucial for comprehending fault mechanics and seismic hazard assessment. This study investigates the roles of fracture energy and breakdown work in the context of earthquake rupture dynamics. Fracture energy, the energy required to propagate a crack, and breakdown work, the energy dissipated during the weakening phase of fault slip, are critical components of the earthquake energy budget. These parameters influence the dynamic weakening of faults, which in turn affects the rupture propagation and the overall seismic energy release. By analyzing a range of seismic events and employing advanced numerical simulations, this research delineates the relationship between fracture energy and breakdown work, highlighting their dependence on fault zone structure and material properties. The study reveals that variations in fault zone heterogeneity and stress conditions significantly impact the partitioning of energy between fracture energy and breakdown work. Furthermore, the findings suggest that dynamic weakening mechanisms, such as thermal pressurization and flash heating, play a pivotal role in modulating these energy components. This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of rupture dynamics by providing insights into how fracture energy and breakdown work interact within the complex framework of fault mechanics. Ultimately, these insights enhance our ability to model earthquake processes and improve predictions of seismic hazard, offering valuable implications for earthquake engineering and risk mitigation strategies.", "label": 1}
