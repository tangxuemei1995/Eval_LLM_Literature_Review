{"grounding": "The continental crust in the overriding plate of the India-Asia collision zone in southern Tibet is characterized by an overthickened layer of felsic composition with an underlying granulite-eclogite layer. A large data set indicates that this crust experienced magmatism from 245 to 10 Ma, as recorded by the Gangdese Batholith. Magmatism was punctuated by flare-ups at 185\u2212170, 90\u221275, and 55\u221245 Ma caused by a combination of external and internal factors. The growth of this crust starts with a period dominated by fractional crystallization and the formation of voluminous (ultra)mafic arc cumulates in the lower crust during subduction, followed by their melting during late-subduction and collision, due to changes in convergence rate. This combined accumulation-melting process resulted in the vertical stratification and density sorting of the Gangdese crust. Comparisons with other similarly thickened collision zones suggests that this is a general process that leads to the stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records the time-integrated development of the world's thickest crust, reaching greater than 50 km at 55\u201345 Ma and greater than 70 km after 32 Ma.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records three magmatic flare-ups in response to distinct drivers; the last one at 55\u221245 Ma marks the arrival of India.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMagmatism was first dominated by fractional crystallization (accumulation) followed by crustal melting: the accumulation-melting process.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tAccumulation-melting in other collision zones provides a general process for vertical stratification and stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Gangdese Batholith in southern Tibet represents a significant geological feature that provides insights into the processes of continental crustal growth within a magmatic arc setting. This study investigates the complex interplay of tectonic and magmatic processes that have contributed to the development of the batholith, which is situated in a prominent collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Through detailed geochemical analyses, isotopic studies, and geochronological data, we explore the stratification and compositional evolution of the crust in this region. Our findings suggest that the Gangdese Batholith has undergone multiple phases of magmatic activity, which have been instrumental in the accretion and differentiation of continental crust. The data indicate that crustal growth in this area is characterized by episodic magmatism, involving both mantle-derived inputs and crustal recycling processes. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of tectonic compression and subsequent crustal thickening in facilitating the emplacement and evolution of magmatic bodies. The results underscore the significance of magmatic arcs as dynamic environments for crustal growth, where interactions between mantle and crustal materials drive the formation of new continental crust. This research contributes to a broader understanding of crustal growth mechanisms in collision zones and provides a framework for interpreting similar geological settings worldwide. The Gangdese Batholith thus serves as a natural laboratory for studying the intricate processes that govern the evolution of continental crust in tectonically active regions.", "label": 1}
