{"grounding": "The strength of lithospheric plates is a central component of plate tectonics, governed by brittle processes in the shallow portion of the plate and ductile behavior in the deeper portion. We review experimental constraints on ductile deformation of olivine, the main mineral in the upper mantle and thus the lithosphere. Olivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (GBS), and diffusion-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (diffusion creep). Deformation in most of the lithosphere is dominated by GBS, except in shear zones\u2014in which diffusion creep dominates\u2014and in the brittle-ductile transition\u2014in which low-temperature plasticity may dominate. We find that observations from naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of the experimentally constrained olivine flow laws to geological conditions but that geophysical observations predict a weaker lithosphere. The causes of this discrepancy are unresolved but likely reside in the uncertainty surrounding processes in the brittle-ductile transition, at which the lithosphere is strongest.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDuctile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is constrained by experimental data for olivine.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tOlivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, and diffusion creep.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tObservations of naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of olivine flow laws from experimental conditions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tExperiments predict stronger lithosphere than geophysical observations, likely due to gaps in constraints on deformation in the brittle-ductile transition.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is a critical process influencing the geodynamic behavior of tectonic plates and the evolution of the Earth's interior. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying ductile flow within the lithospheric mantle, with a particular focus on the role of olivine, the dominant mineral in this region. Through a comprehensive review of experimental and theoretical studies, we explore the conditions under which olivine exhibits plasticity, facilitating ductile deformation. The research highlights the influence of temperature, pressure, and grain size on the deformation mechanisms, including dislocation creep and diffusion creep, which govern the rheological properties of the mantle. We also examine the impact of water content and the presence of other mineral phases on the ductility of the lithospheric mantle. By integrating data from laboratory experiments, field observations, and numerical modeling, this study provides insights into the spatial and temporal variations in mantle deformation. The findings underscore the importance of ductile flow in accommodating tectonic stresses and contributing to mantle convection processes. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for interpreting seismic anisotropy and the thermal and mechanical evolution of the lithosphere. This research advances our knowledge of the complex interplay between mineral physics and geodynamic processes, offering implications for the broader field of Earth sciences.", "label": 1}
