{"grounding": "The current rapid increase in atmospheric CO2, linked to the massive use of fossil fuels, will have major consequences for our climate and for living organisms. To understand what is happening today, it is informative to look at the past. The evolution of the carbon cycle, coupled with that of the past climate system and the other coupled elemental cycles, is explored in the field, in the laboratory, and with the help of numerical modeling. The objective of numerical modeling is to be able to provide a quantification of the processes at work on our planet. Of course, we must remain aware that a numerical model, however complex, will never include all the relevant processes, impacts, and consequences because nature is complex and not all the processes are known. This makes models uncertain. We are still at the beginning of the exploration of the deep-time Earth. In the present contribution, we review some crucial events in coupled Earth-climate-biosphere evolution over the past 540 million years, focusing on the models that have been developed and what their results suggest. For most of these events, the causes are complex and we are not able to conclusively pinpoint all causal relationships and feedbacks in the Earth system. This remains a largely open scientific field.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe era of the pioneers of geological carbon cycle modeling is coming to an end with the recent development of numerical models simulating the physics of the processes, including climate and the role of vegetation, while taking into account spatialization.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tNumerical models now allow us to address increasingly complex processes, which suggests the possibility of simulating the complete carbon balance of objects as complex as a mountain range.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWhile most of the processes simulated by models are physical-chemical processes in which the role of living organisms is taken into account in a very simple way, via a limited number of parameters, models of the carbon cycle in deep time coupled with increasingly complex ecological models are emerging and are profoundly modifying our understanding of the evolution of our planet's surface.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Phanerozoic Eon, spanning over 540 million years, has witnessed significant transformations in Earth's carbon cycle, driven by complex interactions between geological, biological, and climatic processes. Understanding these transformations is crucial for elucidating the evolution of carbon sources and sinks, which have played a pivotal role in regulating Earth's climate over deep time. This study synthesizes insights from a range of models that simulate the carbon cycle across the Phanerozoic, highlighting the dynamic interplay between carbon sources, such as volcanic outgassing and organic carbon burial, and sinks, including silicate weathering and carbonate deposition. \n\nModels of the Phanerozoic carbon cycle incorporate various feedback mechanisms that have influenced atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperatures. For instance, the weathering of silicate rocks, a key carbon sink, is modulated by climatic conditions and tectonic activity, which in turn are affected by atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This feedback loop is critical in understanding long-term climate stability and transitions, such as the shift from greenhouse to icehouse conditions. Additionally, the role of biological processes, including the evolution of land plants and marine organisms, has been integrated into models to assess their impact on carbon sequestration and atmospheric composition.\n\nThe study also examines the limitations and uncertainties inherent in modeling the Phanerozoic carbon cycle, such as the scarcity of direct geological and geochemical data and the challenges in reconstructing past environmental conditions. Despite these challenges, models have provided valuable insights into the temporal variability of carbon fluxes and the resilience of Earth's climate system to perturbations. \n\nBy comparing model outputs with empirical data, this research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in refining our understanding of the carbon cycle over geological timescales. The findings have implications for predicting future climate scenarios, as they offer a long-term perspective on the natural processes that have historically regulated atmospheric CO2 levels. Ultimately, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of carbon sources and sinks, informing both paleoclimate reconstructions and contemporary climate change models.", "label": 1}
