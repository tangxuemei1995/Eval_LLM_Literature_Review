{"grounding": "Future sea-level rise poses an existential threat for many river deltas, yet quantifying the effect of sea-level changes on these coastal landforms remains a challenge. Sea-level changes have been slow compared to other coastal processes during the instrumental record, such that our knowledge comes primarily from models, experiments, and the geologic record. Here we review the current state of science on river delta response to sea-level change, including models and observations from the Holocene until 2300 CE. We report on improvements in the detection and modeling of past and future regional sea-level change, including a better understanding of the underlying processes and sources of uncertainty. We also see significant improvements in morphodynamic delta models. Still, substantial uncertainties remain, notably on present and future subsidence rates in and near deltas. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern sea-level rise also remain elusive, posing major challenges to model validation.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThere are large differences in the initiation time and subsequent delta progradation during the Holocene, likely from different sea-level and sediment supply histories.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tModern deltas are larger and will face faster sea-level rise than during their Holocene growth, making them susceptible to forced transgression.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tRegional sea-level projections have been much improved in the past decade and now also isolate dominant sources of uncertainty, such as the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tVertical land motion in deltas can be the dominant source of relative sea-level change and the dominant source of uncertainty; limited observations complicate projections.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tRiver deltas globally might lose 5% (\u223c35,000 km2) of their surface area by 2100 and 50% by 2300 due to relative sea-level rise under a high-emission scenario.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "River deltas are dynamic landforms at the interface of terrestrial and marine environments, playing a crucial role in coastal geomorphology and sedimentary geology. This study examines the impact of sea-level rise, driven by climate change, on the morphology and stability of river deltas worldwide. As global temperatures increase, the resulting thermal expansion of seawater and melting of ice caps contribute to rising sea levels, posing significant threats to deltaic regions. These areas are particularly vulnerable due to their low-lying topography and the complex interplay of fluvial and marine processes that govern their evolution. \n\nThe research synthesizes recent findings from geomorphological studies and climate models to assess the potential changes in deltaic systems under various sea-level rise scenarios. It highlights the mechanisms through which rising seas can alter sediment deposition patterns, leading to shoreline retreat, increased flooding, and loss of habitat. The study also explores adaptive strategies that can mitigate these impacts, such as sediment management, restoration of natural deltaic processes, and the implementation of engineered structures. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the socio-economic implications of delta degradation, emphasizing the need for integrated management approaches that consider both environmental and human factors. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge, this research aims to inform policymakers and stakeholders involved in coastal management and climate adaptation planning. Ultimately, understanding the response of river deltas to sea-level rise is essential for preserving these vital ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. The findings underscore the urgency of addressing climate change to protect deltaic environments and ensure their resilience in the face of ongoing environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
