{"grounding": "Uncertainty about sea-level rise is dominated by uncertainty about iceberg calving, mass loss from glaciers or ice sheets by fracturing. Review of the rapidly growing calving literature leads to a few overarching hypotheses. Almost all calving occurs near or just downglacier of a location where ice flows into an environment more favorable for calving, so the calving rate is controlled primarily by flow to the ice margin rather than by fracturing. Calving can be classified into five regimes, which tend to be persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations in flow velocity, ice characteristics, or environmental forcing; these regimes can be studied instrumentally. Sufficiently large perturbations may cause sometimes-rapid transitions between regimes or between calving and noncalving behavior, during which fracturing may control the rate of calving. Regime transitions underlie the largest uncertainties in sea-level rise projections, but with few, important exceptions, have not been observed instrumentally. This is especially true of the most important regime transitions for sea-level rise. Process-based models informed by studies of ongoing calving, and assimilation of deep-time paleoclimatic data, may help reduce uncertainties about regime transitions. Failure to include calving accurately in predictive models could lead to large underestimates of warming-induced sea-level rise.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIceberg calving, the breakage of ice from glaciers and ice sheets, affects sea level and many other environmental issues.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tModern rates of iceberg calving usually are controlled by the rate of ice flow past restraining points, not by the brittle calving processes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCalving can be classified into five regimes, which are persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tTransitions between calving regimes are especially important, and with warming might cause faster sea-level rise than generally projected.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Iceberg calving, the process by which chunks of ice break off from the edge of a glacier or ice shelf, plays a critical role in the dynamics of ice sheets and their contribution to sea-level rise. This study explores the various regimes and transitions of iceberg calving, focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. By synthesizing recent observational data and modeling studies, we identify key factors influencing calving processes, including ice thickness, oceanic and atmospheric conditions, and the structural integrity of ice shelves. Our analysis reveals distinct calving regimes characterized by different physical mechanisms, such as tensile fracturing, melt-undercutting, and buoyant flexure. \n\nTransitions between these regimes are often driven by changes in environmental conditions, such as warming ocean temperatures and increased surface melting, which can destabilize ice shelves and accelerate calving rates. The study highlights the importance of understanding these transitions to predict future ice-sheet behavior and their potential impact on global sea levels. We also examine the feedback mechanisms between calving and ice-sheet dynamics, noting that increased calving can lead to ice-sheet thinning and grounding line retreat, further enhancing ice loss. \n\nOur findings underscore the need for improved calving models that incorporate the complex interactions between ice, ocean, and atmosphere to enhance predictions of ice-sheet stability. This research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of iceberg calving processes and their implications for future sea-level rise, emphasizing the urgency of monitoring and modeling efforts in polar regions. By advancing our knowledge of calving regimes and transitions, we aim to inform policy decisions and climate adaptation strategies in response to the ongoing changes in Earth's cryosphere.", "label": 1}
