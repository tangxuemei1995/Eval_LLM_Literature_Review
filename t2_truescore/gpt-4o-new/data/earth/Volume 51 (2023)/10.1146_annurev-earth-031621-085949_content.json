{"grounding": "Carbonate minerals contain stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen with different masses whose abundances and bond arrangement are governed by thermodynamics. The clumped isotopic value \u0394i is a measure of the temperature-dependent preference of heavy C and O isotopes to clump, or bond with or near each other, rather than with light isotopes in the carbonate phase. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry uses \u0394i values measured by mass spectrometry (\u039447, \u039448) or laser spectroscopy (\u0394638) to reconstruct mineral growth temperature in surface and subsurface environments independent of parent water isotopic composition. Two decades of analytical and theoretical development have produced a mature temperature proxy that can estimate carbonate formation temperatures from 0.5 to 1,100\u00b0C, with up to 1\u20132\u00b0C external precision (2 standard error of the mean). Alteration of primary environmental temperatures by fluid-mediated and solid-state reactions and/or \u0394i values that reflect nonequilibrium isotopic fractionations reveal diagenetic history and/or mineralization processes. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has contributed significantly to geological and biological sciences, and it is poised to advance understanding of Earth's climate system, crustal processes, and growth environments of carbonate minerals.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tClumped heavy isotopes in carbonate minerals record robust temperatures and fluid compositions of ancient Earth surface and subsurface environments.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMature analytical methods enable carbonate clumped \u039447, \u039448, and \u0394638 measurements to address diverse questions in geological and biological sciences.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThese methods are poised to advance marine and terrestrial paleoenvironment and paleoclimate, tectonics, deformation, hydrothermal, and mineralization studies.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has emerged as a powerful tool in geochemistry, offering insights into paleoclimate reconstructions and diagenetic processes. This technique leverages the temperature-dependent preference for certain isotopologues, specifically the 'clumping' of heavy isotopes within carbonate minerals, to infer formation temperatures independent of the isotopic composition of the water from which the carbonate precipitated. Recent advancements in analytical precision and calibration have expanded the applicability of clumped isotope thermometry across a range of carbonate materials, including biogenic carbonates, speleothems, and marine sediments. This review explores the frontiers of this rapidly evolving field, highlighting key methodological improvements, such as enhanced mass spectrometry techniques and refined calibration curves, which have increased the accuracy and resolution of temperature estimates. Additionally, the integration of clumped isotope data with other geochemical proxies is discussed, providing a more comprehensive understanding of past environmental conditions. Challenges remain, particularly in addressing kinetic isotope effects and diagenetic alterations that can obscure primary temperature signals. However, ongoing research is focused on developing robust correction models and exploring the potential of clumped isotopes in novel applications, such as tracing carbon cycle dynamics and assessing anthropogenic impacts on carbonate systems. As the field progresses, carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is poised to become an indispensable tool in the geoscientist's toolkit, offering unprecedented insights into Earth's climatic and geochemical history.", "label": 1}
