{"grounding": "Volcanic eruptions are driven by bubbles that form when volatile species exsolve from magma. The conditions under which bubbles form depend mainly on magma composition, volatile concentration, presence of crystals, and magma decompression rate. These are all predicated on the mechanism by which volatiles exsolve from the melt to form bubbles. We critically review the known or inferred mechanisms of bubble formation in magmas: homogeneous nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation on crystal surfaces, and spontaneous phase separation (spinodal decomposition). We propose a general approach for calculating bubble nucleation rates as the sum of the contributions from homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, suggesting that nucleation may not be limited to a single mechanism prior to eruption. We identify three major challenges in which further experimental, analytical, and theoretical work is required to permit the development of a general model for bubble formation under natural eruption conditions.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWe review the mechanisms of bubble formation in magma and summarize the conditions under which the various mechanisms are understood to operate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tBubble formation mechanisms may evolve throughout magma ascent as conditions change such that bubbles may form simultaneously and sequentially via more than one mechanism.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tContributions from both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation on multiphase crystal phases can be captured via a single equation.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFuture work should focus on constraining macroscopic surface tension, characterizing the microphysics, and developing a general framework for modeling bubble formation, via all mechanisms, over natural magma ascent pathways.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of bubbles in magma is a critical process influencing the dynamics of volcanic eruptions. This study investigates the mechanisms of bubble nucleation and growth within magmatic systems, focusing on the interplay between nucleation, spinodal decomposition, and bubble dynamics. The presence of volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, significantly affects the physical properties of magma, altering its viscosity and surface tension, which in turn influence bubble formation. Nucleation, the initial step in bubble formation, can occur homogeneously or heterogeneously, depending on the physicochemical conditions within the magma. Spinodal decomposition, a less common but potentially significant mechanism, involves the spontaneous separation of a supersaturated volatile phase, leading to rapid bubble growth. This research utilizes a combination of experimental petrology, numerical modeling, and field observations to elucidate the conditions under which each mechanism predominates. The results indicate that the rate of volatile exsolution and the degree of undercooling are critical factors determining the dominant bubble formation pathway. Furthermore, the study explores the implications of bubble dynamics on magma ascent and eruption style, highlighting how variations in bubble size distribution and coalescence can influence the explosivity of volcanic eruptions. Understanding these processes is essential for improving predictive models of volcanic activity and assessing associated hazards. This research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between volatiles and magmatic systems, providing insights into the fundamental processes driving volcanic eruptions.", "label": 1}
