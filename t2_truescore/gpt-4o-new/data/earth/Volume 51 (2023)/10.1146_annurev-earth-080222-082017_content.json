{"grounding": "Terrestrial plants have transformed Earth's surface environments by altering water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. Studying vegetation-climate interaction in deep time has necessarily relied on modern-plant analogs to represent paleo-ecosystems\u2014as methods for reconstructing paleo- and, in particular, extinct-plant function were lacking. This approach is potentially compromised given that plant physiology has evolved through time, and some paleo-plants have no clear modern analog. Advancements in the quantitative reconstruction of whole-plant function provide new opportunities to replace modern-plant analogs and capture age-specific vegetation-climate interactions. Here, we review recent investigations of paleo-plant performance through the integration of fossil and geologic data with process-based ecosystem- to Earth system\u2013scale models to explore how early vascular plants responded to and influenced climate. First, we present an argument for characterizing extinct plants in terms of ecological and evolutionary theory to provide a framework for advancing reconstructed vegetation-climate interactions in deep time. We discuss the novel mechanistic understanding provided by applying these approaches to plants of the late Paleozoic ever-wet tropics and at higher latitudes. Finally, we discuss preliminary applications to paleo-plants in a state-of-the-art Earth system model to highlight the potential implications of different plant functional strategies on our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFor hundreds of millions of years, plants have been a keystone in maintaining the status of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and climate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tExtinct plants have functioned differently across time, limiting our understanding of how processes on Earth interact to produce climate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tNew methods, reviewed here, allow quantitative reconstruction of extinct-plant function based on the fossil record.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIntegrating extinct plants into ecosystem and climate models will expand our understanding of vegetation's role in past environmental change.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The transformation of Earth's environment by plants over geological time scales is a pivotal aspect of Earth's history, particularly during the late Paleozoic era. This study employs a systems approach to elucidate the complex interactions between plant functional traits, plant functional strategies, and their broader impacts on ecosystem and Earth system dynamics. By integrating ecosystem modeling with Earth system modeling, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how vegetation-climate interactions have historically shaped the planet's climate and atmospheric composition. The late Paleozoic era, characterized by significant evolutionary advancements in plant life, serves as a critical period for examining these interactions. During this time, the diversification of plant functional traits and strategies, such as the development of deep rooting systems and the evolution of vascular tissues, played a crucial role in altering carbon and water cycles. These changes, in turn, influenced global climate patterns and atmospheric CO2 levels, contributing to the transition from a greenhouse to an icehouse Earth. Our models incorporate data from paleobotanical records and geochemical proxies to simulate the feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate. The results highlight the importance of plant-driven processes in modulating Earth's climate system and underscore the need for incorporating detailed plant functional traits into Earth system models to improve predictions of past and future climate scenarios. This research not only enhances our understanding of historical vegetation-climate interactions but also provides insights into the potential responses of modern ecosystems to ongoing climate change. By adopting a systems approach, this study bridges the gap between paleobotany and climate science, offering a holistic perspective on the role of plants in Earth's environmental evolution.", "label": 1}
