{"grounding": "I describe my career journey from a young girl in Cameroon, West Africa, to a trailblazing geophysicist to my current role as dean. I chronicle my time as a student, the transition to being an early career faculty, launching my research career, and ultimately finding my way to administration. Along the way I helped pioneer biogeophysics as a subdiscipline in geophysics while simultaneously maintaining an international research program in continental rift tectonics. I also describe the many intersectionalities in my life including being the first Black woman in many spaces, being a champion for student success, developing a diverse talent pipeline by enhancing diversity in the geosciences, and navigating academic job searches as part of a dual-career couple. Finally, I acknowledge all those who helped shape my career including the many students I had the opportunity to mentor.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical account of Estella Atekwana delves into her pioneering contributions to the field of biogeophysics, particularly in the study of continental rifts. Atekwana's narrative intertwines her scientific journey with personal insights, highlighting the challenges and triumphs of navigating a career in geophysics as part of a dual-career couple. Her story underscores the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in academia, advocating for systemic changes to foster student success and support underrepresented groups in the sciences. Through her experiences, Atekwana offers a unique perspective on the intersection of personal and professional life, emphasizing the role of mentorship and community in overcoming barriers. This work not only chronicles her scientific achievements but also serves as an inspirational guide for aspiring geophysicists, particularly those from diverse backgrounds, seeking to make their mark in the field.", "label": 0}
