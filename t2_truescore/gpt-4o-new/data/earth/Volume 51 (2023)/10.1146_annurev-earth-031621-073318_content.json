{"grounding": "For the first time, from early 2019 to the end of 2022, Mars\u2019 shallow and deep interiors have been explored by seismology with the InSight mission. Thanks to the performances of its seismometers and the quality of their robotic installation on the ground, 1,319 seismic events have been detected, including about 90 marsquakes at teleseismic distances, with Mw from 2.5 to 4.7 and at least 6 impacts, the largest ones with craters larger than 130 m. A large fraction of these marsquakes occur in Cerberus Fossae, demonstrating active regional tectonics. Records of pressure-induced seismic noise and signals from the penetration of a heat flow probe have provided subsurface models below the lander. Deeper direct and secondary body wave phase travel time, receiver function, and surface wave analysis have provided the first interior models of Mars, including crustal thickness and crustal layering, mantle structure, thermal lithospheric thickness, and core radius and state.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWith InSight's SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure of Mars) experiment and for the first time in planetary exploration, Mars\u2019 internal structure and seismicity are constrained.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMore than 1,300 seismic events and seismic noise records enable the first comparative seismology studies together with Earth and lunar seismic data.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tInversion of seismic travel times and waveforms provided the first interior model of another terrestrial planet, down to the core.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSeveral impacts were also seismically recorded with their craters imaged from orbit, providing the first data on impact dynamic on Mars.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Mars seismology has emerged as a pivotal field of study, offering profound insights into the Red Planet's interior structure and geodynamic processes. The detection and analysis of marsquakes, facilitated by missions such as NASA's InSight lander, have provided unprecedented data on seismic activity on Mars. This research focuses on understanding the frequency, magnitude, and distribution of marsquakes, with particular attention to the Cerberus Fossae region, a geologically active area that has been identified as a significant source of seismic events. The study of marsquakes not only aids in mapping the Martian crust and mantle but also enhances our understanding of tectonic activity and thermal evolution. Additionally, the impact of meteoroids on Mars' surface contributes to the seismic activity, offering a unique opportunity to study impact-generated seismic waves and their propagation through the Martian interior. By analyzing these seismic events, researchers can infer the composition and state of the Martian core, mantle, and crust, providing clues about the planet's formation and evolution. The integration of seismological data with geological and geophysical observations has led to a more comprehensive model of Mars' interior structure, revealing differences and similarities with Earth. This research not only advances our understanding of Mars but also contributes to comparative planetology, offering insights into the dynamic processes that shape terrestrial planets. As Mars seismology continues to evolve, it holds the potential to answer fundamental questions about planetary formation and the potential for past or present life on Mars.", "label": 1}
