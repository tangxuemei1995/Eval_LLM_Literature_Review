{"grounding": "The physician\u2013patient relationship has evolved significantly in the past century. Physician authority has been reduced while patients have been empowered. This review focuses on face-to-face clinical care and argues that current physician\u2013patient relations range from partnerships between social actors who each play critical roles in negotiating care to a more adversarial duel in which both participants advocate for goals that are not necessarily shared. While the former is the hope of increased patient involvement, the latter is increasingly common. Through our discussion of existing studies, we document that while high levels of patient participation are beneficial to treatment outcomes, this engagement also has a dark side that threatens treatment outcomes. We discuss some communication resources patients use that affect treatment outcomes, exemplify how patient engagement affects physician communication, and discuss some strategies that current research finds effective for communicating about treatment with today's engaged patients.", "generated_text": "Effective health care communication is pivotal in shaping treatment outcomes, as it influences patient satisfaction, adherence to medical advice, and overall health results. This study explores the dynamics of physician\u2013patient interactions, employing conversation analysis to dissect the nuances of negotiation and decision-making processes. By examining social interactions within clinical settings, the research highlights how communication strategies impact the mutual understanding and trust between patients and healthcare providers. The findings suggest that successful negotiation and shared decision-making are contingent upon the physician's ability to engage in empathetic listening and clear articulation of medical information. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of tailoring communication styles to individual patient needs, thereby enhancing the therapeutic alliance. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence advocating for improved communication training in medical education to optimize treatment outcomes and patient well-being.", "label": 0}
