{"grounding": "In response to uncovering brain mechanisms underlying vocal communication and searching for biomarkers for mental illnesses, speech prosody has been increasingly studied in recent years in multiple disciplines, including psycholinguistics. In this article, we provide an up-to-date synthesis of the theoretical foundation and empirical evidence to profile linguistic and emotional prosody in the proper characterization of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. Our review reveals a need to develop theoretically motivated and methodologically integrated approaches to the study of context-driven comprehension and expression of pragmatic-affective prosody, which will help elucidate the core features of socio-communicative problems in individuals with mental disorders. We propose that comprehensive models within and across the conventional cognition-emotion-language trichotomy need to be developed to integrate current findings and guide future research. In particular, there needs to be due emphasis on investigating multisensory and cross-modal effects in normal and pathological prosody research. Our review calls for multidisciplinary efforts to address the challenging issues to inform and inspire the advancement of linguistic theories and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.", "generated_text": "Speech prosody, encompassing the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech, plays a crucial role in communication and is often disrupted in individuals with mental disorders. This study explores the multifaceted relationship between mental disorders and speech prosody, focusing on prosody recognition and production, as well as pragmatic and affective prosody. By reviewing recent advancements in prosody analysis, the research highlights how deviations in prosodic features can serve as potential biomarkers for various mental health conditions, including depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. The study examines the underlying neural mechanisms that contribute to prosodic impairments and discusses the implications for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of developing robust prosody recognition technologies to enhance clinical assessments and personalized treatment plans. The findings underscore the need for interdisciplinary approaches combining linguistics, psychology, and computational methods to advance our understanding of prosody in mental disorders. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the integration of speech prosody analysis in mental health diagnostics and interventions.", "label": 1}
