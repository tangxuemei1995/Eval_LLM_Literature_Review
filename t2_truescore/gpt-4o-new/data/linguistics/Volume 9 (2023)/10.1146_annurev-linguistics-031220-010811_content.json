{"grounding": "The past decade has seen the rapid development of a new approach to pragmatics that attempts to integrate insights from formal and experimental semantics and pragmatics, psycholinguistics, and computational cognitive science in the study of meaning: probabilistic pragmatics. The most influential probabilistic approach to pragmatics is the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework. In this review, I demonstrate the basic mechanics and commitments of RSA as well as some of its standard extensions, highlighting the key features that have led to its success in accounting for a wide variety of pragmatic phenomena. Fundamentally, it treats language as probabilistic, informativeness as gradient, alternatives as context-dependent, and subjective prior beliefs (world knowledge) as a crucial facet of interpretation. It also provides an integrated account of the link between production and interpretation. I highlight key challenges for RSA, which include scalability, the treatment of the boundedness of cognition, and the incremental and compositional nature of language.", "generated_text": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework is a computational model that integrates probabilistic reasoning with linguistic pragmatics to explain how speakers and listeners use context to infer meaning. This framework posits that communication is a cooperative activity where speakers choose utterances based on their beliefs about listeners' interpretations, while listeners infer speakers' intentions by considering possible alternatives. RSA combines insights from experimental pragmatics and semantics, providing a formal structure to model how context influences language understanding. By employing probabilistic models, RSA captures the nuances of human communication, offering predictions that align with empirical data from experimental studies. This approach has advanced the field of computational pragmatics by enabling the simulation of complex linguistic phenomena, such as implicature and reference resolution. The RSA framework thus serves as a powerful tool for exploring the interplay between language, cognition, and context, contributing to a deeper understanding of human communication processes.", "label": 1}
