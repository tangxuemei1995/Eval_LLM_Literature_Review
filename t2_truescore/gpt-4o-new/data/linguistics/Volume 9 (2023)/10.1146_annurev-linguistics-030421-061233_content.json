{"grounding": "Detailed comparative studies have revealed many surface similarities between linguistic communication and the communication of nonhumans. How should we interpret these discoveries in linguistic and cognitive perspective? We review the literature with a specific focus on analogy (similar features and function but not shared ancestry) and homology (shared ancestry). We conclude that combinatorial features of animal communication are analogous but not homologous to natural language. Homologies are found instead in cognitive capacities of attention manipulation, which are enriched in humans, making possible many distinctive forms of communication, including language use. We therefore present a new, graded taxonomy of means of attention manipulation, including a new class we call Ladyginian, which is related to but slightly broader than the more familiar class of Gricean interaction. Only in the latter do actors have the goal of revealing specifically informative intentions. Great ape interaction may be best characterized as Ladyginian but not Gricean.", "generated_text": "This study delves into animal communication through the lenses of linguistic and cognitive sciences, drawing on historical and contemporary perspectives. By examining the works of pioneers like Washburn and Ladygina-Kohts, the research highlights the evolution of understanding in comparative cognition. The analysis incorporates Grice's theories on meaning and intention, exploring how these concepts apply to non-human communication systems. Central to the discussion are the principles of duality of patterning and generativity, which are traditionally associated with human language. The study investigates whether these linguistic features are present in animal communication, offering insights into the cognitive capabilities of various species. By bridging linguistic theory and cognitive science, this research aims to enhance our understanding of the complexities and limitations of animal communication, providing a comprehensive framework for future studies in the field. The findings suggest a nuanced continuum of communicative abilities across species, challenging the boundaries between human and animal communication.", "label": 1}
