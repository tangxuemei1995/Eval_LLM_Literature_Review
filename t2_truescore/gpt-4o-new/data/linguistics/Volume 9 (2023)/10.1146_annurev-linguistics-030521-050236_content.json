{"grounding": "A heritage language is a sociopolitically minority and/or minoritized language acquired as the first or one of the first languages in a bilingual or multilingual context. Heritage languages are typically acquired under conditions of reduced exposure and are often used less than the majority language during late childhood and adolescence. Heritage languages show structural differences and changes at all levels of linguistic analysis from baseline grammars that arise from the complex interaction between the nature and quantity of input and the age of bilinguals. Although many situations give rise to heritage languages, this article focuses on immigrants and their children and reviews foundational studies of the linguistic properties of heritage languages; studies of age effects that have shed light on critical differences between first, second, and heritage language acquisition; and recent studies of heritage language relearning and reactivation. The implications of the study of heritage languages for bilingualism and society and for the language and cognitive sciences are discussed.", "generated_text": "Heritage languages, often acquired in early childhood within familial contexts, face unique challenges and opportunities in their maintenance and revitalization. This study explores the dynamic processes of language acquisition, attrition, and reactivation among heritage speakers, who typically experience a shift in linguistic dominance towards the societal language. The phenomenon of L1 attrition, where the heritage language is partially or fully lost, is examined in relation to factors such as age of acquisition, frequency of use, and sociocultural influences. The research further investigates the potential for reactivation and relearning of heritage languages, highlighting the cognitive and emotional benefits of bilingualism. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and case studies, this paper underscores the importance of educational and community support in fostering heritage language proficiency. The findings suggest that strategic interventions can facilitate the regaining of heritage languages, thereby enriching cultural identity and promoting linguistic diversity. This work contributes to the broader understanding of bilingualism and language preservation.", "label": 1}
