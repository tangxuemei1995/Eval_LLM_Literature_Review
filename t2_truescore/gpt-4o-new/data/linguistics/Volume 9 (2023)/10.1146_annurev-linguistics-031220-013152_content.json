{"grounding": "Environmental linguistics is an emerging field at the intersection of linguistics and natural sciences. It recognizes the mutual relationship between cultural and ecological diversity, documenting linguistic structures and verbal practices by which speakers conceptualize, encode, and transmit knowledge about the natural world. It surpasses the largely metaphorical and narrative program of ecolinguistics to position language as the preeminent conceptual framework and channel for environmental knowledge. Natural phenomena\u2014as Indigenous experts explain\u2014cannot be understood apart from the languages that encode them, and vice versa. Language diversity is thus the key to safeguarding biodiversity and a balanced human relationship with nature. Environmental linguistics helps decolonize linguistics as our field evolves to prioritize knowledge coproduction over data extraction. Examples from my fieldwork in Tuva cover six domains of knowledge: landscapes, lifeforms, time, sound, memory, and survival. This article reviews recent literature from many cultures, emphasizing works by Indigenous authors.", "generated_text": "Environmental Linguistics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that explores the intricate relationship between language, ecology, and cultural identity. This study delves into the role of linguistic diversity in fostering biodiversity, emphasizing the importance of indigenous languages in preserving ecological knowledge. By examining the case of Tuva, a region rich in native science and environmental intelligence, the research highlights how traditional ecological knowledge is embedded in local languages, offering insights into sustainable practices. The paper also addresses the decolonization of environmental narratives, advocating for the inclusion of indigenous perspectives in global environmental discourse. Through a comprehensive analysis of linguistic practices in Tuva, the study underscores the potential of environmental linguistics to contribute to biodiversity conservation and cultural resilience. This research calls for a paradigm shift in environmental policy, recognizing the value of linguistic diversity as a crucial component of ecological sustainability.", "label": 1}
