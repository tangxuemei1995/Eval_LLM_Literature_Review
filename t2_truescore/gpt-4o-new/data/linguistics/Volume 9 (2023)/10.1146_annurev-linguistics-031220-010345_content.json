{"grounding": "Much has been written on the abuse and misuse of statistical methods, including p values, statistical significance, and so forth. I present some of the best practices in statistics using a running example data analysis. Focusing primarily on frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models, I illustrate some defensible ways in which statistical inference\u2014specifically, hypothesis testing using Bayes factors versus estimation or uncertainty quantification\u2014can be carried out. The key is to not overstate the evidence and to not expect too much from statistics. Along the way, I demonstrate some powerful ideas, including the use of simulation to understand the design properties of one's experiment before running it, visualization of data before carrying out a formal analysis, and simulation of data from the fitted model to understand the model's behavior.", "generated_text": "This study explores effective methodologies for analyzing psycholinguistic data, emphasizing the integration of Bayesian methods in experimental linguistics. Traditional hypothesis testing often falls short in addressing the complexities and uncertainties inherent in linguistic data. By employing Bayes factors, researchers can more robustly quantify evidence for or against hypotheses, offering a nuanced understanding of linguistic phenomena. This paper discusses the advantages of Bayesian approaches over frequentist methods, particularly in terms of uncertainty quantification and interpretability. Through case studies and simulations, we demonstrate how Bayesian techniques can enhance the reliability and validity of linguistic data analysis. Our findings suggest that adopting these methods can lead to more informed and precise conclusions, ultimately advancing the field of psycholinguistics and its experimental practices.", "label": 0}
