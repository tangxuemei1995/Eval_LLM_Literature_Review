{"grounding": "The term homesign has been used to describe the signing of deaf individuals who have not had sustained access to the linguistic resources of a named language. Early studies of child homesigners focused on documenting their manual communication systems through the lens of developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics, but a recent wave of linguistic ethnographic investigations is challenging many of the established theoretical presuppositions that underlie the foundational homesign research. Sparked by a larger critical movement within Deaf Studies led by deaf scholars, this new generation of scholarship interrogates how researchers portray deaf individuals and their communication practices and questions the conceptualization of language in the foundational body of homesign research. In this review, we discuss these contested issues and the current moment of transition within research on homesign.", "generated_text": "Homesign systems, developed by deaf individuals without access to formal sign language education, present a unique opportunity to explore language emergence and sociolinguistic dynamics. This study delves into the contested issues surrounding homesign, examining its role as a precursor to fully-fledged sign languages and its implications for linguistic ethnography. By analyzing the sociolinguistic environments in which homesign arises, we aim to understand the factors influencing its development and sustainability. The research highlights the tension between homesign as a personal communication system and its potential to evolve into a community language. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper seeks to contribute to the broader discourse on language development, identity, and the rights of deaf individuals to access and develop their own linguistic resources.", "label": 1}
