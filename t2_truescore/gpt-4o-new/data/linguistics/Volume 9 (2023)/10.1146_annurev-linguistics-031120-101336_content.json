{"grounding": "The actuation problem asks why a linguistic change occurs in a particular language at a particular time and space. Responses to this problem are multifaceted. This review approaches the problem of actuation through the lens of sound change, examining it from both individual and population perspectives. Linguistic changes ultimately actuate in the form of idiolectal differences. An understanding of language change actuation at the idiolectal level requires an understanding of (a) how individual speaker-listeners\u2019 different past linguistic experiences and physical, perceptual, cognitive, and social makeups affect the way they process and analyze the primary learning data and (b) how these factors lead to divergent representations and grammars across speakers-listeners. Population-level incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovation depend not only on the nature of contact between speakers with unique idiolects but also on individuals who have the wherewithal to take advantage of the linguistic innovations they encountered to achieve particular ideological projects at any given moment. Because of the vast number of contingencies that need to be aligned properly, the incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovation are predicted to be rare. Agent-based modeling promises to provide a controlled way to investigate the stochastic nature of language change propagation, but a comprehensive model of linguistic change actuation at the individual level remains elusive.", "generated_text": "The actuation problem in linguistics refers to the challenge of understanding why certain sound changes occur in specific languages or dialects at particular times, while others do not. This study explores the actuation problem through the lens of incrementation and propagation, focusing on the role of individual differences in cognitive processing styles. By employing agent-based modeling, we simulate linguistic communities to investigate how variations in cognitive processing among individuals can influence the initiation and spread of sound changes. Our model incorporates parameters that reflect individual differences, such as attention to detail and adaptability, which are hypothesized to affect linguistic behavior. The results suggest that individuals with certain cognitive processing styles are more likely to initiate sound changes, while others play a crucial role in their propagation. Furthermore, the interaction between agents with diverse cognitive profiles can lead to complex patterns of sound change, highlighting the importance of social dynamics in linguistic evolution. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the actuation problem by integrating cognitive and social factors, offering a novel perspective on how individual differences can drive linguistic innovation. The findings have implications for theories of language change, suggesting that cognitive diversity within a population is a key factor in the emergence and dissemination of new linguistic forms.", "label": 1}
