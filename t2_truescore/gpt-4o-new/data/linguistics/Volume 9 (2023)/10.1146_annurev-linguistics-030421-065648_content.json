{"grounding": "Chinese developmental dyslexia (DD) research provides important insights into the language-universal and language-specific mechanisms underlying dyslexia. In this article, we review recent advances in Chinese DD. Converging behavioral evidence suggests that, while phonological and rapid automatized naming deficits are language universal, orthographic and morphological deficits are specific to the linguistic properties of Chinese. At the neural level, hypoactivation in the left superior temporal/inferior frontal regions in dyslexic children across Chinese and alphabetic languages may indicate a shared phonological processing deficit, whereas hyperactivation in the right inferior occipital/middle temporal regions and atypical activation in the left frontal areas in Chinese dyslexic children may indicate a language-specific compensatory strategy for impaired visual-spatial analysis and a morphological deficit in Chinese DD, respectively. The findings call for further theoretical endeavors to understand the language-universal and Chinese-specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying dyslexia and to design more effective and efficient intervention programs.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in the study of Chinese developmental dyslexia have provided significant insights into its linguistic, cognitive, and neurobiological underpinnings. This review synthesizes current research on the unique linguistic profiles associated with dyslexia in Chinese, highlighting the challenges posed by the logographic nature of the script. Studies reveal distinct brain abnormalities in dyslexic individuals, with atypical activation patterns in regions associated with phonological and orthographic processing. Genetic research has identified several susceptibility genes, suggesting a complex interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors. The findings underscore both language-universal and language-specific aspects of dyslexia, emphasizing the need for tailored diagnostic and intervention strategies. This body of work not only enhances our understanding of dyslexia in the context of Chinese language but also contributes to the broader discourse on reading disorders across diverse linguistic systems.", "label": 1}
