{"grounding": "In this review, we discuss the limits of the concept of the modern nation-state to explore language issues in postcolonial contexts, as in Africa. We argue in favor of a revision of the history of the field of language policy and planning (LPP) and sociolinguistics, paying attention to how the colonial issue has been erased and downplayed. We first explore the colonial history of LPP and how this field contributed to frame African multilingualisms as problems to be solved. Second, we briefly discuss how the contemporary understanding of citizenship in Africa is entangled with the colonial history of a particular version of the state in Africa; we focus on Sudan as an example. We problematize the construct of \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d inscribed in the methodological nationalism that characterizes the early LPP framework, which reverberates in contemporary public policies. By doing so, we advocate for a perspective of language that is historically and locally embedded, following a politics that recognizes the importance of Southern epistemologies to language studies.", "generated_text": "This study critically examines the intersection of postcolonial language policy and planning (LPP) with the concept of the modern nation-state, focusing on Southern perspectives, particularly in the context of Sudan. The research highlights how traditional LPP frameworks, often rooted in Western-centric notions of statehood, inadequately address the complexities of postcolonial nations. By employing a postcolonial approach, the study reveals the limitations of conventional LPP in accommodating the diverse linguistic and cultural landscapes of postcolonial states like Sudan. It argues that the imposition of a singular national language policy often exacerbates ethnic tensions and undermines social cohesion. The research advocates for a more nuanced understanding of LPP that incorporates indigenous knowledge systems and recognizes the fluidity of linguistic identities in postcolonial settings. Through a case study of Sudan, the paper illustrates how Southern perspectives can inform more inclusive and context-sensitive language policies that better reflect the realities of postcolonial nation-states, ultimately challenging the rigid boundaries of the modern state paradigm.", "label": 1}
