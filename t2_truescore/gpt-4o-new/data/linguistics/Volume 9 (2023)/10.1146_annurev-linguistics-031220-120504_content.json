{"grounding": "Language documentation as a subfield of linguistics has arisen over the past roughly two and a half decades more or less simultaneously with the widespread availability of inexpensive hardware and software for creating, storing, and sharing digital objects. Thus, in some ways the history of advancements within the discipline is also a history of how technological tools have been developed, tested, adopted, and eventually abandoned as newer technologies appear. In this article we examine some recent technologies used both for creating documentary resources, usually considered to include recorded language events in a variety of genres and settings and enough annotation to make them decipherable, and for then mobilizing those resources so that they can be used and shared in language learning, reclamation, revitalization, and analysis.", "generated_text": "The field of language documentation has witnessed significant technological advancements, enhancing both resource creation and mobilization. Recent innovations have introduced sophisticated tools and platforms that streamline the collection, analysis, and dissemination of linguistic data. These technologies facilitate the documentation of endangered languages by enabling more efficient data gathering and processing, often through mobile applications and cloud-based solutions. Additionally, advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have improved the accuracy and accessibility of language resources, fostering greater collaboration among linguists, native speakers, and communities. This paper reviews the latest technological developments in language documentation, highlighting their impact on preserving linguistic diversity and promoting sustainable language practices. By leveraging these technologies, researchers can create comprehensive language resources that are more easily mobilized for educational and revitalization efforts.", "label": 1}
