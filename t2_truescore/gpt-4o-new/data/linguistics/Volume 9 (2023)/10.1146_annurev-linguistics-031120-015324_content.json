{"grounding": "In linguistics, ethics has long encompassed matters typically covered under regulatory oversight, but it is increasingly understood as relational and reciprocal, conferring responsibilities and obligations that extend beyond the work produced for other researchers. Those who study language are also coming to interrogate their professional responsibilities not only in how research is done but also in how research is conceived, framed, reported, discussed, and taught, as part of larger discussions around decolonization, intersectionality, and social justice. In this article, we review existing literature on ethics in linguistics, both as it relates to research and as it relates to broader practices, which we then situate within ongoing conversations across subfields. The overarching frame for our discussion is that ethical practice and scientific validity are aligned, and that dismantling dominant discourses and normative practices will serve to advance the work linguists do in meaningful ways.", "generated_text": "The field of linguistics, like other scientific disciplines, is increasingly confronted with ethical considerations that impact research practices and outcomes. This paper explores the multifaceted nature of ethics in linguistics, focusing on ethical praxis, regulatory ethics, relational ethics, and scientific validity. Ethical praxis in linguistics involves the application of ethical principles in research design and implementation, ensuring respect for participants and communities. Regulatory ethics addresses compliance with institutional and legal standards, safeguarding the rights and welfare of subjects. Relational ethics emphasizes the importance of relationships between researchers and participants, advocating for mutual respect and understanding. Scientific validity is scrutinized through an ethical lens, questioning how ethical considerations influence the reliability and credibility of linguistic research. By examining these dimensions, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and integrating ethics into linguistic research, ultimately enhancing the discipline's integrity and societal impact.", "label": 1}
