{"grounding": "Impersonal pronouns are prototypically used in generic sentences to make generalizations about people. Yet they are unlike bare plural people or indefinite singular a person in that they exhibit a sensitivity to first-person perspective. This relationship can be seen in (a) inferences of first-person experience associated with use of these pronouns, (b) additional meaning components carried by impersonally used personal pronouns involving a presumption of empathy or (dis)agreement, and (c) their interpretation in attitude reports, including referential dependency on the attitude holder and the de se/de re distinction. I survey recent findings on the perspectival interpretation of impersonal pronouns including English generic one, German man, French on, and Italian si, as well as impersonally used personal pronouns like English you and German ich and du. I end by identifying some common themes emerging from recent formal semantic analyses of impersonal pronouns. One of the key notions here is the treatment of impersonals as Heimian indefinites, which in generic contexts get bound by the generic operator.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of impersonal pronouns and first-person perspective, focusing on their role in attitude reports and the expression of de se thoughts. Impersonal pronouns, often used to convey general truths or norms, can obscure the speaker's personal involvement, yet they also serve as a linguistic tool to express self-referential attitudes indirectly. By examining the indexicality inherent in impersonal pronouns, this research highlights their dual function in maintaining genericity while simultaneously anchoring statements to the speaker's perspective. Through a detailed analysis of linguistic data, the study reveals how impersonal pronouns can subtly shift the narrative perspective, influencing the interpretation of attitude reports. The findings suggest that the use of impersonal pronouns in discourse is not merely a stylistic choice but a strategic mechanism to navigate between personal and impersonal viewpoints. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how language structures mediate the expression of self-related thoughts and the broader implications for theories of indexicality and perspective-taking.", "label": 1}
