{"grounding": "Photoacoustic techniques have shown promise in identifying molecular changes in bone tissue and visualizing tissue microstructure. This capability represents significant advantages over gold standards (i.e., dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) for bone evaluation without requiring ionizing radiation. Instead, photoacoustic imaging uses light to penetrate through bone, followed by acoustic pressure generation, resulting in highly sensitive optical absorption contrast in deep biological tissues. This review covers multiple bone-related photoacoustic imaging contributions to clinical applications, spanning bone cancer, joint pathologies, spinal disorders, osteoporosis, bone-related surgical guidance, consolidation monitoring, and transsphenoidal and transcranial imaging. We also present a summary of photoacoustic-based techniques for characterizing biomechanical properties of bone, including temperature, guided waves, spectral parameters, and spectroscopy. We conclude with a future outlook based on the current state of technological developments, recent achievements, and possible new directions.", "generated_text": "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has emerged as a promising modality for the non-invasive characterization of bone, offering high-resolution insights into bone structure and composition. This review provides an overview of the principles of PAI, highlighting its integration with quantitative ultrasound and spectral unmixing techniques to enhance bone imaging. Applications in medical diagnostics, particularly in assessing bone health and detecting pathologies such as osteoporosis, are discussed. The synergy between PAI and quantitative ultrasound allows for improved contrast and depth penetration, while spectral unmixing facilitates the differentiation of bone components. Current challenges, including the need for standardized protocols and advanced data processing algorithms, are addressed. The outlook for PAI in bone imaging is optimistic, with potential advancements in clinical applications and personalized medicine on the horizon.", "label": 1}
