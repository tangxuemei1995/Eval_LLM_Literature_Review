{"grounding": "Over the last half century, the autofluorescence of the metabolic cofactors NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) has been quantified in a variety of cell types and disease states. With the spread of nonlinear optical microscopy techniques in biomedical research, NADH and FAD imaging has offered an attractive solution to noninvasively monitor cell and tissue status and elucidate dynamic changes in cell or tissue metabolism. Various tools and methods to measure the temporal, spectral, and spatial properties of NADH and FAD autofluorescence have been developed. Specifically, an optical redox ratio of cofactor fluorescence intensities and NADH fluorescence lifetime parameters have been used in numerous applications, but significant work remains to mature this technology for understanding dynamic changes in metabolism. This article describes the current understanding of our optical sensitivity to different metabolic pathways and highlights current challenges in the field. Recent progress in addressing these challenges and acquiring more quantitative information in faster and more metabolically relevant formats is also discussed.", "generated_text": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular and tissue metabolism without the need for exogenous labels. This technique leverages the intrinsic autofluorescence properties of metabolic cofactors such as NADH and FAD, which are key indicators of cellular redox states and metabolic pathways like glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. By employing multiphoton microscopy and two-photon excited fluorescence, researchers can achieve high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of live cells and tissues. Fluorescence lifetime imaging further enhances this approach by providing quantitative insights into the microenvironment and binding states of these cofactors. This method allows for real-time monitoring of metabolic changes, offering significant advantages in studying disease progression, drug response, and cellular heterogeneity. The non-invasive nature of label-free optical metabolic imaging makes it particularly suitable for longitudinal studies and clinical applications, paving the way for advancements in personalized medicine and therapeutic interventions. This review highlights recent developments and applications of this technology in biomedical research.", "label": 1}
