{"grounding": "Neurotechnologies for treating pain rely on electrical stimulation of the central or peripheral nervous system to disrupt or block pain signaling and have been commercialized to treat a variety of pain conditions. While their adoption is accelerating, neurotechnologies are still frequently viewed as a last resort, after many other treatment options have been explored. We review the pain conditions commonly treated with electrical stimulation, as well as the specific neurotechnologies used for treating those conditions. We identify barriers to adoption, including a limited understanding of mechanisms of action, inconsistent efficacy across patients, and challenges related to selectivity of stimulation and off-target side effects. We describe design improvements that have recently been implemented, as well as some cutting-edge technologies that may address the limitations of existing neurotechnologies. Addressing these challenges will accelerate adoption and change neurotechnologies from last-line to first-line treatments for people living with chronic pain.", "generated_text": "Neurotechnology has emerged as a promising frontier in the management of chronic pain, offering innovative solutions that target the nervous system directly. This review explores the efficacy and mechanisms of various neurotechnological interventions, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). These modalities aim to modulate pain pathways by influencing neural activity at different levels of the nervous system. DBS targets central pain processing centers, while SCS and TENS focus on the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system, respectively. Recent advancements in these technologies have shown potential in reducing pain intensity and improving quality of life for patients with refractory chronic pain conditions. The integration of neurotechnology into pain management protocols represents a significant shift towards personalized medicine, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize treatment parameters and understand long-term outcomes. This paper highlights current challenges and future directions in the field.", "label": 1}
