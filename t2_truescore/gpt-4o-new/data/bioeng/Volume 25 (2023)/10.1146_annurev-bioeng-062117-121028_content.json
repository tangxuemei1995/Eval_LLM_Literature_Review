{"grounding": "The need for hydration monitoring is significant, especially for the very young and elderly populations who are more vulnerable to becoming dehydrated and suffering from the effects that dehydration brings. This need has been among the drivers of considerable effort in the academic and commercial sectors to provide a means for monitoring hydration status, with a special interest in doing so outside the hospital or clinical setting. This review of emerging technologies provides an overview of many technology approaches that, on a theoretical basis, have sensitivity to water and are feasible as a routine measurement. We review the evidence of technical validation and of their use in humans. Finally, we highlight the essential need for these technologies to be rigorously evaluated for their diagnostic potential, as a necessary step to meet the need for hydration monitoring outside of the clinical environment.", "generated_text": "Dehydration is a critical health concern that can lead to severe complications if not promptly detected and managed. Traditional methods of assessing hydration status are often invasive, time-consuming, and not suitable for continuous monitoring. Recent advancements in wearable technology and noninvasive sensors offer promising alternatives for real-time hydration monitoring. This review examines the current state of noninvasive devices designed to detect dehydration, focusing on their technological capabilities, accuracy, and practicality in various settings. We explore the integration of biosensors, optical techniques, and machine learning algorithms in wearable devices that aim to provide continuous and reliable hydration status feedback. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in achieving widespread clinical adoption, including device calibration, user compliance, and data interpretation. Future research should address these limitations to enhance the efficacy and accessibility of noninvasive hydration monitoring solutions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and preventive healthcare strategies.", "label": 1}
