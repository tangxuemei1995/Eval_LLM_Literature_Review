{"grounding": "Lipids are essential cellular components forming membranes, serving as energy reserves, and acting as chemical messengers. Dysfunction in lipid metabolism and signaling is associated with a wide range of diseases including cancer and autoimmunity. Heterogeneity in cell behavior including lipid signaling is increasingly recognized as a driver of disease and drug resistance. This diversity in cellular responses as well as the roles of lipids in health and disease drive the need to quantify lipids within single cells. Single-cell lipid assays are challenging due to the small size of cells (\u223c1 pL) and the large numbers of lipid species present at concentrations spanning orders of magnitude. A growing number of methodologies enable assay of large numbers of lipid analytes, perform high-resolution spatial measurements, or permit highly sensitive lipid assays in single cells. Covered in this review are mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, and fluorescence-based assays including microscopy and microseparations.", "generated_text": "The study of lipids at the single-cell level is crucial for understanding cellular heterogeneity and lipid-related diseases. This review explores advanced analytical techniques employed in single-cell biochemical assays of lipids, focusing on mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, capillary electrophoresis, and thin layer chromatography. Mass spectrometry offers high sensitivity and specificity, enabling detailed lipid profiling. Raman imaging provides non-destructive, label-free analysis, allowing for spatial distribution mapping of lipids within cells. Capillary electrophoresis, with its high-resolution separation capabilities, is effective for analyzing complex lipid mixtures in single cells. Thin layer chromatography, although less sensitive, remains a valuable tool for preliminary lipid separation and identification. The integration of these techniques enhances the understanding of lipidomics at the single-cell level, offering insights into cellular metabolism and disease mechanisms. Future advancements in these methodologies promise to further unravel the complexities of lipid function and regulation in individual cells.", "label": 1}
