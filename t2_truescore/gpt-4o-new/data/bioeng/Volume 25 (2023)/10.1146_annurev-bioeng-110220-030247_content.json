{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are currently widely employed in medicine and healthcare. A PubMed search returns more than 100,000 articles on these topics published between 2018 and 2022 alone. Notwithstanding several recent reviews in various subfields of AI and ML in medicine, we have yet to see a comprehensive review around the methods\u2019 use in longitudinal analysis and prediction of an individual patient's health status within a personalized disease pathway. This review seeks to fill that gap. After an overview of the AI and ML methods employed in this field and of specific medical applications of models of this type, the review discusses the strengths and limitations of current studies and looks ahead to future strands of research in this field. We aim to enable interested readers to gain a detailed impression of the research currently available and accordingly plan future work around predictive models for deterioration in health status.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into healthcare has the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine by predicting health deterioration and understanding disease pathways. This study explores the development of predictive models that utilize time series data to analyze digital health pathways and disease trajectories. By leveraging large datasets, these models can identify patterns and early indicators of disease progression, enabling timely interventions tailored to individual patients. The research focuses on the application of advanced ML algorithms to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions, thereby improving patient outcomes. The findings suggest that AI-driven models can significantly contribute to the personalization of treatment plans, offering a more nuanced understanding of disease mechanisms. This approach not only facilitates early diagnosis but also supports the design of targeted therapies, ultimately advancing the field of digital health. The study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in harnessing AI for transformative healthcare solutions.", "label": 0}
