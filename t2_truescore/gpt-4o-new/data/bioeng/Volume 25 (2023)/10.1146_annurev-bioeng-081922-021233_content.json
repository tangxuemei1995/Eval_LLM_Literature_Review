{"grounding": "The central dogma of gene expression involves DNA transcription to RNA and RNA translation into protein. As key intermediaries and modifiers, RNAs undergo various forms of modifications such as methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation. These modifications, termed epitranscriptional regulations, lead to functional changes in RNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated crucial roles for RNA modifications in gene translation, DNA damage response, and cell fate regulation. Epitranscriptional modifications play an essential role in development, mechanosensing, atherogenesis, and regeneration in the cardiovascular (CV) system, and their elucidation is critically important to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CV physiology and pathophysiology. This review aims at providing biomedical engineers with an overview of the epitranscriptome landscape, related key concepts, recent findings in epitranscriptional regulations, and tools for epitranscriptome analysis. The potential applications of this important field in biomedical engineering research are discussed.", "generated_text": "Epitranscriptional regulation, a burgeoning field within molecular biology, explores the dynamic modifications of RNA molecules and their implications for gene expression. This review delves into the intersection of epitranscriptomics and cardiovascular bioengineering, highlighting the potential for novel therapeutic strategies. The epitranscriptome encompasses a variety of chemical modifications, such as methylation and acetylation, which can influence RNA stability, localization, and translation. In the context of cardiovascular health, these modifications play crucial roles in the regulation of genes involved in heart development, function, and disease. By integrating insights from RNA biology with engineering principles, researchers aim to develop innovative approaches to modulate gene expression in cardiovascular tissues. This synthesis of disciplines promises to advance our understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology and foster the development of targeted interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cardiovascular diseases.", "label": 1}
