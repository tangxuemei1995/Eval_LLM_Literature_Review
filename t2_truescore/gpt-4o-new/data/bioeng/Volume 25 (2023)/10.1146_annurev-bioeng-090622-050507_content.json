{"grounding": "Penetrating neural electrodes provide a powerful approach to decipher brain circuitry by allowing for time-resolved electrical detections of individual action potentials. This unique capability has contributed tremendously to basic and translational neuroscience, enabling both fundamental understandings of brain functions and applications of human prosthetic devices that restore crucial sensations and movements. However, conventional approaches are limited by the scarce number of available sensing channels and compromised efficacy over long-term implantations. Recording longevity and scalability have become the most sought-after improvements in emerging technologies. In this review, we discuss the technological advances in the past 5\u201310 years that have enabled larger-scale, more detailed, and longer-lasting recordings of neural circuits at work than ever before. We present snapshots of the latest advances in penetration electrode technology, showcase their applications in animal models and humans, and outline the underlying design principles and considerations to fuel future technological development.", "generated_text": "The development of penetrating neural electrodes has significantly advanced the field of electrophysiology, enabling precise interfacing with neural tissue for both research and clinical applications. This paper reviews recent advancements in electrode technology aimed at achieving large-scale neural recordings and enhancing the longevity of implants. Innovations in materials science, such as the use of biocompatible and flexible substrates, have been pivotal in reducing tissue response and improving chronic stability. Additionally, the integration of microfabrication techniques has facilitated the production of high-density electrode arrays, allowing for comprehensive mapping of neural circuits. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in maintaining electrode functionality over extended periods due to biological and mechanical factors. This review highlights current strategies to address these issues, including surface modifications and novel electrode designs, and discusses future directions for the development of durable, large-scale neural interfaces that can withstand the demands of chronic implantation.", "label": 1}
