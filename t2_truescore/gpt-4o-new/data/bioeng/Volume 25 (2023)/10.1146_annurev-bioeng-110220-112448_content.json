{"grounding": "Energy-efficient sensing with physically secure communication for biosensors on, around, and within the human body is a major area of research for the development of low-cost health care devices, enabling continuous monitoring and/or secure perpetual operation. When used as a network of nodes, these devices form the Internet of Bodies, which poses challenges including stringent resource constraints, simultaneous sensing and communication, and security vulnerabilities. Another major challenge is to find an efficient on-body energy-harvesting method to support the sensing, communication, and security submodules. Due to limitations in the amount of energy harvested, we require a reduction in energy consumed per unit information, making the use of in-sensor analytics and processing imperative. In this article, we review the challenges and opportunities of low-power sensing, processing, and communication with possible powering modalities for future biosensor nodes. Specifically, we analyze, compare, and contrast (a) different sensing mechanisms such as voltage/current domain versus time domain, (b) low-power, secure communication modalities including wireless techniques and human body communication, and (c) different powering techniques for wearable devices and implants.", "generated_text": "The integration of bioelectronic sensor nodes into the Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative advancement in healthcare and personal monitoring.
