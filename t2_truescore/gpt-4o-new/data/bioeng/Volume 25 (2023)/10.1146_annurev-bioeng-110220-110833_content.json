{"grounding": "Brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to treat sensorimotor neurological disorders by creating artificial motor and/or sensory pathways. Introducing artificial pathways creates new relationships between sensory input and motor output, which the brain must learn to gain dexterous control. This review highlights the role of learning in BMIs to restore movement and sensation, and discusses how BMI design may influence neural plasticity and performance. The close integration of plasticity in sensory and motor function influences the design of both artificial pathways and will be an essential consideration for bidirectional devices that restore both sensory and motor function.", "generated_text": "This study explores the role of neural plasticity in sensorimotor brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs), focusing on how sensory and motor learning processes adapt neural circuits. By examining the dynamic interactions between neural plasticity and BMI performance, we identify key mechanisms that facilitate adaptation and learning in neural circuits. Our findings suggest that targeted modulation of plasticity can enhance BMI efficiency, offering insights into optimizing sensory and motor integration. This research advances our understanding of neural adaptation in BMIs, with implications for developing more effective neuroprosthetic devices and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with motor impairments.", "label": 1}
