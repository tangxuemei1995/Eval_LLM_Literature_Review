{"grounding": "Over the past decade, the increased adoption of electroporation-based technologies has led to an expansion of clinical research initiatives. Electroporation has been utilized in molecular biology for mammalian and bacterial transfection; for food sanitation; and in therapeutic settings to increase drug uptake, for gene therapy, and to eliminate cancerous tissues. We begin this article by discussing the biophysics required for understanding the concepts behind the cell permeation phenomenon that is electroporation. We then review nano- and microscale single-cell electroporation technologies before scaling up to emerging in vivo applications.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in electroporation technologies have significantly enhanced their application from bench to clinic. Pulsed field ablation has emerged as a promising technique for precise tissue ablation, while transfection methods have improved gene therapy delivery. Innovations in electrochemotherapy have increased the efficacy of cancer treatments. Additionally, the integration of microfluidics has optimized the control and efficiency of electroporation processes. These developments are paving the way for more effective and targeted therapeutic interventions, highlighting the potential of electroporation in clinical settings.", "label": 0}
