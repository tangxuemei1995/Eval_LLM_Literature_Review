{"grounding": "One of the greatest concerns in the subzero storage of cells, tissues, and organs is the ability to control the nucleation or recrystallization of ice. In nature, evidence of these processes, which aid in sustaining internal temperatures below the physiologic freezing point for extended periods of time, is apparent in freeze-avoidant and freeze-tolerant organisms. After decades of studying these proteins, we now have easily accessible compounds and materials capable of recapitulating the mechanisms seen in nature for biopreser-vation applications. The output from this burgeoning area of research can interact synergistically with other novel developments in the field of cryobiology, making it an opportune time for a review on this topic.", "generated_text": "The study explores the development of engineered compounds designed to modulate ice nucleation and recrystallization processes, crucial for applications in cryopreservation and climate science. By mimicking the properties of natural antifreeze (glyco)proteins, these compounds exhibit significant thermal hysteresis, effectively lowering the freezing point and inhibiting ice growth. The research highlights the synthesis and characterization of these compounds, demonstrating their ability to control ice crystal formation and growth. Experimental results indicate a promising potential for these engineered molecules to enhance the stability of frozen biological materials and improve the efficiency of de-icing technologies. This work paves the way for innovative solutions in managing ice-related challenges across various fields.", "label": 0}
