{"grounding": "Cell functions rely on signal transduction\u2014the cascades of molecular interactions and biochemical reactions that relay extracellular signals to the cell interior. Dissecting principles governing the signal transduction process is critical for the fundamental understanding of cell physiology and the development of biomedical interventions. The complexity of cell signaling is, however, beyond what is accessible by conventional biochemistry assays. Thanks to their unique physical and chemical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly used for the quantitative measurement and manipulation of cell signaling. Even though research in this area is still in its infancy, it has the potential to yield new, paradigm-shifting knowledge of cell biology and lead to biomedical innovations. To highlight this importance, we summarize in this review studies that pioneered the development and application of NPs for cell signaling, from quantitative measurements of signaling molecules to spatiotemporal manipulation of cell signal transduction.", "generated_text": "The integration of nanoparticles into the study of cell signaling offers a transformative approach to understanding complex intracellular processes.
