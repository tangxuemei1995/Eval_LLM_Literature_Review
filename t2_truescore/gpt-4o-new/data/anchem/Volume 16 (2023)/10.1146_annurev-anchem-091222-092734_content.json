{"grounding": "In recent years, there has been a revived appreciation for the importance of spatial context and morphological phenotypes for both understanding disease progression and guiding treatment decisions. Compared with conventional 2D histopathology, which is the current gold standard of medical diagnostics, nondestructive 3D pathology offers researchers and clinicians the ability to visualize orders of magnitude more tissue within their natural volumetric context. This has been enabled by rapid advances in tissue-preparation methods, high-throughput 3D microscopy instrumentation, and computational tools for processing these massive feature-rich data sets. Here, we provide a brief overview of many of these technical advances along with remaining challenges to be overcome. We also speculate on the future of 3D pathology as applied in translational investigations, preclinical drug development, and clinical decision-support assays.", "generated_text": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) offers a transformative approach to nondestructive 3D pathology, enabling unprecedented insights into tissue architecture and cellular interactions. This technique, pivotal for translational research and clinical assays, integrates computational and digital pathology with optical-sectioning microscopy to enhance spatial biology analysis. By providing high-resolution, volumetric imaging, LSFM facilitates precise mapping of molecular and cellular landscapes, crucial for advancing precision medicine. The method's ability to preserve tissue integrity while delivering comprehensive spatial data supports its application in diverse pathological assessments, from tumor microenvironment studies to organ-wide disease mapping. This paper explores the integration of LSFM in clinical workflows, highlighting its potential to revolutionize diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies through enhanced visualization and quantification of complex biological systems.", "label": 0}
