{"grounding": "Since the early 1990s, single-molecule detection in solution at room temperature has enabled direct observation of single biomolecules at work in real time and under physiological conditions, providing insights into complex biological systems that the traditional ensemble methods cannot offer. In particular, recent advances in single-molecule tracking techniques allow researchers to follow individual biomolecules in their native environments for a timescale of seconds to minutes, revealing not only the distinct pathways these biomolecules take for downstream signaling but also their roles in supporting life. In this review, we discuss various single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques developed to date, with an emphasis on advanced three-dimensional (3D) tracking systems that not only achieve ultrahigh spatiotemporal resolution but also provide sufficient working depths suitable for tracking single molecules in 3D tissue models. We then summarize the observables that can be extracted from the trajectory data. Methods to perform single-molecule clustering analysis and future directions are also discussed.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to study dynamic biological processes at the molecular level. Innovations such as feedback-control tracking and point-spread-function engineering have improved the precision and temporal resolution of single-molecule observations. These techniques allow for the real-time tracking of individual molecules in complex environments, providing insights into their behavior and interactions. Multiple plane microscopy has further expanded the dimensionality of single-molecule imaging, enabling the capture of three-dimensional trajectories and facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of molecular dynamics. Advanced trajectory analysis and clustering analysis methods have been developed to interpret the vast amounts of data generated, allowing researchers to identify patterns and infer molecular mechanisms with greater accuracy. These technological advancements are paving the way for new discoveries in fields such as cell biology, biophysics, and nanotechnology, offering unprecedented opportunities to explore the fundamental processes of life at the single-molecule level.", "label": 1}
