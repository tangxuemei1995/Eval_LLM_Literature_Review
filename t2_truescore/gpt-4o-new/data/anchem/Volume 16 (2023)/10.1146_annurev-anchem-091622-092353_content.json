{"grounding": "The identification of thousands of proteins and their relative levels of expression has furthered understanding of biological processes and disease and stimulated new systems biology hypotheses. Quantitative proteomics workflows that rely on analytical assays such as mass spectrometry have facilitated high-throughput measurements of proteins partially due to multiplexing. Multiplexing allows proteome differences across multiple samples to be measured simultaneously, resulting in more accurate quantitation, increased statistical robustness, reduced analysis times, and lower experimental costs. The number of samples that can be multiplexed has evolved from as few as two to more than 50, with studies involving more than 10 samples being denoted as enhanced multiplexing or hyperplexing. In this review, we give an update on emerging multiplexing proteomics techniques and highlight advantages and limitations for enhanced multiplexing strategies.", "generated_text": "The advancement of multiplexing technology has significantly transformed proteomics, enabling high-throughput analysis of complex biological samples. This study explores the development of enhanced multiplexing, or hyperplexing, techniques that increase the number of analytes measured simultaneously, thereby improving data throughput and accuracy. By integrating automation with these advanced multiplexing strategies, we achieve a streamlined workflow that reduces manual intervention and error rates. The implementation of hyperplexing in proteomics not only accelerates the pace of discovery but also enhances the depth of proteomic profiling, providing a more comprehensive understanding of protein dynamics. Our findings demonstrate the potential of these technologies to revolutionize proteomic research, offering new insights into biological processes and disease mechanisms. This work underscores the importance of continued innovation in multiplexing methodologies to meet the growing demands of proteomic analysis.", "label": 1}
