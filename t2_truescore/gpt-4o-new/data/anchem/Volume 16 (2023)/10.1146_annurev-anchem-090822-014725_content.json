{"grounding": "Biosensing based on CRISPR-Cas systems is a young but rapidly evolving technology. The unprecedented properties of the CRISPR-Cas system provide an innovative tool for developing new-generation biosensing strategies. To date, a series of nucleic acid and non-nucleic acid detection methods have been developed based on the CRISPR platform. In this review, we first introduce the core biochemical properties underpinning the development of CRISPR bioassays, such as diverse reaction temperatures, programmability in design, high reaction efficiency, and recognition specificity, and highlight recent efforts to improve these parameters. We then introduce the technical developments, including how to improve sensitivity and quantification capabilities, develop multiplex assays, achieve convenient one-pot assays, create advanced sensors, and extend the applications of detection. Finally, we analyze obstacles to the commercial application of CRISPR detection technology and explore development opportunities and directions.", "generated_text": "CRISPR-based biosensing strategies have emerged as a transformative approach in the detection and analysis of nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules. This review highlights recent technical advancements in CRISPR technology, focusing on its integration into biosensing platforms. The programmability and specificity of CRISPR systems, particularly CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13, have enabled the development of highly sensitive and selective biosensors. These systems offer rapid, cost-effective, and portable solutions for diagnostic applications, ranging from infectious disease detection to environmental monitoring. The versatility of CRISPR-based biosensors is further enhanced by their ability to be adapted for multiplexed and real-time analysis. Future prospects include the expansion of CRISPR biosensing to broader applications, improved signal amplification techniques, and the integration with microfluidic and digital platforms, paving the way for next-generation diagnostic tools.", "label": 1}
