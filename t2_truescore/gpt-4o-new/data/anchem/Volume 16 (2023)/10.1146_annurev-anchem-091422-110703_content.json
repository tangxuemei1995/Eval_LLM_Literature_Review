{"grounding": "Developing a deeper understanding of dynamic chemical, electronic, and morphological changes at interfaces is key to solving practical issues in electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs). To unravel this complexity, an assortment of tools with distinct capabilities and spatiotemporal resolutions have been used to creatively visualize interfacial processes as they occur. This review highlights how electrochemical scanning probe techniques (ESPTs) such as electrochemical atomic force microscopy, scanning electrochemical microscopy, scanning ion conductance microscopy, and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy are uniquely positioned to address these challenges in EESSs. We describe the operating principles of ESPTs, focusing on the inspection of interfacial structure and chemical processes involved in Li-ion batteries and beyond. We discuss current examples, performance limitations, and complementary ESPTs. Finally, we discuss prospects for imaging improvements and deep learning for automation. We foresee that ESPTs will play an enabling role in advancing EESSs as we transition to renewable energies.", "generated_text": "The study of interfaces in energy storage systems is crucial for advancing battery technology. This paper reviews the application of scanning probe methods, including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy (SECCM), Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM), and Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM), in electrochemical imaging of these interfaces. These techniques provide high-resolution insights into the morphological and electrochemical properties of battery interfaces, which are pivotal for understanding degradation mechanisms and improving performance. The integration of automation and deep learning algorithms is highlighted as a transformative approach to enhance data acquisition and analysis, enabling more efficient and accurate characterization.
