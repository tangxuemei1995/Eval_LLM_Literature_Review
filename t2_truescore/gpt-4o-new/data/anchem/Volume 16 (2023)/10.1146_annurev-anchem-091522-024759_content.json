{"grounding": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect tropical and subtropical countries and are caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. These kinds of diseases spread quickly due to the tropical climate and limited access to clean water, sanitation, and health care, which make exposed people more vulnerable. NTDs are reported to be difficult and inefficient to diagnose. As mentioned, most NTDs occur in countries that are socially vulnerable, and the lack of resources and access to modern laboratories and equipment intensify the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment, leading to an increase in the mortality rate. Portable and low-cost microfluidic systems have been widely applied for clinical diagnosis, offering a promising alternative that can meet the needs for fast, affordable, and reliable diagnostic tests in developing countries. This review provides a critical overview of microfluidic devices that have been reported in the literature for the detection of the most common NTDs over the past 5 years.", "generated_text": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect over a billion people worldwide, predominantly in low-resource settings where access to advanced diagnostic tools is limited. This study explores the development and application of low-cost microfluidic systems for the detection of NTDs, focusing on paper-based microfluidics and lateral flow assays. These systems offer a promising alternative to traditional diagnostic methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests, providing rapid, point-of-care testing capabilities. The integration of microfluidic technology with simple, cost-effective materials enables the creation of portable diagnostic devices that are both user-friendly and efficient. By leveraging the principles of fluid dynamics and capillary action, these systems can deliver accurate results with minimal sample volumes and without the need for complex laboratory infrastructure. This research highlights the potential of microfluidic platforms to revolutionize clinical diagnosis in resource-limited settings, ultimately improving disease management and patient outcomes for those affected by NTDs.", "label": 0}
