{"grounding": "This article critically reviews analytical method validation and quality control applied to the environmental chemistry field. The review focuses on the determination of organic micropollutants (OMPs), specifically emerging contaminants and pesticides, in the aquatic environment. The analytical technique considered is (gas and liquid) chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), including high-resolution MS for wide-scope screening purposes. An analysis of current research practices outlined in the literature has been performed, and key issues and analytical challenges are identified and critically discussed. It is worth emphasizing the lack of specific guidelines applied to environmental analytical chemistry and the minimal regulation of OMPs in waters, which greatly affect method development and performance, requirements for method validation, and the subsequent application to samples. Finally, a proposal is made for method validation and data reporting, which can be understood as starting points for further discussion with specialists in environmental analytical chemistry.", "generated_text": "The accurate detection and quantification of organic micropollutants in water samples are critical for environmental monitoring and public health. This study explores efficient validation strategies in environmental analytical chemistry, emphasizing method validation, quality assurance, and quality control. We focus on the application of liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, which are pivotal in identifying and quantifying trace levels of organic micropollutants. The research outlines a comprehensive approach to method validation, including precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity assessments, ensuring reliable analytical results. Quality assurance and control measures are discussed to maintain the integrity of analytical processes and data. The study highlights the importance of robust validation protocols to enhance the reliability of environmental assessments and regulatory compliance. By optimizing these strategies, the research aims to improve the detection capabilities and analytical performance in monitoring organic micropollutants in aquatic environments.", "label": 1}
