{"grounding": "Offering superb speed, chemical specificity, and analytical sensitivity, direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies are highly amenable for the molecular analysis of complex tissues to aid in disease characterization and help identify new diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers. By enabling detection of clinically actionable molecular profiles from tissues and cells, direct MS technologies have the potential to guide treatment decisions and transform sample analysis within clinical workflows. In this review, we highlight recent health-related developments and applications of direct MS technologies that exhibit tangible potential to accelerate clinical research and disease diagnosis, including oncological and neurodegenerative diseases and microbial infections. We focus primarily on applications that employ direct MS technologies for tissue analysis, including MS imaging technologies to map spatial distributions of molecules in situ as well as handheld devices for rapid in vivo and ex vivo tissue analysis.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in direct mass spectrometry technologies have significantly enhanced tissue analysis, offering promising applications in clinical diagnostics. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as a powerful tool, providing spatially resolved molecular information that aids in the understanding of complex biological systems. The development of ambient ionization techniques has further expanded the capabilities of MSI, allowing for rapid and minimally invasive analysis of tissues in their native state. These innovations have paved the way for the creation of handheld mass spectrometry-based devices, which hold the potential to revolutionize point-of-care diagnostics by enabling real-time, on-site analysis. This review highlights the latest technological advancements in direct mass spectrometry, explores their emerging medical applications, and discusses the challenges and future directions in integrating these technologies into routine clinical practice. The integration of these cutting-edge tools promises to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
