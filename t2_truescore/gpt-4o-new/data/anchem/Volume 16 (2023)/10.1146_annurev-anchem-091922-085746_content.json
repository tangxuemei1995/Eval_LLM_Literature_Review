{"grounding": "In situ water monitoring sensors are critical to gain an understanding of ocean biochemistry and ecosystem health. They enable the collection of high-frequency data and capture ecosystem spatial and temporal changes, which in turn facilitate long-term global predictions. They are used as decision support tools in emergency situations and for risk mitigation, pollution source tracking, and regulatory monitoring. Advanced sensing platforms exist to support various monitoring needs together with state-of-the-art power and communication capabilities. To be fit-for-purpose, sensors must withstand the challenging marine environment and provide data at an acceptable cost. Significant technological advancements have catalyzed the development of new and improved sensors for coastal and oceanographic applications. Sensors are becoming smaller, smarter, more cost-effective, and increasingly specialized and diversified. This article, therefore, provides a review of the state-of-the art oceanographic and coastal sensors. Progress in sensor development is discussed in terms of performance and the key strategies used for achieving robustness, marine rating, cost reduction, and antifouling protection.", "generated_text": "The increasing need for comprehensive coastal and ocean monitoring has driven advancements in sensor technologies, enabling more effective environmental management and research. This review explores the current state of in situ sensors and sensor networks used in oceanography, emphasizing their applications in coastal monitoring. Key technologies include a variety of sensors capable of measuring physical, chemical, and biological parameters, which are crucial for understanding complex marine ecosystems. The integration of these sensors into networks enhances data collection, providing real-time insights into oceanic conditions. However, challenges such as biofouling, which affects sensor accuracy and longevity, remain significant obstacles. This review discusses recent innovations aimed at mitigating biofouling and improving sensor performance. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing robust sensor systems that can adapt to the dynamic marine environment. Future directions include the advancement of autonomous platforms and the incorporation of artificial intelligence to enhance data analysis and decision-making processes.", "label": 1}
