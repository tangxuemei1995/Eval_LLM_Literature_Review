{"grounding": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging records spatially resolved molecular vibrational spectra, enabling a comprehensive measurement of the chemical makeup and heterogeneity of biological tissues. Combining this novel contrast mechanism in microscopy with the use of artificial intelligence can transform the practice of histopathology, which currently relies largely on human examination of morphologic patterns within stained tissue. First, this review summarizes IR imaging instrumentation especially suited to histopathology, analyses of its performance, and major trends. Second, an overview of data processing methods and application of machine learning is given, with an emphasis on the emerging use of deep learning. Third, a discussion on workflows in pathology is provided, with four categories proposed based on the complexity of methods and the analytical performance needed. Last, a set of guidelines, termed experimental and analytical specifications for spectroscopic imaging in histopathology, are proposed to help standardize the diversity of approaches in this emerging area.", "generated_text": "Digital histopathology using infrared spectroscopic imaging represents a transformative approach in the analysis of tissue samples. This method leverages the unique vibrational signatures of molecular bonds, providing a chemical map of the tissue without the need for staining. The integration of machine learning and deep learning algorithms enhances the interpretative power of infrared spectroscopy, enabling automated and accurate classification of pathological states. Recent advancements in imaging technology have improved spatial resolution and acquisition speed, making it feasible for clinical applications. The combination of chemical imaging with digital pathology offers a non-destructive, label-free alternative to traditional histological techniques, potentially increasing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This review discusses the current state of infrared spectroscopic imaging in digital pathology, highlighting its advantages, challenges, and future prospects. Emphasis is placed on the role of computational methods in processing and analyzing complex spectral data, which is crucial for the successful implementation of this technology in routine clinical practice.", "label": 1}
