{"grounding": "Biofilms are multicellular communities held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix and exhibit a set of properties that distinguish them from free-living bacteria. Biofilms are exposed to a variety of mechanical and chemical cues resulting from fluid motion and mass transport. Microfluidics provides the precise control of hydrodynamic and physicochemical microenvironments to study biofilms in general. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in microfluidics-based biofilm research, including understanding the mechanism of bacterial adhesion and biofilm development, assessment of antifouling and antimicrobial properties, development of advanced in vitro infection models, and advancement in methods to characterize biofilms. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future direction of microfluidics-assisted biofilm research.", "generated_text": "Microfluidics has emerged as a transformative tool for studying biofilms, offering precise control over flow dynamics and shear stress, which are critical for understanding biofilm formation and behavior. This technology enables in situ visualization of biofilms, providing real-time insights into their structural and functional dynamics. The integration of microfluidics with organ-on-chip systems and biosensors enhances the study of biofilm interactions with host tissues and the environment. Furthermore, microfluidic platforms are pivotal in evaluating antifouling strategies and antimicrobial resistance, facilitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches. This review highlights the potential of microfluidics in advancing biofilm research, emphasizing its role in addressing critical challenges in healthcare and environmental applications.", "label": 1}
