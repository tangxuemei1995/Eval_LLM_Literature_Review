{"grounding": "Gel matrices are fundamental to electrophoresis analyses of biopolymers in microscale channels. Both capillary gel and microchannel gel electrophoresis systems have produced fundamental advances in the scientific community. These analytical techniques remain as foundational tools in bioanalytical chemistry and are indispensable in the field of biotherapeutics. This review summarizes the current state of gels in microscale channels and provides a brief description of electrophoretic transport in gels. In addition to the discussion of traditional polymers, several nontraditional gels are introduced. Advances in gel matrices highlighted include selective polymers modified to contain added functionality as well as thermally responsive gels formed through self-assembly. This review discusses cutting-edge applications to challenging areas of discovery in DNA, RNA, protein, and glycan analyses. Finally, emerging techniques that result in multifunctional assays for real-time biochemical processing in capillary and three-dimensional channels are identified.", "generated_text": "Gels in microscale electrophoresis have revolutionized the separation and analysis of biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans. This study explores the application of capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microfluidic gel electrophoresis (MGE) in providing high-resolution separations with minimal sample and reagent consumption. The choice of sieving matrix is critical, influencing the separation efficiency and resolution. Advances in gel formulations and microfabrication techniques have enhanced the performance of these systems, enabling rapid and precise analysis in various fields, including genomics, proteomics, and glycomics. This paper reviews recent developments in gel materials and their integration into microfluidic platforms, highlighting their impact on analytical throughput and sensitivity. The findings underscore the potential of microscale electrophoresis technologies to facilitate high-throughput biomolecular analysis, offering significant advantages over traditional electrophoresis methods in terms of speed, efficiency, and scalability.", "label": 1}
