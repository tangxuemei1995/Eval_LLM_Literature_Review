{"grounding": "Recent developments in ion mobility (IM) technology have expanded the capability to separate and characterize gas-phase ions of biomolecules, especially when paired with mass spectrometry. This next generation of IM technology has been ushered in by creative innovation focused on both instrument architectures and how electric fields are applied. In this review, we focus on the application of high-resolution and multidimensional IM to biomolecular analyses, encompassing the fields of glycomics, lipidomics, peptidomics, and proteomics. We highlight selected research that demonstrates the application of the new IM toolkit to challenging biomolecular systems. Through our review of recently published literature, we outline the current strengths of respective technologies and perspectives for future applications.", "generated_text": "Next-generation ion mobility experiments are revolutionizing the field of mass spectrometry by providing enhanced multidimensional analysis capabilities. These advanced techniques enable the separation and identification of complex biomolecules with unprecedented precision, facilitating detailed structural elucidation. By integrating ion mobility with mass spectrometry, researchers can achieve higher resolution and sensitivity, allowing for the discrimination of isomeric and conformational variants. This approach significantly improves molecular identification processes, offering deeper insights into biomolecular structures and interactions.
