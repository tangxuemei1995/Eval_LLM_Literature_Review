{"grounding": "As tens of thousands swarmed the US Capitol Grounds on January 6th, 2021, to oppose the election of Joe Biden as President, thousands among them assaulted officers and breached the building to stop the certification of the election results, leading to nine deaths and hundreds of injuries. Despite being an act of terrorism and evidence that far-right extremists planned to take over the government, some dismiss January 6th as legitimate political discourse. This divisive response starkly contrasts with the unifying response to the jihadi attacks on September 11th two decades earlier, raising the question as to why the country has not also united against far-right extremism. This review argues that the Bush administration misused deterrence in response to the September 11th attacks. While unifying the country, it also disproportionately punished innocent Muslims and legitimized anti-Muslim ideals, giving rise to anti-Muslim hate crimes and backlash by jihadi extremists and emboldening violence from far-right extremists. This review combines research on deterrence, counterterrorism, anti-Muslim ideals, and far-right organizations with data on terrorism and hate crimes within the United States to delineate this argument and assess its alignment with the empirical progression of violence between September 11th and January 6th.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolution and dynamics of far-right and jihadi terrorism within the United States from the September 11th attacks in 2001 to the January 6th Capitol insurrection in 2021. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of hate crimes, extremist activities, and terrorist incidents, this research delineates the ideological, operational, and strategic differences and similarities between far-right and jihadi extremist groups. The findings reveal a significant shift in the domestic terrorism landscape, with far-right extremism increasingly surpassing jihadi terrorism in frequency and impact. The study highlights the role of social media and online platforms in radicalizing individuals and facilitating the organization of extremist activities. Furthermore, it explores the socio-political factors contributing to the rise of far-right extremism, including economic disenfranchisement, political polarization, and the mainstreaming of extremist rhetoric. The research underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the motivations and methods of these groups to inform effective counter-terrorism strategies. By comparing the trajectories of these two forms of extremism, the study provides insights into the broader implications for national security and the challenges of addressing domestic terrorism in a rapidly changing socio-political environment.", "label": 1}
