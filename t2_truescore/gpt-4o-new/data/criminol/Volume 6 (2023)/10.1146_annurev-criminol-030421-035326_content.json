{"grounding": "This review collects and critiques the academic literature on criminal defense lawyering, with an emphasis on empirical work. Research on criminal defense attorneys in the United States has traditionally emphasized scarcity of resources: too many people facing criminal charges who are \u201ctoo poor to pay\u201d for counsel and not enough funding to pay for the constitutionally mandated lawyers. Scholars have focused on the capacity of different delivery systems, such as public defender offices, to change the ultimate outcomes in criminal cases within their tight budgetary constraints. Over the decades, however, theoretical understandings of the defense attorney's work have expanded to include client interests outside the criminal courtroom, reaching the broader social conditions connected to the alleged criminal act. Researchers have responded by asking a broader range of questions about the effectiveness of defense counsel outside the courtroom and by using improved data to study the effectiveness of lawyers at discrete procedural stages.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of expanded criminal defense lawyering, emphasizing the integration of holistic defense strategies to enhance the effectiveness of counsel for indigent defendants. Traditional defense counsel often focuses narrowly on legal representation, potentially neglecting broader social and economic factors that influence client outcomes. Holistic defense, by contrast, addresses these factors by incorporating social services, mental health support, and community resources into the defense strategy. This approach aims to provide more comprehensive and effective assistance of counsel, thereby upholding the constitutional right to counsel and mitigating the systemic issues contributing to mass incarceration. The research examines case studies and empirical data to assess the impact of holistic defense on case outcomes, recidivism rates, and client satisfaction. Findings suggest that expanded defense strategies can significantly improve legal and social outcomes for defendants, advocating for policy reforms to support the widespread adoption of holistic defense models in indigent defense systems.", "label": 0}
