{"grounding": "An important body of work documents how race matters for the patterning of crime and criminal legal system involvement largely by focusing on comparisons between Blacks and Whites. We build on this vital scholarship by spotlighting Latino/a/xs, a fast-growing group that is the United States\u2019 largest racial minority, to broaden the field's understanding of race and crime. In this review, we follow race scholars who see Latino/a/xs as a racial category because dominant actors racialize them as an innate, distinct, inferior, and criminogenic category, leading to their marginalized experiences across many domains. Moreover, Latino/a/xs increasingly view themselves as not White. Studying Latino/a/xs offers an opportunity to integrate key tenets of Latina and Latino Critical Legal Theory (LatCrit), which provide a scaffolding to center race and racism. LatCrit highlights the ways racism metes out discrimination, cultural and linguistic devaluation, criminalization, and racial profiling that in turn shape and are shaped by levels of Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement. This article provides a description of what it means to center race with an emphasis on LatCrit,an empirical assessment of Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement, and an integration of core criminological theory with LatCrit. By doing so, we advance the field to more directly and robustly engage with the idea that racial disparities in crime and legal system involvement are products of racialization as well as attendant policies, institutions, and practices that historically and contemporaneously subjugate and marginalize the Latino/a/x population. We seek to push the boundaries of criminology theory and thereby invigorate and equip them for the twenty-first century and its racial landscape, which is increasingly Latino/a/x.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of Latino/a/x experiences with the criminal legal system through the lens of LatCrit, a branch of critical race theory that focuses on the unique social, political, and economic challenges faced by Latino/a/x communities. Despite the growing Latino/a/x population in the United States, criminological theories have historically overlooked the nuanced ways in which race and ethnicity shape their interactions with the criminal justice system. This paper seeks to fill this gap by integrating LatCrit perspectives into criminological discourse, offering a more comprehensive understanding of Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement. \n\nThe research examines how systemic racism, cultural stereotypes, and socio-economic disparities contribute to the overrepresentation of Latino/a/x individuals in crime statistics and their disproportionate involvement in the criminal legal system. By employing a LatCrit framework, the study highlights the importance of considering the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, and other identity markers in criminological research. It also critiques existing criminological theories for their failure to adequately address the structural and institutional factors that influence Latino/a/x criminalization. \n\nThrough a review of existing literature and case studies, this paper demonstrates the need for a paradigm shift in criminology that incorporates LatCrit insights to better understand and address the complexities of Latino/a/x experiences with crime and justice. The findings underscore the importance of developing policies and practices that are informed by a critical understanding of race and ethnicity, ultimately advocating for a more equitable and just criminal legal system. This research contributes to the broader discourse on race, ethnicity, and justice, urging scholars and policymakers to re-evaluate traditional criminological approaches in light of LatCrit theory.", "label": 1}
