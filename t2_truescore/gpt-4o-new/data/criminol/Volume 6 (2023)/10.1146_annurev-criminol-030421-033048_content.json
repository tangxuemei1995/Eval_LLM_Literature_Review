{"grounding": "Ethnographic studies of immigration and crime were prominent in the early decades of the twentieth century, yet contemporary scholarship has been dominated by quantitative approaches. In this review, we heed the call of those who have lamented the \u201ccollective amnesia\u201d and \u201cnewness fetish\u201d that characterize much of contemporary criminology and revisit classic ethnographies of immigration and crime, with an emphasis on the unique methodological contributions of this early work. Next, we synthesize the small but growing body of contemporary ethnographic research on immigration and crime, which includes the policing of immigrant communities in the age of \u201ccrimmigration;\u201d the lived experiences inside contemporary deportation/detention regimes; the integration experiences of Muslims, a highly marginalized but understudied population; and immigrants\u2019 unique vulnerabilities to and experiences of victimization, to illustrate the value of qualitative approaches for capturing the nuances of immigrants\u2019 experiences in the new age of immigration.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the ethnographic exploration of immigration and crime, drawing inspiration from the foundational work of the Chicago School. By employing qualitative methods, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between new immigrant communities and crime dynamics. The study critically examines how contemporary ethnographies can illuminate the socio-cultural and economic factors influencing immigrant interactions with crime, both as victims and perpetrators. Through in-depth case studies and participant observations, the research highlights the diverse experiences of new immigrants, challenging prevailing stereotypes and offering insights into their adaptive strategies within urban environments. This revitalization of ethnographic approaches seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive discourse on immigration and crime, advocating for policies that are informed by the lived realities of immigrant populations. Ultimately, the study underscores the importance of context-specific analyses in shaping effective and equitable immigration policies.", "label": 1}
