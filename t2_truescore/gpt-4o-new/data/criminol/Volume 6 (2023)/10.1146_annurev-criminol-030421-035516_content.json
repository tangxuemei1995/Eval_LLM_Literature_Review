{"grounding": "Recent years have seen increasing interest in, and scholarly discussion of, historical criminology. Yet there remains at present no clear, settled view as to what historical criminology entails, how it is best pursued, and what its future might hold. This article explores the several conceptions of historical criminology found in the present literature, which associate it variously with archival research, practical inquiry, a concern with temporality, and a certain approach to interdisciplinary scholarship. Adopting the view that historical criminology entails a special regard for historical time, the review goes on to assess its significance to the wider field, examining its connection with some of the core impulses of criminology at large. Finally, it suggests some major opportunities for historical criminology to contribute to the future development of criminology, including through an inclusive global criminology, a criminology of events, and research on crime and justice futures.", "generated_text": "This study explores the revitalization of historical criminology, emphasizing its scope, significance, and future directions. Historical criminology, which examines the interplay between crime, law, and society over time, offers critical insights into contemporary criminal justice issues. By integrating historical time into criminological analysis, researchers can uncover patterns and transformations in criminal behavior and legal responses. This interdisciplinary approach draws from history, sociology, and law, enriching our understanding of the socio-cultural contexts that shape crime and justice. The paper argues for a renewed focus on historical criminology to address current challenges in criminal justice, such as systemic inequalities and policy reform. It highlights the importance of historical perspectives in informing evidence-based practices and fostering a more nuanced understanding of crime's evolution. Future directions include expanding methodological frameworks and fostering collaborations across disciplines to enhance the field's relevance and impact in addressing modern criminological concerns.", "label": 1}
