{"grounding": "Police in the United States stand out in the developed world for their reliance on deadly force. Other nations in the Americas, however, feature higher or similar levels of fatal police violence (FPV). Cross-national comparative analyses can help identify stable and malleable factors that distinguish high-FPV from low-FPV countries. Two factors that clearly stand out among high-FPV nations are elevated rates of gun violence\u2014which fosters a preoccupation with danger and wide latitude to use preemptive force\u2014and ethnoracial inequality and discord. The latter seems to be tied to another fundamental difference between the United States and most other developed nations\u2014the \u201cradically decentralized structure of U.S. policing\u201d (Bayley & Stenning 2016). Hyperlocalism limits the influence of external oversight, along with expertise and resources for effective training, policy implementation, and accountability. However, elevated rates of FPV among some Latin American countries with relatively centralized policing demonstrate that decentralization is not a necessary condition for high FPV. Likewise, relatively low FPV in Spain and Chile suggests that achieving low FPV is also possible without the extensive resources and training that appear to suppress FPV in wealthy Northern European nations.", "generated_text": "This study examines the phenomenon of police killings in the United States through a comparative lens, highlighting the exceptional nature of American policing in terms of the use of deadly force. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, the research contrasts the frequency and circumstances of police killings in the U.S. with those in other developed nations. The analysis reveals that the decentralized structure of American policing, coupled with a lack of uniform accountability measures, contributes significantly to the higher incidence of lethal encounters. The concept of American exceptionalism is explored, suggesting that cultural, legal, and institutional factors uniquely shape the operational environment of U.S. law enforcement. The study also delves into the implications of these findings for police accountability and reform, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and enhanced oversight mechanisms. By situating American police killings within a global context, this research underscores the urgent necessity for policy interventions aimed at reducing the use of deadly force and fostering a more accountable policing framework. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on comparative policing and the pursuit of justice and equity in law enforcement practices.", "label": 1}
