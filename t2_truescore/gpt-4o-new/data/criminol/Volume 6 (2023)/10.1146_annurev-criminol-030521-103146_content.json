{"grounding": "As with past pandemics of influenza, COVID-19 tore through US prisons and jails; however, the COVID-19 pandemic, uniquely, has led to more health research on carceral systems than has been seen to date. Herein, we review the data on its impact on incarcerated people, correctional officers, health systems, and surrounding communities. We searched medical, sociological, and criminology databases from March 2020 through February 2022 for studies examining the intersection of COVID-19, prisons and jails, and health outcomes, including COVID-19 incidence, prevalence, hospitalizations, and vaccination. Our scoping review identified 77 studies\u2014the bulk of which focus on disease epidemiology in carceral systems, with a small minority that focuses on the efficacy or effectiveness of prevention and mitigation efforts, including testing, vaccination, and efforts to depopulate correctional facilities. We highlight areas for future research, including the experiences of incarcerated people and correctional staff, unanticipated health effects of prolonged quarantine, excess deaths due to delays in healthcare, and experimental studies on vaccine uptake and testing in correctional staff. These studies will enable a fuller understanding of COVID-19 and help stem future pandemics.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to carceral systems worldwide, where overcrowding, limited healthcare access, and high turnover rates exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases. This review examines the incidence of COVID-19 within prisons and jails, highlighting the unique vulnerabilities of incarcerated populations. It explores the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies implemented to curb the virus's spread, including social distancing measures, enhanced sanitation protocols, and the use of personal protective equipment. The review also assesses the role of vaccination campaigns in these settings, considering both the logistical challenges and the ethical implications of prioritizing incarcerated individuals for vaccination. Data from multiple jurisdictions are analyzed to provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact on carceral systems, with a focus on identifying best practices and areas for improvement. The findings underscore the need for systemic reforms to address the health inequities faced by incarcerated populations and emphasize the importance of integrating public health strategies into the management of correctional facilities to better prepare for future public health emergencies.", "label": 1}
