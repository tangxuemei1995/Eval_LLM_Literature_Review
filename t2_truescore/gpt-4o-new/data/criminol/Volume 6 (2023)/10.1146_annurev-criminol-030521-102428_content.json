{"grounding": "The victims of volume crime in England and Wales are aided by a major institution, Victim Support, but their voices are rarely heard when policy matters are discussed. Many victims of traumatic crimes are organized and purposeful, but they have not come together into a united front. It is the English and Welsh groups supporting abused women, groups amounting to a social movement, that have made the most visible impression on the politics of criminal justice reform at a time when there were widely publicized killings of women and a bill on domestic violence was passing through Parliament at the end of 2021.", "generated_text": "This study examines the pivotal role of victim advocacy in driving criminal justice reform in England and Wales, with a particular focus on the influence of the women's movement. It explores how advocacy efforts have reshaped policies to better support victims, emphasizing the integration of victim support services within the justice system. The research highlights the historical context of victim advocacy, tracing its evolution and impact on legislative changes. By analyzing case studies and policy developments, the study underscores the importance of continued advocacy in addressing systemic challenges and ensuring equitable justice for victims, particularly women, within the criminal justice framework.", "label": 0}
