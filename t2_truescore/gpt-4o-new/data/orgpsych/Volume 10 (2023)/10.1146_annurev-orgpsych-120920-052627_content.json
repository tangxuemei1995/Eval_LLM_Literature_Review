{"grounding": "It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the workplace impact of race from the organizational psychology and organizational behavior literature. Topical coverage is spotty and the findings are fragmented, with little existing theory to orient, integrate, and reconcile them. Consequently, it is unsurprising that public opinion is highly divergent about the influence of race at work, and practitioners are left largely unassisted in determining evidence-based approaches to leveraging this form of difference among their personnel. To fill this void, we review the relevant findings through the lens of organizational justice to help clarify the impact of race on organizational experiences. Our findings suggest that justice indeed varies as a function of race, the magnitude of differences depends on the type of justice, and there are several potentially fruitful areas for additional inquiry.", "generated_text": "This review examines the intersection of race and organizational justice, exploring how racioethnic differences influence perceptions and experiences of fairness in the workplace. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, the study investigates whether organizational justice is truly colorblind or if racial and ethnic disparities persist in the distribution of resources, decision-making processes, and interpersonal treatment. The findings suggest that while organizational justice frameworks aim to promote equity, implicit biases and structural inequalities often result in differential outcomes for racioethnic minorities. The review highlights the need for organizations to implement more inclusive policies and practices that address these disparities, fostering a more equitable work environment. Future research directions are proposed to further understand the mechanisms driving these differences and to develop strategies for enhancing justice perceptions across diverse employee groups.", "label": 1}
