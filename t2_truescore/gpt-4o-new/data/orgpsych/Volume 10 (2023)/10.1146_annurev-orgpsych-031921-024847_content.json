{"grounding": "Emerging from distinct perspectives, decent work and meaningful work are fundamental aspects of contemporary work with profound implications for individuals, organizations, and society. Decent work reflects basic workplace conditions to which all employees are entitled, whereas meaningful work is aspirational, reflecting significance at work. Following a conceptual and empirical review of scholarship on decent work and meaningful work, we draw from psychology of working theory to connect the two constructs. We argue that need satisfaction serves as the primary connector, and societal context, organizational conditions, and individual practices (in order of effectiveness) promote access to each type of work. We suggest future research directions broadening the available scholarship and methods used, promoting a focus on the complex intersection of macrolevel and psychological factors as well as interdisciplinary approaches in determining the quality of work, and engaging in intervention research to improve the way in which people live and work together.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between decent work and meaningful work, two pivotal constructs in the psychology of working. Decent work, as defined by the International Labour Organization, encompasses fair income, security, and social protection, while meaningful work pertains to the personal significance and fulfillment derived from one's job. By examining the intersection of these concepts, this research aims to elucidate how job design and work conditions contribute to the perception of meaningfulness in the workplace. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, the study identifies key factors that enhance or hinder the experience of meaningful work within the framework of decent work. The findings suggest that while decent work provides the foundational conditions necessary for meaningful work, additional elements such as autonomy, purpose, and alignment with personal values are crucial for fostering a truly meaningful work experience. This research underscores the importance of integrating both constructs to enhance employee well-being and productivity.", "label": 1}
