{"grounding": "Over the past decade, hundreds of studies have been published on employee voice and silence. In this review, I summarize that body of work, with an emphasis on the progress that has been made in our understanding of when and why employees choose to speak up or remain silent, as well as the individual and organizational implications of these choices. I identify underexplored issues, limitations in how voice has been conceptualized and studied, and promising avenues for future research. Although there has been notable progress in our knowledge of voice and silence, numerous key questions remain, and there are opportunities for the literature on voice to adopt a broader view of that construct. One of the objectives of this review is to motivate and guide research that will address those questions and explore that broader view.", "generated_text": "Over the past decade, the dynamics of employee voice and silence have garnered significant scholarly attention, reflecting their critical role in organizational success. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding how upward communication and proactive behavior influence information sharing within workplaces. The interplay between employee voice and silence is examined, highlighting the factors that encourage or inhibit employees from expressing ideas, concerns, or feedback. The review identifies key trends, such as the impact of organizational culture, leadership styles, and psychological safety on fostering an environment conducive to open communication. Additionally, it explores the consequences of silence, including missed opportunities for innovation and problem-solving. By integrating insights from recent studies, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research, offering directions for future inquiry into optimizing employee voice and minimizing silence in organizational settings.", "label": 1}
