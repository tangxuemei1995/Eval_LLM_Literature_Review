{"grounding": "The growth in virtual work is reshaping how leaders interface with their followers: Face-to-face interactions are increasingly being supplanted by virtual exchanges. To advance understanding of the implications of leading in this changing environment, we apply functional leadership theory to synthesize the findings of the virtual leadership research that has been conducted across different leadership perspectives and levels of analysis. We identify four traditional leadership functions that empirical research suggests have a stronger effect on follower need satisfaction in virtual settings and highlight a new function\u2014facilitate the use of technology\u2014as particularly germane to virtual leadership. Our review reveals several promising future research directions, including the need to examine the effects of leadership along the full spectrum of virtuality and to consider the unique challenges that leaders may encounter in hybrid work environments. We also outline important practical implications for organizations, leaders, and their followers.", "generated_text": "The transition to virtual and hybrid work environments has necessitated a reevaluation of leadership strategies. This study explores the dynamics of leading virtually, focusing on the unique challenges and opportunities presented by remote and hybrid teams. By examining dyadic interactions between leaders and team members, the research identifies key competencies required for effective virtual leadership, including communication, trust-building, and adaptability. The findings suggest that successful virtual leaders are those who can foster a sense of connection and engagement despite physical distances. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of leveraging technology to facilitate collaboration and maintain team cohesion. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this research provides insights into best practices for leading in a virtual context, offering guidance for leaders seeking to navigate the complexities of remote and hybrid work settings effectively.", "label": 1}
