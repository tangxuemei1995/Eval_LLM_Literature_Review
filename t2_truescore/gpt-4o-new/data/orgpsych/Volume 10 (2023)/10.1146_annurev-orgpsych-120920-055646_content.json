{"grounding": "We review the research on the psychology of entrepreneurship of the last decade. We focus on two key topics in entrepreneurship research: action and process. Combining action and process in a model of the psychology of entrepreneurship, we present the action theory process model of entrepreneurship and use it as a guiding framework for the review. We discuss theories of action, such as effectuation/causation, bricolage, theory of planned behavior, and action theory. Furthermore, we adopt a process perspective to discuss antecedents of actions in terms of cognition, motivation, and emotion and how they develop during the entrepreneurial process. The process perspective considers recursive relationships and dynamic changes in actions and their antecedents over time. We conclude that the action theory process model is a useful starting point to explain the psychological dynamics of entrepreneurship.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate psychological processes underpinning entrepreneurship, focusing on action theory, bricolage, cognition, motivation, effectuation, and emotion. By integrating these diverse psychological constructs, the research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how entrepreneurs navigate complex and uncertain environments. Action theory is examined to understand decision-making and behavior in entrepreneurial contexts, while bricolage highlights resourcefulness and innovation. Cognition and motivation are analyzed to reveal how mental processes and intrinsic drives influence entrepreneurial actions. Effectuation is discussed as a strategic approach that entrepreneurs use to control unpredictable futures. Additionally, the role of emotion is considered, emphasizing its impact on entrepreneurial resilience and adaptability. This multifaceted analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the psychological dimensions that drive entrepreneurial success and offers insights for fostering entrepreneurial mindsets and practices.", "label": 1}
