{"grounding": "Individual and team creativity and innovation are essential for organizational effectiveness and success. The typology we developed in 2014 has stimulated much research in the past decade. We review this body of work and structure our article around the four quadrants described in our typology. We then revisit and update the eight research recommendations we proposed previously, identifying rich opportunities for developing theory and conceiving empirical studies. Finally, we highlight four desirable directions that help to chart the path for conducting frame-breaking research and accelerating theoretical breakthroughs.\n", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamic interplay between actors and their contexts in fostering creativity and innovation. By examining person-context and team-context interactions, the research highlights how situational factors influence creative processes. The findings underscore the importance of adaptive strategies that align individual and team capabilities with contextual demands. The study suggests future research directions, emphasizing the need for integrative models that consider both micro-level interactions and macro-level influences. This approach aims to enhance our understanding of creativity within complex, evolving environments, ultimately informing organizational practices and policy development.", "label": 0}
