{"grounding": "Burnout refers to a work-related state of exhaustion and a sense of cynicism. In contrast, work engagement is a positive motivational state of vigor, dedication, and absorption. In this article, we discuss the concepts of burnout and work engagement and review their antecedents and consequences. We look back at our inaugural Annual Reviews article (Bakker et al. 2014) and highlight new empirical findings and theoretical innovations in relationship to job demands\u2013resources (JD-R) theory. We discuss four major innovations of the past decade, namely (a) the person \u00d7 situation approach of JD-R, (b) multilevel JD-R theory, (c) new proactive approaches in JD-R theory, and (d) the work\u2013home resources model. After discussing practical implications, we elaborate on more opportunities for future research, including JD-R interventions, team-level approaches, and demands and resources from other life domains.", "generated_text": "Over the past decade, the Job Demands\u2013Resources (JD-R) theory has significantly advanced our understanding of occupational well-being, particularly in relation to burnout and work engagement. This paper revisits the JD-R model, highlighting its evolution and application in diverse work settings. The theory posits that job demands, such as workload and emotional stress, can lead to burnout, while job resources, including support and autonomy, foster work engagement. Recent research underscores the role of proactive work behavior in mitigating job demands and enhancing job resources, thus promoting a healthier work environment. Furthermore, the integration of job design principles within the JD-R framework has provided new insights into optimizing employee performance and satisfaction. This review synthesizes key findings and suggests future research directions to further refine the JD-R model in the context of contemporary work challenges.", "label": 1}
