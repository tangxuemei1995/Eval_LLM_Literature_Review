{"grounding": "Some assert that noise (i.e., unwanted variance) is the most neglected yet most important source of error in judgment. We suggest that this problem was discovered nearly 100 years ago in the area of personnel selection and that a century of selection research has shown that noise can be demonstrably reduced by structuring the process (i.e., decomposing the component parts, agreeing on standards, and applying those standards consistently) and by aggregating judgments independently. Algorithms can aid significantly in this process but are often confused with methods that, in their current form, can substantially increase noise in judgment (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning).", "generated_text": "This study explores the impact of noise, or unwanted variance, on workplace judgments, drawing insights from a century of personnel selection research. By examining historical and contemporary methodologies, the research identifies key strategies to mitigate noise in judgment and decision-making processes. The findings highlight the importance of structured approaches and evidence-based forecasting in enhancing strategic decision-making and personnel selection. The study underscores the necessity of reducing noise to improve the accuracy and reliability of workplace judgments, ultimately leading to more effective organizational outcomes. These lessons provide a framework for refining decision-making practices in diverse professional settings.", "label": 0}
