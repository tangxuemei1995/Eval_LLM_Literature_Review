{"grounding": "There is no situation where leadership is more important than during a crisis, and yet crisis leadership is a relatively underdeveloped field. This article explores what we know and what remains unknown about crisis leadership. We begin with an overview of what crises are, including different types and key dynamics of crises. We then review four leadership theories that offer insights into crisis leadership before elucidating five key competencies for crisis leadership. Three distinct avenues for future research are proposed, including exploring the distinctions and intersections of crisis leadership and crisis management, the cross-national and intercultural implications for leading through crises, and the role of ethics in leading well through crisis. Crises are increasingly frequent and complex, warranting a concerted effort to research, teach, and develop good crisis leadership.", "generated_text": "Crisis leadership is a critical field of study that examines the competencies and dynamics necessary for effective leadership during crises.
