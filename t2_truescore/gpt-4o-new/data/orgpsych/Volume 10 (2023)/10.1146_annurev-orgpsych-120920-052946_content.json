{"grounding": "Technology has changed the way that organizational researchers obtain participants for their research studies. Although technology has facilitated the collection of large quantities of data through online platforms, it has also highlighted potential data quality issues for many of our samples. In this article, we review different sampling techniques, including convenience, purposive, probability-based, and snowball sampling. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each approach to help organizational researchers choose the most appropriate sampling techniques for their research questions. We identify best practices that researchers can use to improve the quality of their samples, including reviewing screening techniques to increase the quality of online sampling. Finally, as part of our review we examined the sampling procedures of all empirical research articles published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in the past 5 years, and we use observations from these results to make conclusions about the lack of methodological and sample diversity in organizational research, the overreliance on a few sampling techniques, the need to report key aspects of sampling, and concerns about participant quality.", "generated_text": "The integrity of organizational research is heavily reliant on the quality of the samples used. Recent innovations in sampling techniques have sought to address persistent challenges such as insufficient effort responding and participant dishonesty, which can compromise data quality. This paper reviews contemporary advancements in sampling methodologies, particularly in the context of online samples, which have become increasingly prevalent. We explore novel approaches that enhance the appropriateness and reliability of samples, including adaptive sampling strategies and the integration of machine learning algorithms to identify and mitigate low-quality responses. Additionally, we discuss the role of pre-screening and post-survey validation techniques in ensuring participant authenticity and engagement. By leveraging these innovations, researchers can significantly improve the robustness of their findings, thereby advancing the field of organizational research. The paper concludes with recommendations for best practices in sampling, emphasizing the importance of continuous methodological refinement to keep pace with evolving digital landscapes and participant behaviors. These insights are crucial for researchers aiming to produce high-quality, generalizable results in organizational studies.", "label": 1}
