{"grounding": "Meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for integrating findings from the research literature and building statistical models to explore trends and inconsistencies in the research base. Meta-analysis starts with a process for translating results from each study into an effect size that represents all findings in a common metric. Statistical models are then applied to estimate the mean, variance, and moderators of effect size. This article explores several key decision points in conducting a meta-analysis, including issues in obtaining a common metric, accounting for psychometric artifacts, and choosing an appropriate statistical model. It provides recommendations for choosing among alternate approaches and reporting results to ensure transparency.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive guide to conducting meta-analyses in organizational research, emphasizing methodological choices that enhance validity and reliability. It explores the integration of validity generalization and effect size estimation to synthesize research findings effectively. The paper discusses the role of psychometric artifacts in influencing results and offers strategies to mitigate their impact. By examining various methodological options, the guide aims to assist researchers in selecting appropriate techniques for their specific research questions. This synthesis of methodological insights is intended to improve the rigor and applicability of meta-analytic studies, ultimately advancing the field of organizational research through more robust and generalizable findings.", "label": 0}
