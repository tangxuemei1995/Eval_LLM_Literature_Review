{"grounding": "Environmental sustainability has become an ethical and strategic imperative for organizations, and more and more employees are interested, encouraged, or instructed to act in environmentally sustainable ways. Consequently, organizational scholars have increasingly studied individual-level antecedents of employee pro-environmental or employee green behavior (EGB). We argue that, to advance this literature and to inform effective interventions, research should investigate how EGB, as a compound performance domain, is associated with antecedents and consequences at multiple levels (i.e., individual, team, work context, organization, society). Accordingly, we pursue three interrelated goals with this review. We first present a comprehensive review of research on EGB, including definitions, theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. Second, we develop an integrative conceptual model of EGB as the core of organizational environmental sustainability. Third, we conclude with recommendations for future theory development and methodological improvements, as well as practical implications for employees, leaders, and human resource management.", "generated_text": "This study explores the pivotal role of employee green behavior in fostering environmentally sustainable organizations. By integrating concepts from environmental psychology, the research examines how individual ecological behaviors contribute to broader organizational sustainability goals. The analysis highlights the significance of pro-environmental behavior among employees, emphasizing its impact on reducing the ecological footprint of organizations. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, the study identifies key factors that influence employee green behavior, including organizational culture, leadership support, and individual environmental values. The findings suggest that fostering a workplace environment that encourages and rewards ecological behavior can significantly enhance an organization's sustainability efforts. This research underscores the necessity for organizations to prioritize employee engagement in environmental initiatives as a core strategy for achieving long-term sustainability. The study concludes with recommendations for implementing effective policies and practices that promote employee green behavior, thereby aligning organizational operations with environmental sustainability objectives.", "label": 1}
