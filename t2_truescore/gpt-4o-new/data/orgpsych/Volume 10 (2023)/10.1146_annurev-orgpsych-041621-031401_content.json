{"grounding": "The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) has grown substantially over the past 40 years within organizational research and beyond. There have been many different developments in SEM that make it increasingly useful for a variety of data types, research designs, research questions, and research contexts in the organizational sciences. To give researchers a better understanding of how and why SEM is used, our article (a) presents a review of SEM applications within organizational research; (b) discusses SEM best practices; and (c) explores advanced SEM applications, including instrumental variable methods, latent variable interactions and nonlinear measurement models, multilevel SEM, cross-lagged panel models and dynamic structural equation models, and meta-analytic SEM. We conclude by discussing concerns and debates that are both methodological (i.e., cross-validation and regularization) and theoretical (i.e., understanding causal evidence) as they relate to SEM and its application in organizational research and beyond.", "generated_text": "Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has become a cornerstone in organizational research, offering a robust framework for testing complex theoretical models involving latent variables. This paper reviews the current state of SEM, highlighting its widespread application and the methodological advancements that have enhanced model fit and the estimation of latent interactions. Despite its strengths, challenges remain, including issues of model specification, identification, and the interpretation of results. The paper proposes future directions for SEM, emphasizing the need for improved software capabilities, the integration of Bayesian methods, and the development of more sophisticated techniques for handling non-normal data and measurement invariance. By addressing these challenges, SEM can continue to evolve as a powerful tool for organizational researchers, enabling more accurate and insightful analyses of complex phenomena. This work aims to guide researchers in leveraging SEM's full potential while navigating its limitations.", "label": 1}
