{"grounding": "This review updates and extends Gone & Trimble's (2012) prior review of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) mental health. First, it defines AI/AN populations in the USA, with an explanation of the importance of political citizenship in semisovereign Tribal Nations as primary for categorizing this population. Second, it presents an updated summary of what is known about AI/AN mental health, with careful notation of recurrent findings concerning community inequities in addiction, trauma, and suicide. Third, this article reviews key literature about AI/AN community mental health services appearing since 2010, including six randomized controlled trials of recognizable mental health treatments. Finally, it reimagines the AI/AN mental health enterprise in response to an \u201calter-Native psy-ence,\u201d which recasts prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and harnesses postcolonial meaning-making through Indigenized therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, AI/AN Tribal Nations must determine for themselves how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services for wider community benefit.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of evidence-based practices with culturally resonant approaches, termed 'alter-Native psy-ence,' in community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Recognizing the historical and ongoing impacts of postcolonial anomie, this research highlights the necessity of Indigenized therapies that honor traditional healing practices while addressing contemporary mental health challenges. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the study identifies key strategies for reconciling conventional evidence-based methodologies with Indigenous knowledge systems. Findings suggest that culturally tailored interventions, which incorporate community values and traditional practices, enhance therapeutic outcomes and community engagement. The research underscores the importance of collaborative partnerships between mental health professionals and Indigenous communities to foster culturally competent care. This approach not only respects the cultural heritage of American Indians and Alaska Natives but also promotes holistic well-being, offering a model for integrating diverse epistemologies in mental health services.", "label": 1}
