{"grounding": "Parental incarceration is a significant, inequitably distributed form of adversity that affects millions of US children and increases their risk for emotional and behavioral problems. An emerging body of research also indicates, however, that children exhibit resilience in the context of parental incarceration. In this article, we review evidence regarding the adverse implications of parental incarceration for children's adjustment and consider factors that account for these consequences with special attention to naturally occurring processes and interventions that may mitigate risk and contribute to positive youth development. We also offer a critical reframing of resilience research and argue that (a) scholars should adopt more contextualized approaches to the study of resilience that are sensitive to intersecting inequalities and (b) resilience research and practice should be conceptualized as important complements to, rather than substitutes for, social and institutional change. We conclude by offering social justice\u2013informed recommendations for future research and practice.", "generated_text": "This review critically examines the risk and resilience factors affecting children with incarcerated parents, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding through an intersectional lens. The study synthesizes existing literature to highlight the complex interplay of socio-economic, racial, and familial dynamics that contribute to the vulnerabilities and strengths of these children. It challenges traditional deficit-focused narratives by reframing resilience as a dynamic process influenced by systemic inequalities and social justice issues. The review identifies key intervention strategies that promote resilience, advocating for policies and practices that address structural barriers and support family cohesion. By integrating intersectionality, the research underscores the importance of tailored interventions that consider the diverse experiences of these children. The findings call for a shift towards holistic approaches that empower children and their families, fostering environments where resilience can thrive despite the challenges posed by parental incarceration.", "label": 1}
