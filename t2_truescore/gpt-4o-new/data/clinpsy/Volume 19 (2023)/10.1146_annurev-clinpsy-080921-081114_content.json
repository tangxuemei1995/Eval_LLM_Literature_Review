{"grounding": "For many people worldwide, supernatural beliefs and attributions\u2014those focused on God, the devil, demons, spirits, an afterlife, karma, or fate\u2014are part of everyday life. Although not widely studied in clinical psychology, these beliefs and attributions are a key part of human diversity. This article provides a broad overview of research on supernatural beliefs and attributions with special attention to their psychological relevance: They can serve as coping resources, sources of distress, psychopathology signals, moral guides, and decision-making tools. Although supernatural attributions sometimes involve dramatic experiences seen to violate natural laws, people more commonly think of supernatural entities working indirectly through natural events. A whole host of factors can lead people to make supernatural attributions, including contextual factors, specific beliefs, psychopathology, cognitive styles and personality, and social and cultural influences. Our aim is to provide clinical psychologists with an entry point into this rich, fascinating, and often overlooked literature.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex interplay between supernatural attributions and the interpretation of events, focusing on beliefs in God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma. By examining the psychological and cultural dimensions of supernatural and paranormal beliefs, the research aims to understand how individuals attribute causality to these entities in response to anomalous experiences. The study delves into the role of spiritual struggles and religious frameworks in shaping these attributions, highlighting the influence of personal and societal factors. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis, the research identifies patterns in how supernatural beliefs are invoked to explain life's uncertainties and challenges. The findings suggest that such attributions can provide comfort, meaning, and a sense of control, while also potentially leading to spiritual conflicts. This work contributes to the broader understanding of the intersection between religion, spirituality, and human cognition.", "label": 1}
