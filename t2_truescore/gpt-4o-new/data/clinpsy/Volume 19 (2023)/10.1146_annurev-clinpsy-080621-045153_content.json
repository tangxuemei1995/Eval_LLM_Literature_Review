{"grounding": "Research conducted over the past several decades has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the immune system in neural and psychological development and function across the life span. Our goal in this review is to introduce this dynamic area of research to a psychological audience and highlight its relevance for clinical psychology. We begin by introducing the basic physiology of immune-to-brain signaling and the neuroimmune network, focusing on inflammation. Drawing from preclinical and clinical research, we then examine effects of immune activation on key psychological domains, including positive and negative valence systems, social processes, cognition, and arousal (fatigue, sleep), as well as links with psychological disorders (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia). We also consider psychosocial stress as a critical modulator of neuroimmune activity and focus on early life adversity. Finally, we highlight psychosocial and mind\u2013body interventions that influence the immune system and may promote neuroimmune resilience.", "generated_text": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) explores the intricate interactions between the nervous and immune systems, highlighting their impact on mental health. This field has unveiled how immune-to-brain communication can influence psychological states, particularly through pathways involving inflammation and cytokine signaling. Sickness behavior, characterized by fatigue, anhedonia, and cognitive impairment, exemplifies the behavioral manifestations of immune activation. Psychosocial stress is a critical factor that can exacerbate inflammatory responses, potentially leading to or worsening depressive symptoms. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for clinical psychology, suggesting that interventions targeting inflammation may benefit individuals with stress-related disorders. Translational science in PNI aims to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical applications, fostering the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This introduction to PNI underscores the importance of considering immune system dynamics in psychological assessments and interventions, paving the way for more comprehensive and effective mental health care approaches.", "label": 1}
