{"grounding": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified racism as a serious threat to public health. Structural racism is a fundamental cause of inequity within interconnected institutions and the social environments in which we live and develop. This review illustrates how these ethnoracial inequities impact risk for the extended psychosis phenotype. Black and Latinx populations are more likely than White populations to report psychotic experiences in the United States due to social determining factors such as racial discrimination, food insecurity, and police violence. Unless we dismantle these discriminatory structures, the chronic stress and biological consequences of this race-based stress and trauma will impact the next generation's risk for psychosis directly, and indirectly through Black and Latina pregnant mothers. Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions show promise in improving prognosis, but coordinated care and other treatments still need to be more accessible and address the racism-specific adversities many Black and Latinx people face in their neighborhoods and social environments.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between racism and the social determinants of psychosis, emphasizing the impact of racial discrimination on the prevalence and severity of psychotic experiences. By examining neighborhood factors and structural racism, the research highlights how these elements contribute to the onset and progression of early psychosis. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the study synthesizes findings from epidemiology, sociology, and psychology to elucidate the pathways through which racism exacerbates mental health disparities. The analysis reveals that individuals from racially marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by adverse social determinants, such as poverty, limited access to healthcare, and exposure to violence, which collectively heighten the risk of developing psychosis. Furthermore, the study underscores the necessity of addressing structural racism to mitigate these risks and improve mental health outcomes. The findings advocate for policy interventions and community-based strategies aimed at reducing racial discrimination and promoting equitable access to resources, ultimately fostering resilience against psychotic disorders.", "label": 1}
