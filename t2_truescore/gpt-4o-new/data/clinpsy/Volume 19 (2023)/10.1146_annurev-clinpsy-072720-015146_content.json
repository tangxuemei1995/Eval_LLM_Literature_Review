{"grounding": "Racism constitutes a significant risk to the mental health of African American children, adolescents, and emerging adults. This review evaluates recent literature examining ethnic and racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity and spirituality, and family and parenting as racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors that shape the impact of racism on youth mental health. Representative studies, purported mechanisms, and critiques of prior research are presented for each factor. Recent studies of racism and resilience revisit foundational resilience factors from prior research while reflecting new and important advances (e.g., consideration of gender, cultural context, structural racism), providing important insights for the development of prevention and intervention efforts and policy that can alleviate mental health suffering and promote health and mental health equity for African American youth.", "generated_text": "This study explores the resilience factors that contribute to the mental health of African American youth, focusing on the interplay of racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity, spirituality, and family dynamics. Amidst the challenges posed by systemic racism, these factors serve as protective mechanisms that bolster psychological well-being. The research highlights how strong racial identity and positive ethnic-racial socialization practices enhance self-esteem and coping strategies. Additionally, the roles of religiosity and spirituality are examined as sources of comfort and community support. Family and parenting practices are identified as crucial in fostering resilience, providing emotional stability and guidance. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of culturally informed interventions to support the mental health of African American youth, promoting resilience in the face of adversity.", "label": 1}
