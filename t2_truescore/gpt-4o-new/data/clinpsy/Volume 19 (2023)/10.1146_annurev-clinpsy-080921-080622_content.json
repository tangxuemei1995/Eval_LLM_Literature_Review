{"grounding": "Acculturation and psychopathology are linked in integrated, interactional, intersectional, and dynamic ways that span different types of intercultural contact, levels of analysis, timescales, and contexts. A developmental psychopathology approach can be useful to explain why, how, and what about psychological acculturation results in later adaptation or maladaptation for acculturating youth and adults. This review applies a conceptual model of acculturation and developmental psychopathology to a widely used framework of acculturation variables producing an Integrated Process Framework of Acculturation Variables (IP-FAV). This new comprehensive framework depicts major predisposing acculturation conditions (why) as well as acculturation orientations and processes (how) that result in adaptation and maladaptation across the life span (what). The IP-FAV is unique in that it integrates both proximal and remote acculturation variables and explicates key acculturation processes to inform research, practice, and policy.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between acculturation processes and the development of psychopathology among immigrant and refugee populations. By distinguishing between proximal acculturation, which occurs through direct cultural contact, and remote acculturation, influenced by globalization, the research examines their respective impacts on mental health. Utilizing a developmental psychopathology framework, the study investigates how these acculturation processes contribute to or mitigate psychological distress and disorders. The role of resilience as a protective factor is also analyzed, highlighting its potential to buffer against adverse mental health outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, the study aims to provide insights into the complex dynamics of cultural adaptation and mental health, offering implications for interventions and support systems tailored to diverse cultural contexts in an increasingly globalized world.", "label": 1}
