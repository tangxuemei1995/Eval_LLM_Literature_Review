{"grounding": "While boys and men have historically been underrepresented in eating disorder research, increasing interest and research during the twenty-first century have contributed important knowledge to the field. In this article, we review the epidemiology of eating disorders and muscle dysmorphia (the pathological pursuit of muscularity) in boys and men; specific groups of men at increased risk for eating disorders; sociocultural, psychological, and biological vulnerability factors; and male-specific assessment measures. We also provide an overview of current research on eating disorder and muscle dysmorphia prevention efforts, treatment outcomes, and mortality risk in samples of boys and men. Priorities for future research are including boys and men in epidemiological studies to track changes in incidence, identifying (neuro)biological factors contributing to risk, eliminating barriers to treatment access and utilization, and refining male-specific prevention and treatment efforts.", "generated_text": "Eating disorders, traditionally perceived as predominantly affecting females, are increasingly recognized in boys and men, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of their epidemiology, intervention strategies, and outcomes. This review synthesizes current research on the prevalence and characteristics of eating disorders in male populations, highlighting unique risk factors and symptomatology. Despite underdiagnosis and stigma, evidence suggests a significant prevalence of disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder among males. Intervention strategies tailored to the male experience are crucial, as traditional approaches may not address specific needs. The review also examines treatment outcomes, emphasizing the importance of early detection and gender-sensitive therapeutic approaches. By addressing these gaps, the study aims to improve clinical practices and outcomes for boys and men with eating disorders, ultimately contributing to more inclusive and effective healthcare solutions.", "label": 1}
