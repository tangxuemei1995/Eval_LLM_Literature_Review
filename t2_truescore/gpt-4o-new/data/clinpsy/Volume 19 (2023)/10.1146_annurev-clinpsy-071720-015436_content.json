{"grounding": "Partialing is a statistical approach researchers use with the goal of removing extraneous variance from a variable before examining its association with other variables. Controlling for confounds through analysis of covariance or multiple regression analysis and residualizing variables for use in subsequent analyses are common approaches to partialing in clinical research. Despite its intuitive appeal, partialing is fraught with undesirable consequences when predictors are correlated. After describing effects of partialing on variables, we review analytic approaches commonly used in clinical research to make inferences about the nature and effects of partialed variables. We then use two simulations to show how partialing can distort variables and their relations with other variables. Having concluded that, with rare exception, partialing is ill-advised, we offer recommendations for reducing or eliminating problematic uses of partialing. We conclude that the best alternative to partialing is to define and measure constructs so that it is not needed.", "generated_text": "This study critically examines the practice of partialing, or the use of residualized variables, in refining scores and making inferences about psychological constructs. Partialing is often employed to control for confounding variables, aiming to enhance construct validity. However, this approach may inadvertently distort the true nature of the constructs being measured, leading to questionable measurement practices. By analyzing the implications of statistical control and semipartial effects, this research highlights potential pitfalls in the interpretation of residualized variables. The findings suggest that while partialing can offer insights into specific relationships, it may also obscure the broader context of psychological constructs, thus challenging the validity of inferences drawn from such analyses. The study calls for a more cautious application of partialing, advocating for alternative methods that preserve the integrity of psychological measurements and enhance the robustness of construct validity.", "label": 1}
