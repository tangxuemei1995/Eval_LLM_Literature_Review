{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires guidance not only by sensations that are available immediately but also by relevant mental contents carried forward through working memory. Therefore, selective-attention functions that modulate the contents of working memory to guide behavior (inside-out) are just as important as those operating on sensory signals to generate internal contents (outside-in). We review the burgeoning literature on selective attention in the inside-out direction and underscore its functional, flexible, and future-focused nature. We discuss in turn the purpose (why), targets (what), sources (when), and mechanisms (how) of selective attention inside working memory, using visual working memory as a model. We show how the study of internal selective attention brings new insights concerning the core cognitive processes of attention and working memory and how considering selective attention and working memory together paves the way for a rich and integrated understanding of how mind serves behavior.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between working memory and behavior, focusing on how working memory facilitates selective attention, anticipation, and expectation in vision and action. By turning attention 'inside out,' we examine the dynamic processes through which working memory prioritizes and organizes information to guide behavior effectively. The research highlights the role of working memory in filtering relevant stimuli, thus enhancing selective attention and enabling individuals to anticipate future events and adjust their actions accordingly. Through a series of experimental paradigms, we demonstrate that working memory not only stores information but also actively shapes perceptual and cognitive processes. Our findings suggest that the anticipatory and expectational functions of working memory are crucial for adaptive behavior, providing a framework for understanding how cognitive resources are allocated in complex environments. This work advances our comprehension of the cognitive mechanisms underlying attention and action, with implications for both theoretical models and practical applications.", "label": 1}
