{"grounding": "Surveys administered online have several benefits, but they are particularly prone to careless responding, which occurs when respondents fail to read item content or give sufficient attention, resulting in raw data that may not accurately reflect respondents\u2019 true levels of the constructs being measured. Careless responding can lead to various psychometric issues, potentially impacting any area of psychology that uses self-reported surveys and assessments. This review synthesizes the careless responding literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of careless responding and ways to prevent, identify, report, and clean careless responding from data sets. Further, we include recommendations for different levels of screening for careless responses. Finally, we highlight some of the most promising areas for future work on careless responding.", "generated_text": "Careless responding in survey data poses significant challenges to the validity and reliability of research findings. This paper explores strategies for preventing, identifying, and addressing insufficient effort responding (IER) in survey methodology. We review current literature on the prevalence and impact of invalid responding, including random and lazy respondent behaviors. Best practices for survey design are discussed, emphasizing the importance of clear instructions, attention checks, and response time analysis to mitigate careless responses. Additionally, we propose a framework for identifying IER through statistical techniques and data screening methods. By implementing these strategies, researchers can enhance data quality and ensure more accurate and meaningful results in survey-based studies.", "label": 1}
