{"grounding": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) research investigates changes in the evaluation of a stimulus after co-occurrence with an affective stimulus. To explain the motivation behind this research, this review begins with an overview of the history of EC research, followed by a summary of the state of the art with respect to three key questions. First, how should EC procedures be used to influence evaluation? We provide a guide based on evidence concerning the functional properties of EC effects. Second, how does the EC effect occur? We discuss the possible mediating cognitive processes and their automaticity. Third, are EC effects ubiquitous outside the lab? We discuss the evidence for the external validity of EC research. We conclude that the most important open questions pertain to the relevance of EC to everyday life and to the level of control that characterizes the processes that mediate the EC effect after people notice the stimulus co-occurrence.", "generated_text": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) is a psychological phenomenon where the valence of a stimulus is altered through its association with another stimulus. This process plays a crucial role in attitude formation, influencing preferences and aversions. Historically, EC has been understood through associative learning theories, which emphasize the automatic formation of links between stimuli. However, recent research suggests that propositional processes, involving conscious and deliberate reasoning, also contribute to EC. This dual-process perspective has broadened the understanding of how attitudes are formed and changed. Despite significant advancements, challenges remain in establishing the external validity of EC findings, particularly in real-world settings. Future research should focus on integrating associative and propositional models to better predict EC outcomes and explore the boundary conditions under which EC operates. Additionally, enhancing methodological approaches to improve the ecological validity of EC studies will be essential for translating laboratory findings into practical applications in fields such as marketing and public health.", "label": 1}
