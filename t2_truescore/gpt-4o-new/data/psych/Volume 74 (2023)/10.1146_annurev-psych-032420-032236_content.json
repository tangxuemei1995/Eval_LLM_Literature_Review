{"grounding": "Self-continuity is the subjective sense of connection between one's past and present selves (past\u2013present self-continuity), between one's present and future selves (present\u2013future self-continuity), or among one's past, present, and future selves (global self-continuity). We consider the motivational character of the three forms of self-continuity, their regulatory properties, and the internal or external factors that consolidate them. We also review their consequences for attitudes and judgments or decisions, motivation, intentions and behavior, and psychological and physical health. We further detail the psychological and behavioral benefits of self-discontinuity (i.e., a sense of disconnect among temporal selves). We next turn to the brain regions that are activated synchronously with self-continuity. We consider developmental perspectives on self-continuity, discuss collective self-continuity (along with its consequences and regulatory properties), and elaborate on cultural differences in self-continuity. This inaugural Annual Reviews chapter demonstrates the breadth, excitement, and sense of synergy among self-continuity researchers and points to promising research directions.", "generated_text": "Self-continuity, the perception of a coherent and consistent identity over time, plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes, behaviors, and psychological health. This study explores the multifaceted nature of self-continuity, examining its influence across different cultural contexts and its interaction with the collective self. By integrating cross-cultural perspectives, the research highlights how cultural norms and values impact the development and maintenance of self-continuity. The findings suggest that a strong sense of self-continuity is associated with positive psychological outcomes, including enhanced well-being and resilience. Furthermore, the study investigates the mechanisms through which self-continuity influences behavior, revealing that individuals with a stable sense of identity are more likely to engage in behaviors consistent with their long-term goals and values. The research underscores the importance of fostering self-continuity in diverse cultural settings to promote psychological health and adaptive behavior, offering insights for interventions aimed at enhancing individual and collective well-being.", "label": 1}
