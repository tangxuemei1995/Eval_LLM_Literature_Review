{"grounding": "Exposure to adversity (e.g., poverty, bereavement) is a robust predictor of disruptions in psychological functioning. However, people vary greatly in their responses to adversity; some experience severe long-term disruptions, others experience minimal disruptions or even improvements. We refer to the latter outcomes\u2014faring better than expected given adversity\u2014as psychological resilience. Understanding what processes explain resilience has critical theoretical and practical implications. Yet, psychology's understanding of resilience is incomplete, for two reasons: (a) We lack conceptual clarity, and (b) two major approaches to resilience\u2014the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach\u2014have limitations and are relatively isolated from one another. To address these two obstacles,we first discuss conceptual questions about resilience. Next, we offer an integrative affect-regulation framework that capitalizes on complementary strengths of both approaches. This framework advances our understanding of resilience by integrating existing findings, highlighting gaps in knowledge, and guiding future research.", "generated_text": "This study explores psychological resilience through the lens of affect-regulation, proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates emotion regulation strategies as pivotal mechanisms in fostering resilience. Resilience, the capacity to adapt positively in the face of adversity, is increasingly recognized as a dynamic process influenced by individual differences in stress and coping mechanisms. By examining the interplay between emotion and affect regulation, this research highlights how adaptive regulation strategies can mitigate the impact of stressors, thereby enhancing psychological health. The framework posits that effective emotion regulation not only buffers against negative emotional responses but also promotes positive affective states, facilitating recovery and growth following adverse experiences. Empirical evidence is drawn from interdisciplinary studies, underscoring the importance of tailored interventions that enhance emotion regulation skills to bolster resilience. This approach offers valuable insights for developing therapeutic practices aimed at improving mental health outcomes in diverse populations.", "label": 1}
