{"grounding": "Pride is a self-conscious emotion, comprised of two distinct facets known as authentic and hubristic pride, and associated with a cross-culturally recognized nonverbal expression. Authentic pride involves feelings of accomplishment and confidence and promotes prosocial behaviors, whereas hubristic pride involves feelings of arrogance and conceit and promotes antisociality. Each facet of pride, we argue, contributes to a distinct means of attaining social rank: Authentic pride seems to promote prestige\u2014a rank based on earned respect\u2014whereas hubristic pride seems to promote dominance\u2014a rank based on aggression and coercion. Both prestige and dominance are effective routes to power and influence in human groups, so both facets of pride are likely to be functional adaptations. Overall, the reviewed research suggests that pride is likely to be a human universal, critical for social relationships and rank attainment across human societies.", "generated_text": "Pride, a complex self-conscious emotion, plays a pivotal role in the attainment and maintenance of social rank. This study explores the dual pathways through which pride influences social hierarchy: prestige and dominance. Prestige, associated with admiration and respect, is linked to authentic pride, characterized by confidence and accomplishment. In contrast, dominance, often related to fear and control, is connected to hubristic pride, marked by arrogance and egotism. By examining the psychological and social mechanisms underlying these pathways, the research highlights how pride can both positively and negatively impact social status. The findings suggest that while authentic pride fosters cooperative and prosocial behaviors conducive to prestige, hubristic pride may lead to aggressive and manipulative tactics for dominance. Understanding these dynamics offers insights into the emotional foundations of social rank and the complex interplay between individual emotions and social structures.", "label": 1}
