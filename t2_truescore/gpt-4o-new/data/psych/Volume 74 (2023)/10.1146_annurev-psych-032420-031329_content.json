{"grounding": "Conspiracy theories are abundant in social and political discourse, with serious consequences for individuals, groups, and societies. However, psychological scientists have started paying close attention to them only in the past 20 years. We review the spectacular progress that has since been made and some of the limitations of research so far, and we consider the prospects for further progress. To this end, we take a step back to analyze the defining features that make conspiracy theories different in kind from other beliefs and different in degree from each other. We consider how these features determine the adoption, consequences, and transmission of belief in conspiracy theories, even though their role as causal or moderating variables has seldom been examined. We therefore advocate for a research agenda in the study of conspiracy theories that starts\u2014as is routine in fields such as virology and toxicology\u2014with a robust descriptive analysis of the ontology of the entity at its center.", "generated_text": "Conspiracy theories, often characterized by their speculative nature and resistance to falsification, have become a pervasive element in contemporary discourse. This study aims to provide a comprehensive definition of conspiracy theories, examining their psychological and sociocultural correlates, potential consequences, and modes of communication. By synthesizing existing literature, we identify key predictors of conspiracy beliefs, including cognitive biases, personality traits, and social influences. The consequences of these beliefs are explored, highlighting their impact on individual behavior, societal trust, and democratic processes. Furthermore, the study investigates the role of digital media in the dissemination and reinforcement of conspiracy theories, emphasizing the importance of understanding communication dynamics in the digital age. Through a definitional approach, this research seeks to clarify the complex nature of conspiracy theories, offering insights into their persistence and influence. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the negative effects of conspiracy beliefs and promote critical thinking in public discourse.", "label": 1}
