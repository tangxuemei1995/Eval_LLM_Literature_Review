{"grounding": "Color is a pervasive feature of our psychological experience, having a role in many aspects of human mind and behavior such as basic vision, scene perception, object recognition, aesthetics, and communication. Understanding how humans encode, perceive, talk about, and use color has been a major interdisciplinary effort. Here, we present the current state of knowledge on how color perception and cognition develop. We cover the development of various aspects of the psychological experience of color, ranging from low-level color vision to perceptual mechanisms such as color constancy to phenomena such as color naming and color preference. We also identify neurodiversity in the development of color perception and cognition and implications for clinical and educational contexts. We discuss the theoretical implications of the research for understanding mature color perception and cognition, for identifying the principles of perceptual and cognitive development, and for fostering a broader debate in the psychological sciences.", "generated_text": "The development of color perception and cognition is a complex process that begins in infancy and continues through childhood. This study explores the stages of color perception development, examining how infants initially perceive colors and how this ability evolves into more sophisticated cognitive processes. Utilizing a combination of longitudinal studies and cross-sectional analyses, the research highlights the role of both biological maturation and environmental influences in shaping color cognition. Key findings suggest that while infants can distinguish between basic colors, the ability to categorize and name colors develops later, influenced by language acquisition and cultural factors. The study also investigates the neural mechanisms underlying these processes, providing insights into how early visual experiences contribute to cognitive development. By understanding the trajectory of color perception and cognition, this research offers valuable implications for educational strategies and interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive development in early childhood.", "label": 0}
