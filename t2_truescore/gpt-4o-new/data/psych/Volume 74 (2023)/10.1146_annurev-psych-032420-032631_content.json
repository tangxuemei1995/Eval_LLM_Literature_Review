{"grounding": "Culture and personality are two central topics in psychology. Individuals are culturally influenced influencers of culture, yet the research linking culture and personality has been limited and fragmentary. We integrate the literatures on culture and personality with recent advances in socioecology and genetics to formulate the Socioecological-Genetic Framework of Culture and Personality. Our framework not only delineates the mutual constitution of culture and personality but also sheds light on (a) the roots of culture and personality, (b) how socioecological changes partly explain temporal trends in culture and personality, and (c) how genes and culture/socioecology interact to influence personality (i.e., nature \u00d7 nurture interactions). By spotlighting the roles of socioecology and genetics, our integrative framework advances the understanding of culture and personality.", "generated_text": "This study proposes a comprehensive socioecological-genetic framework to explore the intricate interplay between culture and personality. By integrating socioecological and genetic perspectives, the framework examines how cultural and personality traits are shaped by both environmental and genetic factors. It highlights the dynamic nature of cultural and personality changes, emphasizing the role of socioecological contexts and genetic predispositions. The research underscores the importance of genes \u00d7 environment interactions in understanding the nature\u2013nurture debate, offering insights into how cultural shifts influence personality development and vice versa. This framework provides a novel lens for examining the co-evolution of culture and personality, contributing to a deeper understanding of their roots, trends, and mutual influences in shaping human behavior.", "label": 1}
