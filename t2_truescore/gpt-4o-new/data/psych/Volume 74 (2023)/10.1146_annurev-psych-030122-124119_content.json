{"grounding": "Cancer diagnosis and treatment constitute profoundly stressful experiences involving unique and common challenges that generate uncertainty, fear, and emotional distress. Individuals with cancer must cope with multiple stressors, from the point of diagnosis through surgical and adjuvant treatments and into survivorship, that require substantial psychological and physiological adaptation. This can take a toll on quality of life and well-being and may also promote cellular and molecular changes that can exacerbate physical symptoms and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis, thereby contributing to negative long-term health outcomes. Since modifying responses tostressors might improve psychological and physiological adaptation, quality of life, and clinical health outcomes, several randomized controlled trials have tested interventions that aim to facilitate stress management. We review evidence for the effects of stress management interventions on psychological and physiological adaptation and health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors and summarize emerging research in the field to address unanswered questions.", "generated_text": "Cancer patients and survivors often face significant psychological and physiological stressors that can adversely affect their health outcomes. This study explores the efficacy of stress management interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in facilitating adaptation and improving health outcomes in this population. By examining a range of cancer-related stressors, the research highlights the mechanisms through which psychological and physiological adaptations occur. The findings suggest that targeted stress management interventions can significantly enhance coping strategies, reduce anxiety and depression, and improve overall quality of life. Furthermore, these interventions may contribute to better physiological outcomes, such as immune function and treatment adherence. The study underscores the importance of integrating stress management into cancer care to optimize health outcomes. Future research should focus on tailoring interventions to individual needs and exploring the long-term benefits of such programs in diverse cancer populations.", "label": 1}
