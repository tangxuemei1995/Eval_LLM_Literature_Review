{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the fields of psychosocial and integrative oncology, highlighting common psychological reactions to being diagnosed with and treated for cancer, including distress, anxiety, depression, fear of cancer recurrence and caregiver burden, as well as symptoms of fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance. Patterns of symptomatology across the disease continuum are also discussed. Interventions targeted at treating these symptoms are reviewed, including acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, mind-body therapies, and meaning-based approaches designed for people with advanced stages of disease, including psychedelic therapy. Common methodological issues and shortcomings of the evidence base are summarized with design recommendations, and a discussion of trends in future research including pragmatic research design, digital health interventions, and implementation science completes the article.", "generated_text": "This study explores the role of psychosocial and integrative oncology interventions across the cancer care continuum, focusing on their efficacy in managing anxiety, depression, and distress. It examines cognitive-behavioral and acceptance-based therapies, alongside mindfulness and mind-body approaches, as pivotal in enhancing patient well-being. The research highlights the emerging potential of psychedelic therapy in alleviating psychological distress in oncology settings. By integrating these diverse therapeutic modalities, the study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to cancer care, addressing both psychological and physiological needs. The findings suggest that tailored interventions can significantly improve quality of life for patients, advocating for their inclusion in standard oncology care practices to support patients throughout their disease trajectory.", "label": 1}
