{"grounding": "The modern scope of fermiology encompasses not just the classical geometry of Fermi surfaces but also the geometry of quantum wave functions over the Fermi surface. This enlarged scope is motivated by the advent of topological metals\u2014metals whose Fermi surfaces are characterized by a robustly nontrivial Berry phase. We review the extent to which topological metals can be diagnosed from magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations of transport and thermodynamic quantities. A holistic analysis of the oscillatory wave form is proposed, in which different characteristics of the wave form (e.g., phase offset, high-harmonic amplitudes, temperature-dependent frequency) encode different aspects of a topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. Which characteristic to focus on depends on (a) the orientation of the magnetic field relative to certain crystallographic axes, (b) the symmetry class of the topological metal, and (c) the separation of Fermi-surface pockets in quasimomentum \n\n space. Closely proximate pockets arise when (1) spin\u2013split pockets are nearly overlapping due to a weak spin\u2013orbit force or when (2) two pockets touch at an isolated \n\n point, which can be a topological band-touching point or a saddlepoint in the energy-momentum dispersion. The emergence of a pseudospin degree of freedom (in case 1) and the implications of magnetic breakdown (in case 2) are reviewed, with emphasis on new aspects originating from the (nonabelian) Berry connection of the Fermi surface. Future extensions of topofermiology are suggested in the directions of interaction-induced Fermi-liquid instabilities and two-dimensional electron liquids.", "generated_text": "The study of topological metals, particularly Dirac and Weyl semimetals, has emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics due to their unique electronic properties and potential applications in quantum technologies. This research focuses on the fermiology of these materials, emphasizing the intricate relationship between their Fermi surfaces and topological characteristics. By employing advanced techniques such as quantum oscillations and magnetic breakdown, we explore the geometry and topology of Fermi surfaces in topological metals. Quantum oscillations, including Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen effects, provide insights into the Berry phase, a critical parameter that distinguishes topological metals from conventional ones. The presence of nontrivial Berry phases is indicative of the topological nature of the electronic states, which can lead to novel phenomena such as chiral anomaly and anomalous Hall effects. Furthermore, the study delves into the role of magnetic breakdown in modifying the Fermi surface topology, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between electronic structure and external magnetic fields. Our findings reveal that the Fermi surface topology in Dirac-Weyl semimetals is highly sensitive to external perturbations, which can be harnessed to control their electronic properties. This research not only advances the fundamental understanding of topological metals but also paves the way for designing materials with tailored electronic characteristics for future technological applications. The insights gained from this study are expected to stimulate further experimental and theoretical investigations in the field of topological quantum materials.", "label": 1}
