{"grounding": "Elasticity typically refers to a material's ability to store energy, whereas viscosity refers to a material's tendency to dissipate it. In this review, we discuss fluids and solids for which this is not the case. These materials display additional linear response coefficients known as odd viscosity and odd elasticity. We first introduce odd viscosity and odd elasticity from a continuum perspective, with an emphasis on their rich phenomenology, including transverse responses, modified dislocation dynamics, and topological waves. We then provide an overview of systems that display odd viscosity and odd elasticity. These systems range from quantum fluids and astrophysical gases to active and driven matter. Finally, we comment on microscopic mechanisms by which odd viscosity and odd elasticity arise.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intriguing phenomena of odd viscosity and odd elasticity within the framework of continuum mechanics, focusing on their implications in fluid mechanics and active matter systems. Odd viscosity and elasticity, characterized by their non-dissipative nature, arise in systems far from equilibrium, such as chiral active fluids. We investigate the hydrodynamic and rheological behaviors of these systems, highlighting the unique transport properties and stress responses that deviate from conventional expectations. By employing theoretical models and simulations, we elucidate the role of odd viscosity and elasticity in shaping the dynamics of active matter, offering insights into novel material design and applications. This work advances our understanding of nonequilibrium systems, paving the way for future explorations in complex fluid dynamics.", "label": 1}
