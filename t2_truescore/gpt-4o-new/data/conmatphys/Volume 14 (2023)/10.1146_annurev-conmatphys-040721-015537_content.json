{"grounding": "In Floquet engineering, periodic driving is used to realize novel phases of matter that are inaccessible in thermal equilibrium. For this purpose, the Floquet theory provides us a recipe for obtaining a static effective Hamiltonian. Although many existing works have treated closed systems, it is important to consider the effect of dissipation, which is ubiquitous in nature. Understanding the interplay of periodic driving and dissipation is a fundamental problem of nonequilibrium statistical physics that is receiving growing interest because of the fact that experimental advances have allowed us to engineer dissipation in a controllable manner. In this review, we give a detailed exposition on the formalism of quantum master equations for open Floquet systems and highlight recent work investigating whether equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to Floquet states.", "generated_text": "Floquet states, arising in periodically driven quantum systems, offer a unique framework for exploring nonequilibrium statistical physics. This study investigates the behavior of Floquet states within open quantum systems, where interactions with an external environment introduce dissipation and decoherence. By employing advanced mathematical techniques and numerical simulations, we analyze the stability and dynamics of these states under various driving conditions. Our findings reveal that the interplay between periodic driving and environmental interactions can lead to novel steady-state behaviors and phase transitions, distinct from those in closed systems. These insights enhance our understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena and could inform the design of quantum technologies that exploit Floquet engineering. The results underscore the potential of Floquet systems as a versatile platform for exploring complex quantum dynamics in open environments.", "label": 1}
