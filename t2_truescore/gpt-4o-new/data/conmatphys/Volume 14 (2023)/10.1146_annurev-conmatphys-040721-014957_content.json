{"grounding": "The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) refers to the generation of a spin current as a result of a temperature gradient in a magnetic material, which can be detected electrically via the inverse spin Hall effect in a metallic contact. Since the discovery of the SSE in 2008, intensive studies on the SSE have been conducted to elucidate its origin. SSEs appear in a wide range of magnetic materials including ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnets and also paramagnets with classical or quantum spin fluctuation. SSE voltage reflects fundamental properties of a magnet, such as elementary excitation, static magnetic order, spin correlation, and spin transport. In this article, we review recent progress on the SSE in various systems, with particular emphasis on its emerging role as a probe of these magnetic properties in solids. We also briefly discuss the recently discovered nuclear SSE.", "generated_text": "The Spin Seebeck Effect (SSE) has emerged as a pivotal phenomenon in the field of spin(calori)tronics, offering a sensitive probe for exploring various fundamental properties in solid-state systems. This effect, which involves the generation of a spin current in response to a thermal gradient, provides insights into elementary excitations such as magnons and nuclear spins. It also facilitates the study of spin correlations and transport mechanisms, particularly in antiferromagnetic spintronics. The SSE is instrumental in investigating magnetic order and domain structures, contributing to the understanding of complex phases like quantum spin liquids. Additionally, the inverse spin Hall effect, which converts spin currents into charge currents, is crucial for detecting and analyzing the SSE. This research underscores the SSE's potential in advancing the development of novel spintronic devices and enhancing our comprehension of magnetic phenomena in solids.", "label": 1}
