{"grounding": "We review the literature on swimming in complex fluids. A classification is proposed by comparing the length- and timescales of a swimmer with those of nearby obstacles, interpreted broadly, extending from rigid or soft confining boundaries to molecules that confer the bulk fluid with complex stresses. A third dimension in the classification is the concentration of swimmers, which incorporates fluids whose complexity arises purely by the collective motion of swimming organisms. For each of the eight system types that we identify, we provide a background and describe modern research findings. Although some types have seen a great deal of attention for decades, others remain uncharted waters still open and awaiting exploration.", "generated_text": "The study of swimming in complex fluids encompasses the intricate dynamics of locomotion within soft and active matter environments, such as biological fluids and active suspensions. This research explores the interplay between fluid mechanics and the propulsion mechanisms of microorganisms and synthetic swimmers. By examining the rheological properties of these non-Newtonian fluids, we aim to understand how viscosity, elasticity, and microstructural interactions influence swimming efficiency and behavior. The findings have significant implications for biological processes, such as sperm motility and pathogen transport, as well as for the design of bio-inspired robotic systems. This work advances our comprehension of active matter systems, contributing to the broader field of soft matter physics.", "label": 0}
