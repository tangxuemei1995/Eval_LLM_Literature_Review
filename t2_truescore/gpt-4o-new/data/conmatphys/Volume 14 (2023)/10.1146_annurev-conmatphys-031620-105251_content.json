{"grounding": "Life is a nonequilibrium phenomenon: Metabolism provides a continuous supply of energy that drives nearly all cellular processes. However, very little is known about how much energy different cellular processes use, i.e., their energetic costs. The most direct experimental measurements of these costs involve modulating the activity of cellular processes and determining the resulting changes in energetic fluxes. In this review, we present a flux balance framework to aid in the design and interpretation of such experiments and discuss the challenges associated with measuring the relevant metabolic fluxes. We then describe selected techniques that enable measurement of these fluxes. Finally, we review prior experimental and theoretical work that has employed techniques from biochemistry and nonequilibrium physics to determine the energetic costs of cellular processes.", "generated_text": "Understanding the energetic costs in cell biology is crucial for elucidating cellular processes and metabolic efficiency. This study explores the methodologies for dissecting flux balances to measure these costs, focusing on bioenergetics and metabolic flux analysis. We review current techniques, including isotope labeling and computational modeling, highlighting their applications and limitations in quantifying energy balances. Challenges such as the complexity of metabolic networks and the dynamic nature of cellular environments are discussed. The integration of multi-omics data and advanced computational tools is proposed as a solution to enhance accuracy and resolution in energy cost measurements. This research underscores the importance of precise energetic assessments in advancing our knowledge of cellular metabolism and its implications for health and disease.", "label": 1}
