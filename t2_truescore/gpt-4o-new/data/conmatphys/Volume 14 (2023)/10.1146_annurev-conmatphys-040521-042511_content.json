{"grounding": "Inversion and time reversal are essential symmetries for the structure of Cooper pairs in superconductors. The loss of one or both leads to modifications to this structure and can change the properties of the superconducting phases in profound ways. Superconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry, or noncentrosymmetric materials, has become an important topic. These materials show unusual magnetic and magnetoelectric properties and can host topological superconductivity. Recently, crystal structures with local, but not global, inversion-symmetry breaking have attracted attention. Here, superconductivity can exhibit phenomena not naively expected in centrosymmetric materials. In this review, we first introduce the concept of locally noncentrosymmetric crystals and different material realizations. We then discuss consequences of such local symmetry breaking on the normal state electronic structure and the classification of superconducting order parameters. Finally, we review the expected and, in parts, already observed phenomenology of unconventional superconductivity and possible topological superconducting phases.", "generated_text": "The study of superconductivity in systems with local inversion-symmetry breaking has unveiled novel phenomena, particularly in the context of topological and unconventional superconductors. This research explores the interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and hidden spin polarization, which emerges in non-centrosymmetric environments. Such conditions can lead to the realization of exotic superconducting states with potential applications in quantum computing. By employing advanced theoretical models and experimental techniques, we investigate the role of local inversion-symmetry breaking in stabilizing topological superconductivity. Our findings suggest that the manipulation of Rashba spin-orbit coupling can induce unconventional pairing mechanisms, offering new pathways for engineering superconducting materials with tailored properties. This work not only enhances the understanding of fundamental superconducting phenomena but also paves the way for the development of next-generation quantum devices. The implications of these results are significant for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in the field of condensed matter physics.", "label": 1}
