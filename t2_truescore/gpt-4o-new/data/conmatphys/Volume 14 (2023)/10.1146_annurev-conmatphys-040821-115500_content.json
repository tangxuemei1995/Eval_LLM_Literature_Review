{"grounding": "Active colloids are self-propelled particles moving in viscous fluids by consuming fuel from their surroundings. Here, we review the numerical and theoretical modeling of active colloids propelled by self-generated near-surface flows. We start with the generic model of an active Brownian particle taking into account potential forces and effective pairwise interaction, which include hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. Also, the squirmer as a model microswimmer is introduced. We then discuss the explicit modeling of self-generated fluid flow and the full hydrodynamic-chemical coupling. Finally, we discuss recent advances in selected topics in which modeling of active colloids is used to study motion in crowded and complex environments, microrheology in active baths, active colloidal engines, adaptive responses of active colloids with the help of machine learning techniques, as well as effects of colloid and fluid inertia.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the modeling of active colloids, focusing on the transition from active Brownian particles to the incorporation of hydrodynamic and chemical fields. By employing advanced numerical modeling techniques, we explore the intricate dynamics of microswimmers in complex environments. The research highlights the significance of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions, which are pivotal in understanding the behavior of active colloids in active baths and their potential as active engines. Our findings provide insights into the emergent collective behaviors and the role of environmental factors in modulating these interactions. This work not only advances the theoretical framework for active matter but also paves the way for practical applications in designing synthetic microswimmers and optimizing their performance in diverse settings, from biomedical applications to environmental sensing.", "label": 0}
