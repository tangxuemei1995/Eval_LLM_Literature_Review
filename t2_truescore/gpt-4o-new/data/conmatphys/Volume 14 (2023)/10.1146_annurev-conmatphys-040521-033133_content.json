{"grounding": "The past decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in topological materials, and a lot of mathematical concepts have been introduced in condensed matter physics. Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central topic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on boundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex. Besides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon called the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition. In this article, we review developments in non-Hermitian topological physics by focusing mainly on the boundary problem. As well as the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena, we discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself.", "generated_text": "Non-Hermitian topological phenomena have emerged as a vibrant field of study, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian physics and topological phases. This review explores the unique properties and theoretical frameworks that arise when non-Hermitian systems are considered, particularly focusing on the modified bulk-boundary correspondence and its implications for spectral theory. By examining recent advancements, we highlight how non-Hermitian systems exhibit novel topological phases that are absent in Hermitian counterparts, driven by complex energy spectra and exceptional points. The review also discusses experimental realizations and potential applications in photonics and condensed matter systems. Through a comprehensive analysis, this work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology, paving the way for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.", "label": 1}
