{"grounding": "Learning is traditionally studied in biological or computational systems. The power of learning frameworks in solving hard inverse problems provides an appealing case for the development of physical learning in which physical systems adopt desirable properties on their own without computational design. It was recently realized that large classes of physical systems can physically learn through local learning rules, autonomously adapting their parameters in response to observed examples of use. We review recent work in the emerging field of physical learning, describing theoretical and experimental advances in areas ranging from molecular self-assembly to flow networks and mechanical materials. Physical learning machines provide multiple practical advantages over computer designed ones, in particular by not requiring an accurate model of the system, and their ability to autonomously adapt to changing needs over time. As theoretical constructs, physical learning machines afford a novel perspective on how physical constraints modify abstract learning theory.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of learning without neurons in physical systems, challenging traditional paradigms of learning theory. By leveraging principles of inverse design, we investigate how metamaterials and self-assembling structures can exhibit learning behaviors akin to those found in biological systems. Our approach integrates machine learning techniques with physical systems, enabling the design of materials that can adapt and optimize their properties in response to environmental stimuli. We demonstrate that molecular computing can facilitate complex information processing tasks, traditionally associated with neural networks, within these non-biological substrates. The findings suggest that physical learning systems can achieve efficient computation and adaptation without the need for conventional neural architectures. This research opens new avenues for the development of smart materials and devices, with potential applications in areas such as adaptive optics, responsive surfaces, and autonomous systems. Our work lays the groundwork for future exploration into the capabilities and limitations of learning in physical systems.", "label": 0}
