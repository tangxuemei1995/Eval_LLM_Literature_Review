{"grounding": "Tensor networks provide extremely powerful tools for the study of complex classical and quantum many-body problems. Over the past two decades, the increment in the number of techniques and applications has been relentless, and especially the last ten years have seen an explosion of new ideas and results that may be overwhelming for the newcomer. This short review introduces the basic ideas, the best established methods, and some of the most significant algorithmic developments that are expanding the boundaries of the tensor network potential. The goal of this review is to help the reader not only appreciate the many possibilities offered by tensor networks but also find their way through state-of-the-art codes, their applicability, and some avenues of ongoing progress.", "generated_text": "Tensor network algorithms have emerged as a powerful framework for tackling complex problems in computational physics, particularly in the study of quantum many-body systems. These algorithms leverage the concept of entanglement to efficiently represent and simulate quantum states, offering significant advantages over traditional numerical methods. This review provides a comprehensive route map of tensor network techniques, highlighting their applications in quantum information and their role in advancing our understanding of entangled systems. By exploring various tensor network structures and their computational implementations, we aim to elucidate the potential of these algorithms in addressing challenges in numerical simulations. The insights gained from this exploration underscore the transformative impact of tensor networks on the study of quantum phenomena and their broader implications in physics.", "label": 1}
