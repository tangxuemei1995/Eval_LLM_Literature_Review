{"grounding": "The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey of statistical challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, from neuroimaging techniques to large-scale neuroimaging studies and statistical learning methods. We briefly review eight popular neuroimaging techniques and their potential applications in neuroscience research and clinical translation. We delineate four themes of neuroimaging data and review major image processing analysis methods for processing neuroimaging data at the individual level. We briefly review four large-scale neuroimaging-related studies and a consortium on imaging genomics and discuss four themes of neuroimaging data analysis at the population level. We review nine major population-based statistical analysis methods and their associated statistical challenges and present recent progress in statistical methodology to address these challenges.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of statistical learning methods in neuroimaging data analysis, emphasizing applications in understanding causal pathways and heterogeneity in brain function. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of neuroimaging studies. The research focuses on population-based statistical analysis to identify patterns and variations across diverse cohorts, facilitating personalized insights into neurological conditions. We discuss the implications of study design in capturing complex neural dynamics and propose methodologies to address challenges in data heterogeneity. Our findings underscore the potential of statistical learning to revolutionize neuroimaging, offering robust frameworks for elucidating brain-behavior relationships and informing clinical interventions.", "label": 0}
