{"grounding": "Single-cell RNA sequencing methods have led to improved understanding of the heterogeneity and transcriptomic states present in complex biological systems. Recently, the development of novel single-cell technologies for assaying additional modalities, specifically genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial data, allows for unprecedented insight into cellular biology. While certain technologies collect multiple measurements from the same cells simultaneously, even when modalities are separately assayed in different cells, we can apply novel computational methods to integrate these data. The application of computational integration methods to multimodal paired and unpaired data results in rich information about the identities of the cells present and the interactions between different levels of biology, such as between genetic variation and transcription. In this review, we both discuss the single-cell technologies for measuring these modalities and describe and characterize a variety of computational integration methods for combining the resulting data to leverage multimodal information toward greater biological insight.", "generated_text": "Single-cell multiomics is an emerging field that integrates diverse omics data at the single-cell level, offering unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and function. This approach combines next-generation sequencing technologies with advanced computational methods to simultaneously analyze genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data from individual cells. The integration of multimodal data provides a comprehensive view of cellular states and dynamics, enabling the identification of novel cell types and the elucidation of complex biological processes. Recent advancements in computational tools have facilitated the effective integration and interpretation of multiomics data, addressing challenges such as data sparsity and noise. This review highlights the latest developments in single-cell multiomics technologies and computational strategies, emphasizing their applications in understanding disease mechanisms, developmental biology, and tissue architecture. As the field progresses, single-cell multiomics is poised to revolutionize personalized medicine and therapeutic interventions by providing a detailed molecular map of cellular diversity and interactions.", "label": 1}
