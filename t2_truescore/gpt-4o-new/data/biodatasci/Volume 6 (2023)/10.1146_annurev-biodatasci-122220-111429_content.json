{"grounding": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that can regulate all steps of gene expression (induction, transcription, and translation). Several virus families, primarily double-stranded DNA viruses, encode small RNAs (sRNAs), including miRNAs. These virus-derived miRNAs (v-miRNAs) help the virus evade the host's innate and adaptive immune system and maintain an environment of chronic latent infection. In this review, the functions of the sRNA-mediated virus\u2013host interactions are highlighted, delineating their implication in chronic stress, inflammation, immunopathology, and disease. We provide insights into the latest viral RNA\u2013based research\u2014in silico approaches for functional characterization of v-miRNAs and other RNA types. The latest research can assist toward the identification of therapeutic targets to combat viral infections.", "generated_text": "Virus-derived small RNAs, including virally encoded microRNAs (v-miRNAs), play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions, influencing both viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. This review explores the biogenesis and functional implications of v-miRNAs, with a focus on Epstein\u2013Barr virus, a model organism for studying viral microRNA functions. Advances in bioinformatics have facilitated the identification and characterization of these small RNAs, providing insights into their regulatory networks. We discuss the current state of viral RNA bioinformatics resources, highlighting their applications in understanding the role of v-miRNAs in health and disease. This knowledge is pivotal for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting viral infections and associated diseases.", "label": 0}
