{"grounding": "Prenatal screening using sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA has transformed obstetric care over the past decade and significantly reduced the number of invasive diagnostic procedures like amniocentesis for genetic disorders. Nonetheless, emergency care remains the only option for complications like preeclampsia and preterm birth, two of the most prevalent obstetrical syndromes. Advances in noninvasive prenatal testing expand the scope of precision medicine in obstetric care. In this review, we discuss advances, challenges, and possibilities toward the goal of providing proactive, personalized prenatal care. The highlighted advances focus mainly on cell-free nucleic acids; however, we also review research that uses signals from metabolomics, proteomics, intact cells, and the microbiome. We discuss ethical challenges in providing care. Finally, we look to future possibilities, including redefining disease taxonomy and moving from biomarker correlation to biological causation.", "generated_text": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) utilizing circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) has revolutionized prenatal care by offering a safer alternative to traditional invasive methods. This review explores recent advances in liquid biopsy technologies that enhance the sensitivity and specificity of NIPT, enabling early detection of chromosomal abnormalities and genetic disorders. The integration of genomics into NIPT has expanded its scope, allowing for comprehensive fetal genetic profiling. Despite these advancements, challenges such as the interpretation of complex genomic data, ethical considerations, and accessibility remain. The potential of cfRNA to provide insights into fetal development and maternal health is also discussed, highlighting future possibilities for personalized prenatal care. Continued research and technological innovation are essential to overcome current limitations and fully realize the potential of NIPT in clinical practice.", "label": 1}
