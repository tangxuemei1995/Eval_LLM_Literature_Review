{"grounding": "Drug development is a wide scientific field that faces many challenges these days. Among them are extremely high development costs, long development times, and a small number of new drugs that are approved each year. New and innovative technologies are needed to solve these problems that make the drug discovery process of small molecules more time and cost efficient, and that allow previously undruggable receptor classes to be targeted, such as protein\u2013protein interactions. Structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs) have become a leading contender in this context. In this review, we give an introduction to the foundations of SBVSs and survey their progress in the past few years with a focus on ultralarge virtual screenings (ULVSs). We outline key principles of SBVSs, recent success stories, new screening techniques, available deep learning\u2013based docking methods, and promising future research directions. ULVSs have an enormous potential for the development of new small-molecule drugs and are already starting to transform early-stage drug discovery.", "generated_text": "The field of drug discovery has witnessed significant advancements with the integration of ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches. These methodologies leverage vast chemical libraries and sophisticated computational techniques to identify potential drug candidates with enhanced precision and efficiency. Recent developments have focused on the application of molecular docking and free energy simulations, which are now accelerated by GPU technology, allowing for the rapid processing of extensive datasets. Additionally, the incorporation of machine learning and deep learning algorithms has further refined the predictive accuracy of these screenings, enabling the identification of novel compounds with desirable pharmacological properties. This review highlights the transformative impact of these technologies on the drug discovery pipeline, emphasizing their role in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional experimental methods. By integrating these cutting-edge approaches, researchers can now explore chemical space more comprehensively, paving the way for the discovery of new therapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles.", "label": 1}
