{"grounding": "Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental delay that affects at least 1 in 44 children. Like many neurological disorder phenotypes, the diagnostic features are observable, can be tracked over time, and can be managed or even eliminated through proper therapy and treatments. However, there are major bottlenecks in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and longitudinal tracking pipelines for autism and related neurodevelopmental delays, creating an opportunity for novel data science solutions to augment and transform existing workflows and provide increased access to services for affected families. Several efforts previously conducted by a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress toward improved digital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review the literature on digital health methods for autism behavior quantification and beneficial therapies using data science. We describe both case\u2013control studies and classification systems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and therapeutics that integrate machine learning models of autism-related behaviors, including the factors that must be addressed for translational use. Finally, we describe ongoing challenges and potential opportunities for the field of autism data science. Given the heterogeneous nature of autism and the complexities of the relevant behaviors, this review contains insights that are relevant to neurological behavior analysis and digital psychiatry more broadly.", "generated_text": "The intersection of data science and machine learning with neuropsychiatric research offers promising avenues for advancing our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This review synthesizes current methodologies and applications of digital phenotyping in autism, emphasizing the role of machine learning in identifying and characterizing the neuropsychiatric phenotype of ASD. We explore how digital health technologies, including wearable devices and mobile applications, facilitate the collection of large-scale, real-time data, enabling more nuanced insights into the behavioral and cognitive patterns associated with autism. Crowdsourcing emerges as a pivotal strategy in this domain, allowing for the aggregation of diverse datasets that enhance the robustness of machine learning models. The review highlights key challenges, such as data privacy, ethical considerations, and the need for standardized protocols, which must be addressed to fully leverage these technologies. Furthermore, we propose a roadmap for future research, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of digital psychiatry tools into clinical practice. By harnessing the power of machine learning and digital phenotyping, we can move towards more personalized and effective interventions for individuals with autism, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life. This roadmap aims to guide researchers and practitioners in navigating the complexities of digital health innovations in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.", "label": 1}
