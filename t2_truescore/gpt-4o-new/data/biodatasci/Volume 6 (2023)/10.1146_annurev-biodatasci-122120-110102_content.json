{"grounding": "Understanding the noncoding part of the genome, which encodes gene regulation, is necessary to identify genetic mechanisms of disease and translate findings from genome-wide association studies into actionable results for treatments and personalized care. Here we provide an overview of the computational analysis of noncoding regions, starting from gene-regulatory mechanisms and their representation in data. Deep learning methods, when applied to these data, highlight important regulatory sequence elements and predict the functional effects of genetic variants. These and other algorithms are used to predict damaging sequence variants. Finally, we introduce rare-variant association tests that incorporate functional annotations and predictions in order to increase interpretability and statistical power.", "generated_text": "The identification of functional sequences and variants in noncoding DNA is crucial for understanding gene regulation and its implications in health and disease. This study leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze whole genome sequencing data, focusing on enhancer regions and transcriptional elements. By integrating genome-wide association studies, we aim to predict the effects of rare variants on gene expression. Our approach enhances the accuracy of variant effect prediction, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms of noncoding regions. This research advances the field of sequence analysis, offering a comprehensive framework for identifying functional noncoding sequences and their potential impact on genetic disorders.", "label": 1}
