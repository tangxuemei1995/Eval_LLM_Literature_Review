{"grounding": "SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is silent or benign in most infected individuals, but causes hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia in about 10% of cases. We review studies of the human genetics of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on both rare and common variants. Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified more than 20 common loci robustly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia with modest effect sizes, some implicating genes expressed in the lungs or leukocytes. The most robust association, on chromosome 3, concerns a haplotype inherited from Neanderthals. Sequencing studies focusing on rare variants with a strong effect have been particularly successful, identifying inborn errors of type I interferon (IFN) immunity in 1\u20135% of unvaccinated patients with critical pneumonia, and their autoimmune phenocopy, autoantibodies against type I IFN, in another 15\u201320% of cases. Our growing understanding of the impact of human genetic variation on immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is enabling health systems to improve protection for individuals and populations.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the critical role of human genomics in understanding disease susceptibility and severity. This study investigates the contributions of both rare and common genetic variants to the development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing data, we identify genetic loci associated with increased risk of severe respiratory complications. Our findings emphasize the significance of inborn errors of immunity, particularly those affecting type I interferon pathways, in predisposing individuals to severe COVID-19 outcomes. Rare variants in genes involved in immune response modulation were found to have a substantial impact, while common variants provided insights into population-level susceptibility. This research underscores the importance of integrating genetic data to unravel the complex interplay between host genetics and viral pathogenesis, offering potential avenues for personalized therapeutic strategies and informing public health interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of future pandemics.", "label": 1}
