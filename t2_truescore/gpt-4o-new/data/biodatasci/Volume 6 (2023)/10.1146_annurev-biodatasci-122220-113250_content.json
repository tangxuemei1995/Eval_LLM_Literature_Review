{"grounding": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revolutionized our understanding of common genetic variation and its impact on common human disease and traits. Developed and adopted in the mid-2000s, GWAS led to searchable genotype\u2013phenotype catalogs and genome-wide datasets available for further data mining and analysis for the eventual development of translational applications. The GWAS revolution was swift and specific, including almost exclusively populations of European descent, to the neglect of the majority of the world's genetic diversity. In this narrative review, we recount the GWAS landscape of the early years that established a genotype\u2013phenotype catalog that is now universally understood to be inadequate for a complete understanding of complex human genetics. We then describe approaches taken to augment the genotype\u2013phenotype catalog, including the study populations, collaborative consortia, and study design approaches aimed to generalize and then ultimately discover genome-wide associations in non-European descent populations. The collaborations and data resources established in the efforts to diversify genomic findings undoubtedly provide the foundations of the next chapters of genetic association studies with the advent of budget-friendly whole-genome sequencing.", "generated_text": "The integration of diversity in precision medicine is crucial for enhancing the generalizability of genetic associations across different ancestry groups, thereby improving the identification of disease susceptibility variants. This study examines the role of diverse cohorts and consortia in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to ensure that polygenic risk scores (PRS) are applicable to a broad range of populations. Historically, the underrepresentation of non-European ancestry groups in genetic research has led to biased risk predictions and limited the effectiveness of precision medicine. By incorporating diverse genetic data, researchers can better understand the genetic architecture of diseases and develop more accurate PRS. This approach not only enhances the predictive power of genetic tests but also ensures equitable healthcare outcomes across populations. The findings underscore the necessity of fostering diversity in genetic research to achieve the full potential of precision medicine. Future efforts should focus on expanding diverse genomic databases and fostering international collaborations to address the disparities in genetic research and healthcare delivery.", "label": 0}
