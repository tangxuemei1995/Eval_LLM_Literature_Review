{"grounding": "Advances in single-cell proteomics technologies have resulted in high-dimensional datasets comprising millions of cells that are capable of answering key questions about biology and disease. The advent of these technologies has prompted the development of computational tools to process and visualize the complex data. In this review, we outline the steps of single-cell and spatial proteomics analysis pipelines. In addition to describing available methods, we highlight benchmarking studies that have identified advantages and pitfalls of the currently available computational toolkits. As these technologies continue to advance, robust analysis tools should be developed in tandem to take full advantage of the potential biological insights provided by these data.", "generated_text": "Single-cell proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. This review explores computational methods tailored for single-cell proteomics, focusing on mass cytometry and spatial proteomics. We discuss advanced data analysis techniques, including clustering algorithms that identify distinct cell populations and trajectory inference methods that map cellular differentiation pathways. Emphasis is placed on the integration of high-dimensional data and the challenges of noise reduction and data normalization. By leveraging these computational approaches, researchers can gain deeper insights into cellular processes, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex biological systems. Future directions include enhancing computational efficiency and developing more robust analytical frameworks.", "label": 1}
