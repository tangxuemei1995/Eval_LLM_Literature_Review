{"grounding": "Breast cancer risk is highly variable within the population and current research is leading the shift toward personalized medicine. By accurately assessing an individual woman's risk, we can reduce the risk of over/undertreatment by preventing unnecessary procedures or by elevating screening procedures. Breast density measured from conventional mammography has been established as one of the most dominant risk factors for breast cancer; however, it is currently limited by its ability to characterize more complex breast parenchymal patterns that have been shown to provide additional information to strengthen cancer risk models. Molecular factors ranging from high penetrance, or high likelihood that a mutation will show signs and symptoms of the disease, to combinations of gene mutations with low penetrance have shown promise for augmenting risk assessment. Although imaging biomarkers and molecular biomarkers have both individually demonstrated improved performance in risk assessment, few studies have evaluated them together. This review aims to highlight the current state of the art in breast cancer risk assessment using imaging and genetic biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide, necessitating improved methods for risk assessment and personalized treatment strategies. This study explores the integration of molecular and radiomic features to enhance risk stratification in breast cancer patients. We focus on the combination of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) with advanced radiomic analysis derived from imaging modalities such as MRI and mammography. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we assess the predictive power of these combined features in identifying high-risk individuals. Our findings suggest that the integration of SNPs and PRS with radiomic data significantly improves the accuracy of risk prediction models compared to traditional methods. This approach not only facilitates early detection but also aids in tailoring personalized treatment plans, potentially improving patient outcomes. The study underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in cancer research, highlighting the potential of combining genetic and imaging data to refine risk assessment and enhance clinical decision-making in breast cancer management.", "label": 1}
