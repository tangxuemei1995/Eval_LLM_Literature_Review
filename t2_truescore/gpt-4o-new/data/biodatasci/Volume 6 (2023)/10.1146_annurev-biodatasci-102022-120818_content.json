{"grounding": "Despite monumental advances in molecular technology to generate genome sequence data at scale, there is still a considerable proportion of heritability in most complex diseases that remains unexplained. Because many of the discoveries have been single-nucleotide variants with small to moderate effects on disease, the functional implication of many of the variants is still unknown and, thus, we have limited new drug targets and therapeutics. We, and many others, posit that one primary factor that has limited our ability to identify novel drug targets from genome-wide association studies may be due to gene interactions (epistasis), gene\u2013environment interactions, network/pathway effects, or multiomic relationships. We propose that many of these complex models explain much of the underlying genetic architecture of complex disease. In this review, we discuss the evidence from multiple research avenues, ranging from pairs of alleles to multiomic integration studies and pharmacogenomics, that supports the need for further investigation of gene interactions (or epistasis) in genetic and genomic studies of human disease. Our goal is to catalog the mounting evidence for epistasis in genetic studies and the connections between genetic interactions and human health and disease that could enable precision medicine of the future.", "generated_text": "The intricate web of gene interactions, or epistasis, plays a pivotal role in the genetic architecture of human diseases, offering new insights into their etiology and progression. Recent advancements in multiomics technologies have significantly enhanced our ability to dissect these complex interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how genetic variants contribute to disease phenotypes. This review synthesizes current evidence on the role of epistasis in human disease studies, highlighting its implications for precision medicine. By integrating data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, researchers are uncovering novel gene-gene interactions that were previously obscured in single-omic studies. These findings underscore the necessity of considering epistatic effects in genetic analyses to improve the accuracy of disease risk predictions and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the review discusses methodological advancements in computational tools and statistical models that facilitate the identification and interpretation of epistatic interactions. As evidence continues to mount, it becomes increasingly clear that a paradigm shift towards incorporating epistasis in genetic research is essential for advancing our understanding of human diseases and enhancing the precision of medical interventions.", "label": 1}
