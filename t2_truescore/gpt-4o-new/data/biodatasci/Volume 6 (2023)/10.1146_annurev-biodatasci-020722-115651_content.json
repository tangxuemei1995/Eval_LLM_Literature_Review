{"grounding": "Following the widespread use of deep learning for genomics, deep generative modeling is also becoming a viable methodology for the broad field. Deep generative models (DGMs) can learn the complex structure of genomic data and allow researchers to generate novel genomic instances that retain the real characteristics of the original dataset. Aside from data generation, DGMs can also be used for dimensionality reduction by mapping the data space to a latent space, as well as for prediction tasks via exploitation of this learned mapping or supervised/semi-supervised DGM designs. In this review, we briefly introduce generative modeling and two currently prevailing architectures, we present conceptual applications along with notable examples in functional and evolutionary genomics, and we provide our perspective on potential challenges and future directions.", "generated_text": "Deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have emerged as powerful tools in functional and evolutionary genomics. These models offer novel approaches for understanding complex biological data by capturing intricate patterns and generating realistic synthetic data. In functional genomics, deep generative models facilitate the exploration of gene expression patterns and regulatory networks, enhancing our understanding of gene function and interaction. In evolutionary genetics, they enable the simulation of evolutionary processes and the prediction of genetic variation, providing insights into evolutionary dynamics and adaptation. This overview highlights recent advancements in the application of deep generative models, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize genomic research by offering new perspectives and methodologies for data analysis and interpretation.", "label": 1}
