{"grounding": "Admixed populations constitute a large portion of global human genetic diversity, yet they are often left out of genomics analyses. This exclusion is problematic, as it leads to disparities in the understanding of the genetic structure and history of diverse cohorts and the performance of genomic medicine across populations. Admixed populations have particular statistical challenges, as they inherit genomic segments from multiple source populations\u2014the primary reason they have historically been excluded from genetic studies. In recent years, however, an increasing number of statistical methods and software tools have been developed to account for and leverage admixture in the context of genomics analyses. Here, we provide a survey of such computational strategies for the informed consideration of admixture to allow for the well-calibrated inclusion of mixed ancestry populations in large-scale genomics studies, and we detail persisting gaps in existing tools.", "generated_text": "The genomic analysis of admixed populations presents unique challenges and opportunities in understanding complex traits. This study reviews current strategies and methodologies employed in the statistical genetics of admixed groups, emphasizing the integration of ancestry information to enhance genomic insights. We explore advanced computational methods that account for the intricate genetic architecture resulting from admixture, including novel algorithms for ancestry inference and admixture mapping. The paper highlights the importance of leveraging diverse genetic backgrounds to improve the resolution of association studies and the identification of trait-associated loci. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these strategies for personalized medicine and the potential to uncover genetic variants that are rare or absent in non-admixed populations. By addressing the complexities of admixture, this research aims to refine genomic analyses and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic diversity.", "label": 1}
