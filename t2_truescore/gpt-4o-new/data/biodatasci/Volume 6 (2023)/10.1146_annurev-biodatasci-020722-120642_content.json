{"grounding": "Organismal aging exhibits wide-ranging hallmarks in divergent cell types across tissues, organs, and systems. The advancement of single-cell technologies and generation of rich datasets have afforded the scientific community the opportunity to decode these hallmarks of aging at an unprecedented scope and resolution. In this review, we describe the technological advancements and bioinformatic methodologies enabling data interpretation at the cellular level. Then, we outline the application of such technologies for decoding aging hallmarks and potential intervention targets and summarize common themes and context-specific molecular features in representative organ systems across the body. Finally, we provide a brief summary of available databases relevant for aging research and present an outlook on the opportunities in this emerging field.", "generated_text": "The study of aging hallmarks at the single-cell level offers unprecedented insights into the mechanisms driving cellular senescence and organismal aging. This research focuses on developing advanced analysis tools and data resources to decode these hallmarks, identifying potential intervention targets. By leveraging single-cell technologies, we can dissect the heterogeneity of aging processes across different cell types and tissues, providing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular changes associated with aging. This approach not only enhances our knowledge of aging mechanisms but also facilitates the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related diseases. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating single-cell analysis in aging research to unravel complex biological processes and improve healthspan.", "label": 1}
