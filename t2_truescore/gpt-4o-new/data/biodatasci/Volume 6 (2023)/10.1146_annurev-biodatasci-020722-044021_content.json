{"grounding": "Alternative splicing is pivotal to the regulation of gene expression and protein diversity in eukaryotic cells. The detection of alternative splicing events requires specific omics technologies. Although short-read RNA sequencing has successfully supported a plethora of investigations on alternative splicing, the emerging technologies of long-read RNA sequencing and top-down mass spectrometry open new opportunities to identify alternative splicing and protein isoforms with less ambiguity. Here, we summarize improvements in short-read RNA sequencing for alternative splicing analysis, including percent splicing index estimation and differential analysis. We also review the computational methods used in top-down proteomics analysis regarding proteoform identification, including the construction of databases of protein isoforms and statistical analyses of search results. While many improvements in sequencing and computational methods will result from emerging technologies, there should be future endeavors to increase the effectiveness, integration, and proteome coverage of alternative splicing events.", "generated_text": "The identification of splice variants and isoforms is crucial for understanding the complexity of gene expression and protein function. This study explores the integration of transcriptomics and proteomics to identify alternative splicing events and their resultant protein isoforms. Utilizing both short-read and long-read RNA sequencing technologies, we provide a comprehensive analysis of transcript variants, highlighting the advantages of long-read RNA-seq in capturing full-length transcripts. Concurrently, top-down mass spectrometry is employed to characterize proteoforms, offering insights into the diversity of protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. Our findings demonstrate the complementary nature of these advanced methodologies in elucidating the landscape of splice variants and isoforms. This integrative approach not only enhances the accuracy of isoform identification but also provides a deeper understanding of the functional implications of alternative splicing in various biological contexts. The study underscores the potential of combining transcriptomic and proteomic data to advance precision medicine.", "label": 1}
