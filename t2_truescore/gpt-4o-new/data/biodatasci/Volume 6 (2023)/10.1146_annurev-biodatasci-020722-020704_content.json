{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and other data-driven technologies hold great promise to transform healthcare and confer the predictive power essential to precision medicine. However, the existing biomedical data, which are a vital resource and foundation for developing medical AI models, do not reflect the diversity of the human population. The low representation in biomedical data has become a significant health risk for non-European populations, and the growing application of AI opens a new pathway for this health risk to manifest and amplify. Here we review the current status of biomedical data inequality and present a conceptual framework for understanding its impacts on machine learning. We also discuss the recent advances in algorithmic interventions for mitigating health disparities arising from biomedical data inequality. Finally, we briefly discuss the newly identified disparity in data quality among ethnic groups and its potential impacts on machine learning.", "generated_text": "The increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedical research and healthcare has highlighted significant challenges related to data inequality, particularly across diverse populations. This study explores the implications of data inequality on health equity, emphasizing the need for AI models that are robust to subpopulation shifts. We examine the potential of multiethnic machine learning approaches to mitigate biases inherent in current datasets, which often underrepresent minority groups. By leveraging transfer learning techniques, we propose strategies to enhance model generalizability across diverse demographic groups. Our findings suggest that addressing data inequality through these AI methodologies can lead to more equitable healthcare outcomes. This research underscores the importance of developing AI systems that are not only technically proficient but also socially responsible, ensuring that advancements in biomedical AI benefit all segments of the population equitably.", "label": 1}
