{"grounding": "Since the first publication a decade ago describing the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the context of cancer, over 200 datasets and thousands of scRNA-seq studies have been published in cancer biology. scRNA-seq technologies have been applied across dozens of cancer types and a diverse array of study designs to improve our understanding of tumor biology, the tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic responses, and scRNA-seq is on the verge of being used to improve decision-making in the clinic. Computational methodologies and analytical pipelines are key in facilitating scRNA-seq research. Numerous computational methods utilizing the most advanced tools in data science have been developed to extract meaningful insights. Here, we review the advancements in cancer biology gained by scRNA-seq and discuss the computational challenges of the technology that are specific to cancer research.", "generated_text": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative technology for unraveling the complexities of human cancers at an unprecedented resolution. By enabling the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level, scRNA-seq provides insights into the heterogeneity of tumor cells and the diverse cell types within the tumor microenvironment. This approach facilitates the identification of rare cell populations, elucidates cellular interactions, and uncovers mechanisms of tumor progression and resistance to therapies. Integrating scRNA-seq data with advanced bioinformatics tools enhances our understanding of cancer biology and informs the development of targeted immunotherapies. As scRNA-seq continues to evolve, it holds promise for personalized cancer treatment strategies, offering a pathway to more effective and precise interventions in oncology.", "label": 1}
