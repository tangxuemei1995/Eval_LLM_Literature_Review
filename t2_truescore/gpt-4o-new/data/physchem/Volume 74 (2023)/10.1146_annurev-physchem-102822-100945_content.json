{"grounding": "Light-driven phenomena in organic molecular aggregates underpin several mechanisms relevant to optoelectronic applications. Modeling these processes is essential for aiding the design of new materials and optimizing optoelectronic devices. In this review, we cover the use of different atomistic models, excited-state dynamics, and transport approaches for understanding light-activated phenomena in molecular aggregates, including radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. We consider both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms and focus on the role of conical intersections as facilitators of internal conversion. We explore the use of the exciton models for Frenkel and charge transfer states and the electronic structure methods and algorithms commonly applied for excited-state dynamics. Throughout the review, we analyze the approximations employed for the simulation of internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and reverse intersystem crossing rates and analyze the molecular processes behind single fission, triplet-triplet annihilation, Dexter energy transfer, and F\u00f6rster energy transfer.", "generated_text": "The study of excited states in molecular organic aggregates is pivotal for advancing optoelectronic applications, including organic photovoltaics and light-emitting devices. This research focuses on the theoretical modeling of excited-state dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between radiative and nonradiative decay processes. By employing advanced exciton models, we explore the role of conical intersections in facilitating ultrafast nonradiative transitions. The investigation extends to phenomena such as singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation, which are crucial for enhancing device efficiency. Our models provide insights into the mechanisms governing energy transfer and loss, offering pathways to optimize material performance. Through a combination of quantum chemical calculations and kinetic modeling, we aim to elucidate the fundamental processes that dictate the behavior of excited states in molecular aggregates, thereby contributing to the design of next-generation optoelectronic materials.", "label": 1}
