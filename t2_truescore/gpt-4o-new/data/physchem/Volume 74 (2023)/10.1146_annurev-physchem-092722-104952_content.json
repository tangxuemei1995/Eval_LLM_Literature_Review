{"grounding": "Photochemical upconversion is a process whereby two lower-energy photons are converted into a higher-energy photon by sensitized triplet\u2013triplet annihilation. While recent interest in this process has been motivated by improving the efficiencies of solar cells, many applications are being explored. In this review, we address the underlying physicochemical phenomena that are responsible for photochemical upconversion. We review their kinetics, and the requirements for annihilators and sensitizers to design efficient upconversion systems. We discuss the spin physics of the bi-excitonic interactions and how the spin character of the triplet pairs can fundamentally limit the upconversion efficiency and give rise to the magnetic field effect on delayed photoluminescence. Finally, we address light-matter coupling phenomena that could be employed to enhance photochemical upconversion.", "generated_text": "Photochemical upconversion, a process that converts lower-energy photons into higher-energy ones, holds promise for enhancing solar energy applications. This study delves into the mechanisms of triplet\u2013triplet annihilation (TTA) and its role in overcoming the spin statistical limit, a key barrier in upconversion efficiency. We explore the influence of magnetic field effects on TTA kinetics, providing insights into optimizing the upconversion quantum yield. By examining various sensitizer-chromophore pairs, we identify configurations that maximize energy transfer efficiency. Our findings suggest that strategic manipulation of these parameters can significantly enhance upconversion performance, paving the way for more efficient solar energy harvesting technologies. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes governing photochemical upconversion and its potential applications.", "label": 1}
