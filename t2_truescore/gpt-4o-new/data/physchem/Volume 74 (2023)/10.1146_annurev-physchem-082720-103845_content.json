{"grounding": "Gas-phase molecular spectroscopy is a natural playground for accurate quantum-chemical computations. However, the molecular bricks of life (e.g., DNA bases or amino acids) are challenging systems because of the unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with the molecular size (active electrons) and/or the presence of large-amplitude internal motions. From the theoretical point of view, both aspects prevent the brute-force use of very accurate but very expensive state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methodologies. From the experimental point of view, both features lead to congested gas-phase spectra, whose assignment and interpretation are not at all straightforward. Based on these premises, this review focuses on the current status and perspectives of the fully a priori prediction of the spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules (containing up to two dozen atoms) in the gas phase with special reference to rotational and vibrational spectroscopies of some representative molecular bricks of life.", "generated_text": "Gas-phase computational spectroscopy has emerged as a pivotal tool in elucidating the structural and dynamical properties of the molecular bricks of life, such as amino acids, nucleotides, and simple sugars. This study addresses the challenges inherent in accurately predicting rotational and vibrational spectra of these complex molecules. The inherent flexibility and anharmonicity of these biomolecules pose significant computational challenges, necessitating advanced theoretical methods and high-level quantum chemical calculations. By integrating state-of-the-art computational techniques with experimental data, this research aims to enhance the accuracy of spectral predictions, thereby providing deeper insights into the fundamental properties of biomolecules in the gas phase. The findings underscore the importance of computational spectroscopy in advancing our understanding of molecular structure and dynamics, with implications for fields ranging from astrochemistry to biophysics.", "label": 1}
