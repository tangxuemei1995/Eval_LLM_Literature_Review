{"grounding": "Surfaces mediate the formation of stable glasses (SGs) upon physical vapor deposition (PVD) for a wide range of glass formers. The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of SGs and their anisotropic packing structures are controlled through the deposition parameters (deposition temperature and rate) as well as the chemical structure and composition of the glass former. The resulting PVD glass properties can therefore be related to the structure and dynamics of the glass surface, which can have oriented packing, enhanced surface diffusion, and a lower glass transition temperature, and can facilitate an enhanced aging rate of the interfacial region. We review our current understanding of the details of this surface-mediated SG formation process and discuss key gaps in our knowledge of glass surface dynamics and their effect on this process.", "generated_text": "The formation of stable glasses through surface-mediated processes has garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications. This study explores the role of physical vapor deposition in creating stable glasses, emphasizing the importance of surface-mediated equilibration. Enhanced surface mobility is identified as a critical factor facilitating the structural anisotropy observed in these materials. By examining the glass transition dynamics, we elucidate the mechanisms by which surface interactions contribute to the stabilization of glassy states. Our findings suggest that the controlled manipulation of surface conditions during deposition can lead to the production of glasses with superior stability and distinct structural characteristics. This research advances the understanding of glass formation and opens new avenues for designing materials with tailored properties for technological applications.", "label": 0}
