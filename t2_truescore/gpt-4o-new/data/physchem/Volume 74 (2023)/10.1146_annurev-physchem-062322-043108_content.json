{"grounding": "The magneto-optical signatures of colloidal noble metal nanostructures, spanning both discrete nanoclusters (<2 nm) and plasmonic nanoparticles (>2 nm), exhibit rich structure-property correlations, impacting applications including photonic integrated circuits, light modulation, applied spectroscopy, and more. For nanoclusters, electron doping and single-atom substitution modify both the intensity of the magneto-optical response and the degree of transient spin polarization. Nanoparticle size and morphology also modulate the magnitude and polarity of plasmon-mediated magneto-optical signals. This intimate interplay between nanostructure and magneto-optical properties becomes especially apparent in magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magnetic circular photoluminescence (MCPL) spectroscopic data. Whereas MCD spectroscopy informs on a metal nanostructure's steady-state extinction properties, its MCPL counterpart is sensitive to electronic spin and orbital angular momenta of transiently excited states. This review describes the size- and structure-dependent magneto-optical properties of nanoscale metals, emphasizing the increasingly important role of MCPL in understanding transient spin properties and dynamics.", "generated_text": "The study of magneto-optical properties in noble metal nanostructures has garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in advanced photonic and spintronic devices. This research explores the plasmon-mediated magneto-optics of these nanostructures, focusing on their unique ability to enhance and manipulate light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. By examining superatoms, which mimic the electronic properties of atoms, we investigate their role in spin-polarized emission and the resulting effects on magnetic circular photoluminescence. Additionally, the study delves into the magnetic circular dichroism exhibited by these nanostructures, providing insights into their optical activity under magnetic fields. Our findings reveal that the interplay between plasmonic resonances and magnetic fields in noble metal nanostructures can lead to novel optical phenomena, paving the way for the development of new materials with tailored magneto-optical properties. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of light manipulation in nanostructured materials.", "label": 1}
