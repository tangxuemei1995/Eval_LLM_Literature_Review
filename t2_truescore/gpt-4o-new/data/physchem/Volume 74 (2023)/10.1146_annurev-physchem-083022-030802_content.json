{"grounding": "Reactions at solid\u2013water interfaces play a foundational role in water treatment systems, catalysis, and chemical separations, and in predicting chemical fate and transport in the environment. Over the last century, experimental measurements and computational models have made tremendous progress in capturing reactions at solid surfaces. The interfacial reactivity of a solid surface, however, can change dramatically and unexpectedly when it is confined to the nanoscale. Nanoconfinement can arise in different geometries such as pores/cages (3D confinement), channels (2D confinement), and slits (1D confinement). Therefore, measurements on unconfined surfaces, and molecular models parameterized based on these measurements, fail to capture chemical behaviors under nanoconfinement. This review evaluates recent experimental and theoretical advances, with a focus on adsorption at solid\u2013water interfaces. We review how nanoconfinement alters the physico-chemical properties of water, and how the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water dictate energetics, pathways, and products of adsorption in nanopores. Finally, the implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.", "generated_text": "The study of adsorption at nanoconfined solid\u2013water interfaces is crucial for understanding the behavior of ions and molecules in nanoporous materials. This research investigates the effects of nanoconfinement on surface complexation and speciation within nanopores. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular simulations, we explore how confinement alters the physicochemical properties of adsorbates and the solid surface. Our findings reveal that nanoconfinement significantly influences the distribution and speciation of ions, leading to unique surface complexation phenomena not observed in bulk systems. The results demonstrate that the restricted environment within nanopores enhances specific interactions between adsorbates and the solid surface, which can be attributed to altered hydration dynamics and electrostatic interactions. This study provides new insights into the fundamental processes governing adsorption in nanoconfined systems, with implications for the design of advanced materials for catalysis, separation, and environmental remediation. Understanding these interactions at the nanoscale is essential for optimizing the performance of nanoporous materials in various applications.", "label": 1}
