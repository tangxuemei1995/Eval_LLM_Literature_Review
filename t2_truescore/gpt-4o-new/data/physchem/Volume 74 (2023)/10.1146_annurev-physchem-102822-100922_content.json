{"grounding": "We review our recent quantum stochastic model for spectroscopic lineshapes in the presence of a coevolving and nonstationary background population of excitations. Starting from a field theory description for interacting bosonic excitons, we derive a reduced model whereby optical excitons are coupled to an incoherent background via scattering as mediated by their screened Coulomb coupling. The Heisenberg equations of motion for the optical excitons are then driven by an auxiliary stochastic population variable, which we take to be the solution of an Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process. Here, we present an overview of the theoretical techniques we have developed as applied to predicting coherent nonlinear spectroscopic signals. We show how direct (Coulomb) and exchange coupling to the bath give rise to distinct spectral signatures and discuss mathematical limits on inverting spectral signatures to extract the background density of states.", "generated_text": "This study explores the optical signatures of stochastic processes in many-body exciton scattering, focusing on excitation-induced dephasing and its impact on quantum dynamics. Utilizing coherent nonlinear spectroscopy, we investigate the intricate interplay between many-body effects and quantum stochastic calculus. Our findings reveal that stochastic processes significantly influence exciton dephasing, leading to observable changes in optical spectra. By employing advanced theoretical models, we demonstrate how these processes manifest in the coherent response of excitonic systems, providing insights into the underlying quantum dynamics. The results highlight the importance of considering stochastic influences in the analysis of many-body exciton interactions, offering a deeper understanding of the dephasing mechanisms at play. This work paves the way for future studies on the role of stochasticity in quantum systems, with potential implications for the development of quantum technologies and materials.", "label": 0}
