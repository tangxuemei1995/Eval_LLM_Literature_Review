{"grounding": "The processes of genome expression, regulation, and repair require direct interactions between proteins and DNA at specific sites located at and near single-stranded\u2013double-stranded DNA (ssDNA\u2013dsDNA) junctions. Here, we review the application of recently developed spectroscopic methods and analyses that combine linear absorbance and circular dichroism spectroscopy with nonlinear 2D fluorescence spectroscopy to study the local conformations and conformational disorder of the sugar-phosphate backbones of ssDNA\u2013dsDNA fork constructs that have been internally labeled with exciton-coupled cyanine (iCy3)2 dimer probes. With the application of these methods, the (iCy3)2 dimer can serve as a reliable probe of the mean local conformations and conformational distributions of the sugar-phosphate backbones of dsDNA at various critical positions. The results of our studies suggest a possible structural framework for understanding the roles of DNA breathing in driving the processes of protein\u2013DNA complex assembly and function.", "generated_text": "This study explores the local conformation and conformational disorder of DNA backbones using site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy. By employing advanced 2D spectroscopy techniques, we investigate the dynamic behavior of DNA, particularly focusing on DNA breathing and its implications for protein-DNA interactions and DNA replication. The use of site-specific fluorescence labeling allows for precise monitoring of conformational changes at the molecular level, providing insights into the structural dynamics of DNA. Our findings reveal significant variations in DNA backbone conformation, which are crucial for understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication and the role of conformational disorder in biological processes. This research enhances our understanding of DNA structural dynamics and offers potential applications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting DNA-protein interactions. The study underscores the importance of exciton-coupled dimers as a powerful tool for probing DNA conformational landscapes.", "label": 1}
