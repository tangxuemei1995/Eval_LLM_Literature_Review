{"grounding": "Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) compose a class of luminescent materials that utilize the unique wavelength-converting properties of lanthanide (Ln) ions for light-harvesting applications, photonics technologies, and biological imaging and sensing experiments. Recent advances in UCNP design have shed light on the properties of local color centers, both intrinsic and controllably induced, within these materials and their potential influence on UCNP photophysics. In this review, we describe fundamental studies of color centers in Ln-based materials, including research into their origins and their roles in observed photodarkening and photobrightening mechanisms. We place particular focus on the new functionalities that are enabled by harnessing the properties of color centers within Ln-doped nanocrystals, illustrated through applications in afterglow-based bioimaging, X-ray detection, all-inorganic nanocrystal photoswitching, and fully rewritable optical patterning and memory.", "generated_text": "Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) have garnered significant attention due to their unique ability to convert low-energy photons into higher-energy emissions. This study explores the phenomena of photodarkening and photobrightening in UCNPs, emphasizing the pivotal role of color centers. These centers, which can be manipulated to enhance or diminish luminescence, are crucial for applications such as photon avalanching and photoswitching. The research further delves into the potential of UCNPs in X-ray detection and optical patterning, highlighting their versatility in emerging technologies. By understanding the mechanisms governing color center dynamics, this work paves the way for optimizing UCNPs in various applications, offering insights into their functionalization and integration into advanced photonic systems.", "label": 1}
