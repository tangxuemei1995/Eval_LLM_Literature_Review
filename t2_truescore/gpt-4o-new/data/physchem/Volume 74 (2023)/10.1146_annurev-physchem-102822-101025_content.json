{"grounding": "Predicting the whole process of a chemical reaction while solving kinetic equations presents an opportunity to realize an on-the-fly kinetic simulation that directly discovers chemical reactions with their product yields. Such a simulation avoids the combinatorial explosion of reaction patterns to be examined by narrowing the search space based on the kinetic analysis of the reaction path network, and would open a new paradigm beyond the conventional two-step approach, which requires a reaction path network prior to performing a kinetic simulation. The authors addressed this issue and developed a practical method by combining the artificial force induced reaction method with the rate constant matrix contraction method. Two algorithms are available for this purpose: a forward mode with reactants as the input and a backward mode with products as the input. This article first numerically verifies these modes for known reactions and then demonstrates their application to the actual reaction discovery. Finally, the challenges of this method and the prospects for ab initio reaction discovery are discussed.", "generated_text": "The Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method represents a significant advancement in the field of computational chemistry, particularly in the discovery of novel reaction pathways. This study explores the application of AFIR in mapping potential energy surfaces (PES) to identify feasible reaction paths in organic synthesis. By employing quantum chemical calculations, the AFIR method facilitates the automatic generation of reaction path networks, which are crucial for understanding complex chemical transformations. The integration of kinetic simulations with these networks allows for the prediction of reaction outcomes and the identification of optimal conditions for desired transformations. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of reaction discovery but also provides insights into the mechanistic aspects of chemical reactions. The study demonstrates the potential of AFIR in revolutionizing organic synthesis by enabling the systematic exploration of reaction space, thereby paving the way for the development of new synthetic methodologies. The findings underscore the importance of computational tools in advancing the frontiers of chemical research.", "label": 1}
