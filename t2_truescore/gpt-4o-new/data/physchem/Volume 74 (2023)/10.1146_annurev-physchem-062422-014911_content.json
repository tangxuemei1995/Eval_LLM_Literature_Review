{"grounding": "Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metallic nanostructures result in subwavelength optical confinement that enhances light\u2013matter interactions, for example, aiding the sensitivity of surface spectroscopies. The dissipation of surface plasmons as electronic and vibrational excitations sets the limit for field confinement but also provides opportunities for photochemistry, photocatalysis, and photothermal heating. Optimization for either goal requires a deeper understanding of this photothermalization process. In this review, we focus on recent insights into the physics and dynamics governing photothermalization of LSPRs in metallic nanostructures, emphasizing comparisons between the steady-state behavior and ultrafast time-resolved studies. The differences between these regimes inform how to best optimize plasmonic systems for applications under relatively low-intensity, continuous illumination (e.g., sunlight).", "generated_text": "This study delves into the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, focusing on the steady-state behavior of metallic nanoparticles. By employing Raman thermometry, we investigate the generation and dynamics of nonthermal carriers, particularly hot electrons, which play a crucial role in photocatalysis. Our findings reveal the intricate balance between energy absorption, carrier relaxation, and heat dissipation, providing insights into the efficiency of energy conversion processes. The results underscore the importance of understanding the steady-state conditions to optimize the performance of plasmonic systems in applications such as solar energy harvesting and chemical transformations. This research advances the fundamental knowledge of photothermal effects in nanoscale materials, paving the way for enhanced design strategies in nanotechnology.", "label": 0}
