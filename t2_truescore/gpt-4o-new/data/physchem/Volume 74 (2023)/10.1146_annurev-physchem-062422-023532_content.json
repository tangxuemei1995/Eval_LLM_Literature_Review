{"grounding": "Interaction analysis techniques, including the many-body expansion (MBE), symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, and energy decomposition analysis, allow for an intuitive understanding of complex molecular interactions. We review these methods by first providing a historical context for the study of many-body interactions and discussing how nonadditivities emerge from Hamiltonians containing strictly pairwise-additive interactions. We then elaborate on the synergy between these interaction analysis techniques and the development of advanced force fields aimed at accurately reproducing the Born\u2013Oppenheimer potential energy surface. In particular, we focus on ab initio\u2013based force fields that aim to explicitly reproduce many-body terms and are fitted to high-level electronic structure results. These force fields generally incorporate many-body effects through (a) parameterization of distributed multipoles, (b) explicit fitting of the MBE, (c) inclusion of many-atom features in a neural network, and (d) coarse-graining of many-body terms into an effective two-body term. We also discuss the emerging use of the MBE to improve the accuracy and speed of ab initio molecular dynamics.", "generated_text": "The study of many-body effects in aqueous systems is crucial for understanding complex intermolecular interactions that govern the behavior of water and solute molecules. This research explores the synergies between advanced interaction analysis techniques and the development of polarizable force fields to accurately model these effects. By employing many-body expansion methods, we dissect the contributions of individual and collective interactions, providing insights into the non-additive nature of forces in aqueous environments. The integration of these techniques with molecular dynamics simulations allows for a more precise representation of polarization effects, which are often neglected in traditional force fields. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating many-body interactions in the design of next-generation force fields, which can significantly enhance the predictive power of simulations in biological and chemical systems. This work paves the way for more accurate and efficient computational models, facilitating a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes in aqueous systems and their implications in various scientific and industrial applications.", "label": 1}
