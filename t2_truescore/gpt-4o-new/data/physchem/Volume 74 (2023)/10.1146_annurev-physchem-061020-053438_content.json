{"grounding": "Modern quantum chemistry algorithms are increasingly able to accurately predict molecular properties that are useful for chemists in research and education. Despite this progress, performing such calculations is currently unattainable to the wider chemistry community, as they often require domain expertise, computer programming skills, and powerful computer hardware. In this review, we outline methods to eliminate these barriers using cutting-edge technologies. We discuss the ingredients needed to create accessible platforms that can compute quantum chemistry properties in real time, including graphical processing units\u2013accelerated quantum chemistry in the cloud, artificial intelligence\u2013driven natural molecule input methods, and extended reality visualization. We end by highlighting a series of exciting applications that assemble these components to create uniquely interactive platforms for computing and visualizing spectra, 3D structures, molecular orbitals, and many other chemical properties.", "generated_text": "The integration of machine learning, graphical processing units (GPUs), and cloud computing is revolutionizing interactive quantum chemistry, enabling real-time simulations and analyses. This study explores the synergy between these technologies to enhance natural user interfaces and chemical structure recognition, facilitating more intuitive and efficient workflows for chemists. By leveraging the computational power of GPUs and the scalability of cloud resources, complex quantum chemical calculations can be performed interactively, providing immediate feedback and visualization. Extended reality technologies further augment this experience, offering immersive environments for exploring molecular structures and reactions. This approach not only accelerates research and discovery but also democratizes access to advanced quantum chemistry tools, making them accessible to a broader scientific community. The implications for education, research, and industry are profound, promising significant advancements in chemical sciences.", "label": 1}
