{"grounding": "A growing literature explores how local environments, or contexts, affect political behavior, especially by shaping interpersonal contact with social out-groups. While many studies still draw directly on long-standing hypotheses from contact theory, this research agenda increasingly focuses on new research questions, beyond the classic social psychology literature, and new empirical cases, including from across the lower- and middle-income world. We develop a typology of forms of context and contact to aid the aggregation of findings across disparate cases and demonstrate that the mechanisms that may account for the political effects of intergroup context and contact are broader than those typically explored in psychologically oriented research. We propose future directions for research in this area, including greater focus on the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact and greater attention to how built or computer-based environments may mediate or mirror the effects of demographic contexts.", "generated_text": "This study seeks to integrate the diverse strands of research examining how environmental contexts influence political behavior, with a particular focus on contact theory and neighborhood effects. By synthesizing findings from ethnic politics, inequality, and the built environment, this research aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the multifaceted ways in which context shapes political attitudes and actions. The analysis highlights the role of social interactions and spatial configurations in mediating political outcomes, emphasizing the importance of both physical and social environments. Through a review of empirical studies and theoretical models, the paper identifies key mechanisms by which context and contact interact to influence political behavior. This unifying approach not only advances the theoretical understanding of environmental effects on politics but also offers practical insights for policymakers seeking to address issues of inequality and social cohesion in diverse communities.", "label": 0}
