{"grounding": "A recent wave of research in political science examines the past using statistical methods for causal inference and formal theory\u2014a field widely known as historical political economy (HPE). We examine the development of this field. Our survey reveals three common uses of history in HPE: understanding the past for its own sake, using history as a way to understand the present, and using history as a setting to explore theoretical conjectures. We present important work in each area and discuss trade-offs of each approach. We further identify key practical and analytical challenges for scholars of HPE, including the accessibility of data that do exist and obstacles to inference when they do not. Looking to the future, we see improved training for scholars entering the field, a heightened focus on the accumulation of knowledge, and greater attention to underexplored topics such as race, gender, ethnicity, and climate change.", "generated_text": "Historical political economy examines the enduring impact of historical events and institutions on contemporary political and economic outcomes. This field integrates insights from history, economics, and political science to understand how legacies of the past shape present-day governance and development. By employing causal inference techniques and formal theory, researchers can identify persistent patterns and mechanisms through which historical factors influence modern societies. The study of historical political economy not only sheds light on the origins of current political and economic disparities but also informs policy interventions aimed at addressing these inequalities. As the field evolves, future research is poised to explore new methodological approaches and expand its scope to include diverse historical contexts. This interdisciplinary approach promises to deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between history and political economy, offering valuable insights for both scholars and policymakers.", "label": 0}
