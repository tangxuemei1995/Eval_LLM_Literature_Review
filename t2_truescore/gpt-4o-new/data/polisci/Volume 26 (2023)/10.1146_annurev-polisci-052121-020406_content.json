{"grounding": "We provide a unified language for studying power sharing in authoritarian regimes. Power-sharing deals entail not only sharing spoils between a ruler and challenger, but also establishing an enforcement mechanism. An arrangement does not truly share power without reallocating power to make it costly for the ruler to renege. Institutional concessions, such as delegating agenda control over policy decisions or empowering third-party enforcers, can reallocate power. However, weak institutions create a Catch-22 that inhibits credible commitment. When institutions are weak, self-enforcing power sharing is still possible if challengers have coercive means to defend their spoils. However, challengers can leverage their coercive capabilities to overthrow the ruler. This double-edged sword implies that a strategic dictator shares power only under specific conditions: challengers can credibly punish an autocratic ruler; if the ruler shares power, the challenger must willingly forgo taking harmful actions; and the ruler willingly acquiesces to diminished power and rents.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of authoritarian power sharing, exploring the concepts, mechanisms, and strategies that underpin governance in non-democratic regimes. Authoritarian power sharing is crucial for regime stability, as it addresses commitment problems and mitigates the risks of coups and civil wars. The research examines how institutions are designed to distribute power among elites, ensuring loyalty and reducing the likelihood of internal conflict. By analyzing historical and contemporary case studies, the study identifies key strategies employed by authoritarian leaders to maintain control, such as co-opting potential rivals and establishing robust security apparatuses. The findings highlight the delicate balance between coercion and co-optation, revealing how authoritarian regimes adapt to internal and external pressures. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the resilience and vulnerabilities of authoritarian systems, offering insights into the conditions under which power sharing can either stabilize or destabilize these regimes.", "label": 0}
