{"grounding": "The article reviews the recent advances in comparative political economy. It reconnects knowledge on growth regimes and welfare regimes by analyzing how growth and welfare regimes covary over both time and space. It underlines the fact that governments pursue different growth strategies to adjust to new economic environments, focusing in particular on welfare state reforms. Synthesizing the literature, we propose a definition of growth and welfare regimes that integrates different engines of growth as a way to track general trends in the evolution of capitalism. We analyze the main trends of three eras of capitalism: Fordism, neoliberal financialization, and the digitalized knowledge-based economy. We trace the various paths of change by identifying the five growth strategies governments have pursued to adapt their growth and welfare regimes to the new capitalist era. The result is not a typology of fixed types of capitalist models but a dynamic process of adjustment.", "generated_text": "This study explores the evolution of growth and welfare regimes through a comparative political economy lens, focusing on the transition from Fordism to financialization and the emergence of the knowledge-based economy. By examining diverse national trajectories, the research highlights how different countries have navigated these economic paradigms, resulting in varied welfare state configurations and growth outcomes. The analysis underscores the role of institutional frameworks and policy choices in shaping these paths, revealing that while global trends such as financialization and technological advancement influence all economies, local adaptations and historical contexts lead to distinct developmental patterns. The study contributes to the understanding of how welfare regimes adapt to changing economic conditions, emphasizing the interplay between global economic forces and national policy responses. This research provides insights into the sustainability and inclusivity of growth models, offering a nuanced perspective on the future of welfare states in an increasingly interconnected world.", "label": 1}
