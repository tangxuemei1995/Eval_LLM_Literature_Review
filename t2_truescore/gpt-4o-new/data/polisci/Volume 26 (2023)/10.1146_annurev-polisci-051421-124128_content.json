{"grounding": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing scholarly interest in nonviolent resistance\u2014a method of conflict in which unarmed people mobilize collective protests, strikes, and boycotts in a coordinated way. Mass movements that rely overwhelmingly on nonviolent resistance sometimes feature unarmed collective violence, fringe violence, or even organized armed action. What do we know about the effects of violent flanks on movement outcomes? This article reviews findings on the relationships between nonviolent and unarmed resistance, violence, and the outcomes of mass mobilization, as well as the directionality of these relationships. The balance of empirical evidence suggests that organized armed violence appears to reduce the chances for otherwise nonviolent movements to succeed, whereas unarmed collective violence has more ambiguous effects. The field will benefit from greater analytical precision in comparing the units of analysis, scope, intensity, and media framing of violent flank activity.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex interplay between violence and nonviolent resistance movements, focusing on the impact of violent flanks and unarmed collective violence, such as riots, on the efficacy of nonviolent protests. By analyzing historical and contemporary case studies, the research investigates how the presence of violence within or alongside nonviolent movements influences public perception, media coverage, and governmental response. The findings suggest that while violent flanks can sometimes draw attention to a cause, they often undermine the legitimacy and moral high ground of nonviolent campaigns, potentially reducing their overall effectiveness. However, in certain contexts, the threat or occurrence of violence may pressure authorities to engage in dialogue or reform. This nuanced understanding of the role of violence in nonviolent resistance highlights the strategic considerations for activists and policymakers aiming to achieve social and political change through peaceful means.", "label": 1}
