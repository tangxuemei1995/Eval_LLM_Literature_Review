{"grounding": "In this review, we focus on political inequality in rich democracies. In the two main sections, we look at participation and representation, respectively. The former discusses whether rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions have led to higher levels of inequality in participation. The latter looks at substantive and descriptive representation and asks how they might be linked. Research highlights that people with fewer individual resources participate much less than those with more resources, and collective organizations lose their ability to counter these trends. In terms of representation, the pattern is very similar. Not only are the opinions of decision-makers more congruent with those of the better off but policy choices also reflect their preferences more clearly. As the social distance between rulers and ruled increases, representative democracy gets more biased in favor of higher-status social groups.", "generated_text": "This study examines the multifaceted nature of political inequality in affluent democratic nations, focusing on participation, representation, congruence, and responsiveness. It explores how income inequality exacerbates disparities in political engagement and influence, leading to a democratic deficit where the interests of lower-income groups are underrepresented. The research highlights the role of trade unions as potential mitigators of political inequality, advocating for their capacity to enhance political participation and ensure more equitable representation. By analyzing cross-national data, the study identifies patterns of political congruence and responsiveness, revealing that higher income inequality often correlates with reduced political alignment between elected officials and the general populace. The findings underscore the necessity for policy interventions aimed at strengthening democratic institutions and promoting inclusive political processes to counteract the adverse effects of economic disparities on democratic governance.", "label": 1}
