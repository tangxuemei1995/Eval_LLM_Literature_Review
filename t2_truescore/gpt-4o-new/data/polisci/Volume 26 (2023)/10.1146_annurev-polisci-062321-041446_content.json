{"grounding": "The concept of racist dehumanization is essential for political scientists who seek to understand the nature, scope, and consequences of white racial prejudice in the United States today. Racist dehumanization consists of a variety of processes that construct, refashion, and maintain race by coding some people as white and therefore fully human and others as other than white and therefore less than fully human. In this review, we focus on the racist dehumanization of Indigenous people and Black people, arguing that processes of dehumanization have long been implicated in both the practice of race-making and concurrent efforts to exploit and dominate racialized groups. We posit that contemporary white racial prejudice can be understood, in part, as the residue of these processes, and we conclude by describing how accounting for racist dehumanization can transform the study of white racial prejudice.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate dynamics of racist dehumanization within the political landscape of the United States, focusing on its impact on racial attitudes towards Black, Indigenous, and other marginalized communities. By analyzing historical and contemporary instances of dehumanization, the research highlights how these practices are perpetuated through political rhetoric and policy. The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from sociology, political science, and psychology, to explore the mechanisms by which racial prejudice is institutionalized and normalized. It further investigates the role of media and political discourse in shaping public perceptions and attitudes towards race. The findings underscore the persistent influence of dehumanizing narratives in reinforcing systemic racism and suggest pathways for fostering more equitable racial attitudes. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the socio-political factors that sustain racial hierarchies and offers insights for policy interventions aimed at combating racism.", "label": 1}
