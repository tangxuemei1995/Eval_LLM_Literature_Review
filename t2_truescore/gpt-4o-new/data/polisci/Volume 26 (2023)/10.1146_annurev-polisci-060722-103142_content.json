{"grounding": "Political scientist Hakeem Jefferson (Stanford University) facilitated a discussion about race, policing, and the state of American democracy with fellow political scientists Cathy J. Cohen (University of Chicago), Yanilda M. Gonz\u00e1lez (Harvard Kennedy School), Rebecca U. Thorpe (University of Washington), and Vesla M. Weaver (Johns Hopkins University) on May 26, 2021. The conversation occurred a year after George Perry Floyd Jr., a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Moving beyond common notions of democracy that focus primarily on voting and electoral participation, the panelists discussed how American policing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, redefine citizenship, redistribute power, and shape marginalized people's understanding of their place in society. Closing remarks addressed the potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people and how political scientists can more usefully contribute to efforts that strengthen democracy for all. This is an edited transcript of the conversation and includes a bibliography of the sources mentioned. A video of the conversation is available online at \nhttps://www.annualreviews.org/r/BeyondtheBallotBox\n.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between democracy and policing in the United States, focusing on the dynamics of multiracial democracy and racial authoritarianism. By examining the historical and contemporary intersections of identity, criminal justice, and governance, the research highlights how policing practices have both shaped and been shaped by democratic ideals and racial hierarchies. The analysis delves into the systemic challenges faced by marginalized communities, particularly in the context of law enforcement and its impact on democratic participation and representation. Through a critical lens, the study interrogates the role of policing in perpetuating racial inequalities and its implications for the broader democratic framework. By engaging with diverse perspectives and empirical data, the research aims to foster a nuanced conversation about the potential for reform and the reimagining of policing within a truly inclusive democratic society. Ultimately, this work seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how to reconcile the principles of democracy with the realities of racialized policing practices, advocating for transformative justice and equity.", "label": 1}
