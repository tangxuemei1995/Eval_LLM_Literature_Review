{"grounding": "There is an unexamined paradox in the history of government in the West. The so-called absolutist monarchs of Europe overwhelmingly chartered republican corporations\u2014e.g., towns, universities, and guilds whose members elected their leaders. Indeed, modern constitutional democracy is patterned after them. Yet, modern democracies themselves have overwhelmingly chartered authoritarian corporations\u2014e.g., universities and business corporations whose subjects have no vote. After this Great Inversion, corporations, which once distributed power and wealth, now concentrate them, straining constitutional democracy. Against this backdrop, this article analyzes the major types of relation maintained between states and corporations: constitutive (states charter corporations), mimetic (states and corporations recurrently copy one another's organizational features), and instrumental (each leans on the other, and sometimes captures it, to better advance its own purposes). The article then examines the special challenges that corporate economies pose to constitutional democracy and considers whether a partial reversal of the Great Inversion could reduce them.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between democracy and the corporation, tracing its evolution from historical foundations to contemporary implications. By examining the principles of republicanism and constitutionalism, the research highlights how corporations have influenced democratic structures and vice versa. The analysis delves into the dual role of corporations as both economic entities and political actors, assessing their impact on democratic ideals and practices. A critical focus is placed on the tension between corporate power and democratic equality, particularly in the context of rising economic inequality. The study also considers the foundational principles of enterprise, questioning how these have been shaped by and have shaped democratic governance. Through a long-term perspective, the research aims to provide insights into the potential for harmonizing corporate influence with democratic values, offering pathways for reform that could enhance both economic and political systems. This work contributes to the broader discourse on sustaining democracy in an era of corporate dominance.", "label": 1}
