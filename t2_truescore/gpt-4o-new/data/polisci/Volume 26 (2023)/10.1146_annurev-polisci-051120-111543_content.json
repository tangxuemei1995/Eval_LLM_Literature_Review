{"grounding": "The structure and governance of global supply chains not only shape social and environmental outcomes for both countries and firms, but also affect the quality of life at the local level, for those who live and work at each site of production. Existing literature on supply chain governance focuses on the transnational firm and has yielded a wide range of theoretical and empirical findings about firm- and nation-level outcomes. However, we know less about the drivers of variation in more localized social and environmental outcomes across production sites, which may result from local, national, and global actors and institutions that may interact. I provide a brief overview of the dominant literature on supply chain governance, highlighting the tendency to take an actor-centric approach. I then identify opportunities to study local social and environmental consequences of networked production using a more explicitly multi-actor and multi-level approach that can allow us to identify potential trade-offs, double wins, or spillovers between social and environmental outcomes.", "generated_text": "This study explores a multi-level approach to supply chain governance, emphasizing the intricate interplay between structure and context within complex networks. By integrating concepts of polycentricity, the research highlights how diverse governance mechanisms operate across different levels of the supply chain, from local to global contexts. The study examines how environmental and labor considerations are embedded within these governance structures, influencing decision-making processes and outcomes. Through a comprehensive analysis of supply chain networks, the research identifies key factors that contribute to effective governance, including adaptability, transparency, and stakeholder engagement. The findings suggest that a polycentric governance model, which accommodates multiple centers of decision-making, can enhance the resilience and sustainability of supply chains. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic interactions between various actors and the environments in which they operate. The study contributes to the literature by providing a framework for analyzing supply chain governance that accounts for complexity and contextual variability, offering insights for both scholars and practitioners.", "label": 0}
