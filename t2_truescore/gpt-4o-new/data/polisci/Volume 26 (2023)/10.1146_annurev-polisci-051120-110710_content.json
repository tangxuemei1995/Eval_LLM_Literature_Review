{"grounding": "Recent years have seen a renewed interest in southern distinctiveness within the United States and its ramifications for the nation. This review provides an analysis of recent works and the interpretive issues they raise. I argue that collectively they have broken with the long-established image of the South in political science, the study of which was long organized around the region's anticipated convergence to the patterns of the post\u2013New Deal North. Recent texts have instead emphasized an enduring commitment to white supremacy and a determining influence for the region in shaping national politics and institutions. I identify two broad pathways of southern influence and discuss the debates over its sources. I then discuss recent works on southern regimes and the debates these have provoked. I conclude by suggesting that overcoming the limits of recent works will ultimately undermine some of our more sweeping interpretive claims and foundational premises.", "generated_text": "This study examines the pivotal role of the American South in shaping national political development, with a focus on the enduring legacies of Jim Crow, authoritarianism, and white supremacy. The South's unique political landscape, characterized by its historical commitment to racial segregation and disenfranchisement, has significantly influenced broader American political dynamics. Through an analysis of southern politics, this research highlights how the region's political strategies and ideologies have permeated national policies, particularly during the New Deal era. The study explores the mechanisms through which southern political elites maintained power and how their influence extended beyond regional boundaries, affecting federal legislation and party politics. By tracing the evolution of southern political influence, this research provides insights into the complex interplay between regional and national politics, underscoring the South's critical role in shaping the trajectory of American political development and the persistence of racial and authoritarian legacies.", "label": 0}
