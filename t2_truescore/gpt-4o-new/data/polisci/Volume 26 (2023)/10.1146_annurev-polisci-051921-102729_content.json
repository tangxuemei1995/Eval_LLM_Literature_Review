{"grounding": "This article reviews the field of citizenship studies, with attention to the causes and consequences of policy. It summarizes key findings and points of consensus across three research domains: the determinants of citizenship policy, the consequences of citizenship policy, and the consequences of citizenship, i.e., the utility of obtaining citizenship for immigrant integration. After identifying strengths and weaknesses of each, I propose new directions in research that widen the field in terms of cases and generalizable theory while also deepening the field through serious attention to approaches that center the immigrant experience.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate dynamics of citizenship policies in Western Europe, focusing on their causes and consequences. By analyzing naturalization processes, the research highlights how policy frameworks influence immigrant integration and societal cohesion. It explores the interplay between political, economic, and social factors driving policy changes and their impact on immigrants' access to citizenship. The findings underscore the importance of inclusive policies in fostering integration and the potential repercussions of restrictive measures. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of citizenship as a pivotal element in shaping multicultural societies.", "label": 0}
