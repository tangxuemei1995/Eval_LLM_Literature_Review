{"grounding": "Negative-stranded RNA viruses are a large group of viruses that encode their genomes in RNA across multiple segments in an orientation antisense to messenger RNA. Their members infect broad ranges of hosts, and there are a number of notable human pathogens. Here, we examine the development of reverse genetic systems as applied to these virus families, emphasizing conserved approaches illustrated by some of the prominent members that cause significant human disease. We also describe the utility of their genetic systems in the development of reporter strains of the viruses and some biological insights made possible by their use. To conclude the review, we highlight some possible future uses of reporter viruses that not only will increase our basic understanding of how these viruses replicate and cause disease but also could inform the development of new approaches to therapeutically intervene.", "generated_text": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses, including influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), present unique genetic systems that facilitate the study of viral replication and pathogenesis. These viruses possess segmented genomes, allowing for genetic reassortment and the development of novel strains. Recent advancements have enabled the creation of reporter strains, incorporating fluorescent and bioluminescent markers, which provide powerful tools for real-time visualization and quantification of viral infection in vitro and in vivo. These reporter strains have significantly enhanced our understanding of viral dynamics, host-pathogen interactions, and immune responses. Furthermore, they offer potential applications in antiviral drug screening and vaccine development. This review highlights the genetic manipulation techniques used to generate these reporter strains and discusses their experimental uses, emphasizing their contributions to virology research and therapeutic innovation.", "label": 1}
