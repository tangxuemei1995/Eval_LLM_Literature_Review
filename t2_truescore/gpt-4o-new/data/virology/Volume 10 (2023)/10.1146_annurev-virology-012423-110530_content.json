{"grounding": "The global rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and the waning efficacy of antibiotics urge consideration of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Phage therapy is a classic approach where bacteriophages (bacteria-specific viruses) are used against bacterial infections, with many recent successes in personalized medicine treatment of intractable infections. However, a perpetual challenge for developing generalized phage therapy is the expectation that viruses will exert selection for target bacteria to deploy defenses against virus attack, causing evolution of phage resistance during patient treatment. Here we review the two main complementary strategies for mitigating bacterial resistance in phage therapy: minimizing the ability for bacterial populations to evolve phage resistance and driving (steering) evolution of phage-resistant bacteria toward clinically favorable outcomes. We discuss future research directions that might further address the phage-resistance problem, to foster widespread development and deployment of therapeutic phage strategies that outsmart evolved bacterial resistance in clinical settings.", "generated_text": "The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to global health, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies. Phage therapy, which utilizes bacteriophages to target and destroy pathogenic bacteria, offers a promising solution. However, the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria remains a critical challenge. This study explores the development of phage therapy that can effectively counteract bacterial resistance through the exploitation of evolutionary trade-offs. By understanding the genetic and phenotypic changes that confer resistance, we aim to design phage cocktails that induce fitness costs in bacteria, thereby limiting their ability to evolve resistance. Our research employs a combination of experimental evolution, genomic analysis, and mathematical modeling to predict and manipulate bacterial evolutionary pathways. The findings suggest that strategically designed phage therapies can sustainably manage bacterial infections by leveraging evolutionary constraints, offering a viable alternative to traditional antibiotics in the fight against resistant pathogens.", "label": 1}
