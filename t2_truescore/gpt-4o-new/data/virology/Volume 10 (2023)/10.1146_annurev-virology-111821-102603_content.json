{"grounding": "The nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs), also known as the order Mononegavirales, have a genome consisting of a single strand of negative-sense RNA. Integral to the nsNSV replication cycle is the viral polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing the viral genome, to produce an array of capped and polyadenylated messenger RNAs, and replicating it to produce new genomes. To perform the different steps that are necessary for these processes, the nsNSV polymerases undergo a series of coordinated conformational transitions. While much is still to be learned regarding the intersection of nsNSV polymerase dynamics, structure, and function, recently published polymerase structures, combined with a history of biochemical and molecular biology studies, have provided new insights into how nsNSV polymerases function as dynamic machines. In this review, we consider each of the steps involved in nsNSV transcription and replication and suggest how these relate to solved polymerase structures.", "generated_text": "Nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses, classified under the order Mononegavirales, encompass significant human and animal pathogens, including paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, pneumoviruses, and rhabdoviruses. Central to their replication and transcription is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a multifunctional enzyme complex responsible for synthesizing viral RNA. This study delves into the structural and mechanistic intricacies of RdRp across various Mononegavirales families. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography have elucidated high-resolution structures, revealing conserved motifs and unique adaptations that facilitate viral RNA synthesis. These structural insights have unraveled the dynamic conformational changes and interactions with viral and host factors that underpin the polymerase's function. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of antiviral strategies targeting RdRp. This review synthesizes current knowledge, highlighting the diversity and commonalities in RdRp architecture and function, and discusses potential therapeutic implications for controlling infections caused by these pervasive viruses.", "label": 1}
