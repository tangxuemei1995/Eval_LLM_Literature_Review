{"grounding": "Host defense against viral pathogens is an essential function for all living organisms. In cell-intrinsic innate immunity, dedicated sensor proteins recognize molecular signatures of infection and communicate to downstream adaptor or effector proteins to activate immune defense. Remarkably, recent evidence demonstrates that much of the core machinery of innate immunity is shared across eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains of life. Here, we review a pioneering example of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity: the animal cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase\u2013stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway and its ancestor in bacteria, CBASS (cyclic nucleotide-based antiphage signaling system) antiphage defense. We discuss the unique mechanism by which animal cGLRs (cGAS-like receptors) and bacterial CD-NTases (cGAS/dinucleotide-cyclase in Vibrio (DncV)-like nucleotidyltransferases) in these pathways link pathogen detection with immune activation using nucleotide second messenger signals. Comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we highlight emerging questions in the field and examine evolutionary pressures that may have shaped the origins of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense.", "generated_text": "The study of nucleotide second messenger systems has unveiled critical insights into the mechanisms of innate immune signaling, particularly in antiviral defense. This review explores the evolutionary origins and functional mechanisms of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, alongside the cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS). Both systems utilize nucleotide second messengers to detect and respond to pathogenic threats, highlighting a conserved strategy across diverse biological domains. cGAS-STING is pivotal in mammalian antiviral immunity, detecting cytosolic DNA and triggering type I interferon responses. Conversely, CBASS, primarily found in bacteria, employs cyclic oligonucleotides to activate defense responses against phage infections. Recent discoveries of cGLR (cyclic GMP-AMP-like receptor) proteins suggest a potential evolutionary link between these systems, offering insights into the diversification of immune signaling pathways. Understanding these mechanisms not only elucidates fundamental aspects of immune biology but also opens avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting dysregulated immune responses in diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer.", "label": 1}
