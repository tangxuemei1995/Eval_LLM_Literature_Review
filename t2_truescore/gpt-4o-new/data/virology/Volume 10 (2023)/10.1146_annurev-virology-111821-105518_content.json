{"grounding": "Nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids across the intact nuclear envelope is an exceptional vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic translocation resulting in the delivery of herpesvirus capsids into the cytosol. Budding of the (nucleo)capsid at and scission from the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC) resulting in a transiently enveloped virus particle in the perinuclear space followed by fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The dimeric NEC oligomerizes into a honeycomb-shaped coat underlining the INM to induce membrane curvature and scission. Mutational analyses complemented structural data defining functionally important regions. Questions remain, including where and when the NEC is formed and how membrane curvature is mediated, vesicle formation is regulated, and directionality is secured. The composition of the primary enveloped virion and the machinery mediating fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM is still debated. While NEC-mediated budding apparently follows a highly conserved mechanism, species and/or cell type\u2013specific differences complicate understanding of later steps.", "generated_text": "Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies virus, undergo a complex nuclear egress process critical for viral replication and pathogenesis. This process involves the formation of the nuclear egress complex (NEC), which facilitates the budding of primary enveloped virions (PEVs) through the inner nuclear membrane. Despite significant advances in understanding the NEC's structural and functional dynamics, several aspects of nuclear membrane fusion and the subsequent release of PEVs into the cytoplasm remain elusive. Recent studies have elucidated the roles of viral and host proteins in NEC assembly and function, yet the precise mechanisms governing membrane curvature and scission are not fully understood. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular interactions and regulatory pathways involved in herpesvirus nuclear egress, highlighting the known components and identifying gaps in our understanding. Addressing these unknowns is crucial for developing targeted antiviral strategies that disrupt this essential stage of the herpesvirus life cycle, potentially leading to novel therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
