{"grounding": "Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) continue to experience chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which drives the persistence of latent HIV and prevalence of clinical comorbidities. Elucidating the mechanisms that lead to suboptimal immunity is necessary for developing therapeutics that improve the quality of life of PLWH. Although previous studies have found associations between gut dysbiosis and immune dysfunction, the cellular/molecular cascades implicated in the manifestation of aberrant immune responses downstream of microbial perturbations in PLWH are incompletely understood. Recent literature has highlighted that two abundant metabolite families, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), play a crucial role in shaping immunity. These metabolites can be produced and/or modified by bacterial species that make up the gut microbiota and may serve as the causal link between changes to the gut microbiome, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction in PLWH. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the role of the microbiome on HIV acquisition and latent HIV persistence despite ART. Further, we describe cellular/molecular cascades downstream of SCFAs and BAs that drive innate or adaptive immune responses responsible for promoting latent HIV persistence in PLWH. This knowledge can be used to advance HIV cure efforts.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids is increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in regulating immune homeostasis and inflammation, with significant implications for HIV persistence. This review explores the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and its metabolites influence immune function and contribute to the chronic immune activation observed in HIV-infected individuals. SCFAs, primarily produced through microbial fermentation of dietary fibers, have been shown to modulate immune responses by acting on various immune cells, thereby potentially mitigating inflammation and promoting immune tolerance. Concurrently, bile acids, which are modified by gut bacteria, serve as signaling molecules that can influence host metabolism and immune regulation. Dysbiosis, or the imbalance of microbial communities, is frequently observed in HIV patients and is associated with increased inflammation and immune dysfunction, which may contribute to viral persistence despite antiretroviral therapy. Understanding the role of the microbiome and its metabolites in HIV pathogenesis could unveil novel therapeutic targets aimed at restoring immune balance and reducing viral reservoirs. This review underscores the need for further research to elucidate the complex interactions between the microbiome, SCFAs, bile acids, and the immune system in the context of HIV infection.", "label": 1}
