{"grounding": "Phase separation of viral biopolymers is a key factor in the formation of cytoplasmic viral inclusions, known as sites of virus replication and assembly. This review describes the mechanisms and factors that affect phase separation in viral replication and identifies potential areas for future research. Drawing inspiration from studies on cellular RNA-rich condensates, we compare the hierarchical coassembly of ribosomal RNAs and proteins in the nucleolus to the coordinated coassembly of viral RNAs and proteins taking place within viral factories in viruses containing segmented RNA genomes. We highlight the common characteristics of biomolecular condensates in viral replication and how this new understanding is reshaping our views of virus assembly mechanisms. Such studies have the potential to uncover unexplored antiviral strategies targeting these phase-separated states.", "generated_text": "Biomolecular condensates, dynamic cellular structures formed through liquid-liquid phase separation, play a pivotal role in viral replication and assembly. This study explores the intricate relationship between viruses and these condensates, focusing on viral factories and viroplasms as key sites for virus assembly. We examine segmented RNA genomes, particularly in rotaviruses, to understand how phase transitions facilitate the spatial organization and efficiency of viral replication. By analyzing the mechanisms of condensate formation and their functional implications, we provide insights into the strategies employed by viruses to hijack host cellular machinery. This research underscores the potential of targeting biomolecular condensates in antiviral strategies, offering a novel perspective on combating viral infections by disrupting the phase-separated environments essential for viral life cycles.", "label": 1}
