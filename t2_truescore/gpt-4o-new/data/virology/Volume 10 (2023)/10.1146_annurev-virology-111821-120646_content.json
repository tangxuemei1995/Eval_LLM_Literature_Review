{"grounding": "Protein synthesis by the ribosome is the final stage of biological information transfer and represents an irreversible commitment to gene expression. Accurate translation of messenger RNA is therefore essential to all life, and spontaneous errors by the translational machinery are highly infrequent (\u223c1/100,000 codons). Programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121PRF) is a mechanism in which the elongating ribosome is induced at high frequency to slip backward by one nucleotide at a defined position and to continue translation in the new reading frame. This is exploited as a translational regulation strategy by hundreds of RNA viruses, which rely on \u22121PRF during genome translation to control the stoichiometry of viral proteins. While early investigations of \u22121PRF focused on virological and biochemical aspects, the application of X-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and the advent of deep sequencing and single-molecule approaches have revealed unexpected structural diversity and mechanistic complexity. Molecular players from several model systems have now been characterized in detail, both in isolation and, more recently, in the context of the elongating ribosome. Here we provide a summary of recent advances and discuss to what extent a general model for \u22121PRF remains a useful way of thinking.", "generated_text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a sophisticated translational control mechanism employed by various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, to optimize the expression of their genomic information. This process involves a shift in the reading frame of the ribosome, typically induced by specific mRNA structures such as pseudoknots, which are strategically positioned downstream of the frameshift site. Recent structural studies have provided significant insights into the molecular interactions between the ribosome and these mRNA elements, revealing how they induce conformational changes that facilitate frameshifting. Advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy have elucidated the dynamic nature of ribosomal engagement with pseudoknots, highlighting the critical role of ribosomal proteins and rRNA in stabilizing these interactions. Functionally, PRF allows viruses to regulate the stoichiometry of their protein products, which is crucial for their replication and pathogenicity. Understanding the structural and functional nuances of PRF not only enhances our comprehension of viral translation strategies but also opens avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting these processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the structural basis of PRF, with a focus on its implications for viral lifecycle management and potential antiviral strategies.", "label": 1}
