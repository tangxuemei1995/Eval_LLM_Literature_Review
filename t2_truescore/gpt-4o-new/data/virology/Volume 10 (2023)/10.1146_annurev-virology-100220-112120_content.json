{"grounding": "Understanding the factors that shape viral evolution is critical for developing effective antiviral strategies, accurately predicting viral evolution, and preventing pandemics. One fundamental determinant of viral evolution is the interplay between viral protein biophysics and the host machineries that regulate protein folding and quality control. Most adaptive mutations in viruses are biophysically deleterious, resulting in a viral protein product with folding defects. In cells, protein folding is assisted by a dynamic system of chaperones and quality control processes known as the proteostasis network. Host proteostasis networks can determine the fates of viral proteins with biophysical defects, either by assisting with folding or by targeting them for degradation. In this review, we discuss and analyze new discoveries revealing that host proteostasis factors can profoundly shape the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins. We also discuss the many opportunities for research progress proffered by the proteostasis perspective on viral evolution and adaptation.", "generated_text": "Viral evolution is intricately influenced by host proteostasis networks, which encompass protein folding biophysics, stress response mechanisms, and chaperone-mediated quality control systems. This study explores how these host cellular processes drive viral adaptation, enabling viruses to optimize their replication and survival strategies. By leveraging host chaperones and folding pathways, viruses can enhance their protein stability and functionality, thereby increasing their fitness. Additionally, the host's stress response and quality control mechanisms can inadvertently facilitate viral evolution by selecting for variants that resist degradation or misfolding. This dynamic interplay not only contributes to the emergence of drug and immune system resistance but also highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the molecular interactions between viral components and host proteostasis networks offers insights into the evolutionary pressures shaping viral genomes and provides a framework for developing strategies to mitigate viral pathogenicity and resistance. This research underscores the importance of host-pathogen interactions in viral evolution.", "label": 1}
