{"grounding": "N- and O-glycans are both important constituents of viral envelope glycoproteins. O-linked glycosylation can be initiated by any of 20 different human polypeptide O-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases, resulting in an important functional O-glycan heterogeneity. O-glycans are organized as solitary glycans or in clusters of multiple glycans forming mucin-like domains. They are functional both in the viral life cycle and in viral colonization of their host. Negatively charged O-glycans are crucial for the interactions between glycosaminoglycan-binding viruses and their host. A novel mechanism, based on controlled electrostatic repulsion, explains how such viruses solve the conflict between optimized viral attachment to target cells and efficient egress of progeny virus. Conserved solitary O-glycans appear important for viral uptake in target cells by contributing to viral envelope fusion. Dual roles of viral O-glycans in the host B cell immune response, either epitope blocking or epitope promoting, may be exploitable for vaccine development. Finally, specific virus-induced O-glycans may be involved in viremic spread.", "generated_text": "O-linked glycans, particularly those associated with mucin-like domains, play a critical role in the structure and function of viral envelope proteins. These glycans contribute to the viral life cycle by facilitating attachment, entry, and egress of virions. The interaction of O-linked glycans with host cell surface molecules, such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, is crucial for viral attachment and subsequent infection. This review explores the structural diversity of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins and their implications for viral pathogenesis. Understanding these interactions provides insights into the development of novel antiviral strategies, including vaccines. By targeting the glycan-mediated processes, it may be possible to inhibit viral attachment and egress, thereby reducing viral spread. The study of O-linked glycans in viral proteins not only enhances our understanding of viral biology but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at disrupting critical stages of the viral life cycle.", "label": 1}
