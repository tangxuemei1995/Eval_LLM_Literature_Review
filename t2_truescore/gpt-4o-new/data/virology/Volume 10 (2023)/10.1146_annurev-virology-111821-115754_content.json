{"grounding": "The mammalian gastrointestinal tract (GIT) hosts a diverse and highly active microbiota composed of bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses. Studies of the GIT microbiota date back more than a century, although modern techniques, including mouse models, sequencing technology, and novel therapeutics in humans, have been foundational to our understanding of the roles of commensal microbes in health and disease. Here, we review the impacts of the GIT microbiota on viral infection, both within the GIT and systemically. GIT-associated microbes and their metabolites alter the course of viral infection through a variety of mechanisms, including direct interactions with virions, alteration of the GIT landscape, and extensive regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Mechanistic understanding of the full breadth of interactions between the GIT microbiota and the host is still lacking in many ways but will be vital for the development of novel therapeutics for viral and nonviral diseases alike.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between the microbiota and viral infections has garnered significant attention in recent years, revealing the profound impact of microbial communities on host immune responses. This review explores the multifaceted roles of the microbiota and its metabolites in modulating viral pathogenesis and host defense mechanisms. The microbiome, through its diverse metabolic outputs, influences the virome by altering viral replication and persistence. Key to this interaction is the modulation of interferon signaling pathways, which are crucial for antiviral defense. Microbial metabolites can enhance or suppress interferon responses, thereby affecting the outcome of viral infections. Understanding these complex interactions offers potential therapeutic avenues for modulating the microbiota to enhance antiviral immunity. This synthesis of current research underscores the necessity of integrating microbiome studies into virology to develop comprehensive strategies for managing viral diseases, highlighting the microbiota's pivotal role in shaping host-pathogen dynamics.", "label": 1}
