{"grounding": "Bacteriophages are enigmatic entities that defy definition. Classically, they are specialist viruses that exclusively parasitize bacterial hosts. Yet this definition becomes limiting when we consider their ubiquity in the body coupled with their vast capacity to directly interact with the mammalian host. While phages certainly do not infect nor replicate within mammalian cells, they do interact with and gain unfettered access to the eukaryotic cell structure. With the growing appreciation for the human virome, coupled with our increased application of phages to patients within clinical settings, the potential impact of phage-mammalian interactions is progressively recognized. In this review, we provide a detailed mechanistic overview of how phages interact with the mammalian cell surface, the processes through which said phages are internalized by the cell, and the intracellular processing and fate of the phages. We then summarize the current state-of-the-field with respect to phage-mammalian interactions and their associations with health and disease states.", "generated_text": "The interaction between mammalian cells and bacteriophages, traditionally considered exclusive to bacterial hosts, is gaining attention for its potential implications in cellular immunity and inflammation. This study explores the mechanisms by which mammalian cells process bacteriophages, focusing on endocytosis and intracellular trafficking pathways. We investigate how these pathways influence the cellular response to phage presence, potentially modulating immune responses and contributing to the virome's complexity. Our findings suggest that mammalian cells utilize endocytic pathways to internalize bacteriophages, followed by trafficking to various intracellular compartments. This process may trigger immune signaling cascades, influencing inflammation and cellular homeostasis. By elucidating these interactions, we provide insights into the broader implications of phage presence in mammalian systems, highlighting their role in shaping immune responses and maintaining virome equilibrium. This research underscores the need to further explore the impact of bacteriophages on mammalian cellular processes, with potential applications in therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation and immune modulation.", "label": 1}
