{"grounding": "Enteric viruses display intricate adaptations to the host mucosal immune system to successfully reproduce in the gastrointestinal tract and cause maladies ranging from gastroenteritis to life-threatening disease upon extraintestinal dissemination. However, many viral infections are asymptomatic, and their presence in the gut is associated with an altered immune landscape that can be beneficial or adverse in certain contexts. Genetic variation in the host and environmental factors including the bacterial microbiota influence how the immune system responds to infections in a remarkably viral strain\u2013specific manner. This immune response, in turn, determines whether a given virus establishes acute versus chronic infection, which may have long-lasting consequences such as susceptibility to inflammatory disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interaction between enteric viruses and the immune system that underlie the impact of these ubiquitous infectious agents on our health.", "generated_text": "Enteric viruses, including norovirus, play a significant role in modulating the immune response within the intestinal environment. These viruses, which are a crucial component of the human virome, interact intricately with the host's immune system, influencing both innate and adaptive immunity. This immunomodulation can lead to varied outcomes, from asymptomatic infections to severe gastroenteritis. The mechanisms by which enteric viruses modulate immune responses involve complex interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies and vaccines. Recent studies have highlighted the dual role of enteric viruses in both promoting immune tolerance and triggering inflammatory responses, depending on the context of infection and host factors. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the immunomodulatory effects of enteric viruses, emphasizing the need for further research to unravel the complexities of virus-host interactions in the gut.", "label": 1}
