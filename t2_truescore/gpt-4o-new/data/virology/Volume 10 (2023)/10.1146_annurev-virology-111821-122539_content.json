{"grounding": "The large genetic and structural divergences between plants and fungi may hinder the transmission of viruses between these two kingdoms to some extent. However, recent accumulating evidence from virus phylogenetic analyses and the discovery of naturally occurring virus cross-infection suggest the occurrence of past and current transmissions of viruses between plants and plant-associated fungi. Moreover, artificial virus inoculation experiments showed that diverse plant viruses can multiply in fungi and vice versa. Thus, virus cross-infection between plants and fungi may play an important role in the spread, emergence, and evolution of both plant and fungal viruses and facilitate the interaction between them. In this review, we summarize current knowledge related to cross-kingdom virus infection in plants and fungi and further discuss the relevance of this new virological topic in the context of understanding virus spread and transmission in nature as well as developing control strategies for crop plant diseases.", "generated_text": "The study of cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses is an emerging field that explores the complex dynamics of virus transmission and interaction across different biological kingdoms. This research investigates the mechanisms by which plant and fungal viruses interact, focusing on the potential for cross-kingdom infection and the implications for virus transmission. Key areas of interest include the extracellular transfer of viral particles and the role of virus-virus interactions in facilitating or inhibiting cross-kingdom movement. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing innovative biocontrol strategies to manage viral diseases in plants and fungi. This study synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular and ecological aspects of these interactions, highlighting the potential for novel approaches to disease management. The findings underscore the importance of considering cross-kingdom viral dynamics in the broader context of ecosystem health and agricultural productivity.", "label": 1}
