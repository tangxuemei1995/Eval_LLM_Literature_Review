{"grounding": "There are at least 21 families of enveloped viruses that infect mammals, and many contain members of high concern for global human health. All enveloped viruses have a dedicated fusion protein or fusion complex that enacts the critical genome-releasing membrane fusion event that is essential before viral replication within the host cell interior can begin. Because all enveloped viruses enter cells by fusion, it behooves us to know how viral fusion proteins function. Viral fusion proteins are also major targets of neutralizing antibodies, and hence they serve as key vaccine immunogens. Here we review current concepts about viral membrane fusion proteins focusing on how they are triggered, structural intermediates between pre- and postfusion forms, and their interplay with the lipid bilayers they engage. We also discuss cellular and therapeutic interventions that thwart virus-cell membrane fusion.", "generated_text": "Viral membrane fusion is a critical step in the viral life cycle, facilitating the entry of viral genomes into host cells. This process is orchestrated by viral fusion proteins, categorized into class I, II, and III, each with distinct structural and mechanistic features. These proteins undergo conformational changes, transitioning through intermediates to form trimers-of-hairpins, which drive membrane fusion. The energetics of fusion are influenced by the interplay between fusion peptides or loops and the lipid bilayer, modulating lipid dynamics to overcome energy barriers. Additionally, host cell fusion restriction factors can impede this process, offering potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the intricate dance between proteins and lipids during viral fusion provides insights into viral pathogenesis and informs the development of antiviral strategies.", "label": 1}
