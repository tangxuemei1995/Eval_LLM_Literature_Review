{"grounding": "Plant viruses of the genus Tobamovirus cause significant economic losses in various crops. The emergence of new tobamoviruses such as the tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) poses a major threat to global agriculture. Upon infection, plants mount a complex immune response to restrict virus replication and spread, involving a multilayered defense system that includes defense hormones, RNA silencing, and immune receptors. To counter these defenses, tobamoviruses have evolved various strategies to evade or suppress the different immune pathways. Understanding the interactions between tobamoviruses and the plant immune pathways is crucial for the development of effective control measures and genetic resistance to these viruses. In this review, we discuss past and current knowledge of the intricate relationship between tobamoviruses and host immunity. We use this knowledge to understand the emergence of ToBRFV and discuss potential approaches for the development of new resistance strategies to cope with emerging tobamoviruses.", "generated_text": "The dynamic interaction between tobamoviruses and plant immunity represents a critical area of study in plant pathology. This research explores the complex mechanisms by which plants recognize and respond to tobamovirus infections, focusing on pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and the role of resistance genes. The study delves into the molecular strategies employed by plants, such as RNA silencing and the salicylic acid pathway, to counteract viral threats. Special attention is given to the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), highlighting their ability to overcome plant defenses. By examining the perpetual arms race between these viruses and plant immune systems, the research aims to uncover novel insights into enhancing crop resistance. The findings underscore the importance of integrating genetic and biochemical approaches to develop sustainable strategies for managing tobamovirus outbreaks, ultimately contributing to global food security.", "label": 1}
