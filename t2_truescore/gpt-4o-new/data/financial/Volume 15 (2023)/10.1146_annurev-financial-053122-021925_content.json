{"grounding": "This survey discusses the state of the art in research in racetrack and lottery investment markets. Market efficiency and the pricing of various wagers are studied along with new developments since the Thaler & Ziemba (1988) review. The weak form inefficient market pricing approach using stochastic programming optimization models changed racetrack betting from handicapping to a financial market allowing professional syndicates to operate as hedge funds. Topics discussed include arbitrage and risk arbitrage, syndicates, betting exchange rebates, behavioral biases, and fundamental and mispricing information in racetrack and lottery markets. Similar models can be used to successfully trade stock market anomalies. \nSupplemental Materials\n are included online.", "generated_text": "This study revisits pari-mutuel betting markets, focusing on racetracks and lotteries, to evaluate their efficiency and explore optimization strategies. By employing stochastic programming models, we analyze the dynamics of betting markets, particularly addressing the favorite-longshot bias. Our findings suggest that while racetrack betting markets exhibit certain inefficiencies, strategic approaches can enhance bettors' outcomes. The research further examines lottery strategies, providing insights into their operational mechanisms and potential for optimization. This comprehensive analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying factors influencing market behavior, offering valuable implications for both bettors and market regulators aiming to improve market efficiency and fairness.", "label": 1}
