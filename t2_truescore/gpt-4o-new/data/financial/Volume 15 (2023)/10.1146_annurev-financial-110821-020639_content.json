{"grounding": "The world has been confronted in recent decades with several infectious disease outbreaks caused by novel pathogens, with the COVID-19 pandemic being the most severe of these. In this article, I review some of the main elements of epidemiological models used to forecast the trajectory of a new epidemic and to guide public health policy responses to a new infectious disease. I argue that economists have a lot to contribute to the discussion of public health policies, particularly in regard to assessing the costs and benefits of alternative policies and in improving the modeling of changes in human behavior in response to new infectious diseases. This survey is intended to serve economists interested in starting research in these areas.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of epidemiological models in understanding and forecasting disease dynamics. This study reviews various modeling approaches, including compartmental models, agent-based models, and machine learning techniques, highlighting their applications in predicting infection spread, healthcare demand, and intervention outcomes. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each model type, emphasizing the importance of accurate parameter estimation and real-time data integration. The review also explores the challenges of uncertainty quantification and the need for adaptive models that can respond to evolving epidemiological data. By synthesizing recent advancements, this work aims to inform future model development and enhance the effectiveness of public health strategies in managing infectious disease outbreaks.", "label": 1}
