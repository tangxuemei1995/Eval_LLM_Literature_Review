{"grounding": "Discounting of deferred impacts of government policies is a long-established practice that has been the target of substantial litigation and continued philosophical debate. Legal challenges to the social rate of discount have resulted in general acceptance of the principle of discounting at a nonzero rate for both monetary and nonmonetary impacts. Courts have displayed a general familiarity with discounting and often require transparent justification for the selection of the discount rate based on established scientific principles. The philosophical issues are more wide-ranging and include whether nonmonetary impacts should be discounted, the use of the opportunity cost of capital or the social rate of time preference, the time frame that is pertinent for setting the discount rate, and determination of whose preferences should have standing. Intergenerational issues are particularly challenging, raising questions regarding which generation's preferences should be recognized, the potential for dynamic inconsistencies arising from preferential discount rates, and intertemporal inequities. Benefit-cost analyses that include appropriate recognition of benefits and costs for future generations serve a constructive function in providing a mechanism for recognizing future effects on social welfare.", "generated_text": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a pivotal concept in benefit-cost analysis, particularly when evaluating policies with long-term intertemporal and intergenerational impacts. This paper explores the legal and philosophical foundations of the SDR, emphasizing its role in balancing present and future benefits and costs. The study delves into the ethical considerations of discounting future generations' welfare, questioning the moral justification of valuing present benefits over future ones. It examines the legal frameworks that guide the application of SDR in policy-making, highlighting the tension between economic efficiency and equitable intergenerational resource allocation. By analyzing various philosophical perspectives, including utilitarian and deontological approaches, the paper seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the SDR's implications for sustainable development. The findings suggest that while the SDR is a necessary tool for decision-making, its application requires careful consideration of ethical principles to ensure that future generations are not disproportionately disadvantaged. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on how best to integrate legal and philosophical insights into the formulation of discount rates that reflect societal values and priorities.", "label": 1}
