{"grounding": "Most Western countries use a single discount rate to evaluate public investments and policies. This ignores the differential cost of risk, in a world where most risk markets exhibit surprisingly large prices of risk. The current discounting guidelines generate a misallocation of capital that entails a large welfare cost. We claim that the well-established asset pricing literature provides a strong normative justification in favor of risk-adjusting discount rates. More specifically, project-specific discount rates should be increasing in the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. This will favor projects whose net benefit materializes preferentially in low-income states, thereby recognizing their insurance benefit ex ante. The intuition is simple, the welfare benefit of the reform is large, and the methodology only requires evaluators to estimate an income elasticity on top of what is required in the current approach. It is time to fix our public discounting systems.", "generated_text": "This study examines the inadequacies in current public discounting systems, particularly in the context of environmental policy and carbon pricing. Discounting, a critical component of cost-benefit analysis, often fails to adequately account for long-term risks and uncertainties associated with climate change. The research highlights the need for risk-adjusted discount rates that better reflect the potential future impacts of carbon emissions. By integrating more robust risk adjustment mechanisms, policymakers can improve the accuracy of economic evaluations related to environmental projects. The paper proposes a framework for recalibrating discount rates to incorporate the social cost of carbon, thereby aligning economic incentives with sustainable development goals. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating climate change by ensuring that long-term environmental risks are appropriately valued in economic decision-making processes. The findings underscore the importance of revising discounting methodologies to support more informed and responsible policy decisions.", "label": 0}
