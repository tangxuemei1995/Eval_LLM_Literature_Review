{"grounding": "This review revisits the literature on fiscal capacity using modern tools from asset pricing. We find that properly accounting for aggregate risk substantially reduces fiscal capacity. In this environment, the gap between the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate is not a sufficient statistic for fiscal capacity. To borrow at the risk-free rate when aggregate growth is risky, governments need to ask taxpayers to insure bondholders against aggregate risk, but governments in advanced economies tend to insure taxpayers against aggregate risk. We use this asset pricing perspective to review alternative mechanisms to boost fiscal capacity that have been explored in the literature.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of fiscal policy and asset pricing by examining the term structure of government debt and its implications for fiscal capacity. We analyze how debt maturity influences the convenience yield, a premium investors are willing to pay for holding government securities. Our findings suggest that fiscal policy decisions, particularly those related to debt issuance and maturity, significantly impact the term structure and, consequently, asset prices. By integrating fiscal capacity into asset pricing models, we provide a nuanced understanding of how government debt dynamics affect financial markets, offering insights for policymakers and investors navigating the complexities of fiscal and monetary interactions.", "label": 0}
