{"grounding": "The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the predominant family of global short-term rate benchmarks for the past 40 years, ceased to exist in June 2023. Given the low volumes of interbank loans on which LIBOR had been based, the revelations that LIBOR had been manipulated, and the risks that countless LIBOR-dependent financial instruments without fallback rates would be cast into limbo, regulators over the last decade pushed to replace LIBOR with risk-free overnight rate benchmarks. In the United States, the new benchmark, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), is an overnight rate based on US Treasury repo transactions: Use of term rates and derivatives on term rates is limited, and use of credit-sensitive term rates is discouraged. This article recounts the rise and fall of LIBOR; reviews the academic literature on the efficiency benefits of benchmarks, the LIBOR scandal, and the pros and cons of risk-free versus credit-sensitive rate benchmarks; and calls for further academic work on the current policy of entrenching a single-benchmark SOFR regime relative to the alternative of encouraging a two- or multi-benchmark regime of SOFR and one or more credit-sensitive term rates.", "generated_text": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative short-term rate benchmarks marks a significant shift in global financial markets. This paper examines the post-LIBOR landscape, focusing on the adoption and implications of new benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the United States and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) in Europe. These risk-free rates are designed to provide a more stable and reliable foundation for interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments. However, the transition has also spurred the development of credit-sensitive rates like Ameribor, Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), and Across-the-Curve Credit Spread Index (AXI), which aim to capture credit risk more effectively. The study analyzes the impact of these benchmarks on market liquidity, pricing, and risk management practices. It also explores the challenges and opportunities presented by the coexistence of risk-free and credit-sensitive rates in the financial ecosystem. By evaluating the effectiveness and adoption of these new benchmarks, the paper provides insights into the evolving dynamics of interest rate markets in the post-LIBOR era.", "label": 1}
