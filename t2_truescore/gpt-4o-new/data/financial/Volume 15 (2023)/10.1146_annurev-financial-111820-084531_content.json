{"grounding": "Governments allocate a large share of real and financial capital globally, and their choices of discount rates for project and policy evaluation have a first-order effect on social welfare. The importance of adopting a principles-based approach to selecting discount rates has new urgency in light of the very long horizons over which the benefits and costs of policies to address climate change are being evaluated. The four articles in this theme provide an interpretive overview of the literature on many of the theoretical, practical, legal, and philosophical considerations for discount rate selection by governments. This introduction summarizes the main points of each article and highlights some of the common threads that emerge. These include the importance of using risk-adjusted rates, the problems that arise when discount rates are chosen to be artificially low, and the large disconnect between common government practices and the principles of financial economics.", "generated_text": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a pivotal concept in evaluating government projects and public investments, particularly those with long-term impacts such as climate change mitigation. This introduction to the ARFE theme on the SDR explores its role in determining the present value of future costs and benefits, influencing decisions on public policy and investment. The SDR is crucial in assessing the cost of carbon and other environmental externalities, as it reflects intergenerational trade-offs and ethical considerations about the welfare of future generations. This theme examines the theoretical underpinnings of the SDR, its application in various governmental contexts, and the debates surrounding its appropriate level. By integrating insights from economics, ethics, and environmental science, this collection aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the SDR's implications for sustainable development and policy-making, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to intertemporal equity and efficiency.", "label": 0}
