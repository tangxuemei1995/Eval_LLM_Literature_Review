{"grounding": "This article reviews the recent literature on algorithmic fairness, with a particular emphasis on credit scoring. We discuss human versus machine bias, bias measurement, group versus individual fairness, and a collection of fairness metrics. We then apply these metrics to the US mortgage market, analyzing Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data on mortgage applications between 2009 and 2015. We find evidence of group imbalance in the dataset for both gender and (especially) minority status, which can lead to poorer estimation/prediction for female/minority applicants. Loan applicants are handled mostly fairly across both groups and individuals, though we find that some local male (nonminority) neighbors of otherwise similar rejected female (minority) applicants were granted loans, something that warrants further study. Finally, modern machine learning techniques substantially outperform logistic regression (the industry standard), though at the cost of being substantially harder to explain to denied applicants, regulators, or the courts.", "generated_text": "The increasing reliance on machine learning algorithms in decision-making processes, such as credit scoring, has raised significant concerns about algorithmic fairness. This study explores the intersection of algorithms and fairness, focusing on the identification and mitigation of biases that may arise in machine learning models. We review various fairness metrics that have been proposed to evaluate and ensure equitable outcomes across different demographic groups. By analyzing the impact of these metrics on credit scoring systems, we highlight the challenges and trade-offs involved in achieving fairness. Our findings suggest that while no single metric can universally guarantee fairness, a combination of approaches tailored to specific contexts can enhance the fairness of algorithmic decisions. This research underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptation of fairness strategies to address evolving societal norms and expectations, ultimately contributing to more equitable and just algorithmic systems.", "label": 1}
