We then describe the legal and political institutions that characterize the system for restructuring and liquidating financially distressed firms, including recent reforms of China's bankruptcy law. Finally, we discuss the main challenges faced by China in the implementation of these reforms, including frictions in judicial enforcement. We also propose potential avenues for future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the mechanisms of default and bankruptcy resolution in China, focusing on the interplay between bankruptcy law, nonperforming loans, and shadow banking.
