{"grounding": "Market interest rates reflect the preferences of market participants. When market participants are missing, the average discount rate in the population may therefore differ from the market rate. Missing current market participants, such as constrained borrowers, tends to imply an average discount rate that is above the market rate, whereas missing future market participants, such as future generations, tends to imply an average rate below the market rate. Nonetheless, a government with the ability to transfer wealth intratemporally across agents will generally wish to use the market interest rate as a guide to policy. One robust argument for the use of a lower social discount rate is intrapersonal: Future selves discount the past, whereas current selves discount the future. Legacy utility may also justify a low social discount rate.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate dynamics between missing participants in financial markets and the determination of the social discount rate, emphasizing the roles of borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and legacy desires. By examining incomplete markets, the research highlights how these factors influence individual and collective decision-making processes regarding future investments and resource allocations. The analysis reveals that borrowing constraints limit market participation, affecting the social discount rate by altering the perceived value of future benefits. Additionally, altruistic behaviors and the desire for legacy shape intergenerational wealth transfers, further impacting discount rate calculations. The findings suggest that incorporating these elements into economic models can provide a more comprehensive understanding of social discount rates, ultimately informing policy decisions aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth and intergenerational equity.", "label": 0}
