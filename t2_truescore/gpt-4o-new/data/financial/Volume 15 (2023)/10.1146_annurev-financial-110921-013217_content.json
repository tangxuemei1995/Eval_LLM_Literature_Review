It also minimizes the monetary, cognitive, and psychological costs that households face in economic transactions. We review recent research on the features and effects of robo-advice on individual and aggregate economic outcomes through the lens of its differences from traditional human advice. We discuss the distributional implications of robo-advice, its potential role in increasing the effectiveness of economic policies, the role of providers\u2019 incentives, and several questions that are still wide open for researchers in finance, economics, social psychology, and related fields.", "generated_text": "This study explores the transformative impact of robo-advisors on household financial behavior, positioning them as rational economic agents.
