{"grounding": "The past half-century has seen major shifts in inflation expectations, how inflation comoves with the business cycle, and how stocks comove with Treasury bonds. Against this backdrop, we review the economic channels and empirical evidence on how inflation is priced in financial markets. Not all inflation episodes are created equal. Using a New Keynesian model, we show how \u201cgood\u201d inflation can be linked to demand shocks and \u201cbad\u201d inflation to cost-push shocks driving the economy. We then discuss asset pricing implications of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d inflation. We conclude by providing an outlook for inflation risk premia in the world of newly rising inflation.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate relationship between inflation and asset returns, focusing on risk premia and bond return predictability. By analyzing historical data, we explore how inflationary pressures influence asset performance, particularly during periods of stagflation. The research highlights the role of monetary policy in shaping investor expectations and asset pricing. Our findings suggest that inflation significantly impacts risk premia, with implications for bond market strategies. The study provides insights into the predictive power of inflation indicators for bond returns, offering valuable guidance for investors and policymakers in navigating inflationary environments. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of inflation's role in financial markets.", "label": 1}
