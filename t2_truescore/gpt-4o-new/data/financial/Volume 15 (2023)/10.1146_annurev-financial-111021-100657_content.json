{"grounding": "After two decades of low initial public offering (IPO) activity and a number of regulatory changes, the number of IPOs of both operating companies and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) boomed in the United States in 2021 before collapsing in 2022. In recent years, surging valuations have resulted in many private companies achieving \u201cunicorn\u201d status, a valuation of $1 billion or more, partly fueled by investments from mutual funds. Many of the unicorns that have gone public have done so with dual-class share structures. We compare three alternative mechanisms for going public, including traditional IPOs, mergers with SPACs, and direct listings. The most common exit for successful venture capital\u2013backed companies, however, continues to be by merging with a larger company.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolving landscape of initial public offerings (IPOs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), focusing on recent developments and trends. The analysis highlights the increasing popularity of SPACs as an alternative to traditional IPOs, driven by their expedited process and reduced regulatory scrutiny. The research also explores the rise of unicorn companies opting for confidential filings and direct listings, reflecting a shift towards more flexible and cost-effective public market entry strategies. Additionally, the implications of dual-class share structures on corporate governance and investor interests are discussed. By synthesizing current data and case studies, this paper provides insights into the strategic considerations influencing companies' choices between IPOs and SPACs in the contemporary financial environment.", "label": 1}
