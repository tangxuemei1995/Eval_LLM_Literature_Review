{"grounding": "The principles of financial economics provide equally important insights into the optimal choice of discount rates for both public and private sector decision-makers. However, most governments largely ignore those principles, taking their cost of capital for most purposes as their borrowing rate. This article reviews the arguments often made in support of status quo discounting practices, along with the counterarguments to them. Governments have a choice between several methodologies for risk adjustment, and the practical and conceptual reasons that favor a fair value approach are recapped. The limitations of a financial economics approach become apparent for decisions involving very long time horizons, such as for climate policies. For policies with long-term impacts, intergenerational concerns become paramount, projections of cash flows and discount rates become highly uncertain, and present value calculations are an intrinsically unreliable measure of value. No approach to discount rate selection can overcome those problems; alternative decision criteria need to be established. However, most government investments involve much shorter horizons, and the adoption of standard approaches to risk adjustment could significantly improve social welfare.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the limitations and insights that financial economics offers regarding the determination of the social discount rate, a critical component in government project valuation and policy decision-making. The social discount rate is pivotal in assessing the present value of future costs and benefits, influencing budgetary and fair value accounting practices. While financial economics provides robust frameworks for understanding market-based discount rates, its application to the social discount rate is fraught with challenges due to the unique nature of government projects, which often involve non-market goods and intergenerational equity considerations. The paper critically examines the assumptions underlying traditional financial models, such as the government cost of capital, and their applicability to public sector evaluations. It also highlights the need for a more nuanced approach that incorporates ethical and social dimensions, which are often overlooked in conventional financial analyses. By reflecting on these aspects, the study aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how financial economics can inform, yet also limit, the determination of the social discount rate in public policy contexts.", "label": 1}
