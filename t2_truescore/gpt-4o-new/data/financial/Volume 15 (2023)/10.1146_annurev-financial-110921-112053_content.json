{"grounding": "We review macro-finance models featuring nonlinear dynamics that have recently been developed in the literature, including models with funding liquidity constraints, market liquidity frictions, and bank run frictions, and discuss the empirical evidence and challenges of this class of models. We also construct an illustrative model featuring financial frictions and nonlinear dynamics for readers who are unfamiliar with the literature. We solve the model using different solution techniques, including both global and perturbation solution methods, and comprehensively compare the accuracy of these solutions. Within this framework, we highlight that local linearization approximations omit important nonlinear dynamics and yield biased impulse responses.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of nonlinear dynamics into macro-finance models, specifically focusing on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) frameworks. By incorporating endogenous jump risk and financial constraints, the research addresses systemic risk and liquidity challenges within the economy. The nonlinear approach allows for a more accurate representation of economic fluctuations and financial instability, providing insights into the complex interactions between macroeconomic variables and financial markets. The findings suggest that traditional linear models may underestimate the impact of financial shocks, highlighting the importance of considering nonlinearities in policy formulation and risk assessment. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of macro-financial linkages.", "label": 0}
