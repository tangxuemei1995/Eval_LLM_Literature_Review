{"grounding": "This article surveys the development of nonparametric models and methods for estimation of choice models with nonlinear budget sets. The discussion focuses on the budget set regression, that is, the conditional expectation of a choice variable given the budget set. Utility maximization in a nonparametric model with general heterogeneity reduces the curse of dimensionality in this regression. Empirical results using this regression are different from maximum likelihood and give informative inference. The article also considers the information provided by kink probabilities for nonparametric utility with general heterogeneity. Instrumental variable estimation and the evidence it provides of heterogeneity in preferences are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets, focusing on the application of random utility models and budget set regression techniques. We examine the phenomenon of bunching, where individuals cluster at certain points in the budget set due to nonlinearities, and employ instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues. Our analysis provides insights into consumer behavior under complex budget constraints, offering a robust framework for empirical investigation. By integrating theoretical and empirical approaches, we enhance the understanding of decision-making processes in the presence of nonlinear budget sets, contributing to the broader field of econometric analysis and policy evaluation.", "label": 0}
