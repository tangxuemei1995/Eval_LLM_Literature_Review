We highlight three main themes on which the literature has made great progress in the last 10 years: the domain of traits subject to cultural transmission; the microfoundations for the technology of transmission; and feedback effects between culture, institutions, and various socioeconomic environments. We conclude by suggesting interesting areas for future research.", "generated_text": "This study explores recent advancements in the economic theory of cultural transmission, emphasizing its role in the evolution of institutions.
