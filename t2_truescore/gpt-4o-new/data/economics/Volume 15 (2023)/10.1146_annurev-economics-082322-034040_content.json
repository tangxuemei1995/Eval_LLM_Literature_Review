{"grounding": "International trade contributes directly to global greenhouse gas emissions, as the carbon content of high-emission products is priced differently in different countries. This phenomenon is termed carbon leakage. Thus, not putting a price on carbon is theoretically equivalent to an export subsidy, although that would be difficult to challenge in the context of multilateral trade law. Leakage can be alleviated by pricing the carbon embedded in imported products through a border carbon adjustment (BCA), be it a tax, a carbon tariff, or a regulation requiring the purchase of emissions allowances. The design of a BCA is a compromise between environmental effectiveness in preventing leakage, economic effectiveness in preserving competitiveness and ensuring acceptability, technical feasibility of the implementation, and World Trade Organization compatibility. An import-limited BCA is more effective than free emissions allowances in reducing leakage, but it does not preserve the export competitiveness of the country imposing it.", "generated_text": "The implementation of border carbon adjustments (BCAs) has emerged as a pivotal strategy in addressing carbon leakage and ensuring the effectiveness of domestic climate policies. This paper explores the economic rationale behind BCAs, which aim to level the playing field for domestic industries facing stringent carbon regulations by imposing tariffs on imports from countries with laxer environmental standards. By analyzing the potential impacts of BCAs, the study highlights their role in mitigating carbon leakage, promoting global emissions reductions, and incentivizing non-participating countries to adopt similar climate measures. Furthermore, the concept of a 'climate club' is examined as a cooperative framework to enhance the effectiveness of BCAs, fostering international collaboration and reducing trade tensions. The findings suggest that while BCAs can drive significant environmental benefits, careful design and international coordination are crucial to minimizing adverse economic impacts and ensuring equitable outcomes across global markets.", "label": 1}
