Yet, these data are largely excluded from macroeconomic and finance research. We review work and relevant tools for measuring economic activity, market power, data markets, and the role of data in financial markets. We also highlight areas where future work is needed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of data and markets, focusing on the role of big data in shaping the data economy.
