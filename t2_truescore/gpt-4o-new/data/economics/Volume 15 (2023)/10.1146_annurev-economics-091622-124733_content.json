{"grounding": "In recent years, experiments have documented a new mechanism that leads to failures of profit maximization: the failure of contingent thinking (FCT). This article summarizes key experimental findings, clarifies what constitutes an FCT, and outlines how FCTs can be tested in other environments. Subsequently, we relate FCTs to recent theoretical work on cognitive limitations in behavioral economics. Finally, we connect FCTs to suboptimal behavior documented in applied environments.", "generated_text": "This study explores cognitive limitations in contingent thinking, focusing on the sure-thing principle within cognitive economics. Through behavioral experiments, we examine how individuals deviate from rational decision-making due to cognitive constraints. Our findings reveal systematic failures in applying contingent reasoning, challenging traditional economic models. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive limitations, offering implications for refining behavioral theories and enhancing decision-making frameworks in economic contexts.", "label": 0}
