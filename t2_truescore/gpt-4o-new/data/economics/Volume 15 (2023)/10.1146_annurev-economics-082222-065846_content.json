{"grounding": "The dynamic causal effect of an intervention on an outcome is of paramount interest to applied macro- and microeconomics research. However, this question has been generally approached differently by the two literatures. In making the transition from traditional time series methods to applied microeconometrics, local projections can serve as a natural bridge. Local projections can translate the familiar language of vector autoregressions and impulse responses into the language of potential outcomes and treatment effects. There are gains to be made by both literatures from greater integration of well-established methods in each. This review shows how to make these connections and points to potential areas of further research.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of local projections in applied economics, emphasizing their advantages over traditional vector autoregressions (VARs). Local projections offer a flexible framework for estimating impulse response functions, particularly in the presence of non-linearities and structural breaks. By integrating panel data, this approach enhances the robustness of causal inference, aligning closely with the potential outcomes framework. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of local projections through empirical examples, highlighting their ability to accommodate heterogeneous effects across different economic contexts. This methodology provides a valuable tool for economists seeking to derive more accurate and interpretable insights from complex economic data.", "label": 1}
