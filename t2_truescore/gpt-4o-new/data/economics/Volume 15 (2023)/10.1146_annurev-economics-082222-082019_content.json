{"grounding": "We review theoretical and empirical work on the economic effects of the United States and China trade relations during the past 20 years. We first discuss the origins of the China shock and its measurement and present methods used to study its economic effects on different outcomes. We then focus on the recent US\u2013China trade war. We review methods used to evaluate its effects, describe its economic effects, and analyze whether this increase in trade protectionism reverted the effects of the China shock. The main lessons learned in this review are that (a) the aggregate gains from US\u2013China trade created winners and losers; (b) China's trade expansion seems not to be the main cause of the decline in US manufacturing employment during the same period; and (c) the recent trade war generated welfare losses, had small employment effects, and was ineffective in reversing the distributional effects due to the China shock.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate dynamics of US\u2013China trade relations, focusing on the implications of trade policy, the trade war, and the 'China shock' on US manufacturing employment. Utilizing a dynamic spatial economics framework, the research explores how input-output linkages have influenced the distributional effects of trade policies across different regions and sectors in the United States. The analysis reveals that the 'China shock' significantly disrupted US manufacturing employment, with pronounced regional disparities. The trade war, characterized by escalating tariffs, further complicated these dynamics, leading to both short-term disruptions and long-term strategic adjustments in supply chains. By integrating input-output linkages into the analysis, the study provides a nuanced understanding of how interconnected economic activities amplify or mitigate the impacts of trade policies. The findings underscore the importance of considering spatial and sectoral heterogeneity in formulating trade policies that aim to balance economic growth with equitable employment outcomes.", "label": 1}
