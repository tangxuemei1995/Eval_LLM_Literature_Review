{"grounding": "This article compares early childhood enrichment programs that promote social mobility for disadvantaged children within and across generations. Instead of conducting a standard meta-analysis, we present a harmonized primary data analysis of programs that shape current policy. Our analysis is a template for rigorous syntheses and comparisons across programs. We analyze new long-run life-cycle data collected for iconic programs when participants are middle-aged and their children are in their twenties. The iconic programs are omnibus in nature and offer many services to children and their parents. We compare them with relatively low-cost, more focused home-visiting programs. Participants in programs that enrich home environments grow up with better skills, jobs, earnings, marital stability, and health, as well as reduced participation in crime. The long-run monetized gains are substantially greater than the costs of the iconic programs. A study of focused home-visiting programs that target parents enables us to isolate a crucial component of successful programs: They activate and promote the parenting skills of child caregivers. The home-visiting programs we analyze produce outcomes comparable to those of the iconic omnibus programs. National implementation of the programs with long-run follow-up that we analyze would substantially shrink the overall Black-White earnings gap in the United States.", "generated_text": "This study explores the pivotal role of parenting in fostering social mobility both within and across generations, emphasizing its impact on skill development and the reduction of inequality. By analyzing longitudinal data and employing a multidisciplinary approach, the research investigates how parenting practices influence the acquisition of cognitive and non-cognitive skills in children, which are critical for upward social mobility. The findings suggest that effective parenting strategies, characterized by supportive and nurturing environments, significantly enhance children's educational and occupational outcomes, thereby promoting intergenerational mobility. Furthermore, the study examines the transmission of social capital and values, highlighting how these elements contribute to breaking cycles of poverty and inequality. The research underscores the importance of policy interventions aimed at supporting parents, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to equip them with the resources and knowledge necessary to foster their children's development. By addressing the disparities in parenting resources and opportunities, the study advocates for a more equitable society where social mobility is attainable for all, regardless of socioeconomic status. This research contributes to the broader discourse on human development by illustrating the transformative potential of parenting in shaping future generations and reducing social inequality.", "label": 0}
