{"grounding": "This article reviews economic research on business taxation, with a focus on corporate income taxation. We discuss what this research can contribute to current debates about corporate tax policy and where existing research is incomplete or inconclusive, so that clarification is needed. The issues we discuss include the incidence of the corporate income tax, its effect on investment and economic growth, the problem of international tax avoidance, and the role of corporate taxes in economic crises, including the current debate about taxes on windfall profits.\n", "generated_text": "This study examines the dynamics of corporate taxation, focusing on tax incidence and its implications for multinational companies, particularly during economic crises. By analyzing tax policies and their impact on corporate behavior, the research highlights how economic downturns influence tax strategies and compliance. The findings suggest that multinational companies often adjust their tax planning to mitigate financial pressures, affecting global tax revenues. This paper contributes to understanding the complex interplay between corporate taxation and economic stability, offering insights for policymakers aiming to enhance tax systems' resilience.", "label": 0}
