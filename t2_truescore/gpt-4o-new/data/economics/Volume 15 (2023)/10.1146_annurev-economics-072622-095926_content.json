{"grounding": "China's financial system has been integral to its spectacular economic growth over the past 40 years. We review the recent literature on China's financial system and its connections to the Chinese economy based on the categories of Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (AFRE), a broad measure of the nation's yearly flow of liquidity accounting for unique features of China's financial system. While early work on China's financial system emphasizes the state-owned enterprise reform, the recent literature explores other more market-based financing channels\u2014including shadow banking\u2014that grew rapidly after 2010 and have become important components of AFRE. These new financing channels not only are intertwined with each other, but also, and more importantly, are often ultimately tied back to the dominant banking sector in China. Understanding the mechanisms behind these channels and their intrinsic connections is crucial to alleviate capital allocation distortion and mitigate potential systemic financial risk in China.", "generated_text": "This review examines the evolution and current state of China's financial system and its impact on economic development. Since the initiation of economic reforms, China's financial markets have undergone significant transformation, characterized by rapid growth and increased complexity. The study highlights the role of implicit guarantees in shaping market behavior and the challenges they pose to financial stability. Additionally, the review explores the burgeoning fintech sector, which has emerged as a pivotal force in reshaping financial services and enhancing financial inclusion. The interplay between traditional financial institutions and fintech innovations is analyzed, emphasizing regulatory responses and the need for a balanced approach to foster sustainable growth. By synthesizing recent literature, this review provides insights into the dynamic relationship between financial market development and economic reform in China, offering implications for policymakers aiming to navigate the complexities of a rapidly evolving financial landscape.", "label": 1}
