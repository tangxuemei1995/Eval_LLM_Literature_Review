{"grounding": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator and its demand system are ubiquitous in business cycles theory, macroeconomic growth and development, international trade and other general equilibrium fields; this is because the CES aggregator has many knife-edge properties that help to keep the analysis tractable in the presence of many goods and factors. However, this also makes it hard to tell which properties of CES are responsible for certain results. Furthermore, it is necessary to relax some of those properties for certain applications. In this article, I review several classes of non-CES aggregators, each of which removes some properties of CES and keeps the rest to introduce some flexibility while retaining the tractability of CES as much as possible. These classes are named after the properties of CES they keep. I explain how these classes are related to each other and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses to indicate which classes are suited for which applications.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of non-CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) aggregators, focusing on their role in economic modeling where traditional CES assumptions do not hold. We delve into the implications of nonhomothetic preferences and constant returns to scale (CRS) production functions, highlighting how these factors influence the behavior of aggregators. The study examines the concept of implicit additivity and its impact on the substitutability and complementarity of goods, distinguishing between gross substitutes and gross complements. Furthermore, the paper categorizes goods into essentials and inessentials, analyzing how these classifications affect consumer choice and market dynamics. By offering a guided tour through the theoretical landscape of non-CES aggregators, this research aims to enhance understanding of their application in diverse economic contexts, providing insights into more accurate modeling of real-world economic phenomena where traditional CES models may fall short.", "label": 0}
