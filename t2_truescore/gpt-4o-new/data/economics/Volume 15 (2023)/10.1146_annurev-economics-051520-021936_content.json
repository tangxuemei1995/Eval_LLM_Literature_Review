{"grounding": "We attempt to provide a systemic view of the process of regulating collusion, including detection and prosecution as well as bargaining between firms and regulators via consent orders, the production of evidence, and containment measures that may be taken if collusion cannot be addressed with more direct means. In addition, we try to do justice to the peculiarities of the legal system: Modeling the courts as they are, rather than as economists think they should be, is essential for economic analysis to improve the way collusion is regulated.", "generated_text": "This study examines the regulatory frameworks addressing collusion, focusing on the implications of the Twombly decision on the burden of proof. It explores the development of 'safe tests' to identify collusive behavior and the role of consent orders in enforcement. The integration of artificial intelligence in detecting and regulating collusion is also analyzed, highlighting its potential to enhance regulatory efficiency. The findings suggest that AI-driven tools can provide more precise and timely identification of collusion, thereby supporting more effective regulatory interventions.", "label": 0}
