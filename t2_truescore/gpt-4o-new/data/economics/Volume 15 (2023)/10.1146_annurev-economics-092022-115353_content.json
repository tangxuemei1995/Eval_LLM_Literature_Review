{"grounding": "Gender differences in negotiation are seen as contributing to the persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes. We review the literature on interventions aiming to mute differences in negotiation and assess their effectiveness in reducing the gender pay gap. We present research on initiatives that aspire to increase how often and how women negotiate, as well as institutional changes that ban negotiations, ban requests for employee salary history, and improve wage transparency. Along with reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of these initiatives, we point to unintended consequences that warrant caution at implementation. The review makes clear that initial efforts to push women to negotiate more like men have shifted to alter instead the conditions of the negotiation. This shift results not only from wanting to consider policies that \u201cfix the institutions\u201d rather than \u201cfixing the women,\u201d but also from evidence that these interventions are more successful in securing pay equity.", "generated_text": "This study explores gender disparities in negotiation outcomes and evaluates the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at reducing these gaps. Despite increasing awareness of gender inequality in professional settings, women often face challenges in negotiation, leading to disparities in salary and career advancement. The research examines interventions such as negotiation training programs, 'lean in' strategies, and policy measures like salary history bans and transparency mandates. By analyzing empirical data from diverse organizational contexts, the study assesses the impact of these interventions on negotiation success rates for women. Findings suggest that while negotiation training and 'lean in' strategies can enhance individual skills, systemic changes like salary history bans and transparency policies are more effective in leveling the playing field. The study concludes that a combination of personal empowerment and structural reforms is necessary to address gender disparities in negotiation outcomes comprehensively.", "label": 1}
