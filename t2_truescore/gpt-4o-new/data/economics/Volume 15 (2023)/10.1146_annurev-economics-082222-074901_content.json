{"grounding": "Over the last two decades, the unprecedented increase in non-bank financial intermediation, particularly the rise of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, accounts for nearly half of the external financing flows to emerging markets, exceeding cross-border lending by global banks. Evidence suggests that investment fund flows enhance risk sharing across borders and provide emerging markets access to more diverse forms of financing. However, a growing body of evidence also indicates that investment funds are inherently more vulnerable to liquidity and redemption risks during periods of global financial market stress, increasing the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. Benchmark-driven investments, namely passive funds, appear particularly sensitive to global risk shocks, such as tightening US dollar funding conditions, compared to their active fund counterparts. The procyclicality of investment fund flows to emerging markets during times of global stress poses financial stability concerns, with implications for the role of macroprudential policy.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate dynamics between non-bank financial intermediation and emerging market vulnerabilities in the context of global risk fluctuations. With a focus on investment funds and their role in international capital flows, the research highlights how benchmark investing practices can amplify the transmission of global risk shocks to emerging markets. The analysis reveals that non-bank financial entities, particularly investment funds, significantly influence the volatility and resilience of emerging markets by altering capital flow patterns in response to global risk perceptions. The study further explores the concept of tail risk, emphasizing its critical impact on financial stability in these markets. By employing a comprehensive dataset and advanced econometric techniques, the findings underscore the necessity for enhanced regulatory frameworks to mitigate systemic risks associated with non-bank financial intermediation. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness between global financial systems and emerging market economies, offering insights for policymakers and investors.", "label": 0}
