{"grounding": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) is rapidly attracting interest, as climate change is putting ecosystems at risk and endangering human communities globally. Due to the centrality of the ocean in the global carbon cycle, augmenting the carbon sequestration capacity of the ocean could be a powerful mechanism for the removal of legacy excess emissions. However, OCDR requires careful assessment due to the unique biophysical characteristics of the ocean and its centrality in the Earth system and many social systems. Using a sociotechnical system lens, this review identifies the sets of considerations that need to be included within robust assessments for OCDR decision-making. Specifically, it lays out the state of technical assessments of OCDR approaches along with key financial concerns, social issues (including public perceptions), and the underlying ethical debates and concerns that would need to be addressed if OCDR were to be deployed as a carbon dioxide removal strategy.", "generated_text": "Ocean Carbon Dioxide Removal (OCDR) is emerging as a pivotal strategy in mitigating climate change, yet it presents complex sociotechnical challenges. This study explores the multifaceted considerations surrounding OCDR, focusing on climate finance, public perception, and environmental ethics. The integration of OCDR into climate finance mechanisms is critical, necessitating robust frameworks to ensure equitable and effective funding. Public perception plays a crucial role in the acceptance and implementation of OCDR technologies, influenced by awareness, trust, and perceived risks. Furthermore, environmental ethics demand a careful evaluation of the potential ecological impacts and moral responsibilities associated with altering marine ecosystems. This research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to address these challenges, advocating for transparent stakeholder engagement and comprehensive policy development. By examining these sociotechnical dimensions, the study aims to contribute to a more informed and balanced discourse on the role of OCDR in global climate strategies.", "label": 1}
