{"grounding": "Understanding the nature of organic matter flux in the ocean remains a major goal of oceanography because it impacts some of the most important processes in the ocean. Sinking particles are important for carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and its movement to the deep ocean. They also feed life below the ocean's productive surface and sustain life in the deep sea, in addition to depositing organic matter on the seafloor. However, the magnitude of all of these processes is dependent on the transformation of sinking particles during their journey through the water column. This review focuses on the movement of organic matter from the surface ocean to the deep sea via the biological carbon pump and examines the processes that prevent this downward movement\u2014namely, attenuation via microbial colonization and zooplankton feeding. It also discusses how the depth-specific interactions among microbes, zooplankton, and aggregates determine carbon export as well as nutrient recycling, which in turn impact ocean production and Earth's climate.", "generated_text": "The ocean's biological carbon pump plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by facilitating the transfer of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean. This process is primarily driven by the production and downward flux of organic matter, including marine snow, fecal pellets, and other aggregates. The efficiency of carbon export is influenced by several biological factors, such as microbial degradation and zooplankton feeding, which can attenuate the flux of carbon as it descends through the water column. This review examines the mechanisms underlying carbon export from a biologist's perspective, focusing on the interactions between marine organisms and their environment. We explore how microbial communities contribute to the breakdown of organic matter, and how zooplankton feeding behaviors impact the formation and transformation of particulate organic carbon. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting changes in carbon sequestration in response to environmental shifts, thereby providing insights into the ocean's role in mitigating climate change.", "label": 1}
