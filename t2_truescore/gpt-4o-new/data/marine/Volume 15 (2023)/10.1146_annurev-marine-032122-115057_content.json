{"grounding": "Exchange of material across the nearshore region, extending from the shoreline to a few kilometers offshore, determines the concentrations of pathogens and nutrients near the coast and the transport of larvae, whose cross-shore positions influence dispersal and recruitment. Here, we describe a framework for estimating the relative importance of cross-shore exchange mechanisms, including winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling. For each mechanism, we define an exchange velocity as a function of environmental conditions. The exchange velocity applies for organisms that keep a particular depth due to swimming or buoyancy. A related exchange diffusivity quantifies horizontal spreading of particles without enough vertical swimming speed or buoyancy to counteract turbulent velocities. This framework provides a way to determinewhich processes are important for cross-shore exchange for a particular study site, time period, and particle behavior.", "generated_text": "The nearshore region is a dynamic interface where the exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles significantly impacts coastal ecosystems and human activities. This study investigates the mechanisms driving cross-shore exchange, focusing on the roles of turbulence, wind, surface waves, and internal waves. By integrating field observations with numerical modeling, we elucidate how these physical processes influence particle behavior and transport. Our findings reveal that wind-driven currents and wave-induced turbulence enhance the dispersion of plankton and pollutants, while internal waves contribute to vertical mixing and cross-shore transport. The interplay between these factors determines the distribution and fate of particles, with implications for nutrient cycling, pollutant dispersion, and coastal management. This research advances our understanding of nearshore dynamics, providing insights critical for predicting ecological responses and informing strategies to mitigate pollution impacts in coastal zones.", "label": 1}
