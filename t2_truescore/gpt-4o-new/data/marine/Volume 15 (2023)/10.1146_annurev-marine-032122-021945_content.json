{"grounding": "The world's eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) contribute disproportionately to global ocean productivity and provide critical ecosystem services to human society. The impact of climate change on EBUSs and the ecosystems they support is thus a subject of considerable interest. Here, we review hypotheses of climate-driven change in the physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology of EBUSs; describe observed changes over recent decades; and present projected changes over the twenty-first century. Similarities in historical and projected change among EBUSs include a trend toward upwelling intensification in poleward regions, mitigatedwarming in near-coastal regions where upwelling intensifies, and enhanced water-column stratification and a shoaling mixed layer. However, there remains significant uncertainty in how EBUSs will evolve with climate change, particularly in how the sometimes competing changes in upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification will affect productivity and ecosystem structure. We summarize the commonalities and differences in historical and projected change in EBUSs and conclude with an assessment of key remaining uncertainties and questions. Future studies will need to address these questions to better understand, project, and adapt to climate-driven changes in EBUSs.", "generated_text": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are critical oceanographic features that significantly influence marine biodiversity, fisheries, and global carbon cycles. This study examines the impacts of climate change on EBUS, focusing on alterations in upwelling intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution. Climate change is expected to modify wind patterns, ocean temperatures, and stratification, which are key drivers of upwelling processes. Our analysis synthesizes recent observational data and model projections to assess how these changes may affect nutrient dynamics, primary productivity, and ecosystem structure within EBUS. Results indicate a potential increase in upwelling intensity in some regions, driven by intensified alongshore winds, while other areas may experience reduced upwelling due to altered oceanic conditions. These shifts could lead to significant ecological and socio-economic consequences, including changes in fishery yields and biodiversity loss. The study underscores the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on these vital systems. Further research is essential to refine predictions and develop comprehensive conservation frameworks tailored to the unique challenges faced by EBUS.", "label": 1}
