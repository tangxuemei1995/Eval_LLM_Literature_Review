{"grounding": "The regular movements of waves and tides are obvious representations of the oceans\u2019 rhythmicity. But the rhythms of marine life span across ecological niches and timescales, including short (in the range of hours) and long (in the range of days and months) periods. These rhythms regulate the physiology and behavior of individuals, as well as their interactions with each other and with the environment. This review highlights examples of rhythmicity in marine animals and algae that represent important groups of marine life across different habitats. The examples cover ecologically highly relevant species and a growing number of laboratory model systems that are used to disentangle key mechanistic principles. The review introduces fundamental concepts of chronobiology, such as the distinction between rhythmic and endogenous oscillator\u2013driven processes. It also addresses the relevance of studying diverse rhythms and oscillators, as well as their interconnection, for making better predictions of how species will respond to environmental perturbations, including climate change. As the review aims to address scientists from the diverse fields of marine biology, ecology, and molecular chronobiology, all of which have their own scientific terms, we provide definitions of key terms throughout the article.", "generated_text": "Marine organisms exhibit a remarkable array of rhythmic behaviors and physiological processes that are governed by endogenous oscillators. These biological clocks enable organisms to anticipate and adapt to regular environmental cycles, such as circadian (daily), circatidal (tidal), circalunar (monthly), and circannual (yearly) rhythms. This review explores the mechanisms underlying these oscillators in both algae and marine animals, highlighting the genetic and molecular bases of their timekeeping systems. The synchronization of these rhythms with environmental cues is crucial for survival, influencing behaviors such as feeding, reproduction, and migration. However, the increasing impact of climate change poses significant challenges to these finely tuned systems. Alterations in temperature, ocean currents, and light availability can disrupt the synchronization between endogenous rhythms and environmental cycles, potentially leading to maladaptive responses. Understanding the resilience and adaptability of marine organisms' biological clocks in the face of such changes is essential for predicting the ecological consequences of climate change. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diversity and function of marine biological rhythms, emphasizing the need for further research to unravel the complex interactions between endogenous oscillators and the changing marine environment.", "label": 1}
