{"grounding": "Constraining rates of marine carbonate burial through geologic time is critical for interpreting reconstructed changes in ocean chemistry and understanding feedbacks and interactions between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. The Quaternary Period (the past 2.6 million years) is of particular interest due to dramatic variations in sea level that periodically exposed and flooded areas of carbonate accumulation on the continental shelf, likely impacting the global carbonate budget and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These important effects remain poorly quantified. Here, we summarize the importance of carbonate burial in the ocean\u2013climate system, review methods for quantifying carbonate burial across depositional environments, discuss advances in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial over the past three decades, and identify gaps and challenges in reconciling the existing records. Emerging paleoceanographic proxies such as the stable strontium and calcium isotope systems, as well as innovative modeling approaches, are highlighted as new opportunities to produce continuous records of global carbonate burial.", "generated_text": "The study of global Quaternary carbonate burial offers critical insights into the carbon cycle's response to glacial-interglacial dynamics. This research synthesizes proxy data and model-based reconstructions to evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of marine carbonate deposition over the Quaternary period. By integrating sediment core analyses with advanced modeling techniques, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms driving carbonate burial and its feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 levels. Despite advancements in reconstructive methodologies, significant uncertainties persist, particularly concerning regional variations and the influence of ocean circulation changes. These uncertainties challenge our understanding of the carbon cycle's sensitivity to climatic shifts. Our findings underscore the necessity for improved proxy records and model refinements to better constrain carbonate burial rates and their implications for past and future climate scenarios. This work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between marine carbonate systems and global climate regulation during the Quaternary.", "label": 1}
