{"grounding": "Climatic extremes are becoming increasingly common against a background trend of global warming. In the oceans, marine heatwaves (MHWs)\u2014discrete periods of anomalously warm water\u2014have intensified and become more frequent over the past century, impacting the integrity of marine ecosystems globally. We review and synthesize current understanding of MHW impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. We then examine how these impacts affect broader ecosystem services and discuss the current state of research on biological impacts of MHWs. Finally, we explore current and emergent approaches to predicting the occurrence andimpacts of future events, along with adaptation and management approaches. With further increases in intensity and frequency projected for coming decades, MHWs are emerging as pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems globally. A deeper mechanistic understanding of their biological impacts is needed to better predict and adapt to increased MHW activity in the Anthropocene.", "generated_text": "Marine heatwaves, as extreme events driven by climate change, are increasingly impacting marine ecosystems worldwide. These prolonged periods of anomalously high sea temperatures disrupt the delicate balance of oceanic environments, leading to significant alterations in ecosystem services. The biological impacts are profound, affecting species distribution, abundance, and community structure. Ocean warming exacerbates these effects, threatening biodiversity and the resilience of marine ecosystems. This study synthesizes recent findings on the ecological consequences of marine heatwaves, highlighting the vulnerability of key species and habitats. It underscores the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate these impacts and preserve ecosystem services vital for human well-being. Understanding the complex interactions between marine heatwaves and biological systems is crucial for predicting future changes and developing effective conservation policies in the face of ongoing environmental change.", "label": 1}
