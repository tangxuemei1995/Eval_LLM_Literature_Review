{"grounding": "To thrive in nutrient-poor waters, coral reefs must retain and recycle materials efficiently. This review centers microbial processes in facilitating the persistence and stability of coral reefs, specifically the role of these processes in transforming and recycling the dissolved organic matter (DOM) that acts as an invisible currency in reef production, nutrient exchange, and organismal interactions. The defining characteristics of coral reefs, including high productivity, balanced metabolism, high biodiversity, nutrient retention, and structural complexity, are inextricably linked to microbial processing of DOM. The composition of microbes and DOM in reefs is summarized, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of biogeochemical processes carried out by microorganisms in diverse reef habitats are explored in a variety of key reef processes, including decomposition, accretion, trophictransfer, and macronutrient recycling. Finally, we examine how widespread habitat degradation of reefs is altering these important microbe\u2013DOM interactions, creating feedbacks that reduce reef resilience to global change.", "generated_text": "Coral reefs are dynamic ecosystems where microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) play a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem function and resilience. This study explores the complex relationships between coral reef microbiomes and DOM, emphasizing their influence on nutrient cycling and overall ecosystem health. As coral reefs face increasing threats from deoxygenation and climate change, understanding these interactions becomes crucial. Microbial communities metabolize DOM, facilitating nutrient recycling and supporting coral and algal growth. This process is essential for sustaining biodiversity and productivity in reef environments. The research highlights how shifts in DOM composition, driven by environmental stressors, can alter microbial community structure and function, potentially impacting reef resilience. By elucidating the mechanisms of microbial-DOM interactions, this study provides insights into the adaptive capacity of coral reefs, offering potential strategies for conservation and management in the face of global environmental changes.", "label": 1}
