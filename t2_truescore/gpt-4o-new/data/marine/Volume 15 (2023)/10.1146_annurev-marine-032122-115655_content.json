{"grounding": "The oceanic waters below a depth of 200 m represent, in terms of volume, the largest habitat of the biosphere, harboring approximately 70% of the prokaryotic biomass in the oceanic water column. These waters are characterized by low temperature, increasing hydrostatic pressure, and decreasing organic matter supply with depth. Recent methodological advances in microbial oceanography have refined our view of the ecology of prokaryotes in the dark ocean. Here, we review the ecology of prokaryotes of the dark ocean, present data on the biomass distribution and heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic prokaryotic production in the major oceanic basins, and highlight the phylogenetic and functional diversity of this part of the ocean. We describe the connectivity of surface and deep-water prokaryotes and the molecular adaptations of piezophilic prokaryotes to high hydrostatic pressure. We also highlight knowledge gaps in the ecology of the dark ocean's prokaryotes and their role in the biogeochemical cycles in the largest habitat of the biosphere.", "generated_text": "The deep ocean's water column, a vast and largely unexplored environment, harbors a diverse array of prokaryotic life forms, including bacteria and archaea. This study delves into the microbial oceanography of these prokaryotes, examining their distribution, diversity, and metabolic activities. Utilizing advanced molecular techniques and in situ sampling, we reveal the complex ecological roles these microorganisms play in biogeochemical cycles. Our findings highlight the metabolic versatility of deep ocean prokaryotes, which thrive under extreme conditions of pressure, low temperature, and limited nutrient availability. The study underscores the significance of prokaryotic communities in carbon and nitrogen cycling, contributing to the ocean's overall productivity and resilience. Furthermore, the research provides insights into the evolutionary adaptations that enable these microorganisms to survive and function in such a challenging environment. This work not only enhances our understanding of deep-sea ecosystems but also informs broader ecological and evolutionary theories regarding life in extreme habitats.", "label": 1}
