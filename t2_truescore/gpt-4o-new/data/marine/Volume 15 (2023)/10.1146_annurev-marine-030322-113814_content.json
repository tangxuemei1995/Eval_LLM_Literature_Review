{"grounding": "Fishing provides the world with an important component of its food supply, but it also negatively impacts the biodiversity of marine and freshwater ecosystems, especially when industrial fishing is involved. To mitigate these impacts, civil society needs access to fisheries data (i.e., catches and catch-derived indicators of these impacts). Such data, however, must be more comprehensive than the official fisheries statistics supplied to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) by its member countries, which shape public policy in spite of their deficiencies, notably underestimating small-scale fisheries. This article documents the creation, based on the geographically coarse FAO data, of a database and website (\nhttps://www.seaaroundus.org\n) that provides free reconstructed (i.e., corrected) catch data by ecosystem, country, species, gear type, commercial value, etc., to any interested person, along with catch-derived indicators from 1950 to the near present for the entire world.", "generated_text": "The study explores the profound human impacts on marine ecosystems through a comprehensive analysis of global fisheries, emphasizing the role of The Sea Around Us project in serving civil society. By integrating data science with global studies, the research highlights the critical contributions of both artisanal and subsistence fisheries alongside large-scale operations. The project provides open access to extensive datasets, enabling a nuanced understanding of fisheries' socio-economic and environmental dimensions. This approach facilitates informed decision-making and policy development aimed at sustainable ocean management. The findings underscore the necessity of balancing human needs with ecological preservation, advocating for enhanced collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and communities. By documenting the intricate interactions between human activities and marine environments, the study offers valuable insights into the sustainable stewardship of ocean resources in the twenty-first century, reinforcing the importance of open data in addressing global challenges.", "label": 0}
