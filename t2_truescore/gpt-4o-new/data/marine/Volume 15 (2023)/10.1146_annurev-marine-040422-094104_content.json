{"grounding": "Lipids are structurally diverse biomolecules that serve multiple roles in cells. As such, they are used as biomarkers in the modern ocean and as paleoproxies to explore the geological past. Here, I review lipid geochemistry, biosynthesis, and compartmentalization; the varied uses of lipids as biomarkers; and the evolution of analytical techniques used to measure and characterize lipids. Advancements in high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry have revolutionized the lipidomic and metabolomic fields, both of which are quickly being integrated into marine meta-omic studies. Lipidomics allows us to analyze tens of thousands of features, providing an open analytical window and the ability to quantify unknown compounds that can be structurally elucidated later. However, lipidome annotation is not a trivial matter and represents one of the biggest challenges for oceanographers, owing in part to the lack of marine lipids in current in silico databases and data repositories. A case study reveals the gaps in our knowledge and open opportunities to answer fundamental questions about molecular-level control of chemical reactions and global-scale patterns in the lipidscape.", "generated_text": "Lipid biogeochemistry is a pivotal field that explores the roles and transformations of lipids in marine environments, offering insights into microbial oceanography and the broader biogeochemical cycles. Recent advancements in lipidomic techniques have revolutionized our understanding of lipid diversity and function, enabling detailed characterization of lipid profiles in complex environmental samples. This review highlights the integration of modern lipidomic approaches with meta-omics technologies, which has facilitated the identification of novel lipid biomarkers and elucidated the metabolic pathways of marine microorganisms. By combining high-resolution mass spectrometry with bioinformatics tools, researchers can now map lipid distributions and dynamics with unprecedented precision. These advancements have significant implications for understanding the ecological roles of lipids, their contribution to carbon cycling, and their potential as indicators of environmental change. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of lipid geochemistry in reconstructing past oceanic conditions and predicting future trends. This synthesis of lipidomics and biogeochemistry not only enhances our comprehension of marine ecosystems but also informs strategies for monitoring and mitigating anthropogenic impacts on ocean health.", "label": 0}
