{"grounding": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was the largest in US history, covering more than 1,000 km of shorelines and causing losses that exceeded $50 billion. While oil transformation processes are understood at the laboratory scale, the extent of the Deepwater Horizon spill made it challenging to integrate these processes in the field. This review tracks the Deepwater Horizon oil during its journey from the Mississippi Canyon block 252 (MC252) wellhead, first discussing the formation of the oil and gas plume and the ensuing oil droplet size distribution, then focusing on the behavior of the oil on the water surface with and without waves. It then reports on massive drifter experiments in the Gulf of Mexico and the impact of the Mississippi River on the oil transport. Finally, it concludes by addressing the formation of oil\u2013particle aggregates. Although physical processes lend themselves to numerical modeling, we attempted to elucidate them without using advanced modeling, as our goal is to enhance communication among scientists, engineers, and other entities interested in oil spills.", "generated_text": "The Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 resulted in one of the largest marine oil spills in history, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of oil transport mechanisms in marine environments. This study investigates the processes of oil spreading, dispersion, and droplet formation following the blowout, with a focus on the role of eddy diffusivity in these phenomena. Utilizing a combination of field data, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling, we analyze the dynamics of oil droplet formation and their subsequent dispersion in the water column. Our findings highlight the critical influence of eddy diffusivity on the horizontal and vertical transport of oil, affecting both the rate and extent of oil spreading. The results demonstrate that smaller oil droplets, formed under high-energy conditions, are more susceptible to dispersion by turbulent eddies, leading to a wider distribution of oil in the marine environment. This research provides valuable insights into the complex interactions governing oil transport in oceanic settings, offering guidance for future response strategies and environmental impact assessments following similar incidents.", "label": 1}
