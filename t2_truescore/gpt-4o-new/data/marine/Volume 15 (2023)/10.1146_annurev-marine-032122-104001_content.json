{"grounding": "Nitrogen is a major limiting element for biological productivity, and thus understanding past variations in nitrogen cycling is central to understanding past and future ocean biogeochemical cycling, global climate cycles, and biodiversity. Organic nitrogen encapsulated in fossil biominerals is generally protected from alteration, making it an important archive of the marine nitrogen cycle on seasonal to million-year timescales. The isotopic composition of fossil-bound nitrogen reflects variations in the large-scale nitrogen inventory, local sources and processing, and ecological and physiological traits of organisms. The ability to measure trace amounts of fossil-bound nitrogen has expanded with recent method developments. In this article, we review the foundations and ground truthing for three important fossil-bound proxy types: diatoms, foraminifera, and corals. We highlight their utility with examples of high-resolution evidence for anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen to the oceans, glacial\u2013interglacial-scale assessments of nitrogen inventory change, and evidence for enhanced CO2 drawdown in the high-latitude ocean. Future directions include expanded method development, characterization of ecological and physiological variation, and exploration of extended timescales to push reconstructions further back in Earth's history.", "generated_text": "The study of nitrogen isotopes in fossil-bound biominerals such as diatoms, foraminifera, and corals offers a unique window into past oceanic and atmospheric conditions. This research synthesizes recent advancements in the analysis of nitrogen isotopic compositions preserved in these organisms, providing insights into paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Diatoms, with their siliceous skeletons, and foraminifera, with their calcareous shells, serve as proxies for nutrient dynamics and ocean circulation patterns. Corals, through their aragonitic structures, offer records of nitrogen sources and cycling in reef environments. By examining the isotopic signatures of nitrogen in these biominerals, we can infer changes in primary productivity, nutrient utilization, and the nitrogen cycle over geological timescales. This study highlights the methodological advancements in isotope ratio mass spectrometry that have enhanced the precision and accuracy of nitrogen isotope measurements. The integration of these isotopic records with other paleoenvironmental proxies provides a comprehensive understanding of historical climate variability and its impact on marine ecosystems. These findings underscore the importance of nitrogen isotopes as a tool for reconstructing past environmental conditions and predicting future changes.", "label": 1}
