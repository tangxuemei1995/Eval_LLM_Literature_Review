{"grounding": "The modes of Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV), traditionally defined as statistical patterns of variance, reflect to first order the ocean's integration (i.e., reddening) of atmospheric forcing that arises from both a shift and a change in strength of the climatological (time-mean) atmospheric circulation. While these patterns concisely describe PDV, they do not distinguish among the key dynamical processes driving the evolution of PDV anomalies, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks with similar spatial structures that operate on different timescales. In this review, we synthesize past analysis using an empirical dynamical model constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies drawn from several reanalysis products, showing that the PDV modes of variance result from two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes: the North Pacific\u2013central Pacific (NP-CP) and Kuroshio\u2013Oyashio Extension (KOE) modes. Both eigenmodes highlight how two-way tropical\u2013extratropical teleconnection dynamics are the primary mechanisms energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale footprint of PDV. While the NP-CP mode captures interannual- to decadal-scale variability, the KOE mode is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV on decadal to multidecadal timescales, including contributions from the South Pacific.", "generated_text": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV) represents a critical component of the Earth's climate system, influencing global weather patterns and climate variability. This study synthesizes recent advances in understanding the modes and mechanisms driving PDV, with a focus on the Pacific Ocean's role in modulating climate variability over decadal timescales. The research highlights the complex interplay between oceanic and atmospheric processes, including ocean\u2013atmosphere teleconnections and their interactions with the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). By examining observational data and climate model simulations, the study identifies key modes of PDV, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), and explores their impacts on regional and global climate systems. The findings underscore the importance of PDV in modulating climate change signals and emphasize the need for improved predictive models to enhance our understanding of future climate scenarios. This research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of PDV, offering insights into its potential implications for climate policy and adaptation strategies in the context of ongoing global climate change.", "label": 1}
