{"grounding": "Oxidative stress is an important and pervasive physical stress encountered by all kingdoms of life, including bacteria. In this review, we briefly describe the nature of oxidative stress, highlight well-characterized protein-based sensors (transcription factors) of reactive oxygen species that serve as standards for molecular sensors in oxidative stress, and describe molecular studies that have explored the potential of direct RNA sensitivity to oxidative stress. Finally, we describe the gaps in knowledge of RNA sensors\u2014particularly regarding the chemical modification of RNA nucleobases. RNA sensors are poised to emerge as an essential layer of understanding and regulating dynamic biological pathways in oxidative stress responses in bacteria and, thus, also represent an important frontier of synthetic biology.", "generated_text": "RNAs play a crucial role in bacterial stress response by acting as sensors of oxidative stress, a condition characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses. This study explores the mechanisms by which RNA molecules detect and respond to oxidative stress, focusing on RNA oxidation and its impact on bacterial physiology. The research highlights the potential of RNA sensors in synthetic biology applications, where engineered RNA molecules could be used to monitor and mitigate oxidative damage. Understanding RNA's role in oxidative stress response not only provides insights into bacterial survival strategies but also opens avenues for developing novel biotechnological tools to enhance microbial resilience and productivity in industrial settings.", "label": 0}
