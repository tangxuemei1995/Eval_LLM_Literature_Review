{"grounding": "Are deep eutectic solvents (DESs) a promising alternative to conventional solvents? Perhaps, but their development is hindered by a plethora of misconceptions. These are carefully analyzed here, beginning with the very meaning of DESs, which has strayed far beyond its original scope of eutectic mixtures of Lewis or Br\u00f8nsted acids and bases. Instead, a definition that is grounded on thermodynamic principles and distinguishes between eutectic and deep eutectic is encouraged, and the types of precursors that can be used to prepare DESs are reviewed. Landmark works surrounding the sustainability, stability, toxicity, and biodegradability of these solvents are also discussed, revealing piling evidence that numerous DESs reported thus far, particularly those that are choline based, lack sufficient sustainability-related traits to be considered green solvents. Finally, emerging DES applications are reviewed, emphasizing their most remarkable feature: the ability to liquefy a solid compound with a target property, allowing its use as a liquid solvent.", "generated_text": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a promising class of green solvents, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional solvents due to their low toxicity, biodegradability, and ease of preparation. This review delves into the fundamental aspects of DESs, focusing on their formation through hydrogen bonding interactions and the resulting depression in melting temperatures, which facilitates the creation of eutectic mixtures. The solid\u2013liquid equilibrium of these mixtures is crucial for understanding their physicochemical properties and potential applications. By examining the role of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of DESs, this study highlights the versatility of these solvents in various fields, including catalysis, extraction, and material synthesis. The review also addresses common misconceptions and challenges associated with DESs, providing a comprehensive overview for researchers interested in harnessing their potential in green chemistry. Through this exploration, the study aims to demystify DESs and encourage their broader adoption in sustainable practices.", "label": 1}
