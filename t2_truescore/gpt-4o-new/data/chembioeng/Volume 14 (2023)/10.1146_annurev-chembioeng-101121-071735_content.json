{"grounding": "Electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable chemicals and fuels driven by renewable energy plays a crucial role in achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Understanding the structure\u2013activity relationship and the reaction mechanism is significant for tuning electrocatalyst selectivity. Therefore, characterizing catalyst dynamic evolution and reaction intermediates under reaction conditions is necessary but still challenging. We first summarize the most recent progress in mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous CO2/CO reduction using in situ/operando techniques, including surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies, X-ray- and electron-based techniques, and mass spectroscopy, along with discussing remaining limitations. We then offer insights and perspectives to accelerate the future development of in situ/operando techniques.", "generated_text": "The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a promising approach for sustainable fuel production, yet understanding the underlying mechanisms remains challenging. This study reviews advanced in situ/operando characterization techniques that provide mechanistic insights into CO2 electroreduction. Emphasis is placed on the role of catalysts and electrolytes in influencing reaction pathways and intermediates. Techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy are highlighted for their ability to monitor dynamic changes in catalyst structure and surface chemistry. These insights are crucial for optimizing catalyst design and improving the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 reduction processes.", "label": 1}
