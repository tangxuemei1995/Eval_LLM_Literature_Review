{"grounding": "Scientific and engineering capabilities in hydrocarbon supply chains developed over decades in international oil and gas companies (IOCs) uniquely position these companies to drive rapid scale-up and transition to a net-zero emission economy. Flexible large-scale production of energy carriers such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and other synthetic fuels produced with low- or zero-emission renewable power, nuclear energy, or hydrogen derived from natural gas with carbon capture and storage will enable long-distance transport and permanent storage options for clean energy. Use of energy carriers can overcome the inherent constraints of a fully electrified energy system by providing the energy and power densities, as well as transport and storage capacity, required to achieve energy supply and security in a net-zero emission economy, and over time allow optimization to the lowest cost for a consumer anywhere on the globe.", "generated_text": "The transition to a net-zero emission energy system necessitates a pivotal role for international oil companies (IOCs) in reshaping the global energy landscape. This study explores the multifaceted contributions of IOCs in advancing energy carriers, transport, and storage technologies, emphasizing their potential to enhance energy density and efficiency. By leveraging their extensive infrastructure and expertise, IOCs can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources and the development of low-carbon technologies. The research highlights strategic investments and innovations by IOCs in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), hydrogen production, and bioenergy, which are critical for achieving net-zero targets. Furthermore, the study examines the challenges and opportunities faced by IOCs in aligning their business models with sustainable practices, underscoring the importance of policy frameworks and stakeholder collaboration in driving the energy transition.", "label": 1}
