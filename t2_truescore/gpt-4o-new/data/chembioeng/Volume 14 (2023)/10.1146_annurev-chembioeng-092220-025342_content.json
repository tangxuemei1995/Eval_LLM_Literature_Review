{"grounding": "Thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures are important in many fields of science and engineering. However, experimental data are scarce in this field, so prediction methods are vital. Different types of physical prediction methods are available, ranging from molecular models over equations of state to models of excess properties. These well-established methods are currently being complemented by new methods from the field of machine learning (ML). This review focuses on the rapidly developing interface between these two approaches and gives a structured overview of how physical modeling and ML can be combined to yield hybrid models. We illustrate the different options with examples from recent research and give an outlook on future developments.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of machine learning techniques with traditional physical models to enhance the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures. By leveraging the predictive power of machine learning, we aim to address the limitations of conventional models in capturing complex interactions within fluid mixtures. The proposed hybrid model combines data-driven insights with established thermodynamic principles, offering improved accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate the model's performance on various fluid systems, demonstrating its capability to predict thermodynamic properties with higher precision than standalone approaches. This research highlights the potential of hybrid models in advancing the understanding and prediction of fluid mixture behaviors, paving the way for more robust and versatile thermodynamic applications.", "label": 0}
