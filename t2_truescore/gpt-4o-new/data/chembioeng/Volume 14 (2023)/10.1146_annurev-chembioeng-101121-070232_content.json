{"grounding": "From the first clinical trial by Dr. W.F. Anderson to the most recent US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics, 2017) and Zolgensma (Novartis, 2019), gene therapy has revamped thinking and practice around cancer treatment and improved survival rates for adult and pediatric patients with genetic diseases. A major challenge to advancing gene therapies for a broader array of applications lies in safely delivering nucleic acids to their intended sites of action. Peptides offer unique potential to improve nucleic acid delivery based on their versatile and tunable interactions with biomolecules and cells. Cell-penetrating peptides and intracellular targeting peptides have received particular focus due to their promise for improving the delivery of gene therapies into cells. We highlight key examples of peptide-assisted, targeted gene delivery to cancer-specific signatures involved in tumor growth and subcellular organelle\u2013targeting peptides, as well as emerging strategies to enhance peptide stability and bioavailability that will support long-term implementation.", "generated_text": "Peptide-based vectors have emerged as a promising biomolecular engineering strategy for gene delivery, offering a versatile platform for the transport of nucleic acids such as silencing RNA (siRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and other oligonucleotides. These vectors leverage intracellular targeting peptides to enhance cellular uptake and ensure precise delivery to target sites, addressing key challenges in gene therapy. The ability of these peptides to facilitate endosomal escape is critical for the successful release of genetic material into the cytoplasm, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of peptide-based vectors in preclinical models, with several candidates advancing to clinical trials. This review highlights the design principles, functional mechanisms, and therapeutic applications of peptide-based vectors, emphasizing their role in overcoming biological barriers to gene delivery. The integration of these vectors into gene therapy protocols holds significant promise for the treatment of a wide range of genetic disorders, paving the way for innovative therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
