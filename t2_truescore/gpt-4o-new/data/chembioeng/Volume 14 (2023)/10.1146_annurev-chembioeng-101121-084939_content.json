{"grounding": "Active colloids use energy input at the particle level to propel persistent motion and direct dynamic assemblies. We consider three types of colloids animated by chemical reactions, time-varying magnetic fields, and electric currents. For each type, we review the basic propulsion mechanisms at the particle level and discuss their consequences for collective behaviors in particle ensembles. These microscopic systems provide useful experimental models of nonequilibrium many-body physics in which dissipative currents break time-reversal symmetry. Freed from the constraints of thermodynamic equilibrium, active colloids assemble to form materials that move, reconfigure, heal, and adapt. Colloidal machines based on engineered particles and their assemblies provide a basis for mobile robots with increasing levels of autonomy. This review provides a conceptual framework for understanding and applying active colloids to create material systems that mimic the functions of living matter. We highlight opportunities for chemical engineers to contribute to this growing field.", "generated_text": "Active colloids, as a subset of active matter, have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring nonequilibrium phenomena, offering insights into both fundamental physics and practical applications. These self-propelled particles exhibit complex behaviors that arise from their intrinsic activity, leading to novel collective dynamics and pattern formation. As models, active colloids provide a controllable system to study the principles governing nonequilibrium systems, shedding light on processes such as energy dissipation and entropy production. As materials, they enable the design of responsive and adaptive structures with potential applications in drug delivery, environmental sensing, and smart materials. Furthermore, as machines, active colloids can be engineered to perform specific tasks, harnessing their autonomous motion for micro- and nanoscale operations. This review highlights recent advances in the understanding and utilization of active colloids, emphasizing their role as a bridge between theoretical models and real-world applications.", "label": 1}
