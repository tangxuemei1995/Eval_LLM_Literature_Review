{"grounding": "There is growing interest in identifying antibodies that protect against infectious diseases, especially for high-risk individuals and pathogens for which no vaccine is yet available. However, pathogens that manifest as opportunistic or latent infections express complex arrays of virulence-associated proteins and are adept at avoiding immune responses. Some pathogens have developed strategies to selectively destroy antibodies, whereas others create decoy epitopes that trick the host immune system into generating antibodies that are at best nonprotective and at worst enhance pathogenesis. Antibody engineering strategies can thwart these efforts by accessing conserved neutralizing epitopes, generating Fc domains that resist capture or degradation and even accessing pathogens hidden inside cells. Design of pathogen-resistant antibodies can enhance protection and guide development of vaccine immunogens against these complex pathogens. Here, we discuss general strategies for design of antibodies resistant to specific pathogen defense mechanisms.", "generated_text": "The rapid evolution of pathogens poses significant challenges to traditional vaccine development and passive immunization strategies. Antibody engineering emerges as a promising approach to outsmart these adaptive threats. This review explores recent advancements in antibody engineering, focusing on Fc engineering, bispecific antibodies, and antibody\u2013drug conjugates. Fc engineering enhances antibody efficacy by improving immune system engagement and extending half-life, while bispecific antibodies offer targeted pathogen neutralization by simultaneously binding to two distinct antigens. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates provide a dual mechanism of action, combining specific pathogen targeting with potent therapeutic payloads. These innovations address immune evasion tactics employed by pathogens, offering a versatile toolkit for combating infectious diseases. By integrating these engineered antibodies into existing immunization frameworks, we can enhance the breadth and durability of immune protection, paving the way for more effective and adaptable therapeutic interventions against evolving pathogens.", "label": 1}
