{"grounding": "Related groups of microbes are widely distributed across Earth's habitats, implying numerous dispersal and adaptation events over evolutionary time. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics and mechanisms of these habitat transitions, particularly for populations that reside in animal microbiomes. Here, we review the literature concerning habitat transitions among a variety of bacterial and archaeal lineages, considering the frequency of migration events, potential environmental barriers, and mechanisms of adaptation to new physicochemical conditions, including the modification of protein inventories and other genomic characteristics. Cells dependent on microbial hosts, particularly bacteria from the Candidate Phyla Radiation, have undergone repeated habitat transitions from environmental sources into animal microbiomes. We compare their trajectories to those of both free-living cells\u2014including the Melainabacteria, Elusimicrobia, and methanogenic archaea\u2014and cellular endosymbionts and bacteriophages, which have made similar transitions. We conclude by highlighting major related topics that may be worthy of future study.", "generated_text": "The study of habitat transition in bacteria and archaea offers critical insights into microbial evolution, particularly in the context of dispersal and adaptation. This research explores the evolutionary mechanisms that enable these microorganisms to transition between diverse environments, focusing on the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria and their role in the human microbiome. By examining genomic adaptations and ecological strategies, we aim to elucidate how these microorganisms navigate and thrive in varied habitats. The findings highlight the significance of horizontal gene transfer and metabolic versatility in facilitating habitat transitions. Furthermore, the study underscores the impact of environmental microbiology on shaping microbial communities, with implications for understanding human microbiome evolution. This research contributes to a broader comprehension of microbial diversity and the evolutionary processes that underpin the adaptability and resilience of bacteria and archaea across different ecological niches.", "label": 0}
