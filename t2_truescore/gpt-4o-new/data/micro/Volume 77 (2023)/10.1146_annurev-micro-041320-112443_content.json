{"grounding": "Fungal species have dynamic genomes and often exhibit genomic plasticity in response to stress. This genome plasticity often comes with phenotypic consequences that affect fitness and resistance to stress. Fungal pathogens exhibit genome plasticity in both clinical and agricultural settings and often during adaptation to antifungal drugs, posing significant challenges to human health. Therefore, it is important to understand the rates, mechanisms, and impact of large genomic changes. This review addresses the prevalence of polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation across diverse fungal species, with special attention to prominent fungal pathogens and model species. We also explore the relationship between environmental stress and rates of genomic changes and highlight the mechanisms underlying genotypic and phenotypic changes. A comprehensive understanding of these dynamic fungal genomes is needed to identify novel solutions for the increase in antifungal drug resistance.", "generated_text": "Fungal genomes exhibit remarkable plasticity, enabling rapid adaptation to environmental stressors through mechanisms such as polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation (CNV). This study explores the dynamic nature of fungal genomes, highlighting how these genetic alterations contribute to survival and adaptation under stress conditions. Polyploidy, the presence of multiple sets of chromosomes, can enhance genetic diversity and resilience, while aneuploidy, the gain or loss of individual chromosomes, allows for flexible gene dosage adjustments. CNVs further contribute to genomic adaptability by altering the number of copies of specific genes, thereby influencing phenotypic traits. Together, these genomic strategies facilitate rapid evolutionary responses, providing fungi with a competitive edge in fluctuating environments. Understanding these processes not only sheds light on fungal biology but also has implications for managing fungal pathogens and exploiting fungi in biotechnology.", "label": 1}
