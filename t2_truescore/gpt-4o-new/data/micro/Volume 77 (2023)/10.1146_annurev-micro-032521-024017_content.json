{"grounding": "The immune system of multicellular organisms protects them from harmful microbes. To establish an infection in the face of host immune responses, pathogens must evolve specific strategies to target immune defense mechanisms. One such defense is the formation of intracellular protein complexes, termed inflammasomes, that are triggered by the detection of microbial components and the disruption of homeostatic processes that occur during bacterial infection. Formation of active inflammasomes initiates programmed cell death pathways via activation of inflammatory caspases and cleavage of target proteins. Inflammasome-activated cell death pathways such as pyroptosis lead to proinflammatory responses that protect the host. Bacterial infection has the capacity to influence inflammasomes in two distinct ways: activation and perturbation. In this review, we discuss how bacterial activities influence inflammasomes, and we discuss the consequences of inflammasome activation or evasion for both the host and pathogen.", "generated_text": "Inflammasomes are pivotal components of the innate immune system, orchestrating responses to pathogenic bacteria through the activation of caspase-1 and caspase-8, leading to pyroptosis via gasdermin-mediated pore formation. This study explores the dual role of bacterial influencers in modulating inflammasome signaling, either collaborating with or canceling the host's immune response. We examine the interactions between bacterial components and Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which serve as sensors for inflammasome assembly. The research highlights how specific bacterial species can either potentiate or inhibit inflammasome activation, affecting the downstream signaling pathways and the resultant inflammatory response. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms of these interactions, we aim to provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting inflammasome-related diseases. Our findings underscore the complexity of host-pathogen interactions and the potential for manipulating bacterial influences to modulate immune responses.", "label": 1}
