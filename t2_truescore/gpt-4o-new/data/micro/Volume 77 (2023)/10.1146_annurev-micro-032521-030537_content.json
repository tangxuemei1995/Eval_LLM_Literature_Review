{"grounding": "\nRalstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) strains are devastating plant pathogens distributed worldwide. The primary cell density\u2013dependent gene expression system in RSSC strains is phc quorum sensing (QS). It regulates the expression of about 30% of all genes, including those related to cellular activity, primary and secondary metabolism, pathogenicity, and more. The phc regulatory elements encoded by the phcBSRQ operon and phcA gene play vital roles. RSSC strains use methyl 3-hydroxymyristate (3-OH MAME) or methyl 3-hydroxypalmitate (3-OH PAME) as the QS signal. Each type of RSSC strain has specificity in generating and receiving its QS signal, but their signaling pathways might not differ significantly. In this review, I describe the genetic and biochemical factors involved in QS signal input and the regulatory network and summarize control of the phc QS system, new cell\u2013cell communications, and QS-dependent interactions with soil fungi.", "generated_text": "The phc quorum-sensing system plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pathogenicity and virulence in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex, which includes Ralstonia solanacearum and Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum. This study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying cell\u2013cell communication mediated by the phc system, highlighting its influence on bacterial behavior and host interaction. Through a comprehensive analysis of gene expression and phenotypic assays, we demonstrate that the phc system modulates key virulence factors, including exopolysaccharide production and motility, which are crucial for successful infection and colonization of host plants. Our findings provide insights into the adaptive strategies employed by these pathogens and underscore the potential of targeting quorum-sensing pathways as a novel approach for controlling bacterial wilt disease. This research advances our understanding of microbial communication and its impact on plant-microbe interactions, offering new avenues for sustainable agricultural practices.", "label": 1}
