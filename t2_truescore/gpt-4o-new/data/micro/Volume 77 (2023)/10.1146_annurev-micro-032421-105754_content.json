{"grounding": "The gut microbiome is a dense and metabolically active consortium of microorganisms and viruses located in the lower gastrointestinal tract of the human body. Bacteria and their viruses (phages) are the most abundant members of the gut microbiome. Investigating their biology and the interplay between the two is important if we are to understand their roles in human health and disease. In this review, we summarize recent advances in resolving the taxonomic structure and ecological functions of the complex community of phages in the human gut\u2014the gut phageome. We discuss how age, diet, and geography can all have a significant impact on phageome composition. We note that alterations to the gut phageome have been observed in several diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer, and we evaluate whether these phageome changes can directly or indirectly contribute to disease etiology and pathogenesis. We also highlight how lack of standardization in studying the gut phageome has contributed to variation in reported results.", "generated_text": "The human gut phageome, a critical component of the gut microbiome, plays a significant role in maintaining health and influencing disease states. This study explores the factors contributing to the variation in the human gut phageome, focusing on bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria. Key factors include diet, age, genetics, antibiotic use, and environmental exposures, all of which can alter the composition and diversity of the gut virome. The interaction between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts is crucial for modulating microbial communities, impacting gut health and disease susceptibility. Variations in the phageome can influence the balance of beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, potentially affecting conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and infections. Understanding these variations provides insights into the dynamic nature of the gut ecosystem and its implications for personalized medicine. This research underscores the importance of integrating phageome analysis into broader microbiome studies to develop targeted therapeutic strategies for maintaining gut health and preventing disease.", "label": 1}
