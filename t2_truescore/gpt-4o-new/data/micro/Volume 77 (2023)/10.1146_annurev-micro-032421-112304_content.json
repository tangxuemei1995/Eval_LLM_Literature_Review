{"grounding": "Genetic manipulation is necessary to interrogate the functions of microbes in their environments, such as the human gut microbiome. Yet, the vast majority of human gut microbiome species are not genetically tractable. Here, we review the hurdles to seizing genetic control of more species. We address the barriers preventing the application of genetic techniques to gut microbes and report on genetic systems currently under development. While methods aimed at genetically transforming many species simultaneously in situ show promise, they are unable to overcome many of the same challenges that exist for individual microbes. Unless a major conceptual breakthrough emerges, the genetic tractability of the microbiome will remain an arduous task. Increasing the list of genetically tractable organisms from the human gut remains one of the highest priorities for microbiome research and will provide the foundation for microbiome engineering.", "generated_text": "The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, yet its complexity poses challenges for genetic manipulation. This study explores advancements in microbiome engineering by expanding the repertoire of genetically tractable gut microbiota. We review recent developments in genetic tools and techniques that facilitate the manipulation of diverse microbial species within the gut ecosystem. Emphasis is placed on the identification and characterization of key microbial members amenable to genetic engineering, alongside novel methodologies for gene editing and synthetic biology applications. By enhancing our ability to genetically modify these organisms, we aim to unlock new therapeutic potentials and improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions. This work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in microbiome research, paving the way for innovative strategies in precision medicine and personalized healthcare.", "label": 1}
