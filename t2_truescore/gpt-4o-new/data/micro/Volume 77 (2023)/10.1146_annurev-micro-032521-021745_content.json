{"grounding": "Fungal-mediated disease progression and antifungal drug efficacy are significantly impacted by the dynamic infection microenvironment. At the site of infection, oxygen often becomes limiting and induces a hypoxia response in both the fungal pathogen and host cells. The fungal hypoxia response impacts several important aspects of fungal biology that contribute to pathogenesis, virulence, antifungal drug susceptibility, and ultimately infection outcomes. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the hypoxia response in the most common human fungal pathogens, discuss potential therapeutic opportunities, and highlight important areas for future research.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in understanding the hypoxia response of human fungal pathogens have unveiled critical insights into disease progression and virulence. Hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, is a common feature in host environments that pathogens encounter during infection. Fungal adaptation to hypoxia is crucial for survival and virulence, influencing disease outcomes. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms fungi employ to sense and respond to hypoxic conditions, and how these pathways contribute to pathogenicity. Understanding these processes opens new avenues for developing targeted antifungal therapies, potentially improving treatment efficacy and patient outcomes in fungal infections.", "label": 1}
