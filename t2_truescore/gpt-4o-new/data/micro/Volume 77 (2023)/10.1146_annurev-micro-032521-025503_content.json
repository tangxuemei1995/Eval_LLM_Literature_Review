{"grounding": "Two of the most fascinating bacterial nanomachines\u2014the broadly disseminated rotary flagellum at the heart of cellular motility and the eukaryotic cell\u2013puncturing injectisome essential to specific pathogenic species\u2014utilize at their core a conserved export machinery called the type III secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS not only secretes the components that self-assemble into their extracellular appendages but also, in the case of the injectisome, subsequently directly translocates modulating effector proteins from the bacterial cell into the infected host. The injectisome is thought to have evolved from the flagellum as a minimal secretory system lacking motility, with the subsequent acquisition of additional components tailored to its specialized role in manipulating eukaryotic hosts for pathogenic advantage. Both nanomachines have long been the focus of intense interest, but advances in structural and functional understanding have taken a significant step forward since 2015, facilitated by the revolutionary advances in cryo-electron microscopy technologies. With several seminal structures of each nanomachine now captured, we review here the molecular similarities and differences that underlie their diverse functions.", "generated_text": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are pivotal for the pathogenicity and motility of many Gram-negative bacteria, functioning as molecular syringes to translocate effector proteins into host cells. This study provides comprehensive structural insights into the T3SS of the bacterial flagellum and injectisome, utilizing advanced cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques. By resolving high-resolution structures, we elucidate the intricate architecture and dynamic assembly of these complex nanomachines. Our findings reveal conserved structural motifs and unique adaptations that facilitate their dual roles in motility and virulence. The comparative analysis highlights the evolutionary divergence between the flagellar and injectisome T3SS, offering a deeper understanding of their functional specialization. These insights not only enhance our knowledge of bacterial pathogenesis and motility but also pave the way for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies targeting these essential bacterial systems. This research underscores the potential of cryo-EM and cryo-ET in unraveling the complexities of bacterial secretion systems at the molecular level.", "label": 0}
