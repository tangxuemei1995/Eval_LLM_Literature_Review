{"grounding": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are present in all gram-negative bacteria and mediate energy-dependent uptake of molecules that are too scarce or large to be taken up efficiently by outer membrane (OM) diffusion channels. This process requires energy that is derived from the proton motive force and delivered to TBDTs by the TonB-ExbBD motor complex in the inner membrane. Together with the need to preserve the OM permeability barrier, this has led to an extremely complex and fascinating transport mechanism for which the fundamentals, despite decades of research, are still unclear. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the transport mechanism of TBDTs, their potential role in the delivery of novel antibiotics, and the important contributions made by TBDT-associated (lipo)proteins.", "generated_text": "TonB-dependent transport systems are crucial for the active transport of nutrients across the bacterial outer membrane, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria. These systems utilize energy from the proton motive force to facilitate the uptake of essential molecules, such as iron-siderophore complexes, through \u03b2 barrel proteins. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of exploiting these pathways for the delivery of Trojan horse antibiotics, offering a novel approach to combat antibiotic resistance. In Bacteroidetes, a diverse phylum of bacteria, TonB-dependent transporters play a significant role in nutrient acquisition and pathogenicity. Understanding the structural and functional dynamics of these transporters could lead to innovative strategies for targeting bacterial infections, emphasizing the importance of continued research in this area.", "label": 1}
