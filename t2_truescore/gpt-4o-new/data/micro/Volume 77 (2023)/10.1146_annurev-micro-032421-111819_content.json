{"grounding": "Amino acids are indispensable substrates for protein synthesis in all organisms and incorporated into diverse aspects of metabolic physiology and signaling. However, animals lack the ability to synthesize several of them and must acquire these essential amino acids from their diet or perhaps their associated microbial communities. The essential amino acids therefore occupy a unique position in the health of animals and their relationships with microbes. Here we review recent work connecting microbial production and metabolism of essential amino acids to host biology, and the reciprocal impacts of host metabolism of essential amino acids on their associated microbes. We focus on the roles of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) and tryptophan on host-microbe communication in the intestine of humans and other vertebrates. We then conclude by highlighting research questions surrounding the less-understood aspects of microbial essential amino acid synthesis in animal hosts.", "generated_text": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in host health, with essential amino acid metabolites acting as key chemical mediators in host-microbe interactions. This study explores the metabolic pathways of valine, isoleucine, leucine, and tryptophan within the gut environment, highlighting their influence on microbial composition and host physiology. Tryptophan metabolism, in particular, is linked to serotonin production, impacting gut-brain communication and overall well-being. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) valine, isoleucine, and leucine are shown to modulate immune responses and energy homeostasis, further illustrating the complex interplay between diet, microbial activity, and host health. By elucidating these metabolic interactions, the research underscores the potential for targeted dietary interventions to modulate the microbiome and improve health outcomes. This study advances our understanding of the biochemical dialogue between host and microbiota, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies in managing gut-related disorders.", "label": 1}
