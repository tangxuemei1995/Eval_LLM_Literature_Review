{"grounding": "\nPlasmodium falciparum, the human malaria parasite, infects two hosts and various cell types, inducing distinct morphological and physiological changes in the parasite in response to different environmental conditions. These variations required the parasite to adapt and develop elaborate molecular mechanisms to ensure its spread and transmission. Recent findings have significantly improved our understanding of the regulation of gene expression in P. falciparum. Here, we provide an up-to-date overview of technologies used to highlight the transcriptomic adjustments occurring in the parasite throughout its life cycle. We also emphasize the complementary and complex epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in malaria parasites. This review concludes with an outlook on the chromatin architecture, the remodeling systems, and how this 3D genome organization is critical in various biological processes.", "generated_text": "Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, remains a significant global health challenge. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have unveiled the intricate epigenetic landscape and chromatin architecture of these parasites. This study explores the role of epigenetic regulation, focusing on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their impact on chromatin remodeling. We highlight how lncRNAs contribute to the dynamic regulation of gene expression, facilitating the parasite's adaptation to host environments. By dissecting the chromatin architecture at a single-cell level, we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying Plasmodium's developmental stages and pathogenicity. Understanding these epigenetic processes opens new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions, potentially disrupting the parasite's life cycle and offering novel strategies for malaria control and eradication.", "label": 0}
