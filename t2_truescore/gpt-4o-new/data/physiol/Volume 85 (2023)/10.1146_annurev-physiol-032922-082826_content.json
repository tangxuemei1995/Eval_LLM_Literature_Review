{"grounding": "The human lung cellular portfolio, traditionally characterized by cellular morphology and individual markers, is highly diverse, with over 40 cell types and a complex branching structure highly adapted for agile airflow and gas exchange. While constant during adulthood, lung cellular content changes in response to exposure, injury, and infection. Some changes are temporary, but others are persistent, leading to structural changes and progressive lung disease. The recent advance of single-cell profiling technologies allows an unprecedented level of detail and scale to cellular measurements, leading to the rise of comprehensive cell atlas styles of reporting. In this review, we chronical the rise of cell atlases and explore their contributions to human lung biology in health and disease.", "generated_text": "Lung cell atlases, constructed using single-cell RNA sequencing, offer unprecedented insights into the cellular landscape of the respiratory system in both health and disease. This research explores the application of these atlases in understanding complex pulmonary conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). By delineating cell-type-specific gene expression profiles, these atlases facilitate the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The study highlights the potential of single-cell technologies to unravel the heterogeneity of lung diseases, providing a comprehensive framework for personalized medicine approaches. This work underscores the transformative impact of lung cell atlases in advancing our understanding of respiratory pathophysiology and improving clinical outcomes.", "label": 1}
