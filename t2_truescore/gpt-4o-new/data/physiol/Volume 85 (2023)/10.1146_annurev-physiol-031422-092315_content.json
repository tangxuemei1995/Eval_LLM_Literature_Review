{"grounding": "Coughing is a dynamic physiological process resulting from input of vagal sensory neurons innervating the airways and perceived airway irritation. Although cough serves to protect and clear the airways, it can also be exploited by respiratory pathogens to facilitate disease transmission. Microbial components or infection-induced inflammatory mediators can directly interact with sensory nerve receptors to induce a cough response. Analysis of cough-generated aerosols and transmission studies have further demonstrated how infectious disease is spread through coughing. This review summarizes the neurophysiology of cough, cough induction by respiratory pathogens and inflammation, and cough-mediated disease transmission.", "generated_text": "Cough is a prevalent symptom of respiratory tract infections, serving as a mechanism for disease transmission. This study explores the infectious and inflammatory pathways that contribute to cough, focusing on the role of sensory neurons in the respiratory system. We examine how pathogens trigger inflammatory responses, leading to the activation of sensory neurons and subsequent cough reflex. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing targeted therapies to mitigate cough and reduce transmission of infectious diseases. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between infection, inflammation, and neural pathways in the pathophysiology of cough.", "label": 1}
