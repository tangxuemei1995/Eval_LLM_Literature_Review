{"grounding": "The endothelium is one of the largest organ systems in the body, and data continue to emerge regarding the importance of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction in vascular aging and a range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Over the last two decades and as a process intimately related to EC dysfunction, an increasing number of studies have also implicated endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) as a potentially disease-causal pathobiologic process that is involved in a multitude of differing CVDs. However, EndMT is also involved in physiologic processes (e.g., cardiac development), and transient EndMT may contribute to vascular regeneration in certain contexts. Given that EndMT involves a major alteration in the EC-specific molecular program, and that it potentially contributes to CVD pathobiology, the clinical translation opportunities are significant, but further molecular and translational research is needed to see these opportunities realized.\n", "generated_text": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a complex biological process where endothelial cells lose their specific markers and acquire mesenchymal characteristics. This transition plays a crucial role in embryonic development, tissue repair, and fibrosis. In the context of cardiovascular health, EndMT is implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including atherosclerosis, cardiac fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate its detrimental effects in disease states. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of signaling pathways such as TGF-\u03b2, Wnt, and Notch in regulating EndMT. Moreover, the identification of key transcription factors and epigenetic modifications offers new insights into the modulation of this process. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on EndMT, emphasizing its dual role in health and disease, and to explore potential therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
