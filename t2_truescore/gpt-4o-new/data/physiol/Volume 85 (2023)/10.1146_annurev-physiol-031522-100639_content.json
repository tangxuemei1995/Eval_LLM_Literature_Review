{"grounding": "Numerous trafficking and quality control pathways evolved to handle the diversity of proteins made by eukaryotic cells. However, at every step along the biosynthetic pathway, there is the potential for quality control system failure. This review focuses on the mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis. Inspired by diseases caused by misfolded proteins in the kidney (mucin 1 and uromodulin), we outline the general principles of protein biosynthesis, delineate the recognition and degradation pathways targeting misfolded proteins, and discuss the role of cargo receptors in protein trafficking and lipid homeostasis. We also discuss technical approaches including live-cell fluorescent microscopy, chemical screens to elucidate trafficking mechanisms, multiplexed single-cell CRISPR screening platforms to systematically delineate mechanisms of proteostasis, and the advancement of novel tools to degrade secretory and membrane-associated proteins. By focusing on components of trafficking that go awry, we highlight ongoing efforts to understand fundamental mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis and implications for the treatment of human proteinopathies.", "generated_text": "Protein trafficking and quality control are critical processes in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the kidney, where precise protein sorting and degradation are essential for function. This review explores the intricate mechanisms governing protein trafficking, focusing on the roles of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and vesicular transport systems. We highlight the significance of the transmembrane emp24 domain-containing (TMED) family in cargo selection and transport within the secretory pathway. The study further delves into the proteome dynamics involved in vesicle formation and fusion, emphasizing the importance of these processes in kidney physiology and pathology. Disruptions in these pathways can lead to kidney diseases, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of protein trafficking and quality control. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of these mechanisms beyond the kidney, including their roles in lysosomal function and systemic protein homeostasis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for related disorders.", "label": 0}
