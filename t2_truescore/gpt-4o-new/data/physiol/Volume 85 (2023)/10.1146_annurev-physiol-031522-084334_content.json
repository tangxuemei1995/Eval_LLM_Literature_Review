{"grounding": "Polycystin subunits can form hetero- and homotetrameric ion channels in the membranes of various compartments of the cell. Homotetrameric polycystin channels are voltage- and calcium-modulated, whereas heterotetrameric versions are proposed to be ligand- or autoproteolytically regulated. Their importance is underscored by variants associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and by vital roles in fertilization and embryonic development. The diversity in polycystin assembly and subcellular distribution allows for a multitude of sensory functions by this class of channels. In this review, we highlight their recent structural and functional characterization, which has provided a molecular blueprint to investigate the conformational changes required for channel opening in response to unique stimuli. We consider each polycystin channel type individually, discussing how they contribute to sensory cell biology, as well as their impact on the physiology of various tissues.", "generated_text": "Polycystin channel complexes, primarily composed of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a prevalent genetic disorder characterized by the formation of renal cysts. These complexes are integral to the function of primary cilia, acting as mechanosensors and regulators of calcium signaling. Recent studies have elucidated the gating mechanisms of polycystin channels, revealing their structural and functional similarities to transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing targeted therapies for ADPKD and related ciliopathies. This review synthesizes current insights into the molecular architecture and biophysical properties of polycystin channel complexes, highlighting their significance in cellular signaling and potential as therapeutic targets in ciliopathies.", "label": 1}
