{"grounding": "Pericytes, attached to the surface of capillaries, play an important role in regulating local blood flow. Using optogenetic tools and genetically encoded reporters in conjunction with confocal and multiphoton imaging techniques, the 3D structure, anatomical organization, and physiology of pericytes have recently been the subject of detailed examination. This work has revealed novel functions of pericytes and morphological features such as tunneling nanotubes in brain and tunneling microtubes in heart. Here, we discuss the state of our current understanding of the roles of pericytes in blood flow control in brain and heart, where functions may differ due to the distinct spatiotemporal metabolic requirements of these tissues. We also outline the novel concept of electro-metabolic signaling, a universal mechanistic framework that links tissue metabolic state with blood flow regulation by pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, with capillary KATP and Kir2.1 channels as primary sensors. Finally, we present major unresolved questions and outline how they can be addressed.", "generated_text": "Pericytes, integral components of the microvascular system, play a crucial role in regulating blood flow in both the brain and heart. This study explores the mechanisms by which pericytes influence neurovascular coupling and cardiac function, focusing on their electro-metabolic signaling capabilities. Pericytes modulate blood flow through ion channels, particularly those involving calcium and potassium, which are essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. In the brain, pericytes contribute to neurovascular coupling by responding to neuronal activity and adjusting capillary diameter, thereby optimizing oxygen and nutrient delivery. Similarly, in the heart, pericytes are involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow, ensuring efficient cardiac metabolism. This research highlights the importance of pericytes in maintaining the delicate balance of blood supply and metabolic demand in these vital organs. Understanding the signaling pathways and ion channel dynamics in pericytes could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for conditions such as stroke and heart disease, where blood flow regulation is compromised.", "label": 1}
