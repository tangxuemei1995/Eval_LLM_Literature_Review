{"grounding": "Membrane contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM), or ER-PM junctions, are found in all eukaryotic cells. In excitable cells they play unique roles in organizing diverse forms of Ca2+ signaling as triggered by membrane depolarization. ER-PM junctions underlie crucial physiological processes such as excitation-contraction coupling, smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, and various forms of activity-dependent signaling and plasticity in neurons. In many cases the structure and molecular composition of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells comprise important regulatory feedback loops linking depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling at these sites to the regulation of membrane potential. Here, we describe recent findings on physiological roles and molecular composition of native ER-PM junctions in excitable cells. We focus on recent studies that provide new insights into canonical forms of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling occurring at junctional triads and dyads of striated muscle, as well as the diversity of ER-PM junctions in these cells and in smooth muscle and neurons.", "generated_text": "Endoplasmic reticulum\u2013plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions are increasingly recognized as critical sites for Ca2+ signaling, particularly in excitable cells such as neurons and muscle tissues. These specialized membrane contact sites facilitate the rapid and localized exchange of ions and second messengers, crucial for cellular responses to depolarization. This study explores the role of ER-PM junctions in modulating Ca2+ dynamics across skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, as well as neurons. We highlight the involvement of specific ion channels and transporters that are strategically positioned at these junctions, enabling efficient Ca2+ influx and release. Our findings suggest that the spatial organization of these junctions is essential for the precise regulation of Ca2+ signaling, which is vital for muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and other cellular functions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions provides insights into the pathophysiology of diseases associated with dysregulated Ca2+ signaling and offers potential therapeutic targets for intervention.", "label": 1}
