{"grounding": "Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are components of plasma membranes and an efficient fuel source and also serve as metabolic regulators through FA signaling mediated by membrane FA receptors. Impaired tissue FA uptake has been linked to major complications of obesity, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Fatty acid interactions with a membrane receptor and the initiation of signaling can modify pathways related to nutrient uptake and processing, cell proliferation or differentiation, and secretion of bioactive factors. Here, we review the major membrane receptors involved in FA uptake and FA signaling. We focus on two types of membrane receptors for long-chain FAs: CD36 and the G protein\u2013coupled FA receptors FFAR1 and FFAR4. We describe key signaling pathways and metabolic outcomes for CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 and highlight the parallels that provide insight into FA regulation of cell function.", "generated_text": "Fatty acids play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and signaling, influencing various physiological processes. This review explores the mechanisms of fatty acid transport and signaling, focusing on key proteins such as CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4. CD36 facilitates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids, while FFAR1 and FFAR4 are G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate fatty acid signaling, impacting insulin secretion and anti-inflammatory responses. The role of caveolin in organizing lipid rafts and modulating receptor activity is also examined. Furthermore, the review discusses the implications of fatty acid signaling in \u03b2-oxidation and tissue repair, highlighting its potential in therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders and injury recovery. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the complex interplay between fatty acid metabolism and cellular function, offering avenues for novel interventions in metabolic and inflammatory diseases.", "label": 1}
