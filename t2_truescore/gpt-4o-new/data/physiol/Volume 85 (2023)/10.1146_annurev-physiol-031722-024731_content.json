{"grounding": "Neural mechanisms of perceptual decision making have been extensively studied in experimental settings that mimic stable environments with repeating stimuli, fixed rules, and payoffs. In contrast, we live in an ever-changing environment and have varying goals and behavioral demands. To accommodate variability, our brain flexibly adjusts decision-making processes depending on context. Here, we review a growing body of research that explores the neural mechanisms underlying this flexibility. We highlight diverse forms of context dependency in decision making implemented through a variety of neural computations. Context-dependent neural activity is observed in a distributed network of brain structures, including posterior parietal, sensory, motor, and subcortical regions, as well as the prefrontal areas classically implicated in cognitive control. We propose that investigating the distributed network underlying flexible decisions is key to advancing our understanding and discuss a path forward for experimental and theoretical investigations.", "generated_text": "The ability to adapt perceptual decisions based on changing environmental demands is a hallmark of flexible decision making. This study explores the neural mechanisms underlying this adaptability, focusing on sensory-guided behavior and task switching. We examine how distributed neural networks facilitate the dynamic mapping of stimuli to actions, allowing for rapid adjustments in decision policy. By integrating findings from recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies, we identify key brain regions involved in flexible decision making, including the prefrontal cortex and parietal areas. These regions are implicated in maintaining and updating stimulus-action mappings, enabling efficient task switching. Our analysis highlights the role of neural plasticity and connectivity in supporting the flexibility of perceptual decisions. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the neural basis of adaptive behavior and has implications for addressing disorders characterized by impaired decision-making flexibility.", "label": 1}
