{"grounding": "Insulin action is impaired in type 2 diabetes. The functions of the hormone are an integrated product of insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and insulin clearance by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation, mostly in liver (hepatocytes) and, to a lower extent, in extrahepatic peripheral tissues. Substantial evidence indicates that genetic or acquired abnormalities of insulin secretion or action predispose to type 2 diabetes. In recent years, along with the discovery of the molecular foundation of receptor-mediated insulin clearance, such as through the membrane glycoprotein CEACAM1, a consensus has begun to emerge that reduction of insulin clearance contributes to the disease process. In this review, we consider the evidence suggesting a pathogenic role for reduced insulin clearance in insulin resistance, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and type 2 diabetes.", "generated_text": "Insulin clearance is a critical determinant of insulin action and plays a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. This review explores the mechanisms of insulin clearance in both health and disease, emphasizing its impact on insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. We examine how factors such as age, ethnicity, and the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) influence insulin clearance rates. The interplay between hyperglycemia and insulin clearance is also discussed, highlighting the potential for altered clearance to exacerbate metabolic dysfunction. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing targeted interventions to improve insulin sensitivity and manage conditions like NAFLD. This synthesis of current research underscores the need for further studies to elucidate the complex relationships between insulin clearance and metabolic health across diverse populations.", "label": 1}
