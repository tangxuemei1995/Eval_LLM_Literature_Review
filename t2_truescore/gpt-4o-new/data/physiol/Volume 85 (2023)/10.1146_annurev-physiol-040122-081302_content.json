{"grounding": "The generation of an internal body model and its continuous update is essential in sensorimotor control. Although known to rely on proprioceptive sensory feedback, the underlying mechanism that transforms this sensory feedback into a dynamic body percept remains poorly understood. However, advances in the development of genetic tools for proprioceptive circuit elements, including the sensory receptors, are beginning to offer new and unprecedented leverage to dissect the central pathways responsible for proprioceptive encoding. Simultaneously, new data derived through emerging bionic neural machine\u2013interface technologies reveal clues regarding the relative importance of kinesthetic sensory feedback and insights into the functional proprioceptive substrates that underlie natural motor behaviors.", "generated_text": "Proprioception, the body's intrinsic ability to sense movement and position, is undergoing a transformative era driven by genetic and bionic innovations. Recent advances in understanding proprioceptive sensory neurons, muscle spindles, and Golgi tendon organs have elucidated their roles in kinesthetic illusions and neural processing within the dorsal column nuclei and somatosensory cortex. Concurrently, the development of neural machine interfaces and advanced prosthetic limbs is enhancing proprioceptive feedback in amputees, offering unprecedented integration with the nervous system. This review explores the intersection of genetic insights and bionic technologies, highlighting their potential to revolutionize therapeutic strategies and improve quality of life for individuals with proprioceptive deficits.", "label": 1}
