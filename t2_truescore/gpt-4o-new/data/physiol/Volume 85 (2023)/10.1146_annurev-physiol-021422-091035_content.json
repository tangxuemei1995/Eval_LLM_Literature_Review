{"grounding": "Information processing imposes urgent metabolic demands on neurons, which have negligible energy stores and restricted access to fuel. Here, we discuss metabolic recruitment, the tissue-level phenomenon whereby active neurons harvest resources from their surroundings. The primary event is the neuronal release of K+ that mirrors workload. Astrocytes sense K+ in exquisite fashion thanks to their unique coexpression of NBCe1 and \u03b12\u03b22 Na+/K+ ATPase, and within seconds switch to Crabtree metabolism, involving GLUT1, aerobic glycolysis, transient suppression of mitochondrial respiration, and lactate export. The lactate surge serves as a secondary recruiter by inhibiting glucose consumption in distant cells. Additional recruiters are glutamate, nitric oxide, and ammonium, which signal over different spatiotemporal domains. The net outcome of these events is that more glucose, lactate, and oxygen are made available. Metabolic recruitment works alongside neurovascular coupling and various averaging strategies to support the inordinate dynamic range of individual neurons.", "generated_text": "The intricate metabolic interplay between neurons and astrocytes is crucial for maintaining brain function, particularly under varying energetic demands. This study explores the recruitment of metabolic pathways in brain tissue, focusing on the roles of glucose, lactate, and oxygen in neuronal and astrocytic metabolism. Neurons primarily rely on oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria, necessitating a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose. In contrast, astrocytes predominantly utilize glycolysis, producing lactate as a byproduct, which can be shuttled to neurons as an alternative energy substrate. This lactate shuttle hypothesis underscores the complementary metabolic roles of these cell types. Our findings highlight the dynamic regulation of glycolytic and oxidative pathways, emphasizing the adaptability of brain tissue to fluctuating energy requirements. Understanding these metabolic interactions provides insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and potential therapeutic targets for enhancing brain resilience under metabolic stress.", "label": 0}
