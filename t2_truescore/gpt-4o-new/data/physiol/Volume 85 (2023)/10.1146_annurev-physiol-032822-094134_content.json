{"grounding": "Liver regeneration occurs in response to diverse injuries and is capable of functionally reestablishing the lost parenchyma. This phenomenon has been known since antiquity, encapsulated in the Greek myth where Prometheus was to be punished by Zeus for sharing the gift of fire with humanity by having an eagle eat his liver daily, only to have the liver regrow back, thus ensuring eternal suffering and punishment. Today, this process is actively leveraged clinically during living donor liver transplantation whereby up to a two-thirds hepatectomy (resection or removal of part of the liver) on a donor is used for transplant to a recipient. The donor liver rapidly regenerates to recover the lost parenchymal mass to form a functional tissue. This astonishing regenerative process and unique capacity of the liver are examined in further detail in this review.", "generated_text": "The mammalian liver is a complex organ characterized by its remarkable capacity for regeneration and maintenance of homeostasis. This review explores the multifaceted nature of liver zonation and cellular heterogeneity, which are crucial for its diverse metabolic functions. We examine the mechanisms underlying liver homeostasis, focusing on the dynamic balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. The liver's response to acute and chronic injury is discussed, highlighting the role of cellular plasticity in regeneration. Hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells exhibit distinct regenerative capabilities, influenced by their microenvironment and zonal location. Understanding these processes is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver regeneration and repair. This synthesis of current research underscores the liver's adaptability and resilience, providing insights into its regenerative biology and potential interventions for liver diseases.", "label": 1}
