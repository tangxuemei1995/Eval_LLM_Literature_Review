{"grounding": "Traditionally, competition law and practice serve to preserve competition, with a focus on the maximization of consumer welfare. This has been criticized as conflicting with society's overarching goal of achieving greater (environmental) sustainability. Consequently, various jurisdictions have recently reformed their laws and guidance allowing them to account for sustainability benefits in the assessment of cooperation between competitors, with potentially considerable implications for how firms can jointly develop and introduce more sustainable technologies and products. This has opened a new research frontier in the long-standing tradition of marrying the theory of industrial organization with the field of environmental and resource economics. The consideration of sustainability benefits in competition analysis also requires both the transfer and adaptation of measurement techniques. We summarize recent developments and sketch potential research opportunities.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, focusing on how antitrust regulations can accommodate sustainability agreements among firms. By analyzing the role of competition analysis in fostering cooperation for environmental goals, the research highlights the potential for aligning firm green preferences with industrial organization principles. The paper examines case studies where firms have successfully integrated sustainability into their competitive strategies without breaching antitrust laws. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by such integration, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to competition policy that considers environmental impacts. The findings suggest that well-designed competition policies can promote both market efficiency and environmental sustainability, encouraging firms to innovate and collaborate in ways that benefit both the economy and the environment.", "label": 0}
