{"grounding": "Identifying mechanisms of real-life human decision-making is central to inform effective, human-centric public policy. Here, we report larger trends and synthesize preliminary lessons from behavioral economic and neuro-economic investigations focusing on environmental values. We review the currently available evidence at different levels of granularity, from insights into how individuals value natural resources (individual level), evidence from work on group externalities, common pool resources, and social norms (social group level) to the study of incentives, policies, and their impact (institutional level). At each level, we identify viable directions for future scientific research and actionable items for policy-makers. Coupled with new technological and methodological advances, we suggest that behavioral economic and neuroeconomic insights may inform an effective strategy to optimize environmental resources. We conclude that the time is ripe for action to enrich policies with scientifically grounded insights, making an impact in the interest of current and future generations.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics in understanding environmental values and individual decision-making. By integrating insights from these fields, we aim to elucidate how cognitive biases and neural mechanisms influence perceptions and actions regarding environmental issues. The research examines the role of common pool resources and how individuals value and manage these resources, often leading to suboptimal outcomes due to bounded rationality and social preferences. We analyze how neuroeconomic tools, such as neuroimaging, can reveal underlying neural processes that drive environmental decision-making. Furthermore, the study discusses policy implications, suggesting that incorporating behavioral and neuroeconomic insights can enhance the design of interventions aimed at promoting sustainable behaviors. By bridging these disciplines, the research provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and influencing environmental values, ultimately contributing to more effective environmental policies and resource management strategies.", "label": 1}
