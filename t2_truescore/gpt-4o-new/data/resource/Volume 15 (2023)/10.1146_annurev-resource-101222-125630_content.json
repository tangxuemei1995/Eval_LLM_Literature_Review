{"grounding": "This article reviews recent economic studies on the causal effects of temperature on labor productivity. The negative effects of extreme temperatures are widespread, and the magnitudes of the impact differ across social and economic factors. In addition to physical outputs, extreme temperatures also impair mental productivity, including cognition and learning. In utero exposure to extreme temperatures has profound effects on human development. Although the literature has detected various adaptation strategies, the conclusions are mixed. We discuss some limitations of existing studies and propose several directions for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of temperature variations on labor productivity, focusing on both physical and mental tasks. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, we analyze how temperature fluctuations affect productivity levels and explore the role of adaptation mechanisms. The research highlights the significance of early-life exposure to temperature extremes in shaping long-term productivity outcomes. Additionally, we examine the distributional effects across different sectors and demographic groups. Our findings underscore the importance of developing adaptive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of temperature changes on labor productivity in a warming climate.", "label": 1}
