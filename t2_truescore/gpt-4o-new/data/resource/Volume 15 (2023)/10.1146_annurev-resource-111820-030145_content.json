{"grounding": "Having experienced low prices for about a decade, the European Union Emissions Trading System has been supplemented with the market stability reserve (MSR) that adjusts the supply of allowances to market outcomes. We critically review the literature assessing the performance of the MSR against several policy objectives. In doing so, we cover both conceptual aspects and quantitative assessments. We conclude by pointing out important policy implications and open issues for further research.", "generated_text": "This critical review examines the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), focusing on its role in enhancing market stability amid overlapping climate policies. The analysis highlights the MSR's effectiveness in addressing surplus allowances and price volatility, while considering its interaction with other policy instruments. The study underscores the need for adaptive mechanisms to ensure the EU ETS's robustness in achieving long-term climate objectives.", "label": 1}
