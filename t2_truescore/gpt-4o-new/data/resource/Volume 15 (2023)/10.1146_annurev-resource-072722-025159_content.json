{"grounding": "In 2015, the United Nations and the G20 put food loss and food waste on the global agenda. While progress has been made since then, the scale of the problem persists because food loss and food waste are measured together, not separately. The paucity of data also poses a challenge. This article reviews the measurements, causes, and determinants of food loss as well as the interventions to reduce it. The review finds that food loss is considered in isolation, even though it is one of the causes and results of how agrifood systems function. The review calls for improved microdata collection and standardized measurements to separate food loss from food waste. Such efforts would help integrate feedback loops and cascading effects across the value chain with agrifood systems to identify intervention hot spots, trade-offs, and synergies of interventions as well as the effects of food loss reduction on socioeconomic, environmental, and food security goals.", "generated_text": "Food loss and waste within agrifood systems pose significant challenges to global food security, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. This study synthesizes current knowledge on the extent, causes, and impacts of food losses across various stages of the value chain, from production to consumption. It highlights the complexity of measuring food loss due to diverse definitions and methodologies, which complicates the assessment of its true scale and impact. Key determinants of food loss include inadequate infrastructure, inefficient supply chain management, and socio-economic factors. The paper reviews interventions aimed at reducing food loss, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that involve technological innovations, policy reforms, and stakeholder collaboration. By identifying gaps in current research and practice, this study underscores the importance of developing standardized measurement frameworks and targeted strategies to mitigate food loss, thereby enhancing the resilience and efficiency of agrifood systems and contributing to global food security goals.", "label": 1}
