{"grounding": "Based on an extensive literature review and publicly available data, this article provides insights into the differences in prevalence, sociodemographics, contributing factors, socioeconomic consequences, health effects, and public policies related to obesity between developed and developing countries. Most importantly, it explores the relationship between obesity and life expectancy and identifies potential mechanisms through which obesity affects mortality, highlighting the differences between developed and developing countries and by gender. It also examines how the associations between obesity and life expectancy differ at the population level compared with the individual level. The evidence shows a negative association between obesity and longevity, as well as an increased risk of various diseases with the rising rates of obesity. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing countries and by gender. The article also discusses the effectiveness of various policies adopted to address obesity and provides suggestions to address obesity problems and improve health and well-being in these countries.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy across different global contexts, focusing on both developed and developing countries. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset that spans multiple decades and includes diverse demographic and socioeconomic variables, we analyze how obesity impacts mortality rates and life expectancy. Our findings reveal significant disparities in the effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing nations. In developed countries, where healthcare systems are more robust, the impact of obesity on life expectancy is somewhat mitigated, although still significant. Conversely, in developing countries, the lack of adequate healthcare infrastructure exacerbates the negative effects of obesity, leading to a more pronounced reduction in life expectancy. The study highlights the importance of tailored public health strategies that consider the unique challenges and resources of each region. By understanding these heterogeneous effects, policymakers can better address the global obesity epidemic and its implications for health and mortality, ultimately improving life expectancy outcomes worldwide.", "label": 1}
