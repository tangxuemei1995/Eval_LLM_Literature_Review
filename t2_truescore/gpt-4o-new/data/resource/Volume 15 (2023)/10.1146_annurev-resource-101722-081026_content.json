{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the recent economics literature analyzing the effect of air pollution on health outcomes. We review the common approaches to measuring and modeling air pollution exposures and the epidemiological and biological literature on health outcomes that undergird federal air regulations in the United States. The article contrasts the methods used in the epidemiology literature with the causal inference framework used in economics. In particular, we review the common sources of estimation bias in epidemiological approaches that the economics literature has sought to overcome with research designs that take advantage of natural experiments. We review new promising research designs for estimating concentration-response functions and identify areas for further research.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in causal inference methodologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the relationship between air pollution and health outcomes. This study explores the integration of natural experiments and epidemiological data to establish more robust causal links. By leveraging integrated science assessments, researchers can better account for confounding variables and biases, leading to more accurate estimations of health impacts. The application of these advanced techniques provides critical insights into the mechanisms by which air pollution affects human health, informing policy decisions and public health interventions. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the importance of combining statistical innovation with comprehensive environmental assessments to address complex public health challenges.", "label": 0}
