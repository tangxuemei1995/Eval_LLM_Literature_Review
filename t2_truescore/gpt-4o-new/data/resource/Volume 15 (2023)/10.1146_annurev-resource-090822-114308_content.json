{"grounding": "This review evaluates three micro and three macro estimation approaches to determine whether unrealistic differences exist in estimating the size of nonobserved/shadow economies. While some macro-MIMIC estimates are higher than estimates using the statistical discrepancy approach, when adjusting for double-counting, MIMIC approaches provide similar results. Macro approaches usually cover not only typical shadow economy activities, but also voluntary work, do-it-yourself activities, and classical crime activities; by nature, macro approaches will lead to higher and more accurate estimates than micro approaches. However, if certain adjustments are made, the estimated size of the shadow economy using the MIMIC approach comes close to the size of the shadow economy indicated by micro survey approaches. Hence, claims that macro approaches are unrealistically high and rely on unrealistic assumptions must be reconsidered.", "generated_text": "This study investigates whether various estimation methods yield significantly different results in assessing the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. By comparing the MIMIC estimation approaches, micro survey techniques, and the consumption-income gap approach, the research aims to identify potential discrepancies and their implications. Preliminary findings suggest that while each method offers unique insights, they may produce implausible variations in estimated shadow economy sizes due to methodological differences and data limitations. The study highlights the importance of methodological transparency and the need for a standardized framework to enhance comparability across studies. These insights are crucial for policymakers and researchers seeking to understand and address the complexities of shadow economies effectively. Further research is recommended to refine these methods and validate findings across diverse economic contexts.", "label": 1}
