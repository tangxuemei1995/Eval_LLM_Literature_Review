{"grounding": "More than five billion metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually worldwide. Despite having multiple uses and significant potential to augment crop and livestock production, a large share of crop residues is burned, especially in Asian countries. This unsustainable practice causes tremendous air pollution and health hazards while restricting soil nutrient recycling. In this review, we examine the economic rationale for unsustainable residue management. The sustainability of residue utilization is determined by several economic factors, such as local demand for and quantity of residue production, development and dissemination of technologies to absorb excess residue, and market and policy instruments to internalize the social costs of residue burning. The intervention strategy to ensure sustainable residue management depends on public awareness of the private and societal costs of open residue burning.", "generated_text": "The management of crop residues is a critical component in sustainable agriculture, particularly for smallholder farmers. This study examines the economic implications of various crop residue management practices, with a focus on residue burning and its environmental effects. Residue burning, while a quick disposal method, contributes significantly to air pollution and climate change. The research highlights the potential benefits of alternative practices, such as mulching and composting, which can enhance soil fertility and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the adoption of these technologies is often hindered by economic constraints and lack of awareness among smallholder farmers. This paper explores the cost-benefit analysis of different residue management strategies and suggests policy interventions to promote sustainable practices, thereby aligning agricultural productivity with environmental conservation goals.", "label": 1}
