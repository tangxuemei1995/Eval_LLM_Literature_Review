{"grounding": "We take stock of the major changes in methodology for studying the impacts of international agricultural research, focusing on the period 2006\u20132020. Impact assessment of agricultural research has a long and recognized tradition. Until the mid-2000s, such assessments were dominated by a model of demand for and supply of agricultural products in partial equilibrium. The basic ideas for this approach were sketched out by Griliches more than half a century ago. We describe the implications of heightened standards of evidence for good practice in three domains of research design: causal inference, valid measurement, and statistical representativeness. We document advances in each of these domains and review recent evidence that demonstrates the lessons that can be learned from adopting these practices, emphasizing the importance of evidence at-scale, the need to consider portfolios of innovations at a national level, and the challenges of accounting for innovations that are promoted as bundles.", "generated_text": "The Rigor Revolution in international agricultural research emphasizes the need for robust standards of evidence in impact assessment. This paper explores the evolving methodologies that enhance the precision and reliability of measuring the effects of agricultural research for development. By integrating advanced causal inference techniques and scalable measurement frameworks, the study addresses the challenges of attributing outcomes directly to research interventions. The analysis highlights the importance of context-specific approaches that consider the diverse socio-economic and environmental landscapes in which agricultural innovations are deployed. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of these new standards for policy-making and resource allocation, advocating for a paradigm shift towards more rigorous, evidence-based decision-making processes. This revolution in rigor not only aims to improve the credibility of impact assessments but also seeks to maximize the developmental benefits of agricultural research by ensuring that interventions are both effective and scalable across different regions.", "label": 0}
