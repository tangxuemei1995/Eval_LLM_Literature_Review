{"grounding": "Food fraud represents a serious threat to the integrity of the global agri-food marketing system and has received considerable attention by policy makers, academics, and the public at large. This review presents the conditions that enable fraudulent activity in agri-food supply chains (such as asymmetric information, imperfect certification processes, supply chain complexity, and weak monitoring and enforcement systems) and discusses recent efforts to document and deter food fraud and the growing theoretical and empirical literature on the economics of food fraud. The article concludes by identifying some gaps in the literature and provides suggestions for future research.", "generated_text": "Food fraud, encompassing adulteration and mislabeling, arises from asymmetric information and the credence nature of food products. This study examines the causes, including economic incentives and regulatory gaps, and the consequences, such as health risks and economic losses. The role of certification and labeling as deterrence strategies is analyzed, highlighting their limitations due to costly and imperfect enforcement. The research suggests enhancing transparency and accountability through improved regulatory frameworks and technological innovations. By addressing these challenges, the study aims to contribute to more effective deterrence strategies, ensuring food integrity and consumer trust in the global food supply chain.", "label": 0}
