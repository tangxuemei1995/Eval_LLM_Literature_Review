{"grounding": "Agroecology is often considered as the ultimate and most comprehensive solution to the many challenges of the agricultural and food system, also referred to as the agri-food system. This review investigates to what extent agroecology can become the mainstream model for transforming agriculture toward more sustainable and resilient agri-food systems within the given economic and political context. We find that enhancing agroecology will require a fully integrated multiscale systems approach from farm to region to globe. The approach must consider relevant processes and relationships, actors and stakeholders as well as drivers, sustainability indicators, and the respective assessment methods across all scales. Giving specific attention to drivers related to economy, technology, and policy we point out that agroecology needs to be economically viable for farmers and other food system actors. In particular, new and emerging technologies related to digitalization and breeding should be given more consideration in agroecological transformation. We stress the need for an analytical and operational framework and adequate multiscale policy design and suggest six areas of needed attention to support the large-scale adoption of agroecology.", "generated_text": "Agroecology presents a transformative approach to achieving sustainable agriculture and food systems by integrating ecological principles with agricultural practices. This study explores the potential of agroecology to address pressing global challenges such as food security, environmental degradation, and climate change. By examining case studies from diverse geographical regions, the research highlights successful local solutions that have been implemented through multiactor approaches, involving farmers, policymakers, scientists, and civil society. The findings underscore the importance of supportive agricultural and food policies in facilitating the transition from local initiatives to large-scale adoption. Furthermore, the study discusses the role of emerging technologies in enhancing agroecological practices, emphasizing the need for context-specific innovations that respect local knowledge and biodiversity. The research advocates for a holistic agricultural transformation that aligns with sustainable development goals, urging stakeholders to collaborate across multiple scales to foster resilient food systems. Ultimately, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting agroecology as a viable pathway for sustainable agricultural development and calls for integrated policy frameworks to enable its widespread implementation.", "label": 1}
