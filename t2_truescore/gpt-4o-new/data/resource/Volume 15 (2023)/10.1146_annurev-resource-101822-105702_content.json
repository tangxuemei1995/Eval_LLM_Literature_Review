{"grounding": "This article reviews the literature on the financial sector impacts of natural disasters and physical climate change risks, covering banking, insurance, stock markets, bond markets, and international financial flows. Most studies have applied statistical approaches to historical data from developed countries to identify these impacts, while some have also used theoretical and computational modeling to assess future risks under climate change scenarios. The findings show that natural disasters and climate change risks generally lower insurer profitability and risk-sharing capacity, bank stability and credit supply, returns and stability of stock and bond markets, foreign direct investment inflows, and international lending. Factors such as income levels, rigorous financial regulations, capital abundance, market diversification, and adaptation strategies mitigate the negative effects. Natural disasters increase remittance inflows and financial assistance to low- and middle-income countries. We recommend future research on forward-looking computational modeling to assess the future financial sector impacts of climate change, while accounting for adaptation actions and their drivers. Future research should also consider hazard correlations and the interactions between financial industries and regions to more comprehensively assess the economic effects of natural disasters in general and for vulnerable countries in particular.", "generated_text": "This review examines the multifaceted impacts of climate change-related risks on the financial sector, with a focus on banking, insurance, and financial markets. As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase, financial institutions face heightened exposure to physical risks, such as property damage and business interruptions, which can lead to significant financial losses. The banking sector is particularly vulnerable to credit risks arising from borrowers' inability to repay loans due to climate-induced disruptions. Insurance companies are grappling with escalating claims and the challenge of accurately pricing climate risks, which threatens their solvency and market stability. Financial markets are also affected, as climate risks influence asset valuations and investor behavior, leading to increased volatility and potential market corrections. This review highlights the need for enhanced risk assessment frameworks and the integration of climate risk considerations into financial decision-making processes. It also underscores the importance of regulatory interventions and the development of innovative financial instruments to mitigate these risks. By synthesizing current research, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the financial sector's vulnerabilities to climate change and to inform strategies for building resilience against future climate-related challenges.", "label": 1}
