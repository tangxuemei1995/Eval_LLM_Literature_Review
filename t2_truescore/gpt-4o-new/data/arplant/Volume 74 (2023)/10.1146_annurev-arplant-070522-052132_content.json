{"grounding": "Proteins are workhorses in the cell; they form stable and more often dynamic, transient protein\u2013protein interactions, assemblies, and networks and have an intimate interplay with DNA and RNA. These network interactions underlie fundamental biological processes and play essential roles in cellular function. The proximity-dependent biotinylation labeling approach combined with mass spectrometry (PL-MS) has recently emerged as a powerful technique to dissect the complex cellular network at the molecular level. In PL-MS, by fusing a genetically encoded proximity-labeling (PL) enzyme to a protein or a localization signal peptide, the enzyme is targeted to a protein complex of interest or to an organelle, allowing labeling of proximity proteins within a zoom radius. These biotinylated proteins can then be captured by streptavidin beads and identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. Recently engineered PL enzymes such as TurboID have a much-improved enzymatic activity, enabling spatiotemporal mapping with a dramatically increased signal-to-noise ratio. PL-MS has revolutionized the way we perform proteomics by overcoming several hurdles imposed by traditional technology, such as biochemical fractionation and affinity purification mass spectrometry. In this review, we focus on biotin ligase\u2013based PL-MS applications that have been, or are likely to be, adopted by the plant field. We discuss the experimental designs and review the different choices for engineered biotin ligases, enrichment, and quantification strategies. Lastly, we review the validation and discuss future perspectives.", "generated_text": "Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful technique for elucidating protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleotide interactions within the complex cellular environments of plants. This method involves the use of engineered enzymes that catalyze the covalent attachment of biotin or other tags to nearby proteins or nucleotides, enabling the capture and identification of interaction partners in vivo. The application of PL in plant systems offers significant advantages for mapping subcellular and cell type\u2013specific proteomes, which are crucial for understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant cellular processes. Recent advancements in PL technologies, such as TurboID and miniTurbo, have enhanced the speed and efficiency of labeling, allowing for more precise quantification of interactions under various physiological conditions. These improvements facilitate the study of transient and weak interactions that are often missed by traditional methods. Furthermore, PL can be integrated with mass spectrometry to provide a comprehensive view of the proteomic landscape, offering insights into the functional networks that underpin plant development and stress responses. This review highlights the current state of PL applications in plant research, discusses methodological considerations, and explores future directions for expanding the utility of PL in plant biology. By advancing our understanding of plant proteomes, PL holds the potential to drive innovations in agriculture and biotechnology, ultimately contributing to sustainable crop production and food security.", "label": 1}
