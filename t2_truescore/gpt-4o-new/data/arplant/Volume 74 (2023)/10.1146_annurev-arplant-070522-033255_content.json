{"grounding": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) genes encode ion channels with demonstrated roles in electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling. The expansion of the GLR family along the lineage of land plants, culminating in the appearance of a multiclade system among flowering plants, has been a topic of interest since their discovery nearly 25 years ago. GLRs are involved in many physiological processes, from wound signaling to transcriptional regulation to sexual reproduction. Emerging evidence supports the notion that their fundamental functions are conserved among different groups of plants as well. In this review, we update the physiological and genetic evidence for GLRs, establishing their role in signaling and cell\u2013cell communication. Special emphasis is given to the recent discussion of GLRs\u2019 atomic structures. Along with functional assays, a structural view of GLRs\u2019 molecular organization presents a window for novel hypotheses regarding the molecular mechanisms underpinning signaling associated with the ionic fluxes that GLRs regulate. Newly uncovered transcriptional regulations associated with GLRs\u2014which propose the involvement of genes from all clades ofArabidopsis thaliana in ways not previously observed\u2014are discussed in the context of the broader impacts of GLR activity. We posit that the functions of GLRs in plant biology are probably much broader than anticipated, but describing their widespread involvement will only be possible with (a) a comprehensive understanding of the channel's properties at the molecular and structural levels, including protein\u2013protein interactions, and (b) the design of new genetic approaches to explore stress and pathogen responses where precise transcriptional control may result in more precise testable hypotheses to overcome their apparent functional redundancies.", "generated_text": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) ion channels are pivotal components in the intricate network of plant signaling, bridging the gap between structural integrity and dynamic cellular communication. These channels, homologous to animal ionotropic glutamate receptors, are integral to the modulation of excitability and cell\u2013cell communication in plants. This review delves into the multifaceted roles and mechanisms of GLRs, emphasizing their contribution to calcium transport and signaling, which are crucial for various physiological processes. GLRs facilitate the influx of calcium ions, thereby influencing electric signaling and the generation of action potentials, which are essential for rapid systemic responses to environmental stimuli. Furthermore, GLRs are implicated in amino acid signaling, particularly through their interaction with glutathione and other signaling molecules, underscoring their role in metabolic regulation and stress responses. The structural aspects of GLRs, including their ligand-binding domains and ion channel architecture, are explored to elucidate their functional diversity and specificity. Recent advances in molecular biology and electrophysiology have shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms governing GLR activity, including post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. This synthesis of signaling and structural insights provides a comprehensive understanding of how GLRs integrate external signals with internal cellular responses, thereby maintaining homeostasis and adaptability in plants. By highlighting the convergence of signaling pathways mediated by GLRs, this review underscores their potential as targets for genetic and biotechnological interventions aimed at enhancing plant resilience and productivity in the face of environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
