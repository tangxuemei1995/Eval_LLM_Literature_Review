{"grounding": "Plant cells accumulate small RNA molecules that regulate plant development, genome stability, and environmental responses. These small RNAs fall into three major classes based on their function and mechanisms of biogenesis\u2014microRNAs, heterochromatic small interfering RNAs, and secondary small interfering RNAs\u2014plus several other less well-characterized categories. Biogenesis of each small RNA class requires a pathway of factors, some specific to each pathway and others involved in multiple pathways. Diverse sequenced plant genomes, along with rapid developments in sequencing, imaging, and genetic transformation techniques, have enabled significant progress in understanding the biogenesis, functions, and evolution of plant small RNAs, including those that had been poorly characterized because they were absent or had low representation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we review recent findings about plant small RNAs and discuss our current understanding of their biogenesis mechanisms, targets, modes of action, mobility, and functions in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including economically important crops.", "generated_text": "Plant small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and phased secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs), are pivotal regulators of gene expression, influencing plant development and stress responses. These small RNAs are generated through distinct biogenesis pathways, involving Dicer-like enzymes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which produce mature RNA molecules that guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to target mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. miRNAs primarily regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, while siRNAs, including mobile siRNAs, can move between cells to coordinate developmental processes and defense mechanisms. PhasiRNAs, derived from precursor transcripts, play crucial roles in reproductive development. The intricate network of small RNA-mediated regulation underscores their importance in plant growth, development, and adaptation to environmental challenges. Understanding the biogenesis and functional dynamics of these small RNAs offers insights into plant biology and potential applications in crop improvement and stress resilience.", "label": 1}
