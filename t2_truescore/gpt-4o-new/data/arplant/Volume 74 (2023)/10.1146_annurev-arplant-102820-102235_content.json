{"grounding": "Temperature is a key environmental cue that influences the distribution and behavior of plants globally. Understanding how plants sense temperature and integrate this information into their development is important to determine how plants adapt to climate change and to apply this knowledge to the breeding of climate-resilient crops. The mechanisms of temperature perception in eukaryotes are only just beginning to be understood, with multiple molecular phenomena with inherent temperature dependencies, such as RNA melting, phytochrome dark reversion, and protein phase change, being exploited by nature to create thermosensory signaling networks. Here, we review recent progress in understanding how temperature sensing in four major pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana occurs: vernalization, cold stress, thermomorphogenesis, and heat stress. We discuss outstanding questions in the field and the importance of these mechanisms in the context of breeding climate-resilient crops.", "generated_text": "Temperature sensing in plants is a critical adaptive mechanism that enables survival under varying thermal conditions. This study focuses on the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana to elucidate the molecular and physiological processes underlying plant thermosensation. We explore the role of thermosensors in detecting temperature fluctuations and initiating appropriate responses to heat and cold stress. Our findings highlight the significance of thermomorphogenesis, a process by which plants alter their growth and development in response to temperature changes. By examining gene expression patterns and phenotypic adaptations, we identify key regulatory pathways that facilitate thermal adaptation. This research advances our understanding of plant resilience to climate variability and provides insights into potential strategies for enhancing crop tolerance to extreme temperatures, thereby contributing to agricultural sustainability in the face of global climate change.", "label": 1}
