{"grounding": "Since the discovery of the first ribonucleic acid (RNA) modifications in transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), scientists have been on a quest to decipher the identities and functions of RNA modifications in biological systems. The last decade has seen monumental growth in the number of studies that have characterized and assessed the functionalities of RNA modifications in the field of plant biology. Owing to these studies, we now categorize RNA modifications based on their chemical nature and the RNA on which they are found, as well as the array of proteins that are involved in the processes that add, read, and remove them from an RNA molecule. Beyond their identity, another key piece of the puzzle is the functional significance of the various types of RNA modifications. Here, we shed light on recent studies that help establish our current understanding of the diversity of RNA modifications found in plant transcriptomes and the functions they play at both the molecular (e.g., RNA stability, translation, and transport) and organismal (e.g., stress response and development) levels. Finally, we consider the key research questions related to plant gene expression and biology in general and highlight developments in various technologies that are driving our insights forward in this research area.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene expression, influencing various biological processes in plants. This review delves into the diversity and functional roles of RNA modifications, with a focus on mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA in plant systems. Among the myriad of modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) are highlighted for their significant roles in modulating RNA stability, translation, and splicing. These modifications are not only crucial for normal plant development but also play a vital role in plant stress responses, enabling plants to adapt to environmental challenges. The review synthesizes current knowledge on the enzymatic machinery responsible for these modifications, including writers, erasers, and readers, and their dynamic regulation under stress conditions. Despite the advances in understanding RNA modifications, many questions remain regarding their precise molecular mechanisms and the full spectrum of their biological functions. The review calls for further research employing advanced technologies such as high-throughput sequencing and CRISPR-based tools to unravel the complexities of RNA modifications. By expanding our understanding of RNA modifications, we can potentially enhance crop resilience and productivity, addressing global food security challenges. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers aiming to explore the functional diversity of RNA modifications in plants.", "label": 1}
