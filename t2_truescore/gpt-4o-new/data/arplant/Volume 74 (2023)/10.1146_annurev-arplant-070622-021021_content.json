{"grounding": "My research career started with an ambition to work out how genes are regulated in plants. I tried out various experimental systems\u2014artichoke tissue culture in Edinburgh; soybean root nodules in Montreal; soybean hypocotyls in Athens, Georgia; and cereal aleurones in Cambridge\u2014but eventually I discovered plant viruses. Viral satellite RNAs were my first interest, but I then explored transgenic and natural disease resistance and was led by curiosity into topics beyond virology, including RNA silencing, epigenetics, and more recently, genome evolution. On the way, I have learned about approaches to research, finding tractable systems, and taking academic research into the real world. I have always tried to consider the broader significance of our work, and my current projects address the definition of epigenetics, the arms race concept of disease resistance, and Darwin's abominable mystery.", "generated_text": "The concept of an RNA world posits that RNA molecules were pivotal in the early stages of life, serving both as genetic material and as catalysts. This study explores the multifaceted roles of RNA in gene expression and its implications for plant viruses and disease resistance. By examining the evolutionary trajectory of RNA, we gain insights into its adaptability and functionality in various biological processes. The research highlights the potential of RNA-based technologies in agriculture, offering innovative solutions for enhancing crop resilience and productivity. Furthermore, the study delves into the autobiographical journey of RNA research, tracing its historical milestones and future prospects. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of RNA in both the natural world and technological advancements, paving the way for novel applications in sustainable agriculture and beyond.", "label": 0}
