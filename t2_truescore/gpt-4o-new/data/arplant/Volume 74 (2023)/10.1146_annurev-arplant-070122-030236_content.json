{"grounding": "\ncis-Regulatory elements encode the genomic blueprints that ensure the proper spatiotemporal patterning of gene expression necessary for appropriate development and responses to the environment. Accumulating evidence implicates changes to gene expression as a major source of phenotypic novelty in eukaryotes, including acute phenotypes such as disease and cancer in mammals. Moreover, genetic and epigenetic variation affecting cis-regulatory sequences over longer evolutionary timescales has become a recurring theme in studies of morphological divergence and local adaptation. Here, we discuss the functions of and methods used to identify various classes of cis-regulatory elements, as well as their role in plant development and response to the environment. We highlight opportunities to exploit cis-regulatory variants underlying plant development and environmental responses for crop improvement efforts. Although a comprehensive understanding of cis-regulatory mechanisms in plants has lagged behind that in animals, we showcase several breakthrough findings that have profoundly influenced plant biology and shaped the overall understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes.", "generated_text": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating plant development, adaptation, and evolutionary processes by modulating gene expression. These non-coding DNA sequences, located proximal to genes, interact with transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to regulate transcriptional activity. This review synthesizes current insights into the role of CREs in plant development, highlighting their influence on spatial and temporal gene expression patterns essential for organogenesis and differentiation. Furthermore, we explore how CREs contribute to plant adaptation by mediating stress response pathways, enabling plants to cope with environmental challenges such as drought, salinity, and pathogen attack. The evolutionary significance of CREs is underscored by their capacity to drive phenotypic diversity and speciation through subtle modifications in gene regulatory networks. Advances in genomic technologies, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and CRISPR-based editing, have facilitated the identification and functional characterization of CREs, offering new avenues for crop improvement and sustainable agriculture. Understanding CRE dynamics is crucial for harnessing plant resilience and productivity in changing climates.", "label": 1}
