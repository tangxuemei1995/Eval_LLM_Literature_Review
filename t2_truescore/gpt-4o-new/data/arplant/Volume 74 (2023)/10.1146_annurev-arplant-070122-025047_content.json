{"grounding": "The establishment, maintenance, and removal of epigenetic modifications provide an additional layer of regulation, beyond genetically encoded factors, by which plants can control developmental processes and adapt to the environment. Epigenetic inheritance, while historically referring to information not encoded in the DNA sequence that is inherited between generations, can also refer to epigenetic modifications that are maintained within an individual but are reset between generations. Both types of epigenetic inheritance occur in plants, and the functions and mechanisms distinguishing the two are of great interest to the field. Here, we discuss examples of epigenetic dynamics and maintenance during selected stages of growth and development and their functional consequences. Epigenetic states are also dynamic in response to stress, with consequences for transposable element regulation. How epigenetic resetting between generations occurs during normal development and in response to stress is an emerging area of research.", "generated_text": "Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in plant development, influencing gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. This regulation is mediated through mechanisms such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, which can modulate chromatin structure and accessibility. These epigenetic marks are dynamic, allowing plants to adapt to environmental changes, such as heat stress, by altering gene expression patterns. Furthermore, epigenetic memory enables plants to 'remember' past environmental conditions, potentially enhancing their resilience to future stresses. Transposable elements, often silenced by epigenetic mechanisms, can also contribute to genomic plasticity and adaptation. This review explores the intricate network of epigenetic regulation during plant development, emphasizing the capacity for epigenetic memory in response to environmental stimuli. Understanding these processes provides insights into plant adaptability and resilience, offering potential strategies for improving crop performance under changing climatic conditions.", "label": 1}
