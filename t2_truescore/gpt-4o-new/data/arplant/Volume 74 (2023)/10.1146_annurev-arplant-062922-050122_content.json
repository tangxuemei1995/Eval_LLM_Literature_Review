{"grounding": "Plants\u2019 ability to chemically modify core structures of specialized metabolites is the main reason why the plant kingdom contains such a wide and rich array of diverse compounds. One of the most important types of chemical modifications of small molecules is the addition of an acyl moiety to produce esters and amides. Large-scale phylogenomics analyses have shown that the enzymes that perform acyl transfer reactions on the myriad small molecules synthesized by plants belong to only a few gene families. This review is focused on describing the biochemistry, evolutionary origins, and chemical ecology implications of one of these families\u2014the BAHD acyltransferases. The growth of advanced metabolomic studies coupled with next-generation sequencing of diverse plant species has confirmed that the BAHD family plays critical roles in modifying nearly all known classes of specialized metabolites. The current and future outlook for research on BAHDs includes expanding their roles in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.", "generated_text": "The BAHD acyltransferase gene family, encompassing hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCTs), plays a pivotal role in plant metabolism, particularly in the phenylpropanoid pathway. This pathway is crucial for the biosynthesis of a diverse array of secondary metabolites, including acylsugars, esters, and amides, which are vital for plant defense, growth, and adaptation. Recent studies have highlighted the evolutionary significance of BAHD acyltransferases in land plants, underscoring their contribution to the diversification of plant chemical defenses and ecological interactions. The functional versatility of these enzymes is attributed to their ability to catalyze the transfer of acyl groups to a wide range of acceptor molecules, facilitating the synthesis of complex compounds. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the structural and functional diversity of the BAHD family, exploring their evolutionary trajectories and expanding roles in plant biology. Understanding these mechanisms offers insights into plant resilience and potential applications in agriculture and biotechnology.", "label": 1}
