{"grounding": "Plant hormones are a group of small signaling molecules produced by plants at very low concentrations that have the ability to move and function at distal sites. Hormone homeostasis is critical to balance plant growth and development and is regulated at multiple levels, including hormone biosynthesis, catabolism, perception, and transduction. In addition, plants move hormones over short and long distances to regulate various developmental processes and responses to environmental factors. Transporters coordinate these movements, resulting in hormone maxima, gradients, and cellular and subcellular sinks. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of most of the characterized plant hormone transporters with respect to biochemical, physiological, and developmental activities. We further discuss the subcellular localizations of transporters, their substrate specificities, and the need for multiple transporters for the same hormone in the context of plant growth and development.", "generated_text": "Plant hormones, or phytohormones, are crucial signaling molecules that regulate growth, development, and stress responses. This review explores the transport and localization mechanisms of key phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). Understanding the transport mechanisms, such as specific transporters and cellular pathways, is essential for maintaining hormone homeostasis and ensuring precise spatial and temporal signaling. Recent advances highlight the role of transport proteins and vesicular trafficking in hormone distribution, influencing plant physiology and adaptation. The interplay between different hormones and their transport systems underscores the complexity of plant signaling networks. This synthesis of current knowledge provides insights into the dynamic movement of phytohormones, offering potential strategies for enhancing crop resilience and productivity through targeted manipulation of hormone transport pathways.", "label": 1}
