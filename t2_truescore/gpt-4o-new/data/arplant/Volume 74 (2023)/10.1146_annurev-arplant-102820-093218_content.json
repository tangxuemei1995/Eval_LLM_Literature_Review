{"grounding": "SWITCH deficient SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) class chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to facilitate access of proteins to the genomic DNA for transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Uniquely, SWI/SNF CRCs can both slide the histone octamer along the DNA or eject it from the DNA. Given their ability to change the chromatin status quo, SWI/SNF remodelers are critical for cell fate reprogramming with pioneer and other transcription factors, for responses to environmental challenges, and for disease prevention. Recent cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry approaches have uncovered different subtypes of SWI/SNF complexes with unique properties and functions. At the same time, tethering or rapid depletion and inactivation of SWI/SNF have provided novel insight into SWI/SNF requirements for enhancer activity and into balancing chromatin compaction and accessibility in concert with Polycomb complexes. Given their importance, SWI/SNF recruitment to genomic locations by transcription factors and their biochemical activity is tightly controlled. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of SWI/SNF CRCs in animals and plants and discusses the multiple nuclear and biological roles of SWI/SNF CRCs and how SWI/SNF activity is altered by complex subunit composition, posttranslational modifications, and the chromatin context to support proper development and response to extrinsic cues.", "generated_text": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers are pivotal in modulating chromatin architecture, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. These ATP-dependent complexes facilitate the repositioning, ejection, or restructuring of nucleosomes, which are the fundamental units of chromatin. By altering nucleosome positioning, SWI/SNF complexes enable or restrict access to DNA for transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, thus playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. This review explores the mechanistic underpinnings of SWI/SNF activity, focusing on the ATPase subunits that drive chromatin remodeling. We discuss how these remodelers interact with nucleosomes and the subsequent impact on chromatin dynamics. Furthermore, the role of SWI/SNF complexes in development and cellular response to environmental stimuli is examined, highlighting their involvement in cell differentiation and adaptation processes. Recent studies have elucidated the diverse functions of SWI/SNF complexes in various biological contexts, including their contribution to the regulation of developmental pathways and response to external signals. The dysregulation of SWI/SNF activity is implicated in numerous diseases, underscoring the importance of these remodelers in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of SWI/SNF function provides insights into their potential as therapeutic targets in disease contexts where chromatin remodeling is disrupted.", "label": 1}
