{"grounding": "Plant invasions, a byproduct of globalization, are increasing worldwide. Because of their ecological and economic impacts, considerable efforts have been made to understand and predict the success of non-native plants. Numerous frameworks, hypotheses, and theories have been advanced to conceptualize the interactions of multiple drivers and context dependence of invasion success with the aim of achieving robust explanations with predictive power. We review these efforts from a community-level perspective rather than a biogeographical one, focusing on terrestrial systems, and explore the roles of intrinsic plant properties in determining species invasiveness, as well as the effects of biotic and abiotic conditions in mediating ecosystem invasibility (or resistance) and ecological and evolutionary processes. We also consider the fundamental influences of human-induced changes at scales ranging from local to global in triggering, promoting, and sustaining plant invasions and discuss how these changes could alter future invasion trajectories.", "generated_text": "Invasive plants pose significant ecological challenges, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem dynamics. This study explores the factors contributing to the success of alien plants, focusing on biotic interactions, competition, and ecosystem invasibility. We examine the role of functional traits that enhance invasiveness, such as rapid growth, high reproductive output, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. The research highlights how these traits enable non-native plants to exploit available resources more efficiently than native species. Additionally, we investigate the influence of biotic interactions, including mutualisms and enemy release, which can facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive species. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting potential invasions and developing effective management strategies. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both intrinsic plant traits and extrinsic ecosystem characteristics to mitigate the impacts of invasive plants on biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "label": 1}
