{"grounding": "Optogenetics is a technique employing natural or genetically engineered photoreceptors in transgene organisms to manipulate biological activities with light. Light can be turned on or off, and adjusting its intensity and duration allows optogenetic fine-tuning of cellular processes in a noninvasive and spatiotemporally resolved manner. Since the introduction of Channelrhodopsin-2 and phytochrome-based switches nearly 20 years ago, optogenetic tools have been applied in a variety of model organisms with enormous success, but rarely in plants. For a long time, the dependence of plant growth on light and the absence of retinal, the rhodopsin chromophore, prevented the establishment of plant optogenetics until recent progress overcame these difficulties. We summarize the recent results of work in the field to control plant growth and cellular motion via green light\u2013gated ion channels and present successful applications to light-control gene expression with single or combined photoswitches in plants. Furthermore, we highlight the technical requirements and options for future plant optogenetic research.", "generated_text": "Optogenetic methods have emerged as a transformative approach in plant biology, offering precise control over cellular processes through light-responsive proteins. This review explores the integration of plant optogenetics, focusing on the utilization of photoreceptors, rhodopsins, and optoswitches to manipulate plant physiology and development. Photoreceptors, such as phytochromes and cryptochromes, are harnessed to modulate gene expression and signaling pathways, providing insights into plant responses to environmental stimuli. Rhodopsins, traditionally studied in microbial systems, are now being adapted to plants, enabling the regulation of ion channels and membrane potentials with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, the development of optoswitches and biosensors facilitates real-time monitoring and control of metabolic pathways, enhancing our understanding of plant growth and adaptation. This synthesis of optogenetic tools in plant systems not only advances fundamental research but also holds potential for agricultural innovations, such as improving crop resilience and productivity in response to climate change.", "label": 1}
