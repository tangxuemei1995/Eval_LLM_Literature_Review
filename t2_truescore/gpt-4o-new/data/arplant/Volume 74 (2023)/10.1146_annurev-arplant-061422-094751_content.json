{"grounding": "Living structures constantly interact with the biotic and abiotic environment by sensing and responding via specialized functional parts. In other words, biological bodies embody highly functional machines and actuators. What are the signatures of engineering mechanisms in biology? In this review, we connect the dots in the literature to seek engineering principles in plant structures. We identify three thematic motifs\u2014bilayer actuator, slender-bodied functional surface, and self-similarity\u2014and provide an overview of their structure\u2013function relationships. Unlike human-engineered machines and actuators, biological counterparts may appear suboptimal in design, loosely complying with physical theories or engineering principles. We postulate what factors may influence the evolution of functional morphology and anatomy to dissect and comprehend better the why behind the biological forms.", "generated_text": "This study explores the engineering principles underlying plant forms and functions, emphasizing the biomechanics of plant structures. By examining the structure\u2013function relationship, we identify how plants utilize bilayer and slender body designs to optimize their growth and survival. The concept of self-similarity is highlighted as a key factor in the efficient scaling of plant structures, allowing for adaptability and resilience. Through a detailed analysis of biological design, we reveal how plants achieve mechanical stability and functional efficiency. This research provides insights into the intricate balance between form and function in plant biology, offering potential applications in biomimetic engineering and sustainable design practices. Our findings underscore the sophistication of natural engineering in plant systems.", "label": 1}
