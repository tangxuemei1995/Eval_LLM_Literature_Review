{"grounding": "There is intense interest in using genome editing technologies to domesticate wild plants, or accelerate the improvement of weakly domesticated crops, in de novo domestication. Here, we discuss promising genetic strategies, with a focus on plant development. Importantly, genome editing releases us from dependence on random mutagenesis or intraspecific diversity, allowing us to draw solutions more broadly from diversity. However, sparse understanding of the complex genetics of diversity limits innovation. Beyond genetics, we urge the ethical use of indigenous knowledge, indigenous plants, and ethnobotany. De novo domestication still requires conventional breeding by phenotypic selection, especially in the development of crops for diverse environments and cultures. Indeed, uniting genome editing with selective breeding could facilitate faster and better outcomes than either technology alone. Domestication is complex and incompletely understood, involving changes to many aspects of plant biology and human culture. Success in de novo domestication requires careful attention to history and collaboration across traditional boundaries.", "generated_text": "De novo domestication, facilitated by advances in genome editing technologies, offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance crop resilience and productivity in the face of climate change. This approach allows for the targeted modification of wild plant species, harnessing desirable traits such as drought tolerance and disease resistance, while maintaining genetic diversity. By integrating insights from plant developmental genetics and ethnobotany, researchers can identify and manipulate key genetic pathways to accelerate the domestication process. However, the power of genome editing also presents significant ethical and ecological challenges. Potential risks include unintended consequences on ecosystems and the erosion of traditional agricultural practices. This paper explores the dual nature of de novo domestication, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers both the scientific potential and the socio-cultural implications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and robust regulatory frameworks, the benefits of genome editing can be maximized while minimizing its perils, ensuring sustainable agricultural development.", "label": 1}
