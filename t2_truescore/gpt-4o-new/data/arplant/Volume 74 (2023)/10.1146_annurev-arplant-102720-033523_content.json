{"grounding": "The plant hormone auxin is certainly the most studied developmental regulator in plants. The many functions of auxin during development, from the embryo to the root and shoot construction, are mediated by an ever-growing collection of molecular regulators, with an overwhelming degree of both ubiquity and complexity that we are still far from fully understanding and that biological experiments alone cannot grasp. In this review, we discuss how bioinformatics and computational modeling approaches have helped in recent years to explore this complexity and to push the frontiers of our understanding of auxin biology. We focus on how analysis of massive amounts of genomic data and construction of computational models to simulate auxin-regulated processes at different scales have complemented wet experiments to increase the understanding of how auxin acts in the nucleus to regulate transcription and how auxin movement between cells regulates development at the tissular scale.", "generated_text": "Auxin, a pivotal plant hormone, orchestrates a myriad of developmental processes and evolutionary adaptations through its complex signaling pathways and polar transport mechanisms. This study delves into the intricate auxin matrix by leveraging advanced bioinformatics and computational modeling techniques. By integrating data from diverse biological systems, we aim to unravel the multifaceted roles of auxin in plant development and evolution. Our approach employs synthetic biology to simulate auxin dynamics, providing novel insights into its regulatory networks. Through computational analysis, we identify key components and interactions within auxin signaling pathways, offering a comprehensive understanding of its biological functions. This research not only enhances our knowledge of auxin biology but also paves the way for innovative applications in agriculture and biotechnology. By decoding the auxin matrix, we contribute to the development of strategies for crop improvement and sustainable agricultural practices.", "label": 1}
