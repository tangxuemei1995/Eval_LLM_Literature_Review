{"grounding": "Parasitic plants use a special organ, the haustorium, to attach to and penetrate host tissues, forming phloem and/or xylem fusion with the host vascular systems. Across this haustorium\u2013host interface, not only water and nutrients are extracted from the host by the parasitic plant, but also secondary metabolites, messenger RNAs, noncoding RNAs, proteins, and systemic signals are transported between the parasite and host and even among different hosts connected by a parasite. Furthermore, mycorrhizal fungi can form common mycelial networks (CMNs) that simultaneously interconnect multiple plants. Increasing lines of evidence suggest that CMNs can function as conduits, transferring stress-related systemic signals between plants. Between-plant signaling mediated by haustoria and CMNs likely has a profound impact on plant interactions with other organisms and adaptation to environmental factors. Here, we summarize the findings regarding between-plant transfer of biomolecules and systemic signals and the current understanding of the physiological and ecological implications of between-plant signaling.", "generated_text": "Between-plant signaling is a complex and dynamic process facilitated by various biotic interactions, including those mediated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and common mycelial networks (CMNs). These networks enable interplant signaling, allowing plants to communicate and share resources, enhancing their resilience to environmental stresses. AMF and CMNs play a crucial role in systemic signaling, where signals are transmitted across plant communities, influencing growth, defense mechanisms, and nutrient acquisition. Additionally, parasitic plants exploit these networks to siphon resources from host plants, demonstrating the dual nature of interplant signaling as both beneficial and detrimental. This review synthesizes current research on the mechanisms and ecological implications of between-plant signaling, highlighting the importance of these interactions in maintaining ecosystem stability and biodiversity. Understanding these processes offers insights into sustainable agricultural practices and the development of strategies to mitigate the impacts of parasitic plants on crop productivity.", "label": 1}
