{"grounding": "The transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play a pivotal role in bone development and skeletal health. More than 30 different types of skeletal dysplasia are now known to be caused by pathogenic variants in genes that belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and/or regulate TGF-\u03b2/BMP bioavailability. This review describes the latest advances in skeletal dysplasia that is due to impaired TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling and results in short stature (acromelic dysplasia and cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome) or tall stature (Marfan syndrome). We thoroughly describe the clinical features of the patients, the underlying genetic findings, and the pathomolecular mechanisms leading to disease, which have been investigated mainly using patient-derived skin fibroblasts and mouse models. Although no pharmacological treatment is yet available for skeletal dysplasia due to impaired TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling, in recent years advances in the use of drugs targeting TGF-\u03b2 have been made, and we also discuss these advances.", "generated_text": "Skeletal dysplasia encompasses a diverse group of disorders characterized by abnormalities in bone and cartilage growth, often resulting in short or tall stature. Central to the pathogenesis of these conditions are the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathways, which play crucial roles in skeletal development and homeostasis. This review synthesizes current research on the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-\u03b2 and BMP pathways contribute to skeletal dysplasia. We explore how dysregulation of these pathways can lead to aberrant bone growth, highlighting specific genetic mutations and their phenotypic manifestations. Furthermore, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways, aiming to correct or mitigate the growth abnormalities associated with skeletal dysplasia. Understanding the intricate balance of TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling is essential for developing effective treatments for patients with stature-related skeletal dysplasias, offering hope for improved clinical outcomes.", "label": 1}
