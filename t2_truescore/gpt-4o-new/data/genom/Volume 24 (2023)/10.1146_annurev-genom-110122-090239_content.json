{"grounding": "In meiosis, homologous chromosome synapsis is mediated by a supramolecular protein structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), that assembles between homologous chromosome axes. The mammalian SC comprises at least eight largely coiled-coil proteins that interact and self-assemble to generate a long, zipper-like structure that holds homologous chromosomes in close proximity and promotes the formation of genetic crossovers and accurate meiotic chromosome segregation. In recent years, numerous mutations in human SC genes have been associated with different types of male and female infertility. Here, we integrate structural information on the human SC with mouse and human genetics to describe the molecular mechanisms by which SC mutations can result in human infertility. We outline certain themes in which different SC proteins are susceptible to different types of disease mutation and how genetic variants with seemingly minor effects on SC proteins may act as dominant-negative mutations in which the heterozygous state is pathogenic.", "generated_text": "The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a critical proteinaceous structure that facilitates homologous chromosome pairing and recombination during meiosis, a process essential for gametogenesis. Disruptions in the formation or function of the SC can lead to meiotic errors, resulting in infertility-related conditions such as azoospermia, primary ovarian failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss. This review synthesizes current research on the molecular architecture of the SC and its role in ensuring accurate chromosomal segregation. We explore genetic mutations and environmental factors that compromise SC integrity, leading to meiotic arrest or aneuploidy. Furthermore, we discuss recent advances in diagnostic techniques and potential therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring fertility in affected individuals. Understanding the intricate dynamics of the SC not only provides insights into the etiology of infertility but also opens avenues for novel fertility treatments. This research underscores the importance of the SC in reproductive health and its implications for clinical practice.", "label": 1}
