{"grounding": "Genome sequencing is increasingly used in research and integrated into clinical care. In the research domain, large-scale analyses, including whole genome sequencing with variant interpretation and curation, virtually guarantee identification of variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic and actionable. Multiple guidelines recommend that findings associated with actionable conditions be offered to research participants in order to demonstrate respect for autonomy, reciprocity, and participant interests in health and privacy. Some recommendations go further and support offering a wider range of findings, including those that are not immediately actionable. In addition, entities covered by the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be required to provide a participant's raw genomic data on request. Despite these widely endorsed guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. This article analyzes the ethical and legal foundations for researcher duties to offer adult participants their interpreted results and raw data as the new normal in genomic research.", "generated_text": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized genomic research, offering unprecedented insights into human health and disease. However, the return of results (RoR) from such studies, particularly secondary and incidental findings, presents complex ethical, legal, and practical challenges. This paper explores the evolving landscape of RoR in genomic research, emphasizing the need for a new normal that balances scientific advancement with participant rights and expectations. We examine current practices and policies, highlighting the variability in RoR approaches across different research contexts. The discussion includes the ethical implications of disclosing or withholding findings, the role of informed consent, and the impact of technological advancements on RoR processes. We propose a framework for RoR that incorporates stakeholder engagement, transparency, and adaptability to emerging genomic technologies. By addressing these challenges, the research community can enhance the ethical conduct of genomic studies and ensure that participants benefit from the knowledge generated by WGS.", "label": 1}
