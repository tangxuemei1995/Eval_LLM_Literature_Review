{"grounding": "The subcellular localization of a biopolymer often informs its function. RNA is traditionally confined to the cytosolic and nuclear spaces, where it plays critical and conserved roles across nearly all biochemical processes. Our recent observation of cell surface glycoRNAs may further explain the extracellular role of RNA. While cellular membranes are efficient gatekeepers of charged polymers such as RNAs, a large body of research has demonstrated the accumulation of specific RNA species outside of the cell, termed extracellular RNAs (exRNAs). Across various species and forms of life, protein pores have evolved to transport RNA across membranes, thus providing a mechanistic path for exRNAs to achieve their extracellular topology. Here, we review types of exRNAs and the pores capable of RNA transport to provide a logical and testable path toward understanding the biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs.", "generated_text": "The study of RNA crossing cellular membranes has unveiled complex systems and mechanisms that facilitate the trafficking of extracellular RNA (exRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs. This research explores the dynamic processes by which RNA molecules are transported across cellular barriers, emphasizing the role of glycoRNAs\u2014RNAs modified with glycans\u2014on cell surfaces. These glycoRNAs are implicated in cell communication and signaling, suggesting a sophisticated layer of regulatory control. The mechanisms of RNA trafficking involve various cellular machineries, including vesicular transport and membrane-bound receptors, which ensure the precise delivery and function of RNA molecules in extracellular environments. Understanding these processes provides insights into the physiological and pathological roles of exRNA and glycoRNAs, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies targeting RNA-based communication pathways. This review synthesizes current knowledge, highlighting the significance of RNA membrane crossing in cellular function and intercellular communication.", "label": 1}
