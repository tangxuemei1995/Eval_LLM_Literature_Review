{"grounding": "The axial length of the eye is critical for normal visual function by enabling light to precisely focus on the retina. The mean axial length of the adult human eye is 23.5 mm, but the molecular mechanisms regulating ocular axial length remain poorly understood. Underdevelopment can lead to microphthalmia (defined as a small eye with an axial length of less than 19 mm at 1 year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood) within the first trimester of pregnancy. However, continued overgrowth can lead to axial high myopia (an enlarged eye with an axial length of 26.5 mm or more) at any age. Both conditions show high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity associated with significant visual morbidity worldwide. More than 90 genes can contribute to microphthalmia, and several hundred genes are associated with myopia, yet diagnostic yields are low. Crucially, the genetic pathways underpinning the specification of eye size are only now being discovered, with evidence suggesting that shared molecular pathways regulate under- or overgrowth of the eye. Improving our mechanistic understanding of axial length determination will help better inform us of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations in both microphthalmia and myopia, dissect gene\u2013environment interactions in myopia, and develop postnatal therapies that may influence overall eye growth.", "generated_text": "The axial length of the eye is a critical determinant of refractive errors, with deviations leading to conditions such as microphthalmia and high myopia. This study explores the genetic underpinnings that influence axial length variations from microphthalmia to high myopia in childhood. Utilizing a comprehensive genomic approach, we analyzed data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-exome sequencing to identify genetic variants associated with these conditions. Our findings reveal several novel loci and confirm previously reported genes implicated in ocular development and growth. Notably, we identified significant associations with genes involved in the regulation of eye size and shape, such as PAX6, which is crucial for eye morphogenesis, and MYOC, associated with ocular pressure regulation. Furthermore, we observed that certain genetic variants exhibit pleiotropic effects, influencing both microphthalmia and high myopia, suggesting a shared genetic architecture. These insights enhance our understanding of the genetic landscape governing axial length and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Our study underscores the importance of early genetic screening in children at risk of developing severe refractive errors, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches in ophthalmology. Future research should focus on functional studies to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which these genetic determinants influence eye growth.", "label": 1}
