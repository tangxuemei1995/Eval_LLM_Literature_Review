{"grounding": "Genetic data contain a record of our evolutionary history. The availability of large-scale datasets of human populations from various geographic areas and timescales, coupled with advances in the computational methods to analyze these data, has transformed our ability to use genetic data to learn about our evolutionary past. Here, we review some of the widely used statistical methods to explore and characterize population relationships and history using genomic data. We describe the intuition behind commonly used approaches, their interpretation, and important limitations. For illustration, we apply some of these techniques to genome-wide autosomal data from 929 individuals representing 53 worldwide populations that are part of the Human Genome Diversity Project. Finally, we discuss the new frontiers in genomic methods to learn about population history. In sum, this review highlights the power (and limitations) of DNA to infer features of human evolutionary history, complementing the knowledge gleaned from other disciplines, such as archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics.", "generated_text": "The advent of genomic data has revolutionized the study of population relationships and history, providing unprecedented insights into demographic inference, admixture, and ancestry. This paper reviews contemporary methods for analyzing genomic data to assess population dynamics, focusing on the estimation of effective population size and the detection of historical admixture events. We explore the application of molecular clocks in dating population divergences and migrations, highlighting the integration of genomic data with computational models to reconstruct complex demographic histories. Key methodologies include coalescent theory, principal component analysis, and admixture mapping, each offering unique advantages in resolving population structure and historical relationships. The paper also discusses challenges such as the impact of selection, gene flow, and recombination on demographic inference. By synthesizing recent advancements, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for researchers to effectively utilize genomic data in understanding the intricate tapestry of human and non-human population histories.", "label": 1}
