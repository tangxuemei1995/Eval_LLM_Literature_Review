{"grounding": "DECIPHER (Database of Genomic Variation and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources) shares candidate diagnostic variants and phenotypic data from patients with genetic disorders to facilitate research and improve the diagnosis, management, and therapy of rare diseases. The platform sits at the boundary between genomic research and the clinical community. DECIPHER aims to ensure that the most up-to-date data are made rapidly available within its interpretation interfaces to improve clinical care. Newly integrated cardiac case\u2013control data that provide evidence of gene\u2013disease associations and inform variant interpretation exemplify this mission. New research resources are presented in a format optimized for use by a broad range of professionals supporting the delivery of genomic medicine. The interfaces within DECIPHER integrate and contextualize variant and phenotypic data, helping to determine a robust clinico-molecular diagnosis for rare-disease patients, which combines both variant classification and clinical fit. DECIPHER supports discovery research, connecting individuals within the rare-disease community to pursue hypothesis-driven research.", "generated_text": "The DECIPHER project aims to enhance genetic diagnosis by dynamically integrating genomic and clinical data, addressing the challenges of diagnosing rare diseases and genetic disorders. This study explores the potential of combining genotype and phenotype information to improve the accuracy of variant interpretation and establish robust genotype\u2013phenotype correlations. By leveraging a comprehensive database of genomic variants and associated clinical features, DECIPHER facilitates the identification of pathogenic variants and their clinical significance. The integration of diverse data sources allows for a more nuanced understanding of genetic disorders, enabling personalized diagnostic approaches. Our findings demonstrate that this dynamic integration significantly improves diagnostic yield, particularly in cases with complex phenotypic presentations. Furthermore, the project underscores the importance of collaborative data sharing and the development of standardized protocols for variant interpretation. DECIPHER represents a pivotal step towards precision medicine, offering new insights into the genetic underpinnings of rare diseases and enhancing the overall efficacy of genetic diagnosis.", "label": 1}
