{"grounding": "Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis across many individuals at single-cell resolution. Compared with bulk RNA sequencing, which averages gene expression across cell types and cell states, single-cell assays capture the transcriptional states of individual cells, including fine-grained, transient, and difficult-to-isolate populations at unprecedented scale and resolution. Single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) mapping can identify context-dependent eQTLs that vary with cell states, including some that colocalize with disease variants identified in genome-wide association studies. By uncovering the precise contexts in which these eQTLs act, single-cell approaches can unveil previously hidden regulatory effects and pinpoint important cell states underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. Here, we present an overview of recently deployed experimental designs in sc-eQTL studies. In the process, we consider the influence of study design choices such as cohort, cell states, and ex vivo perturbations. We then discuss current methodologies, modeling approaches, and technical challenges as well as future opportunities and applications.", "generated_text": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to unravel the complexities of gene regulation at the cellular level. By integrating single-cell sequencing technologies with eQTL mapping, researchers can now explore how genetic variants influence gene expression in specific cell types and states. This method provides unprecedented insights into the role of noncoding variants in modulating gene expression, which are often overlooked in bulk tissue analyses. The ability to dissect the heterogeneity of cell populations allows for a more precise understanding of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits and diseases. Recent advancements in computational tools and statistical models have further enhanced the resolution and accuracy of sc-eQTL studies, enabling the identification of cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms. This review highlights the methodological innovations in sc-eQTL mapping and discusses the implications of these findings for understanding gene regulation and the potential for personalized medicine applications.", "label": 1}
