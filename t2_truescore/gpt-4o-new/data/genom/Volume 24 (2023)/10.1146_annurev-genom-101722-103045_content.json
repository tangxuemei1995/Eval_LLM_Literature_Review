{"grounding": "DNA sequencing has revolutionized medicine over recent decades. However, analysis of large structural variation and repetitive DNA, a hallmark of human genomes, has been limited by short-read technology, with read lengths of 100\u2013300 bp. Long-read sequencing (LRS) permits routine sequencing of human DNA fragments tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in size, using both real-time sequencing by synthesis and nanopore-based direct electronic sequencing. LRS permits analysis of large structural variation and haplotypic phasing in human genomes and has enabled the discovery and characterization of rare pathogenic structural variants and repeat expansions. It has also recently enabled the assembly of a complete, gapless human genome that includes previously intractable regions, such as highly repetitive centromeres and homologous acrocentric short arms. With the addition of protocols for targeted enrichment, direct epigenetic DNA modification detection, and long-range chromatin profiling, LRS promises to launch a new era of understanding of genetic diversity and pathogenic mutations in human populations.", "generated_text": "Long-read DNA sequencing has emerged as a transformative technology in genomics, offering unprecedented insights into complex genomic regions. Recent advances have significantly improved the accuracy and throughput of long-read platforms, enabling more comprehensive detection of structural variants and repetitive DNA sequences that are often missed by short-read technologies. This has profound implications for understanding genomic architecture and its role in disease, particularly in identifying pathogenic mutations that contribute to genetic disorders. Additionally, long-read sequencing facilitates the study of epigenetic modifications, providing a more complete picture of gene regulation and expression. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including high error rates, cost, and the need for extensive computational resources for data analysis. Ongoing research is focused on overcoming these hurdles to fully realize the potential of long-read sequencing in clinical and research settings. This review highlights the recent technological improvements, applications, and the remaining challenges that need to be addressed to enhance the utility of long-read sequencing in genomics.", "label": 1}
