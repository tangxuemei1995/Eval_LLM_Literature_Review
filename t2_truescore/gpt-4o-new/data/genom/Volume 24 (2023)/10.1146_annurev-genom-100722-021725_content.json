{"grounding": "This article reviews evolving legal implications for clinicians and researchers as genomics is used more widely in both the clinic and in translational research, reflecting rapid changes in scientific knowledge as well as the surrounding cultural and political environment. Professionals will face new and changing duties to make or act upon a genetic diagnosis, address direct-to-consumer genetic testing in patient care, consider the health implications of results for patients\u2019 family members, and recontact patients when test results change over time. Professional duties in reproductive genetic testing will need to be recalibrated in response to disruptive changes to reproductive rights in the United States. We also review the debate over who controls the flow of genetic information and who is responsible for its protection, considering the globally influential European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the rapidly evolving data privacy law landscape of the United States.", "generated_text": "The rapid advancements in genomics have revolutionized personalized medicine, yet they also present significant legal challenges. This paper explores the evolving landscape of liability and legal responsibilities in genomics, focusing on the duty to warn and data privacy concerns. As genomic data becomes increasingly integral to healthcare, the potential for liability arises from misinterpretation, unauthorized access, and failure to communicate genetic risks. The duty to warn, traditionally applied in clinical settings, now extends to genetic information, necessitating clear guidelines to balance patient confidentiality with the obligation to inform at-risk individuals. Additionally, the protection of genomic data privacy is paramount, given its sensitive nature and potential misuse. This study examines current legal frameworks and proposes strategies for healthcare providers and researchers to navigate these legal land mines, ensuring ethical and legal compliance while fostering innovation in genomics. The findings underscore the need for updated policies that address these emerging challenges.", "label": 0}
