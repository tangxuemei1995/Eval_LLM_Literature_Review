{"grounding": "Elucidating spatiotemporal changes in gene expression has been an essential goal in studies of health, development, and disease. In the emerging field of spatially resolved transcriptomics, gene expression profiles are acquired with the tissue architecture maintained, sometimes at cellular resolution. This has allowed for the development of spatial cell atlases, studies of cell\u2013cell interactions, and in situ cell typing. In this review, we focus on padlock probe\u2013based in situ sequencing, which is a targeted spatially resolved transcriptomic method. We summarize recent methodological and computational tool developments and discuss key applications. We also discuss compatibility with other methods and integration with multiomic platforms for future applications.", "generated_text": "Padlock probe\u2013based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) is a powerful technique for spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT), enabling the precise localization of RNA molecules within tissue sections. This method employs padlock probes and rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve high sensitivity and specificity in detecting target transcripts. ISS facilitates the construction of spatial cell atlases and in situ cell typing, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and tissue architecture. Recent advancements in ISS methodologies have expanded its applications in various biological and clinical research fields, offering a robust tool for understanding complex tissue environments and disease mechanisms at the molecular level.", "label": 1}
