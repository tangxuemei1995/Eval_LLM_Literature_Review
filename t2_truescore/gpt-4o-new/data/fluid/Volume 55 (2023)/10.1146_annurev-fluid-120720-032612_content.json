{"grounding": "A rotating detonation engine (RDE) is a realization of pressure-gain combustion, wherein a traveling detonation wave confined in a chamber provides shock-based compression along with chemical heat release. Due to the high wave speeds, such devices can process high mass flow rates in small volumes, leading to compact and unconventional designs. RDEs involve unsteady and multiscale physics, and their operational characteristics are determined by an equilibrium between large- and small-scale processes. While RDEs can provide a significant theoretical gain in efficiency, achieving this improvement requires an understanding of the multiscale coupling. Specifically, unavoidable nonidealities, such as unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and multiple competing waves associated with practical designs, need to be understood and managed. The secondary combustion processes arise from fuel/air injection and unsteady and incomplete mixing, and can create spurious losses. In addition, a combination of multiple detonation and secondary waves compete and define the dynamical behavior of mixing, heat release distribution, and the overall mode of operation of the device. This review discusses the current understanding of such nonidealities and describes the tools and techniques used to gain insight into the extreme unsteady environment in such combustors.", "generated_text": "Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) represent a promising advancement in propulsion technology due to their potential for pressure gain combustion, which can enhance efficiency compared to traditional engines. However, the practical implementation of RDEs is challenged by several nonidealities that affect their performance. This study investigates the impact of unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and deflagration loss on the operation of RDEs. The presence of multiple competing detonation waves and secondary waves can lead to complex flow dynamics, which are not fully understood. These phenomena can result in reduced efficiency and stability, as well as increased thermal and mechanical stresses on engine components. Through a combination of experimental observations and computational simulations, this research aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which these nonidealities influence the detonation wave structure and propagation. The findings suggest that optimizing the fuel-air mixing process and controlling the initiation and interaction of detonation waves are crucial for minimizing deflagration losses and enhancing overall engine performance. This work contributes to the development of more robust and efficient RDE designs, paving the way for their integration into future aerospace applications.", "label": 1}
