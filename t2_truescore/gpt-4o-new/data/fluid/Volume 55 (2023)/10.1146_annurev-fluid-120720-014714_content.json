{"grounding": "A common feature of many free surface flows\u2014drop/bubble breakup or coalescence and film/sheet rupture\u2014is the occurrence of hydrodynamic singularities. Accurately computing such flows with continuum mechanical, multidimensional free surface flow algorithms is a challenging task given these problems\u2019 multiscale nature, which necessitates capturing dynamics occurring over disparate length scales across 5\u20136 orders of magnitude. In drop breakup, the thinning of fluid threads that form and eventually pinch-off must be simulated until the thread's radius is about 10 nm. When two drops approach one another, the thickness of the fluid film separating them must fall below 10 nm before coalescence is said to have occurred. If the initial drop radii are 1 mm, simulations must remain faithful to the physics as thread radius or film thickness falls from 10\u22123 m to below 10\u22128 m. Here we review significant findings in interfacial flows with hydrodynamic singularities spearheaded by sharp interface algorithms. These multidimensional algorithms can achieve resolution that to date has only been possible with the use of simple 1D evolution equations.", "generated_text": "The study of free surface flows, particularly those involving singularities such as breakup and coalescence, is crucial for advancing technologies in inkjet printing, microfluidics, and spray systems. This research focuses on the development and application of sharp interface methods to simulate and analyze these complex phenomena. By employing finite element techniques, we accurately capture the dynamics of drops, jets, and filaments as they undergo critical transitions like pinch-off and merging. The sharp interface approach allows for precise tracking of the evolving interfaces, providing insights into the underlying physics of singularity formation and resolution. Our simulations reveal the intricate interplay between fluid properties and geometric constraints, offering predictive capabilities for optimizing industrial processes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of sharp interface methods in handling the challenges posed by free surface flows with singularities, paving the way for improved design and control in applications ranging from inkjet printing to advanced microfluidic devices.
