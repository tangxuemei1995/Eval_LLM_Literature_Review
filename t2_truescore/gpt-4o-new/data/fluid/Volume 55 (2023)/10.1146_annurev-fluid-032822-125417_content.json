{"grounding": "Gas-liquid foams are important in applications ranging from oil recovery and mineral flotation to food science and microfluidics. Beyond their practical use, they represent an intriguing prototype of a soft material with a complex, viscoelastic rheological response. Crucially, foams allow detailed access to fluid-dynamical processes on the mesoscale of bubbles underlying the large-scale material behavior. This review emphasizes the importance of the geometry and interaction of mesoscale structural elements for the description of the dynamics of entire foams. Using examples including bulk flow of foam under steady shear, interfacial instabilities, and foam fracture through bubble rupture, this article highlights the wide variety of available theoretical descriptions, ranging from network modeling approaches coupling structural element equations of motion to full continuum models with elastoviscoplastic constitutive relations. Foams offer the opportunity to develop rigorous links between such disparate descriptions, providing a blueprint for physical modeling of dynamical multiscale systems with complex structure.", "generated_text": "Gas-liquid foams are complex soft matter systems characterized by intricate interfacial mechanics and rheological behavior. This study delves into the dynamics of foams, bridging the gap between their structural elements and continuum descriptions. By examining the interplay between thin films and the surrounding fluid matrix, we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing foam stability and flow. Advanced experimental techniques and computational models are employed to capture the microstructural evolution and its impact on macroscopic properties. The research highlights the role of interfacial forces and film drainage in dictating foam rheology, offering insights into the design of materials with tailored properties. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of foam dynamics, with implications for various industrial applications, including food processing, cosmetics, and enhanced oil recovery. This work paves the way for future studies aimed at optimizing foam formulations and improving their performance in diverse environments.", "label": 1}
