{"grounding": "Particles floating at interfaces are commonly observed in nature, as well as in industrial processes. When the particles are non-Brownian particles, large deformations of the interface are created that induce long-ranged capillary interactions and lead to the formation of particle rafts with unique characteristics. In this review we discuss recent efforts in investigating particle raft formation and the role of the rafts\u2019 own weight during dynamic clustering. Under specific conditions, these rafts can ultimately collapse and sink. When subjected to external or internal forces, the raft undergoes large deformations that test the mechanical characteristics of this interfacial composite material. It can behave as a continuous elastic sheet under compression, although its discrete nature can also trigger its fragmentation via interparticle interactions. Finally, armored droplets, drops covered by a protective shell of particles, can lose their integrity when submitted to dynamic deformations, resulting in the ejection of particles or the fracturing of the armor. Open questions to understand the properties of this material are highlighted and future research to understand the fundamental physics of particle rafts, the customization of the cluster formation, or the disassembly of this collective material is suggested.", "generated_text": "Particle rafts and armored droplets represent fascinating systems in the study of particle-laden interfaces, where particles self-assemble at fluid boundaries, leading to unique mechanical and structural properties. This research explores the interplay between buoyancy, capillarity, and elasticity in these systems, providing insights into their interfacial rheology. The self-assembly of particles at interfaces is driven by capillary forces, which can lead to the formation of stable structures with enhanced mechanical properties. These structures exhibit a range of behaviors, from fluid-like to solid-like, depending on particle concentration and interfacial tension. The study investigates how buoyancy influences the stability and morphology of particle rafts and armored droplets, revealing the critical role of particle size and density. Additionally, the research examines the elastic properties of these interfaces, highlighting their potential applications in materials science and engineering. By understanding the fundamental principles governing particle-laden interfaces, this work contributes to the development of novel materials with tailored properties. The findings have implications for various fields, including drug delivery, food science, and the design of advanced coatings, where control over interfacial properties is crucial. This study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in unraveling the complexities of particle-laden systems.", "label": 1}
