{"grounding": "Since the seminal studies by Osborne Reynolds in the nineteenth century, pipe flow has served as a primary prototype for investigating the transition to turbulence in wall-bounded flows. Despite the apparent simplicity of this flow, various facets of this problem have occupied researchers for more than a century. Here we review insights from three distinct perspectives: (a) stability and susceptibility of laminar flow, (b) phase transition and spatiotemporal dynamics, and (c) dynamical systems analysis of the Navier\u2014Stokes equations. We show how these perspectives have led to a profound understanding of the onset of turbulence in pipe flow. Outstanding open points, applications to flows of complex fluids, and similarities with other wall-bounded flows are discussed.", "generated_text": "The transition to turbulence in pipe flow is a complex phenomenon characterized by the interplay of transient growth, turbulent puffs, and slugs. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying the onset of turbulence in shear flows, focusing on the role of transient chaos and intermittency. Through experimental and computational analyses, we explore how localized disturbances evolve into turbulent structures, highlighting the significance of transient growth in amplifying perturbations. The transition is further examined through the lens of directed percolation, providing insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of turbulent puffs and slugs. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the critical thresholds and pathways leading to sustained turbulence in pipe flow systems.", "label": 0}
