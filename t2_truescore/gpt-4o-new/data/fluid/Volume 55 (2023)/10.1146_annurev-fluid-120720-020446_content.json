{"grounding": "Rotation with thermally induced buoyancy governs many astrophysical and geophysical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, sun, and Earth's liquid-metal outer core. Rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection (RRBC) is an experimental system that has features of rotation and buoyancy, where a container of height H and temperature difference \u0394 between its bottom and top is rotated about its vertical axis with angular velocity \u03a9. The strength of buoyancy is reflected in the Rayleigh number (\u223cH\n3\u0394) and that of the Coriolis force in the Ekman and Rossby numbers (\u223c\u03a9\u22121). Rotation suppresses the convective onset, introduces instabilities, changes the velocity boundary layers, modifies the shape of thermal structures from plumes to vortical columns, affects the large-scale circulation, and can decrease or enhance global heat transport depending on buoyant and Coriolis forcing. RRBC is an extremely rich system, with features directly comparable to geophysical and astrophysical phenomena. Here we review RRBC studies, suggest a unifying heat transport scaling approach for the transition between rotation-dominated and buoyancy-dominated regimes in RRBC, and discuss non-Oberbeck\u2013Boussinesq and centrifugal effects.", "generated_text": "Turbulent rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection is a complex fluid dynamic phenomenon characterized by the interplay of buoyancy-driven flow and rotational effects. This study investigates the intricate dynamics of this system, focusing on the impact of rotation on heat transport and flow structures. Utilizing a combination of theoretical analysis, direct numerical simulations, and experimental measurements, we explore the parameter space defined by the Rayleigh and Rossby numbers. Our findings reveal that rotation significantly alters the heat transport efficiency and modifies the flow topology, leading to the formation of coherent structures such as vortices and plumes. The results demonstrate a non-monotonic dependence of the Nusselt number on the rotation rate, highlighting the competition between buoyancy and Coriolis forces. Theoretical models are developed to predict the observed trends, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the flow. This research advances our understanding of geophysical and astrophysical flows, where similar conditions prevail, and contributes to the broader field of turbulent convection by elucidating the role of rotation in modulating convective heat transfer.", "label": 1}
