{"grounding": "Density stratification due to temperature or salinity variations greatly influences the flow around and the sedimentation of objects such as particles, drops, bubbles, and small organisms in the atmosphere, oceans, and lakes. Density stratification hampers the vertical flow and substantially affects the sedimentation of an isolated object, the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of objects, and the collective behavior of suspensions in various ways, depending on the relative magnitude of stratification, inertia (advection), and viscous (diffusion) effects. This review discusses these effects and their hydrodynamic mechanisms in some commonly observed fluid\u2013particle transport phenomena in oceans and the atmosphere. Physical understanding of these mechanisms can help us better model these phenomena and, hence, predict their geophysical, engineering, ecological, and environmental implications.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamics of motion in stratified fluids, focusing on the behavior of particles, drops, bubbles, and microorganisms within these complex environments. Stratified flows, characterized by variations in fluid density, significantly influence the movement and distribution of suspended entities. The research examines the interactions between particle-laden flows and pycnoclines, the interfaces where density gradients are most pronounced. By employing advanced modeling techniques and experimental observations, the study elucidates the mechanisms governing the transport and settling of particles and biological entities in stratified systems. The findings have implications for understanding natural phenomena such as oceanic and atmospheric processes, as well as for industrial applications involving fluid mixing and pollutant dispersion. This work contributes to the broader understanding of fluid dynamics in stratified environments.", "label": 1}
