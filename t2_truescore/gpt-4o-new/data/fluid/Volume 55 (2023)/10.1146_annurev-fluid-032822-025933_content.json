{"grounding": "The dissolution of minute concentration of polymers in wall-bounded flows is well-known for its unparalleled ability to reduce turbulent friction drag. Another phenomenon, elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT), has been far less studied even though elastic instabilities have already been observed in dilute polymer solutions before the discovery of polymer drag reduction. EIT is a chaotic state driven by polymer dynamics that is observed across many orders of magnitude in Reynolds number. It involves energy transfer from small elastic scales to large flow scales. The investigation of the mechanisms of EIT offers the possibility to better understand other complex phenomena such as elastic turbulence and maximum drag reduction. In this review, we survey recent research efforts that are advancing the understanding of the dynamics of EIT. We highlight the fundamental differences between EIT and Newtonian/inertial turbulence from the perspective of experiments, numerical simulations, instabilities, and coherent structures. Finally, we discuss the possible links between EIT and elastic turbulence and polymer drag reduction, as well as the remaining challenges in unraveling the self-sustaining mechanism of EIT.", "generated_text": "Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) represents a complex flow regime characterized by the interplay between elastic and inertial forces in viscoelastic fluids. This study delves into the mechanisms underlying EIT, focusing on the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in polymer-laden fluids. By employing advanced numerical simulations and viscoelastic models, we explore the onset of elastic instabilities and their role in the formation of coherent structures within the flow. Our findings reveal that polymer additives, known for their drag-reducing capabilities, significantly alter the flow dynamics, leading to unique transitional behaviors distinct from classical turbulence. The study highlights the critical parameters influencing EIT, such as polymer concentration and flow geometry, and provides insights into the conditions necessary for the emergence of elastic turbulence. These results have profound implications for industrial applications, where understanding and controlling EIT can lead to enhanced efficiency in processes involving viscoelastic fluids. This research contributes to the broader understanding of non-Newtonian fluid dynamics and the development of predictive models for complex flow systems.", "label": 1}
