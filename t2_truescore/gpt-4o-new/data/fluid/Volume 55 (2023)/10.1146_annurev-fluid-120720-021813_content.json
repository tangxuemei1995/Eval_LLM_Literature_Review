{"grounding": "Transitional\u2013turbulent spots bridge the deterministic laminar state with the stochastic turbulent state and affect the transition zone length in engineering flows. Turbulent spot research over the past four decades has expanded from incompressible flat-plate boundary layer and pipe flow to hypersonic boundary layer flow, turbomachinery flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, and a range of more complex flows. Progress has been made on the origination, composition, demarcation, growth, mutual interaction, reproduction, sustainability, and self-organization of turbulent spots. The hypothesis that transitional\u2013turbulent spots are a basic module of the fully turbulent boundary layer has been proven through the discovery of locally generated turbulent\u2013turbulent spots dominating the wall layer. Splitting of transitional\u2013turbulent spots in pipe flow has been linked to a life cycle localized in the spot frontal section. This review discusses these advances and outlines future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the complex dynamics of turbulent spots, which are critical in understanding the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in various fluid systems. By examining turbulent spots across different flow configurations, including boundary layers, pipe flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, turbomachinery flow, and hypersonic flow, we provide new insights into their formation, evolution, and interaction mechanisms. Advanced computational simulations and experimental techniques reveal the influence of flow parameters on spot characteristics and their role in the transition process. Our findings highlight the universality and variability of turbulent spots across different flow regimes, offering potential pathways for controlling transition in engineering applications. This research contributes to the broader understanding of turbulence, with implications for improving efficiency and performance in aerodynamics and fluid machinery.", "label": 1}
