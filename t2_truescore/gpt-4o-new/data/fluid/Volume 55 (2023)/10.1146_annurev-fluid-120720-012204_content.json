{"grounding": "Microscopic active droplets are able to swim autonomously in viscous flows. This puzzling feature stems from solute exchanges with the surrounding fluid via surface reactions or their spontaneous solubilization and from the interfacial flows resulting from these solutes\u2019 gradients. Contrary to asymmetric active colloids, these isotropic droplets swim spontaneously by exploiting the nonlinear coupling of solute transport with self-generated Marangoni flows; such coupling is also responsible for secondary transitions to more complex individual and collective dynamics. Thanks to their simple design and their sensitivity to physico-chemical signals, these droplets are fascinating to physicists, chemists, biologists, and fluid dynamicists alike in analyzing viscous self-propulsion and collective dynamics in active-matter systems, developing synthetic cellular models, or performing targeted biomedical or engineering applications. I review here the most recent and significant developments of this rapidly growing field, focusing on the mathematical and physical modeling of these intriguing droplets, together with their experimental design and characterization.", "generated_text": "The study of self-propulsion in chemically active droplets has garnered significant attention due to its implications for understanding microswimmers and designing synthetic active matter. This research investigates the mechanisms underlying the autonomous motion of active droplets, focusing on the interplay between Marangoni flows and advection\u2013diffusion processes. By employing a combination of experimental observations and theoretical modeling, we explore how chemical reactions at the droplet interface induce symmetry-breaking, leading to sustained propulsion in viscous environments. Our findings reveal that the self-generated concentration gradients drive Marangoni flows, which in turn facilitate droplet movement through a delicate balance of forces. The results highlight the critical role of interfacial tension variations and fluid dynamics in governing the behavior of active droplets. This work not only advances our understanding of natural microswimmers but also provides insights into the design of novel synthetic systems capable of autonomous navigation in complex fluidic landscapes.", "label": 1}
