{"grounding": "Although face masks have been used for over a century to provide protection against airborne pathogens and pollutants, close scrutiny of their effectiveness has peaked in the past two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The simplicity of face masks belies the complexity of the physical phenomena that determine their effectiveness as a defense against airborne infections. This complexity is rooted in the fact that the effectiveness of face masks depends on the combined effects of respiratory aerodynamics, filtration flow physics, droplet dynamics and their interactions with porous materials, structural dynamics, physiology, and even human behavior. At its core, however, the face mask is a flow-handling device, and in the current review, we take a flow physics\u2013centric view of face masks and the key phenomena that underlie their function. We summarize the state of the art in experimental measurements, as well as the growing body of computational studies that have contributed to our understanding of the factors that determine the effectiveness of face masks. The review also lays out some of the important open questions and technical challenges associated with the effectiveness of face masks.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of face masks in mitigating the spread of respiratory infections, particularly those caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study delves into the flow physics associated with face masks, aiming to elucidate their effectiveness in preventing airborne transmission of coronavirus particles. By employing advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental flow visualization techniques, we analyze the interaction between respiratory droplets and various mask materials. Our findings reveal that the filtration efficiency of masks is significantly influenced by factors such as material porosity, fiber arrangement, and mask fit. The study highlights the importance of optimizing these parameters to enhance mask performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of mask usage on airflow patterns and droplet dispersion, providing insights into how masks can reduce the risk of infection in different environmental settings. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the protective mechanisms of face masks, offering valuable guidance for public health policies and the design of more effective personal protective equipment. Ultimately, our work supports the continued use of face masks as a vital tool in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and similar respiratory infections.", "label": 0}
