{"grounding": "Understanding inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid flows requires mathematical and computational tools that are tailored to such flows and distinct from methods used to understand the canonical problem of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. We review some recent developments in the theory of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, placing special emphasis on several kinds of quasi-linear approximations and their corresponding statistical formulations. Aspects of quasi-linear theory that have received insufficient attention in the literature are discussed, and open questions are framed.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in the study of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence have focused on quasi-linear approaches and statistical methods to better understand complex flow dynamics. These developments have provided new insights into the behavior of turbulent flows under varying conditions, highlighting the importance of anisotropy and inhomogeneity in turbulence modeling. By integrating theoretical and computational techniques, researchers have improved predictions of turbulent behavior, offering potential applications in engineering and environmental sciences.", "label": 0}
