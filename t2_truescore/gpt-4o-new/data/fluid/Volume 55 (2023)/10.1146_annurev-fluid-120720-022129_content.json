{"grounding": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) are versatile and efficient computational techniques to solve flow problems in complex geometric configurations that retain the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian structured meshes. Although these methods became known in the 1970s and gained credibility only in the new millennium, they had already been conceived and implemented at the beginning of the 1960s, even if the early computers of those times did not allow researchers to exploit their potential. Nowadays IBMs are established numerical schemes employed for the solution of many complex problems in which fluid mechanics may account for only part of the multiphysics dynamics. Despite the indisputable advantages, these methods also have drawbacks, and each problem should be carefully analyzed before deciding which particular IBM implementation is most suitable and whether additional modeling is necessary. High\u2013Reynolds number flows constitute one of the main limitations of IBMs owing to the resolution of thin wall shear layers, which cannot benefit from anisotropic grid refinement at the boundaries. To alleviate this weakness, researchers have developed IBM-compliant wall models and local grid refinement strategies, although in these cases possible pitfalls must also be considered.", "generated_text": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) have emerged as a pivotal computational tool for simulating complex flows, particularly in scenarios involving fluid-structure interactions and multiphysics problems. This paper provides a comprehensive historical perspective on the development of IBMs, tracing their evolution from early conceptual frameworks to sophisticated algorithms capable of handling intricate boundary conditions and diverse physical phenomena. Initially developed to address the challenges posed by complex geometries in fluid dynamics, IBMs have significantly advanced, incorporating wall models and adaptive mesh refinement techniques to enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. The versatility of IBMs has facilitated their application across various scientific and engineering domains, including biomedical engineering, aerodynamics, and environmental science. As we look to the future, the integration of machine learning and high-performance computing is poised to further revolutionize IBMs, enabling real-time simulations and more accurate predictions of multiphysics interactions. This paper also discusses the current challenges and potential research directions, emphasizing the need for improved numerical stability and the development of robust algorithms to handle increasingly complex systems. Ultimately, IBMs continue to be a dynamic and evolving field, offering promising avenues for future exploration and innovation.", "label": 1}
