{"grounding": "In the past few decades various particle image\u2013based volumetric flow measurement techniques have been developed that have demonstrated their potential in accessing unsteady flow properties quantitatively in various experimental applications in fluid mechanics. In this review, we focus on physical properties and circumstances of 3D particle\u2013based measurements and what knowledge can be used for advancing reconstruction accuracy and spatial and temporal resolution, as well as completeness. The natural candidate for our focus is 3D Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT), which allows for position, velocity, and acceleration to be determined alongside a large number of individual particle tracks in the investigated volume. The advent of the dense 3D LPT technique Shake-The-Box in the past decade has opened further possibilities for characterizing unsteady flows by delivering input data for powerful data assimilation techniques that use Navier\u2013Stokes constraints. As a result, high-resolution Lagrangian and Eulerian data can be obtained, including long particle trajectories embedded in time-resolved 3D velocity and pressure fields.", "generated_text": "The study of fluid mechanics has been significantly advanced by the development of 3D Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) techniques, which provide detailed insights into the dynamics of fluid flows. This paper focuses on the application of 3D particle tracking velocimetry, particularly the iterative particle reconstruction method known as Shake-The-Box, to capture high-resolution velocity fields. By employing one- and multipoint statistics, we analyze the velocity gradient tensor to better understand the underlying flow structures. The integration of these techniques facilitates the reconstruction of 3D pressure fields, offering a comprehensive view of the fluid dynamics. Furthermore, data assimilation methods are utilized to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the reconstructed flow fields. This research not only advances the methodological framework for LPT but also contributes to the broader understanding of complex fluid systems, with implications for both theoretical studies and practical applications in engineering and environmental sciences.", "label": 0}
