{"grounding": "We review the class of materials known as polar metals, in which polarity and metallicity coexist in the same phase. While the notion of polar metals was first invoked more than 50 years ago, their practical realization has proved challenging since the itinerant carriers required for metallicity tend to screen any polarization. Huge progress has been made in the last decade, with many mechanisms for combining polarity and metallicity proposed and the first examples, LiOsO3 and WTe2, identified experimentally. The availability of polar metallic samples has opened a new paradigm in polar metal research, with implications in the fields of topology, ferroelectricity, magnetoelectricity, spintronics, and superconductivity. Here, we review the principles and techniques that have been developed to design and engineer polar metals and describe some of their interesting properties, with a focus on the most promising directions for future work.", "generated_text": "Polar metals, a class of materials that exhibit both metallic conductivity and polar structural distortions, challenge the conventional understanding of ferroelectricity, which typically requires insulating behavior. This study explores the fundamental principles underlying polar metals, focusing on their unique electronic and structural properties. The interplay between polarization and metallicity is examined, with particular attention to the role of improper ferroelectricity in stabilizing polar distortions in metallic systems. Perovskite structures are highlighted as promising candidates for polar metals due to their versatile chemistry and structural flexibility. The potential applications of polar metals in novel electronic devices, such as non-volatile memories and sensors, are discussed, emphasizing their ability to combine functionalities of both metals and ferroelectrics. This review aims to provide insights into the design and synthesis of new polar metal materials, paving the way for future technological advancements.", "label": 1}
