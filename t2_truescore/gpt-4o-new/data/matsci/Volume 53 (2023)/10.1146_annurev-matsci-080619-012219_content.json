{"grounding": "The energy-efficient manipulation of the properties of functional materials is of great interest from both a scientific and an applied perspective. The application of electric fields is one of the most widely used methods to induce significant changes in the properties of materials, such as their structural, transport, magnetic, and optical properties. This article presents an overview of recent research on the manipulation of the electronic and magnetic properties of various material systems via electrolyte-based ionic gating. Oxides, magnetic thin-film heterostructures, and van der Waals 2D layers are discussed as exemplary systems. The detailed mechanisms through which ionic gating can induce significant changes in material properties, including their crystal and electronic structure and their electrical, optical, and magnetic properties, are summarized. Current and potential future functional devices enabled by such ionic control mechanisms are also briefly summarized, especially with respect to the emerging field of neuromorphic computing. Finally, a brief outlook and some key challenges are presented.", "generated_text": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for modulating the electronic and magnetic properties of various materials, including transition metal oxides, magnetic thin films, and van der Waals two-dimensional (2D) materials. By employing an ionic liquid or gel as a gate dielectric, this method allows for the precise control of carrier density and phase transitions, enabling the exploration of novel states of matter such as superconductivity and magnetism. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of ionic gating in tuning the properties of magnetic thin films, leading to significant implications for spintronic applications. Furthermore, the ability to dynamically alter the electronic states in 2D materials opens new avenues for the development of neuromorphic computing devices, where ionic gating can mimic synaptic plasticity.
