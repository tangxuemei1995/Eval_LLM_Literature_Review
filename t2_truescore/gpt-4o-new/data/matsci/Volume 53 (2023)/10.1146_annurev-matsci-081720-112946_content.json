{"grounding": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have found a role in crystal morphology engineering and control by specific binding to crystal surfaces through stereo-chemical recognition. The utility of TMAs, however, has been largely limited to crystal growth from solutions. In this review, we illustrate examples where TMAs have been used to influence the growth of crystals during cooling of their melts. In solution, the crystal growth driving force is governed by solute supersaturation, which corresponds to the deviation from equilibrium. In growth from melts, however, undercooling is the important thermodynamic parameter responsible for crystallization outcomes, a key difference that can influence the manner in which TMAs affect growth kinetics, crystal morphology, nucleation, enantioselective surface recognition, and the determination of the absolute sense of polar axes. When the crystallization driving force in a melt is small and diffusion is comparatively high, TMAs can exert their influence on well-faceted single crystals with the stereochemical richness observed in solution growth. Under high supercooling, where the driving force is large, ensembles of crystals can grow radially, masking stereochemical information and requiring new optical tools for understanding the influence of TMAs on emerging crystals.", "generated_text": "The development of tailor-made additives for melt-grown molecular crystals presents a promising avenue for enhancing the properties and functionalities of crystalline materials. This study explores the rationale behind the use of such additives, focusing on their impact on the crystallization process, particularly in the formation of spherulites and twisted crystals. By manipulating chirality and polarity, tailor-made additives can influence the nucleation and growth kinetics, leading to improved control over crystal morphology and size distribution. The ability to direct the assembly of molecular crystals through specific interactions offers potential applications in optoelectronics, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. However, the complexity of designing effective additives that can consistently yield desired outcomes poses significant challenges. This research critically evaluates the benefits and limitations of employing tailor-made additives, considering factors such as cost, scalability, and the potential for unintended effects on crystal properties. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements and case studies, this paper aims to provide insights into the strategic design of additives that can optimize melt crystallization processes, ultimately contributing to the advancement of material science and engineering.", "label": 1}
