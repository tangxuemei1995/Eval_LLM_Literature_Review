{"grounding": "Soft robotics aims to close the performance gap between built and biological machines through materials design. Soft robots are constructed from soft, actuatable materials to be physically intelligent, or to have traits that living organisms possess such as passive adaptability and morphological computation through their compliant, deformable bodies. However, materials selection for physical intelligence often involves low-performance and/or energy-inefficient, stimuli-responsive materials for actuation. Additional challenges in soft robot sensorization and control further limit the practical utility of these machines. Recognizing that electrically controllable materials are crucial for the development of soft machines that are both physically and computationally intelligent, we review progress in the development of electroprogrammable materials for soft robotic actuation. We focus on thermomechanical, electrostatic, and electrochemical actuation strategies that are directly controlled by electric currents and fields. We conclude with an outlook on the design and fabrication of next-generation robotic materials that will facilitate true bioinspired autonomy.", "generated_text": "The development of electrically controllable materials for soft, bioinspired machines represents a significant advancement in the field of soft robotics. These materials, which function as actuators, are designed to mimic the flexibility and adaptability of biological organisms, offering enhanced performance in robotic applications. This study explores the integration of multifunctional materials that respond to electrical stimuli, enabling precise control over movement and function. By leveraging the unique properties of these materials, such as their ability to undergo significant deformation while maintaining structural integrity, researchers aim to create robotic systems that are not only efficient but also capable of complex, life-like motions. The findings suggest that these innovative materials could lead to the development of more versatile and adaptive robotic systems, with potential applications ranging from medical devices to environmental monitoring. This research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in advancing the capabilities of soft robotics through bioinspired design.", "label": 1}
