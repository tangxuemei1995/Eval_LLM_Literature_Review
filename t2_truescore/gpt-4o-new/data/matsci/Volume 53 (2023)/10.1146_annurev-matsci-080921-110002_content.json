{"grounding": "Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) materials feature an exciting array of functionalities such as nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and topological spin textures (skyrmions). While NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions display two different sets of physical properties, their design strategies are deeply connected in terms of atomic-scale precision, structural customization, and electronic tunability. Despite impressive progress in studying these systems separately, a joint road map for navigating the chemical principles for NCS materials remains elusive. This review unites two subtopics of NCS systems, NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions, offering a multifaceted narrative of how to translate the often-abstract fundamentals to the targeted functionalities while inviting innovative approaches from the community. We outline the design principles central to the desired properties by exemplifying relevant examples in the field. We supplement materials chemistry with pertinent electronic structures to demonstrate the power of the fundamentals to create systems integration relevant to foreseeable societal impacts in frequency-doubling instrumentation and spin-based electronics.", "generated_text": "Noncentrosymmetric materials, characterized by the absence of inversion symmetry, exhibit unique properties that are pivotal for advanced technological applications. This study explores the design principles underlying these materials, focusing on their nonlinear optical responses, magnetism, and the emergence of skyrmions. The lack of centrosymmetry in these materials leads to enhanced second-order nonlinear optical effects, making them ideal candidates for photonic devices. Additionally, the interplay between electronic structure and magnetic properties in noncentrosymmetric systems facilitates the stabilization of skyrmions, which are topologically protected magnetic textures with potential applications in spintronics. The research delves into the electronic structure modifications that promote these phenomena, providing insights into the synthesis and optimization of noncentrosymmetric materials. By understanding the fundamental principles governing their behavior, this work aims to guide the development of materials with tailored properties for specific applications, thereby advancing the fields of optoelectronics and magnetic data storage.", "label": 1}
