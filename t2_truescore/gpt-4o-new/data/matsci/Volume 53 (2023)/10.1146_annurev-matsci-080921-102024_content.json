{"grounding": "Most heterogeneous catalytic processes occur between combinations of gases, liquids, and solids at elevated temperatures. They play a critical role for society in energy production, health care, a cleaner environment, industrial products, food, fuel cells, battery technologies, and photocatalysis. Dynamic gas\u2013solid catalyst reactions take place at the atomic level, with active catalyst structures forming, and often also progressively and competitively deactivating, under reaction conditions. There is increasing evidence that single atoms and small clusters of atoms can act as primary active sites in catalytic reactions. Understanding and directing the reactions at the atomic level under controlled operating conditions are crucial for the development of improved materials and processes. We review advances in dynamic in situ microscopy for directly probing heterogeneous catalysis at the atomic level in live action and real time. Benefits include new knowledge and improved management of process fundamentals for greater efficiency and sustainability.", "generated_text": "Dynamic in situ electron microscopy has emerged as a transformative tool in the study of single-atom catalysis, offering unprecedented insights into the real-time behavior of catalysts at the atomic level. This technique allows researchers to observe the dynamic processes and structural changes that occur during catalytic reactions, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive catalytic activity and selectivity. By capturing live action images and videos, dynamic in situ microscopy enables the visualization of single atoms and their interactions with reactants, facilitating the identification of active sites and the elucidation of reaction pathways. This advancement not only enhances our fundamental understanding of catalysis but also informs the design of more efficient and sustainable catalysts. The integration of this cutting-edge technology into chemical research represents a significant leap forward, promising to accelerate the development of novel catalytic materials and processes.", "label": 0}
