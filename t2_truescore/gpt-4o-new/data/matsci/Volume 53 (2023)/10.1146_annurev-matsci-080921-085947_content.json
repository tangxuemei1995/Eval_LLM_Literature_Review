{"grounding": "High-throughput data generation methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms have given rise to a new era of computational materials science by learning the relations between composition, structure, and properties and by exploiting such relations for design. However, to build these connections, materials data must be translated into a numerical form, called a representation, that can be processed by an ML model. Data sets in materials science vary in format (ranging from images to spectra), size, and fidelity. Predictive models vary in scope and properties of interest. Here, we review context-dependent strategies for constructing representations that enable the use of materials as inputs or outputs for ML models. Furthermore, we discuss how modern ML techniques can learn representations from data and transfer chemical and physical information between tasks. Finally, we outline high-impact questions that have not been fully resolved and thus require further investigation.", "generated_text": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into materials science has the potential to revolutionize the discovery and design of new materials. Central to this integration is the development of effective representations of materials that can be utilized by ML algorithms. This study explores various approaches to feature engineering, focusing on the representation of crystal structures and their properties. We examine traditional descriptor-based methods alongside emerging generative models that automatically learn representations from raw data. By comparing these methodologies, we highlight the strengths and limitations of each in capturing the complex, multi-scale nature of materials. Our findings suggest that generative models, with their ability to uncover latent features, offer a promising avenue for advancing ML applications in materials science. This work underscores the importance of representation in enhancing the predictive power and generalizability of ML models, ultimately accelerating the pace of materials innovation.", "label": 1}
