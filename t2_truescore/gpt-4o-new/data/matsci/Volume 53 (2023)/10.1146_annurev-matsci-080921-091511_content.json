{"grounding": "Grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials migrate to reduce the total excess energy. It has recently been found that the factors governing migration rates of boundaries in bicrystals are insufficient to explain boundary migration in polycrystals. We first review our current understanding of the atomistic mechanisms of grain boundary migration based on simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. We then review our current understanding at the continuum scale based on simulations and observations using high-energy diffraction microscopy. We conclude that detailed comparisons of experimental observations with atomistic simulations of migration in polycrystals (rather than bicrystals) are required to better understand the mechanisms of grain boundary migration, that the driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals must include factors other than curvature, and that current simulations of grain growth are insufficient for reproducing experimental observations, possibly because of an inadequate representation of the driving force.", "generated_text": "Grain boundary migration is a critical phenomenon influencing the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials. This study investigates the mechanisms driving grain boundary migration, focusing on its role in grain growth and the overall stability of microstructures. By employing advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling, we analyze the factors affecting migration, including temperature, impurity concentration, and applied stress. Our findings reveal that grain boundary mobility is significantly enhanced by elevated temperatures and reduced impurity levels, leading to accelerated grain growth. Additionally, the study highlights the anisotropic nature of grain boundary migration, which is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of adjacent grains. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of microstructural development in polycrystals, offering potential pathways for optimizing material properties through controlled grain boundary engineering. The results have implications for the design of materials with improved mechanical performance and durability in various industrial applications.", "label": 1}
