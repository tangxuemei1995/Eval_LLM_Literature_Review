{"grounding": "If variety is the spice of life, then abnormal grain growth (AGG) may be the materials processing equivalent of sriracha sauce. Abnormally growing grains can be prismatic, dendritic, or practically any shape in between. When they grow at least an order of magnitude larger than their neighbors in the matrix\u2014a state we call extreme AGG\u2014we can examine the abnormal/matrix interface for clues to the underlying mechanism. Simulating AGG for various formulations of the grain boundary (GB) equation of motion, we show that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy leave a characteristic fingerprint in the abnormal/matrix boundary. Except in the case of prismatic growth, the morphological signature of most reported instances of AGG is consistent with a certain degree of GB mobility variability. Open questions remain, however, concerning the mechanism by which the corresponding growth advantage is established and maintained as the GBs of abnormal grains advance through the matrix.", "generated_text": "Extreme abnormal grain growth (EAGG) is a critical phenomenon influencing the microstructural evolution of polycrystalline materials, with significant implications for their mechanical properties. This study investigates the underlying mechanisms driving EAGG, focusing on the interplay between grain boundary energy, grain boundary mobility, and Zener pinning effects. By employing advanced computational models and experimental techniques, we elucidate how variations in these parameters can lead to distinct microstructural outcomes. Our findings reveal that high grain boundary mobility, coupled with low boundary energy, facilitates the rapid growth of select grains, while Zener pinning can effectively hinder this process by stabilizing smaller grains. The research highlights the importance of controlling these factors to tailor material properties through microstructural engineering. This work provides a comprehensive framework for predicting and managing EAGG in various materials, offering pathways to optimize their performance in industrial applications.", "label": 0}
