{"grounding": "Natural wood has been used for construction, fuel, and furniture for thousands of years because of its versatility, renewability, and aesthetic appeal. However, new opportunities for wood are arising as researchers have developed ways to tune the material's optical, thermal, mechanical, and ionic transport properties by chemically and physically modifying wood's naturally porous structure and chemical composition. Such modifications can be used to produce sustainable, functional materials for various emerging applications such as automobiles, construction, energy storage, and environmental remediation. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in engineered wood for sustainable technologies, including thermal and light management, environmental remediation, nanofluidics, batteries, and structural materials with high strength-to-weight ratios. Additionally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future of wood research are discussed, providing a guideline for the further development of next-generation, sustainable wood-based materials.", "generated_text": "Engineered wood has emerged as a pivotal material in sustainable construction and design, offering innovative solutions to environmental challenges. This study explores the integration of advanced technologies such as nanocellulose and transparent wood, highlighting their potential to revolutionize the industry. Nanocellulose, with its remarkable strength and lightweight properties, enhances the mechanical performance and sustainability of engineered wood products. Transparent wood, a novel material, offers unique applications in energy-efficient buildings by improving natural light penetration and thermal management. The research underscores the importance of these technologies in reducing carbon footprints and promoting eco-friendly practices. By examining the lifecycle and environmental impact of engineered wood, this study provides insights into its role in sustainable development, paving the way for future advancements in material science and green architecture.", "label": 1}
