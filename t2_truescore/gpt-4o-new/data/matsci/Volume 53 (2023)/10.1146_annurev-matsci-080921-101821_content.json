{"grounding": "Owing to its unique structure, morphology, and crystal quality, low-dimensional (L-D) ice has attracted increasing attention in recent years. With a size (at least in one dimension) between that of a single water molecule and a snowflake, L-D ice does not only appear as an intermediate state during the dimensional change but can also manifest extraordinary characteristics, from its molecular structures to its physical properties, which offer exciting opportunities for a better understanding and utilization of ice. In this article, we start with a brief introduction to the crystal growth, structure, and typical characterization techniques of ice and then review recent progress in the study of crystal growth, molecular structures, phase morphologies, and physical properties of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional (0-, 1-, and 2D) ice. Extraordinary behaviors of ice in low dimensions and extreme conditions are highlighted. Finally, the future outlook for the physical study and technological applications of L-D ice is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "The study of low-dimensional and confined ice has garnered significant interest due to its unique structural, optical, and mechanical properties, which differ markedly from bulk ice. This research explores the crystal growth and characterization of ice in low-dimensional environments, such as thin films and nanoconfined spaces. By employing advanced microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, we investigate the morphology and interface dynamics of these ice structures. Our findings reveal that confinement leads to altered hydrogen bonding networks, resulting in distinct phase transitions and stability ranges. The optical properties of confined ice, including refractive index and light scattering, are examined, highlighting potential applications in photonics and sensor technologies. Additionally, the mechanical properties, such as hardness and elasticity, are assessed, providing insights into the behavior of ice under nanoscale constraints. This study advances our understanding of ice's behavior in restricted geometries, with implications for fields ranging from climate science to material engineering.", "label": 1}
