{"grounding": "The increasing consumption of nonrenewable materials urgently calls for the design and fabrication of sustainable alternatives. New generations of materials should be derived from renewable sources, processed using environmentally friendly methods, and designed considering their full life cycle, especially their end-of-life fate. Here, we review recent advances in developing sustainable polymers from biological matter (biomatter), including progress in the extraction and utilization of bioderived monomers and polymers, as well as the emergence of polymers produced directly from unprocessed biomatter (entire cells or tissues). We also discuss applications of sustainable polymers in bioplastics, biocomposites, and cementitious biomaterials, with emphasis on relating their performance to underlying fundamental mechanisms. Finally, we provide a future outlook for sustainable material development, highlighting the need for more accurate and accessible tools for assessing life-cycle impacts and socioeconomic challenges as this field advances.", "generated_text": "The development of sustainable polymers from biological matter has gained significant attention as a response to environmental concerns and the depletion of fossil resources. This review highlights recent advancements in the synthesis and application of biopolymers and biocomposites derived from renewable resources. Emphasis is placed on the integration of these materials into cementitious matrices, enhancing the sustainability of construction materials. Innovations in processing techniques and the functionalization of biopolymers have led to improved mechanical properties and durability, making them viable alternatives to conventional polymers. The study also explores the life cycle assessment of these materials, underscoring their potential to reduce carbon footprints. By leveraging the inherent biodegradability and renewability of biological matter, this research contributes to the broader goal of achieving a circular economy in material science, promoting environmental sustainability and resource efficiency.", "label": 1}
