{"grounding": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is one of the most powerful characterization tools in materials science research. Due to instrumentation developments such as highly coherent electron sources, aberration correctors, and direct electron detectors, STEM experiments can examine the structure and properties of materials at length scales of functional devices and materials down to single atoms. STEM encompasses a wide array of flexible operating modes, including imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and 3D tomography experiments. This review outlines many common STEM experimental methods with a focus on quantitative data analysis and simulation methods, especially those enabled by open source software. The hope is to introduce both classic and new experimental methods to materials scientists and summarize recent progress in STEM characterization. The review also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the various STEM methodologies and briefly considers promising future directions for quantitative STEM research.", "generated_text": "Quantitative Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has emerged as a pivotal tool in materials science, offering unparalleled insights into the structural and compositional properties of materials at the atomic scale. This paper reviews the advancements in STEM techniques, focusing on imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and tomography. By integrating quantitative analysis and simulation, STEM enables precise measurement of atomic positions, chemical compositions, and electronic structures. Recent developments in detector technology and data processing have enhanced the resolution and sensitivity of STEM, facilitating the study of complex materials systems. The application of STEM in imaging provides high-resolution visualization of atomic arrangements, while diffraction and spectroscopy offer detailed information on crystallography and elemental distribution. Tomography, combined with advanced reconstruction algorithms, allows for three-dimensional characterization of nanostructures.
