{"grounding": "In this article, I review scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model in which the top quark plays a special role. Models that aim at the stabilization of the weak scale are presented together with the specific phenomenology of partner states that are characteristic of this type of model. Further, I present models of flavor in which the top quark is singled out as a special flavor in the Standard Model. The flavor and collider phenomenology of these models is broadly presented. Finally, I discuss the possibility that dark matter interacts preferably with the top quark flavor and give an overview of the dark matter phenomenology of these scenarios, as well as collider and flavor signals.", "generated_text": "The top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle, plays a pivotal role in probing physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This research explores the potential of the top quark to address unresolved issues such as the hierarchy problem, flavor anomalies, and the nature of dark matter. By examining top quark interactions and properties, we aim to uncover signatures of New Physics, including potential new particles or forces. The study leverages advanced theoretical models and experimental data from high-energy colliders to investigate deviations from Standard Model predictions. Our findings could provide critical insights into the fundamental structure of matter and the universe, offering pathways to a more comprehensive theory of particle physics.", "label": 0}
