{"grounding": "We present a method for ordering two-nucleon interactions based upon their scaling with the number of QCD colors, N\n\nc\n, in the limit that N\n\nc\n becomes large. Available data in the two-nucleon sector show general agreement with this ordering, indicating that the method may be useful in other contexts where data are less readily available. However, several caveats and potential pitfalls can make the large-N\n\nc\n ordering fragile and/or vulnerable to misinterpretation. We discuss the application of the large-N\n\nc\n analysis to two- and three-nucleon interactions, including those originating from weak and BSM (beyond the Standard Model) interactions, as well as two-nucleon external currents. Finally, we discuss some open questions in the field.", "generated_text": "The study of large-N_c QCD offers significant insights into the nature of nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions, providing a framework to explore effective field theories in nuclear physics. This research investigates the implications of large-N_c QCD on two-nucleon and few-nucleon interactions, highlighting the simplifications and symmetries that emerge in the large-N_c limit. By analyzing the scaling behaviors and potential modifications to traditional NN interaction models, this work enhances our understanding of nuclear forces and their underlying symmetries. The findings suggest that large-N_c QCD can serve as a powerful tool for refining effective field theories, offering a more unified and systematic approach to modeling nuclear interactions across different energy scales.", "label": 0}
