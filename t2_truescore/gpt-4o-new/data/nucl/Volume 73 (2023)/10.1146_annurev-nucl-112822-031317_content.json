{"grounding": "The study of high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider has evolved from a qualitative understanding to the precise extraction of the properties of the quantum chromodynamics medium at extremely high temperatures. Jet quenching has offered unique insights into the transport properties of the quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP) created in these energetic collisions. Apart from medium modification of jets, jet-induced medium excitation constitutes another crucial aspect of jet\u2013QGP interaction and is indispensable in understanding the soft components of jets. We review recent theoretical and phenomenological developments regarding medium response to jet energy loss, including an overview of both weakly and strongly coupled approaches for describing the thermalization and propagation of energy deposition from jets, effects of medium response on jet observables, and exploration of its unique signatures in jet\u2013hadron correlations. Jet-induced medium excitation is shown to be an essential component in probing the in-medium dynamics of jets and a critical step toward precise extraction of the QGP properties.", "generated_text": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP) provides a unique environment to study the properties of strongly interacting matter. One of the key phenomena observed in these collisions is jet quenching, where high-energy partons lose energy as they traverse the QGP, leading to modifications in the jet structure. This study focuses on the medium response to jet propagation and the resulting jet\u2013hadron correlations. By analyzing the angular and momentum distributions of hadrons associated with jets, insights into the mechanisms of jet-induced medium excitation are obtained. The correlation patterns reveal the interplay between energy loss mechanisms and medium-induced modifications, offering a window into the transport properties of the QGP. Advanced theoretical models and experimental data from facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are employed to interpret the observed phenomena. This research enhances our understanding of the QGP's dynamic response to energetic probes, contributing to the broader field of high-energy nuclear physics.", "label": 0}
