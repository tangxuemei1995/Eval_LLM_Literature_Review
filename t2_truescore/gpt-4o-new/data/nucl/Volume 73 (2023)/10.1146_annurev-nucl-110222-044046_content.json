{"grounding": "We present a comprehensive review of purely leptonic and semileptonic decays of D\n0(+), \n\n, and charmed baryons (including \n\n, \u039e\nc\n, and \u03a9\nc\n). The precise studies of these decays help deepen our understanding and knowledge of quantum chromodynamics via measuring decay constants and form factors, and test the Standard Model through examining the unitarity of the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix and lepton flavor universality. We give an overview of the theoretical and experimental tools before discussing the recent progress. The data sets collected by the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) near the production thresholds of \n\n, \n\n, and \n\n offer important opportunities for studies of charm physics.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in charm physics have significantly enhanced our understanding of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons. Utilizing lattice quantum chromodynamics, researchers have refined calculations of decay constants and form factors, crucial for probing the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix elements. These developments have improved the precision of theoretical predictions, facilitating more accurate tests of lepton flavor universality. Experimental data from high-energy physics facilities have been instrumental in validating these theoretical models, revealing potential deviations that could indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model. This review synthesizes recent progress, highlighting the interplay between theoretical innovations and experimental findings in the study of charmed hadron decays.", "label": 1}
