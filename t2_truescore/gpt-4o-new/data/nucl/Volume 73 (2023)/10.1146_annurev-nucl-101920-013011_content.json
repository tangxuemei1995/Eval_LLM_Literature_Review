{"grounding": "This article is a pedagogical review of searches for long-lived particles at the LHC. It is primarily aimed at experimentalists and theorists seeking to initiate and/or deepen their research in this field. We cover the general theoretical motivation and some example models, the main experimental techniques employed in searches for long-lived particles, and some of the important subtleties involved in estimating signal efficiencies and background rates.", "generated_text": "This guide explores methodologies for detecting long-lived particles (LLPs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It emphasizes innovative detector technologies and analysis techniques crucial for identifying LLP signatures, which often evade traditional detection methods. By integrating theoretical models with experimental strategies, this work aims to enhance the discovery potential of LLPs, offering insights into physics beyond the Standard Model and contributing to our understanding of fundamental particle interactions.", "label": 0}
