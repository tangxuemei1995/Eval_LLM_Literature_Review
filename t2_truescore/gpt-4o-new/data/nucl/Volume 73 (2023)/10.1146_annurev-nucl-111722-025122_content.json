{"grounding": "Detection of low-energy nuclear recoil events plays a central role in searches for particle dark matter interactions with atomic matter and studies of coherent neutrino scatters. Precise nuclear recoil calibration data allow the responses of these dark matter and neutrino detectors to be characterized and enable in situ evaluation of an experiment's sensitivity to anticipated signals. This article reviews the common methods for detection of nuclear recoil events and the wide variety of techniques that have been developed to calibrate detector response to nuclear recoils. We summarize the main experimental factors that are critical for accurate nuclear recoil calibrations, investigate mitigation strategies for different backgrounds and biases, and discuss how the presentation of calibration results can facilitate comparison between experiments. Lastly, we discuss the challenges for future nuclear recoil calibration efforts and the physics opportunities they may enable.", "generated_text": "The detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils are pivotal for advancing dark matter and coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE\u03bdNS) experiments. This study explores innovative methodologies for accurately measuring nuclear recoils at sub-keV energy levels, which are crucial for identifying potential dark matter interactions and neutrino scattering events. We employ advanced neutron scattering techniques to simulate and calibrate low-energy recoil events, ensuring precise energy scale determination. Our approach integrates state-of-the-art detector technologies with sophisticated data analysis algorithms to enhance sensitivity and resolution. The results demonstrate significant improvements in recoil energy calibration, reducing systematic uncertainties and enhancing the reliability of experimental outcomes. This work not only contributes to the fundamental understanding of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and neutrino properties but also sets a new benchmark for future low-energy nuclear recoil detection in particle physics research.", "label": 1}
