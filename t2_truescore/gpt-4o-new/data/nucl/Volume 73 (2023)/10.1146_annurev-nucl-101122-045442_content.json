{"grounding": "Two topics have recently risen to prominence within the ongoing searches of beyond\u2013Standard Model effects in b and c decays: observables that test lepton flavor universality (LFU) and those that test lepton flavor violation (LFV). A coherent set of measurements suggests nonstandard LFU effects. General arguments relate LFU to LFV, and the observed size of the former gives hope of observable signals for the latter. We attempt a comprehensive discussion of both theoretical and experimental aspects of these tests. The main final message is that all the instruments necessary to fully establish the putative new effects are at hand, thanks to running experiments and their upgrades. Therefore, this subject stands a concrete chance of ushering in genuinely unexpected discoveries.", "generated_text": "The study of lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in b and c decays offers a promising avenue for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Recent experimental results from LHCb have indicated potential deviations from the expected symmetries of fundamental interactions, suggesting the presence of new particles or forces. This research focuses on analyzing heavy meson decays to identify LFV and LFUV signatures, which could provide critical insights into the underlying mechanisms of BSM physics. By examining the decay patterns and branching ratios, this study aims to enhance our understanding of lepton interactions and contribute to the development of a more comprehensive theoretical framework that extends beyond the current Standard Model.", "label": 1}
