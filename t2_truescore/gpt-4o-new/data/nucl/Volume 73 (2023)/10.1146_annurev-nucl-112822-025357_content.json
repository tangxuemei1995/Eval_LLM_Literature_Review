{"grounding": "Ultra-high-energy (UHE, >0.1 PeV) \u03b3-ray astronomy is rapidly evolving into an expanding branch of \u03b3-ray astronomy with the surprising discovery of 12 PeVatrons and the detection of a handful of photons above 1 PeV. Nearly all known celestial object types that have emissions in the TeV band are found also to emit UHE photons. UHE \u03b3-rays have a well-defined horizon inside our Galaxy due to the absorption of infrared and cosmic microwave backgrounds in the Universe. In the last 30 years, traditional cosmic ray (CR) measurement techniques have enabled the detection of UHE \u03b3-rays and opened the last observation window. For leptonic sources, UHE radiation is in the deep Klein\u2013Nishina regime, which is largely suppressed. Therefore, UHE \u03b3-ray detection will be helpful in locating and identifying hadronic radiation sources, tracing the historic pursuit for the origin of CRs around the knee of the spectrum. The Crab Nebula is the focus of attention with measured photon emissions up to 1 PeV. In the absence of hadronic processes, these emissions may indicate the existence of an extreme accelerator of e\n+\ne\n\u2212. Use of CR extensive air shower detection techniques broadens the field of view of the source observations, enabling measurement of UHE radiation surrounding the sources. These observations can probe the particle propagation inside and outside the accelerators and the subsequent injection/escape into the interstellar medium.", "generated_text": "Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has emerged as a pivotal field in understanding the most energetic processes in the universe. This study focuses on the detection and analysis of gamma rays with energies exceeding 100 TeV, often associated with PeVatrons, which are astrophysical sources capable of accelerating particles to peta-electronvolt energies. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) plays a crucial role in this research, providing unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in the detection of extensive air showers produced by these gamma rays. By examining the muon content of these showers, researchers can distinguish between gamma-ray and cosmic-ray events, enhancing the accuracy of source identification. The Crab Nebula, a well-known cosmic accelerator, serves as a benchmark for calibrating instruments and validating detection techniques due to its consistent emission of high-energy gamma rays. This paper presents recent findings from LHAASO, highlighting the discovery of new PeVatron candidates and the implications for our understanding of cosmic ray origins and propagation. The results underscore the importance of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger approaches in gamma-ray astronomy, as they provide complementary insights into the mechanisms driving these extreme astrophysical phenomena. Future directions include refining detection methods and expanding observational campaigns to further explore the high-energy universe, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive cosmic ray model and advancing our knowledge of the fundamental processes governing the cosmos.", "label": 1}
