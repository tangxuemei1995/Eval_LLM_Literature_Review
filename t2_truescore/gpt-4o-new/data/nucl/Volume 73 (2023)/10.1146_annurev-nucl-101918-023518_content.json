{"grounding": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides an intense, high-quality source of neutrinos from pion decay at rest. This source was recently used for the first measurements of coherent elastic neutrino\u2013nucleus scattering (CEvNS) by the COHERENT Collaboration, which resulted in new constraints of physics beyond the Standard Model. The SNS neutrino source will enable further CEvNS measurements, exploration of inelastic neutrino\u2013nucleus interactions of particular relevance for understanding supernova neutrinos, and searches for accelerator-produced sub-GeV dark matter. Taking advantage of this unique facility, COHERENT's suite of detectors in Neutrino Alley at the SNS is accumulating more data to address a broad physics program at the intersection of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. This review describes COHERENT's first two CEvNS measurements, their interpretation, and the potential of a future physics program at the SNS.", "generated_text": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is a pioneering effort to study coherent elastic neutrino\u2013nucleus scattering (CEvNS), a process predicted by the Standard Model but only recently observed. Utilizing the intense neutrino flux produced at SNS, COHERENT aims to measure CEvNS across various target materials, providing critical insights into neutrino interactions. These measurements have significant implications for understanding supernova neutrinos, as CEvNS is a dominant interaction in supernova environments. Additionally, the experiment's findings contribute to the search for dark matter, as CEvNS shares similarities with potential dark matter interactions. By refining our knowledge of neutrino properties and interactions, COHERENT enhances our understanding of fundamental physics and aids in the development of new models that could explain phenomena beyond the Standard Model. The experiment's results are crucial for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in neutrino physics.", "label": 1}
