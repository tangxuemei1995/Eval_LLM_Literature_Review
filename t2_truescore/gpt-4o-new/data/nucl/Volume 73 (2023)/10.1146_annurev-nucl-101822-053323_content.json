{"grounding": "Vector boson scattering is a key production process to probe the electroweak symmetry breaking of the Standard Model and is one of the most important topics of the physics program for the HL-LHC since it involves both self-couplings of vector bosons and their coupling with the Higgs boson. If the Higgs mechanism is not the sole source of electroweak symmetry breaking, the scattering amplitude deviates from the Standard Model prediction at high scattering energy. Moreover, deviations may be detectable even if a New Physics scale is higher than the reach of direct searches. In this review, the most recent experimental measurements of the production cross sections of vector boson pairs in association with two jets in proton\u2013proton collisions at  TeV at the LHC are reported, using data sets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors. Applications to searches for New Physics, as well as prospects for measuring the electroweak vector boson scattering processes with larger data samples, are also summarized.", "generated_text": "The study of boson\u2013boson interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provides critical insights into the electroweak sector of the Standard Model and potential new physics beyond it. This research focuses on diboson production and vector boson scattering processes, which are key to understanding the self-interactions of gauge bosons and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Utilizing data from the LHC's high-energy proton-proton collisions, we analyze events involving pairs of W, Z, and photon bosons. Advanced techniques in event reconstruction and background suppression are employed to enhance the sensitivity to these rare processes. The results are compared with theoretical predictions, including those from the Standard Model and various beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios. This study not only tests the robustness of the electroweak theory but also explores the potential for discovering new particles or interactions. The findings contribute to refining our understanding of fundamental forces and guiding future experimental and theoretical efforts in particle physics.", "label": 1}
