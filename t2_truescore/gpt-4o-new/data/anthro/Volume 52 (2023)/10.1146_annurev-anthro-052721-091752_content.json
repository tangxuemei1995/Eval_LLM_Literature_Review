{"grounding": "In this review, we call for heightened attention to the labor of interpreters to think more reflexively about our own professional ethics and the paradoxes of global capitalism within which both interpreters and anthropologists work. Like other forms of communicative labor, interpretation is often devalued, unrecognized, and uncompensated\u2014a form of invisible labor. Professional language ideologies, some paradoxically perpetuated by the profession itself, contribute to interpreters\u2019 invisibility in their workplaces. Global and multilingual organizations depend on ideologies of transparency and the assumption that language transmission is easy; examining interpreters\u2019 labor ethnographically troubles these assumptions. Interpreters also confront an ethical tension in their position that mirrors a tension in anthropology: namely, between ideals of professional neutrality and analytic distance versus intentional advocacy. The study of interpreters offers ways to critically assess anthropologists\u2019 own professional practices and dig deeply into the contradictions of global capitalism.", "generated_text": "This study explores the often-overlooked labor of interpreters within the frameworks of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Interpreters play a crucial role in facilitating communication across linguistic and cultural barriers, yet their contributions frequently remain invisible. This invisibility is compounded by the ethical dilemmas they face, as they navigate the complexities of voice and representation. By examining the intersection of interpreters' work with the demands of global capitalism, this research highlights the ethical challenges and pressures that arise in contexts where efficiency and profit are prioritized over human connection. Furthermore, the study delves into the moral responsibilities of interpreters, who must balance fidelity to the source language with the need to convey meaning accurately and empathetically. Through a critical analysis of these dynamics, the research underscores the necessity of recognizing and valuing the essential, yet often hidden, labor of interpreters.", "label": 1}
