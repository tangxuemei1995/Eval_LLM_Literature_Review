{"grounding": "Anthropological expeditions seeking out algorithms frequently return empty-handed. They are confronted with the challenge of the object: what to study when studying algorithms? In this article, I draw together a number of literatures to outline one possible answer to the question of how to study algorithms in social science. I argue that what we should study are algorithmic ecologies. I sketch five modalities of algorithmic ecologies and review concomitant literatures: (a) imaginaries, (b) infrastructures, (c) interfaces, (d) identities, and (e) investments and interests. The speculative propositions offered here are that algorithms are immanent to ecologies and that they are enacted across all the modalities of algorithmic ecologies.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of algorithms and ecology, examining how algorithms function as infrastructural elements within social imaginaries and smart technologies. By conceptualizing algorithms as ecological entities, the research highlights their role in shaping interfaces and mediating human-technology interactions. The paper argues for a reconceptualization of algorithms beyond mere computational tools, proposing a framework that considers their ecological impacts and interdependencies. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the study investigates the socio-technical dynamics that emerge from algorithmic infrastructures, emphasizing the need for sustainable and ethical algorithmic practices. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between technology, society, and the environment.", "label": 0}
