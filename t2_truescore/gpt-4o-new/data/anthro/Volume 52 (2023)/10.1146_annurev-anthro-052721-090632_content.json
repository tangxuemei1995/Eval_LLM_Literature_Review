{"grounding": "Contesting ideas about what is \u201cnormal\u201d human behavior or biology is a core contribution of anthropology. In efforts to provide more inclusive views of what it means to be human, anthropologists challenge judgments about diverse ways of being, which include assumptions about what it means to be normal. Meanings of the term normal encompass the descriptive (statistical) and the evaluative (normative), i.e., judgments about a given characteristic. In biomedicine, \u201chealthy\u201d is often the value ascribed to normal, but embedded in healthy are biases that derive from particular cultural and historical contexts. Here I review how the term normal is understood and used in anthropological and related studies of human biology and biological variation. I propose the biological normalcy framework for understanding how the statistical and normative meanings of normal mutually inform each other and their consequences for human population biology. Several examples provide illustrations of the framework.", "generated_text": "Biological normalcy is a concept that explores the intersection of human biology and cultural norms, challenging traditional notions of what is considered 'normal' in human populations. This research examines how normative views are constructed and perpetuated through statistical measures, often overlooking the inherent biological variation among individuals. By analyzing the interplay between cultural expectations and biological diversity, the study highlights the limitations of using statistical averages to define normalcy. It argues for a more nuanced understanding that recognizes the spectrum of human biological variation as a natural and essential aspect of human diversity. The findings suggest that redefining normalcy in human biology requires a shift from rigid statistical norms to a more inclusive framework that accommodates cultural and biological diversity. This approach not only enhances our understanding of human biology but also promotes a more equitable view of human health and well-being.", "label": 0}
