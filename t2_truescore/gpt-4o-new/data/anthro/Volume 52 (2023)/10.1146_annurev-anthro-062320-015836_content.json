{"grounding": "In this Perspective article, I am able to draw the various strands of my intellectual thinking and practice in archaeology and European prehistory into a complex narrative of changing themes. In this narrative, I draw attention to the inspirational triggers of these transformations to be found in works and words of colleagues and events within and outside my immediate discipline. A group of events between 1988 and 1993 disrupted (in a good way) the trajectory of my professional life and provided a convenient anchor around which my themes pivoted and regrouped with very different standpoints. But some trends in my way of working remained constant and contributed, I hope, to a career of cumulative knowledge. Along the way, I show the significance, in terms of my personal intellectual context as well as archaeological practice in general, of my published works as well as more obscure and some unpublished works that are cited here for the first time.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamic interplay between feminist practice and digital archaeology in shaping the understanding of European prehistory, particularly during the Neolithic era. By examining the autobiographical narratives of archaeologists, the research highlights how personal and professional shifts influence the construction of historical narratives. The integration of middle range research methodologies provides a framework for analyzing the impact of these shifting standpoints on the interpretation of archaeological data. Through a critical review of the history of archaeology, the paper acknowledges the inspirations and challenges that have driven the evolution of archaeological practices. The findings underscore the importance of reflexivity and adaptability in archaeological research, advocating for a more inclusive and nuanced approach to reconstructing the past. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on the role of personal and collective experiences in shaping archaeological interpretations, emphasizing the need for a diverse and interdisciplinary perspective in the field.", "label": 0}
