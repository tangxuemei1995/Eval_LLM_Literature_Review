{"grounding": "In this article, we explore critical university studies (CUS), an interdisciplinary body of scholarship that interrogates structures of higher education and their entanglements with national and global institutions and political movements. Favoring an expansive definition of CUS, we draw from scholars who trace the origins of the American university to the slave trade, racial science, and Native American ethnic cleansing projects, as well as scholars who bring abolitionist and decolonial stances to highlight how the university continues to perpetuate state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness. We then bring the lens of CUS to bear on critical work by anthropologists on higher education and on the discipline more broadly. We explore the challenges of advocating for antiracist and anti-imperial anthropology without attending to the structures of Western/white superiority that have enabled its institutionalization. We conclude by considering interventions by the emerging field of abolitionist anthropology.", "generated_text": "Critical University Studies (CUS) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that interrogates the structures, practices, and ideologies underpinning higher education. This research explores the intersections of decolonization, abolition, and Black studies within the context of CUS, aiming to dismantle oppressive systems and reimagine the university as a site of liberation. By critically examining the historical and contemporary roles of universities in perpetuating colonial and racial hierarchies, this study advocates for transformative approaches that prioritize equity and justice. The integration of decolonial and abolitionist frameworks challenges traditional academic paradigms, fostering inclusive and diverse educational environments. This paper contributes to the growing body of CUS literature by highlighting the potential of Black studies to inform and inspire radical change in higher education. Ultimately, this research calls for a re-envisioning of the university as a space that not only reflects but actively contributes to social transformation and the dismantling of systemic inequities.", "label": 1}
