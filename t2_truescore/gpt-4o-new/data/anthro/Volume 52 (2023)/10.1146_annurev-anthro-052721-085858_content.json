{"grounding": "Human habitation and adaptation to extreme environments have a deep history in anthropological research. Anthropologists\u2019 understanding of these ecological pressures and how humans respond to them has grown substantially over the last 100+ years. This review covers long-standing knowledge on adaptation to classic extreme conditions of heat, cold, and high altitude, while also updating the areas in which recent research has broadened our understanding of human adaptation, acclimatization, and resilience. Unfortunately, the intersecting stresses of structural inequality and climate change have made these extremes more extreme, with drastic negative impacts on health and well-being. Future research will need to explore how extreme environments, structural inequality, and climate change are embodied as well as mitigated so that humans are better prepared to face a rapidly changing world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the multifaceted adaptations of human bodies in extreme environments, focusing on metabolic and thermoregulatory mechanisms. As climate change intensifies, understanding these adaptations becomes crucial for predicting human resilience and vulnerability. The research examines physiological responses to extreme temperatures, high altitudes, and other challenging conditions, highlighting the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in adaptation. Additionally, the study addresses how structural inequalities exacerbate the impacts of extreme environments on marginalized populations, influencing access to resources and adaptive capacity. By integrating insights from anthropology, physiology, and environmental science, this research aims to inform strategies for enhancing human adaptability and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change, while emphasizing the need for equitable solutions to protect vulnerable communities.", "label": 0}
