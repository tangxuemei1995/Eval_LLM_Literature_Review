{"grounding": "This review examines the discourses and practices that have produced a lively literature on museum decolonization created by scholars of museum practices and curators. We consider the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, focusing especially on the care of Native North American heritage, with comparison to similar trajectories internationally. We begin with a discussion of decolonizing moments in theory and practice, with particular attention to 1990s critique of ethnographic museums and developments after the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Following this discussion is a review of works on concerns regarding Native American representation and public displays, involvement in collections care, and the varied collaborations that are changing museum practices. The final section foregrounds the fluorescence of tribal museums and their contributions to the decolonization and indigenization of museums, as well as emerging paradigm shifts in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums.", "generated_text": "This study explores the transformative potential of decolonizing museums, emphasizing a paradigm shift towards more inclusive and equitable practices. By integrating Native American scholarship and indigenization strategies, museums can challenge traditional narratives and power structures that have historically marginalized Indigenous voices. The research examines case studies where museums have successfully implemented decolonization initiatives, highlighting the role of collaboration with Indigenous communities in reshaping curatorial practices and exhibition narratives. It also addresses the challenges and resistance faced in this process, advocating for a sustained commitment to ethical stewardship and cultural sensitivity. The findings suggest that decolonizing museums not only enriches the cultural landscape but also fosters a deeper understanding and respect for Indigenous histories and contributions. This paradigm shift is essential for museums to remain relevant and responsive to the diverse communities they serve, ultimately contributing to a more just and inclusive society.", "label": 0}
