{"grounding": "This article reviews the anthropological scholarship that engages with religious conversion as a political phenomenon, broadly defined. It develops the idea of making a difference as an overarching framework with a double meaning. First, this idiom captures how, by framing religious conversion in political terms, anthropologists have claimed to have substantially intervened\u2014have made a difference, so to speak\u2014in the discussion of conversion. Second, the article sets aside the prevalent problematization of conversion as a category of change, showing instead how anthropologists have sought to establish how religious change makes a difference\u2014in the interweaved realities of individuals, collectives, and polities. I scrutinize and contextualize the belated consolidation of this area of inquiry, map its major strands, and identify the interrelated theoretical developments within anthropology. Seeing these strands as a generative domain of inquiry, I conclude with a number of suggestions for future research, such as paying closer attention to political conversions and to the links between religious conversion and political crises.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between religious conversion and political dynamics, emphasizing how shifts in religious identity can influence political landscapes. By examining historical and contemporary case studies, the research highlights the transformative power of religious conversion in creating both religious and political differences. It delves into the motivations behind conversion, the role of religious institutions, and the socio-political contexts that facilitate or hinder such transformations. The analysis reveals that religious conversion often transcends personal belief systems, impacting broader political structures and ideologies. This intersection of religion and politics underscores the potential of conversion to act as a catalyst for political change, challenging existing power dynamics and fostering new forms of political engagement. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of the politics of religion, offering insights into how religious conversion can serve as a vehicle for both individual and collective change, ultimately reshaping societal norms and political discourse.", "label": 1}
