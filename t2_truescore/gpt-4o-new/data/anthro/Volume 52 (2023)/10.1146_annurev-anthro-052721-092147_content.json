{"grounding": "This review sketches a linguistic anthropology of images. While linguistic anthropology has not historically focalized images as a central theoretical object of concern, linguistic anthropologists\u2019 research has increasingly concerned images of various sorts. Furthermore, in its critique of structuralist reductions of language, the field has advanced an analytic vocabulary for thinking about the image in discourse. In this article, I review scholarship in linguistic anthropology on prototypic images to show how these advances (e.g., entextualization, performativity, perspective, and enregisterment) can be leveraged to theorize images more generally. In doing so, I argue against any hard distinction between language and image. I conclude by expanding out from a linguistic anthropology of images to what I call \u201ca linguistic anthropology of\u2026,\u201d a field characterized by an open-ended horizon of objects and modes of inquiry, all linked together as linguistic anthropology.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of linguistic anthropology and visual semiotics, focusing on the entextualization and performativity of images. By examining how images function as communicative acts within cultural contexts, the research highlights the processes of enregisterment that imbue images with social meaning. Utilizing a semiotic framework, the study investigates how images are not merely passive representations but active participants in the construction of social realities. Through case studies, the research demonstrates how images are entextualized, gaining new meanings as they circulate across different contexts and audiences. The performative aspect of images is analyzed, revealing how they can enact social roles and identities. This interdisciplinary approach provides new insights into the dynamic relationship between language, culture, and visual media, offering a comprehensive understanding of how images contribute to the semiotic landscape of human communication.", "label": 0}
