{"grounding": "Water links the environment, culture, and biology. An integrative approach is needed to attain a complete picture of how water affects human biology due to its inherent interdisciplinary nature. First, this review describes advances in human water needs, thirst, and hydration strategies from a biocultural perspective. Second, it provides a critical appraisal of the literatures on water insecurity (WI) experiences and coping strategies used to mitigate WI to illustrate how they intersect to affect human biology through the embodiment framework. Deviations from water needs and heightened WI can alter hydration and coping strategies, which have implications for a suite of psychological and physiological outcomes. These disruptions are embodied in cellular damage, dehydration, nutrition, stress, mental health, cognitive impairment, aging-related effects, cardiometabolic health, and kidney function. Disrupting forces such as lifestyle changes and climate change have important implications for water needs, WI, coping and hydration strategies, and the embodiment of each.", "generated_text": "Water insecurity is an increasingly pressing issue that intersects with human biology, affecting hydration, thirst, and overall health. This study explores the physiological and psychological dimensions of water needs and the embodiment of water scarcity. It examines how individuals and communities adapt through various coping strategies in response to limited water access. The research highlights the biological imperatives of hydration and the consequences of chronic water insecurity on human health, including impacts on metabolic processes and cognitive function. Furthermore, the study considers the exacerbating effects of climate change on water availability, emphasizing the need for sustainable water management practices. By integrating insights from human biology and environmental science, this research underscores the critical importance of addressing water insecurity to safeguard human health and well-being. The findings aim to inform policy and community-level interventions that enhance resilience against the backdrop of a changing climate.", "label": 1}
