{"grounding": "\u201cIntervention\u201d is central to global health, but the significance and effects of how intervention is practiced are often taken for granted. This review takes interventions into health and medicine as subjects for ethnographic inquiry. We highlight three lines of anthropological contributions: studies of global health interventions that serve imperial and military objectives, studies of \u201cmagic bullet\u201d interventions arising from laboratory science, and studies of interventions based on deterministic modeling techniques. We then outline examples of \u201cintervention otherwise,\u201d in which people build relations of solidarity and care through global health programming, design interventions to be interactive and adaptable, and use data and modeling to support health justice. Whereas many global health interventions reproduce Western power hierarchies, intervention otherwise draws attention to alternative forms of knowledge, action, and expertise. Our analysis of lively and multivalent practices of intervention has implications for debates about the im/possibility of decolonizing global health.", "generated_text": "This study critically examines the paradigms underpinning global health interventions, focusing on the roles of military involvement, the pursuit of 'magic bullet' solutions, and deterministic models. By analyzing these frameworks, the research highlights the complexities and limitations inherent in current global public health strategies. The paper draws on anthropological perspectives to explore how historical and colonial legacies shape contemporary health care and aid practices. It argues for a more nuanced understanding of intervention strategies that transcend simplistic, one-size-fits-all approaches. Through case studies and theoretical analysis, the research advocates for interventions that are context-sensitive and culturally informed, emphasizing the importance of local knowledge and participatory approaches. This work contributes to the discourse on global medicine by challenging dominant narratives and proposing alternative models that prioritize equity and sustainability in health care delivery. The findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift towards more holistic and inclusive global health practices.", "label": 1}
