{"grounding": "This review surveys studies of men and masculinities in anthropology and ethnography from other disciplines, as well as theoretical frameworks and debates among anthropologists and other relevant scholars in the field. It also aims to assess developments in these studies since an earlier Annual Review of Anthropology article was published on this subject. By considering the ethnographic boom in men and masculinities studies across the globe since 2000, increasingly authored by anthropologists from the Global South, this review considers anthropology's singular contributions topically and conceptually\u2014for example, masculinity and militarism, men and public health, gender inequalities, and trans* social movements\u2014including through innovative research in biological and linguistic anthropology and archaeology. Throughout, this article reflects on the extent to which anthropologists have moved (and if they should have moved) beyond the study of women or men to instead explore gender, sex, and sexuality of humans and nonhuman animals in less binary frameworks.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the anthropology of masculinity, focusing on the evolving dynamics of gender and sexuality in contemporary societies. By examining the often unmarked category of men, this research highlights the complexities and diversities within masculinities, challenging traditional notions and stereotypes. The analysis draws on ethnographic data and theoretical frameworks to explore how men navigate and negotiate their identities amidst changing social norms and expectations. It addresses the intersections of masculinity with issues of inequality, power, and privilege, emphasizing the role of cultural, economic, and political factors in shaping male experiences. The study also considers the impact of global movements advocating for gender equality and how these influence perceptions and practices of masculinity. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of gender dynamics, advocating for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to studying men and masculinity in anthropology.", "label": 1}
