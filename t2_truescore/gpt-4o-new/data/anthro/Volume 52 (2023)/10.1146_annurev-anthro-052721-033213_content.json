{"grounding": "This article reviews key theoretical and methodological contributions that anthropologists have made to the study of what we call security regimes. While anthropologists have been instrumental in denaturalizing discourses of security, much of the existing literature on who security actors are or where their work and force are to be found remains focused on the masculinist frontlines and visibly spectacular instances of security state power. We adopt a transnational feminist lens to rethink what we understand security regimes to be and where they are to be found by drawing attention to the multiscalar sites (e.g., home, family, kinship, intimacy) and technologies of rule (e.g., affect, aesthetics, discourse) through which security regimes are constituted, expanded, and challenged. The final section of the review examines methodological and ethical challenges, which are made more complex by the changing profile of the multiply racialized, gendered, nationalized, and classed researchers of security regimes.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate entanglements of security regimes within the frameworks of empire, race, and gender, employing a political anthropology lens. By examining the transnational dimensions of security, the research highlights how imperial legacies continue to shape contemporary security practices and discourses. The analysis foregrounds the role of race and gender in constructing and perpetuating these regimes, revealing how they intersect to produce differential impacts across global contexts. Through the lens of transnational feminism, the study critiques the dominant narratives of security that often marginalize or silence diverse voices and experiences. By integrating theoretical insights from political anthropology and feminist scholarship, the research offers a nuanced understanding of how security is negotiated and contested across borders. This work contributes to the broader discourse on global security by challenging traditional paradigms and advocating for more inclusive and equitable approaches to understanding and addressing security concerns.", "label": 0}
