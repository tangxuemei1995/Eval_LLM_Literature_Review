{"grounding": "The microbiota populating the plant\u2013soil continuum defines an untapped resource for sustainable crop production. The host plant is a driver for the taxonomic composition and function of these microbial communities. In this review, we illustrate how the host genetic determinants of the microbiota have been shaped by plant domestication and crop diversification. We discuss how the heritable component of microbiota recruitment may represent, at least partially, a selection for microbial functions underpinning the growth, development, and health of their host plants and how the magnitude of this heritability is influenced by the environment. We illustrate how host\u2013microbiota interactions can be treated as an external quantitative trait and review recent studies associating crop genetics with microbiota-based quantitative traits. We also explore the results of reductionist approaches, including synthetic microbial communities, to establish causal relationships between microbiota and plant phenotypes. Lastly, we propose strategies to integrate microbiota manipulation into crop selection programs. Although a detailed understanding of when and how heritability for microbiota composition can be deployed for breeding purposes is still lacking, we argue that advances in crop genomics are likely to accelerate wider applications of plant\u2013microbiota interactions in agriculture.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between crops and their associated microbiota plays a crucial role in plant health, growth, and productivity. This study explores the potential of engineering crop microbiota through host genetics, focusing on the rhizosphere and root-associated microbial communities. By examining the genetic basis of plant-microbiota interactions, we aim to identify key genetic traits that influence microbial community composition and function. The domestication of crops has historically altered these interactions, often reducing microbial diversity and resilience. Through advanced plant breeding techniques, it is possible to reintroduce or enhance beneficial microbial associations that have been lost or diminished. This research highlights the importance of understanding the genetic determinants of microbiota assembly and function in the context of crop improvement. By leveraging genetic insights, we can develop crops that are better equipped to harness the benefits of their microbiota, leading to improved nutrient uptake, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. Ultimately, this approach offers a sustainable pathway to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience in the face of global challenges such as climate change and food security. The findings underscore the potential of integrating host genetics with microbiome management in modern plant breeding programs.", "label": 1}
