{"grounding": "\nKitaviridae is a family of plant-infecting viruses that have multiple positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic segments. Kitaviruses are assigned into the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, mainly on the basis of the diversity of their genomic organization. Cell-to-cell movement of most kitaviruses is provided by the 30K family of proteins or the binary movement block, considered an alternative movement module among plant viruses. Kitaviruses stand out for producing conspicuously unusual locally restricted infections and showing deficient or nonsystemic movement likely resulting from incompatible or suboptimal interactions with their hosts. Transmission of kitaviruses is mediated by mites of many species of the genus Brevipalpus and at least one species of eriophyids. Kitavirus genomes encode numerous orphan open reading frames but RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the transmembrane helix-containing protein, generically called SP24, typify a close phylogenetic link with arthropod viruses. Kitaviruses infect a large range of host plants and cause diseases of economic concern in crops such as citrus, tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry.", "generated_text": "Kitaviruses represent a unique group of plant viruses that deviate from the typical systemic infection patterns observed in most plant viruses, instead causing localized, nonsystemic diseases. This review focuses on the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, which are primarily transmitted by Brevipalpus mites. These viruses are responsible for economically significant diseases such as citrus leprosis, characterized by localized lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to substantial yield losses. The study of kitaviruses provides insights into the complex interactions between plant hosts, vector mites, and viral pathogens. Recent advances in molecular biology have shed light on the genomic organization and replication strategies of these viruses, revealing similarities with negeviruses, a group of insect-infecting viruses. Understanding the transmission dynamics and host-virus interactions of kitaviruses is crucial for developing effective management strategies. This review highlights the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the atypical infection patterns of kitaviruses and their evolutionary relationship with other plant and insect viruses.", "label": 1}
