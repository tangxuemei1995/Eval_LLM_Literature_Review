{"grounding": "\nPhytophthora capsici is a destructive oomycete pathogen of vegetable, ornamental, and tropical crops. First described by L.H. Leonian in 1922 as a pathogen of pepper in New Mexico, USA, P. capsici is now widespread in temperate and tropical countries alike. Phytophthora capsici is notorious for its capability to evade disease management strategies. High genetic diversity allows P. capsici populations to overcome fungicides and host resistance, the formation of oospores results in long-term persistence in soils, zoospore differentiation in the presence of water increases epidemic potential, and a broad host range maximizes economic losses and limits the effectiveness of crop rotation. The severity of disease caused by P. capsici and management challenges have led to numerous research efforts in the past 100 years. Here, we discuss recent findings regarding the biology, genetic diversity, disease management, fungicide resistance, host resistance, genomics, and effector biology of P. capsici.", "generated_text": "Phytophthora capsici, a notorious oomycete plant pathogen, continues to pose significant threats to vegetable crops worldwide, a century after its initial description. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the fundamental biology of P. capsici, highlighting its complex life cycle, genetic diversity, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. The pathogen's ability to rapidly adapt and develop resistance to fungicides underscores the urgency for innovative management strategies. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular basis of fungicide resistance, offering insights into potential targets for novel control measures. Integrated disease management approaches, combining cultural practices, resistant cultivars, and judicious fungicide use, are emphasized as sustainable solutions. Advances in genomic and transcriptomic technologies have furthered our understanding of host-pathogen interactions, paving the way for the development of resistant crop varieties. This review underscores the need for continued research and collaboration to mitigate the impact of P. capsici on global agriculture.", "label": 1}
