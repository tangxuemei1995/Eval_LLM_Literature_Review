{"grounding": "Harvested fruit and vegetables are perishable, subject to desiccation, show increased respiration during ripening, and are colonized by postharvest fungal pathogens. Induced resistance is a strategy to control diseases by eliciting biochemical processes in fruits and vegetables. This is accomplished by modulating the progress of ripening and senescence, which maintains the produce in a state of heightened resistance to decay-causing fungi. Utilization of induced resistance to protect produce has been improved by scientific tools that better characterize physiological changes in plants. Induced resistance slows the decline of innate immunity after harvest and increases the production of defensive responses that directly inhibit plant pathogens. This increase in defense response in fruits and vegetables contributes to higher amounts of phenols and antioxidant compounds, improving both the quality and appearance of the produce. This review summarizes mechanisms and treatments that induce resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables to suppress fungal colonization. Moreover, it highlights the importance of host maturity and stage of ripening as limiting conditions for the improved expression of induced-resistance processes.", "generated_text": "Induced resistance in fruits and vegetables represents a promising strategy to mitigate postharvest disease development, which is a significant concern for global food security and economic sustainability. This study explores the physiological mechanisms underlying induced resistance, focusing on how these processes can be harnessed to extend the shelf life of produce. By examining the interplay between host physiological factors and external stimuli, we identify key pathways that trigger resistance responses, including the activation of defense-related enzymes and the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds. The research highlights the role of ripening and maturation delay as critical factors in enhancing resistance, providing insights into how these processes can be manipulated to reduce susceptibility to pathogens. Our findings suggest that optimizing induced resistance through targeted interventions could significantly reduce postharvest losses, offering a sustainable alternative to chemical treatments. This study underscores the potential of leveraging natural plant defenses to improve the quality and longevity of fruits and vegetables, contributing to more resilient agricultural practices.", "label": 1}
