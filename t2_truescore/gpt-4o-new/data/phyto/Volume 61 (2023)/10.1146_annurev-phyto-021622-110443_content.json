{"grounding": "The plant immune system perceives pathogens to trigger defense responses. In turn, pathogens secrete effector molecules to subvert these defense responses. The initiation and maintenance of defense responses involve not only de novo synthesis of regulatory proteins and enzymes but also their regulated degradation. The latter is achieved through protein degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS). The UPS regulates all stages of immunity, from the perception of the pathogen to the execution of the response, and, therefore, constitutes an ideal candidate for microbial manipulation of the host. Pathogen effector molecules interfere with the plant UPS through several mechanisms. This includes hijacking general UPS functions or perturbing its ability to degrade specific targets. In this review, we describe how the UPS regulates different immunity-related processes and how pathogens subvert this to promote disease.", "generated_text": "The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS) is a critical regulatory mechanism in plants, orchestrating protein degradation and maintaining proteostasis. This system plays a pivotal role in plant immunity by modulating the stability and activity of key immune components. Pathogens, however, have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate the UPS, deploying effectors that hijack ubiquitination processes to suppress host defenses and promote infection. This review explores the intricate interactions between plant UPS and microbial effectors, highlighting recent advances in understanding how pathogens exploit ubiquitination to undermine plant immune responses. By dissecting these molecular interactions, we can identify potential targets for enhancing plant resistance. Understanding the dual role of the UPS in maintaining cellular homeostasis and mediating immune responses offers promising avenues for developing novel strategies to bolster plant defense against pathogenic threats.", "label": 1}
