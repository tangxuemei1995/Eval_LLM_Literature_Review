{"grounding": "Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is an emerging tobamovirus. It was first reported in 2015 in Jordan in greenhouse tomatoes and now threatens tomato and pepper crops around the world. ToBRFV is a stable and highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted by mechanical means and via seeds, which enables it to spread locally and over long distances. The ability of ToBRFV to infect tomato plants harboring the commonly deployed Tm resistance genes, as well as pepper plants harboring the L resistance alleles under certain conditions, limits the ability to prevent damage from the virus. The fruit production and quality of ToBRFV-infected tomato and pepper plants can be drastically affected, thus significantly impacting their market value. Herein, we review the current information and discuss the latest areas of research on this virus, which include its discovery and distribution, epidemiology, detection, and prevention and control measures, that could help mitigate the ToBRFV disease pandemic.", "generated_text": "The Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV), a member of the Tobamovirus genus, has emerged as a significant threat to global agriculture, particularly affecting tomato and pepper crops. This pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of these essential crops to viral pathogens, necessitating urgent research and intervention strategies. The virus is primarily seed-borne, facilitating its rapid spread across international borders, and is characterized by its ability to overcome existing genetic resistances in tomato varieties. Effective management of ToBRFV requires a multifaceted approach, including stringent seed hygiene protocols to prevent initial infection and the development of resistant cultivars through advanced breeding techniques. Additionally, the implementation of comprehensive biosecurity measures in agricultural practices is crucial to mitigate the spread of the virus. This review synthesizes current knowledge on ToBRFV, emphasizing the need for coordinated global efforts to enhance resistance breeding, improve diagnostic tools, and establish robust quarantine measures to safeguard the future of tomato and pepper production.", "label": 1}
