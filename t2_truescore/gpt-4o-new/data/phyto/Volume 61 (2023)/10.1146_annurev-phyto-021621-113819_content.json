{"grounding": "Understanding the coevolutionary history of plants, pathogens, and disease resistance is vital for plant pathology. Here, I review Francis O. Holmes's work with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) framed by the foundational work of Nikolai Vavilov on the geographic centers of origin of plants and crop wild relatives (CWRs) and T. Harper Goodspeed's taxonomy of the genus Nicotiana. Holmes developed a hypothesis that the origin of host resistance to viruses was due to coevolution of both at a geographic center. In the 1950s, Holmes proved that genetic resistance to TMV, especially dominant R-genes, was centered in South America for Nicotiana and other solanaceous plants, including Capsicum, potato, and tomato. One seeming exception was eggplant (Solanum melongena). Not until the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s and recent advances in evolutionary taxonomy did it become evident that northeast Africa was the home of eggplant CWRs, far from Holmes's geographic center for TMV\u2013R-gene coevolution. Unbeknownst to most plant pathologists, Holmes's ideas predated those of H.H. Flor, including experimental proof of the gene-for-gene interaction, identification of R-genes, and deployment of dominant host genes to protect crop plants from virus-associated yield losses.", "generated_text": "The intricate dance of coevolution between viruses and their plant hosts is a dynamic process that has shaped the genetic landscape of both parties over millennia. This study delves into the coevolutionary interactions within geographic centers of plant diversity, with a focus on the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) and its host plants. By examining these interactions, we aim to understand how historical and environmental factors, such as plate tectonics, have influenced the distribution and evolution of host resistance and viral pathogenicity. Our research highlights the significance of crop centers of diversity as hotspots for host\u2013pathogen coevolution, where diverse genetic resources provide a reservoir for resistance traits. Through a combination of phylogenetic analysis and ecological modeling, we explore the evolutionary trajectories of both viruses and host plants, revealing patterns of adaptation and counter-adaptation. The findings underscore the importance of preserving these centers of diversity, not only for their ecological value but also for their potential to inform sustainable agricultural practices. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of host\u2013microbe interactions and offers insights into the development of resilient crop varieties in the face of emerging viral threats.", "label": 0}
