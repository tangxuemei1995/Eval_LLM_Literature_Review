{"grounding": "Membrane trafficking pathways play a prominent role in plant immunity. The endomembrane transport system coordinates membrane-bound cellular organelles to ensure that immunological components are utilized effectively during pathogen resistance. Adapted pathogens and pests have evolved to interfere with aspects of membrane transport systems to subvert plant immunity. To do this, they secrete virulence factors known as effectors, many of which converge on host membrane trafficking routes. The emerging paradigm is that effectors redundantly target every step of membrane trafficking from vesicle budding to trafficking and membrane fusion. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms adopted by plant pathogens to reprogram host plant vesicle trafficking, providing examples of effector-targeted transport pathways and highlighting key questions for the field to answer moving forward.", "generated_text": "Pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to subvert plant immune responses, often targeting the host's membrane trafficking pathways. This review explores how microbial effectors manipulate plant endomembrane systems, including autophagy and protein secretion, to facilitate infection. By hijacking these pathways, pathogens can suppress immune signaling and promote the formation of specialized structures like haustoria, which are crucial for nutrient acquisition. Understanding the interplay between pathogen effectors and plant membrane trafficking is essential for developing strategies to enhance plant resistance. Recent advances in molecular techniques have shed light on the dynamic interactions between host and pathogen, revealing potential targets for intervention. This research underscores the complexity of plant-pathogen interactions and the critical role of membrane trafficking in plant immunity.", "label": 1}
