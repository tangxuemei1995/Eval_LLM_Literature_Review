{"grounding": "Plant disease control requires novel approaches to mitigate the spread of and losses caused by current, emerging, and re-emerging diseases and to adapt plant protection to global climate change and the restrictions on the use of conventional pesticides. Currently, disease management relies mainly on biopesticides, which are required for the sustainable use of plant-protection products. Functional peptides are candidate biopesticides because they originate from living organisms or are synthetic analogs and provide novel mechanisms of action against plant pathogens. Hundreds of compounds exist that cover an extensive range of activities against viruses, bacteria and phytoplasmas, fungi and oomycetes, and nematodes. Natural sources, chemical synthesis, and biotechnological platforms may provide peptides at large scale for the industry and growers. The main challenges for their use in plant disease protection are (a) the requirement of stability in the plant environment and counteracting resistance in pathogen populations, (b) the need to develop suitable formulations to increase their shelf life and methods of application, (c) the selection of compounds with acceptable toxicological profiles, and (d) the high cost of production for agricultural purposes. In the near future, it is expected that several functional peptides will be commercially available for plant disease control, but more effort is needed to validate their efficacy at the field level and fulfill the requirements of the regulatory framework.", "generated_text": "The increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices has intensified the search for novel biopesticides, with functional peptides emerging as promising candidates for plant disease control. This review explores the potential of functional peptides derived from natural sources, such as plants, microorganisms, and animals, in combating plant pathogens. Functional peptides exhibit diverse mechanisms of action, including antimicrobial activity, immune modulation, and interference with pathogen signaling pathways, making them versatile tools in plant protection. The study delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying these actions, highlighting their ability to disrupt cell membranes, inhibit enzyme activity, and induce systemic resistance in plants. Advances in peptide synthesis and production technologies, such as recombinant DNA technology and peptide engineering, have facilitated the development of cost-effective and scalable production methods, enhancing the feasibility of their application in agriculture. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges associated with the stability, delivery, and environmental impact of peptide-based biopesticides, emphasizing the need for innovative formulation strategies to enhance their efficacy and persistence in the field. By integrating functional peptides into integrated pest management systems, it is possible to reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, thereby minimizing environmental impact and promoting sustainable agriculture. This review underscores the potential of functional peptides as a novel class of biopesticides, paving the way for future research and development in plant disease management.", "label": 1}
