{"grounding": "Society is confronted by interconnected threats to ecological sustainability. Among these is the devastation of forests by destructive non-native pathogens and insects introduced through global trade, leading to the loss of critical ecosystem services and a global forest health crisis. We argue that the forest health crisis is a public-good social dilemma and propose a response framework that incorporates principles of collective action. This framework enables scientists to better engage policymakers and empowers the public to advocate for proactive biosecurity and forest health management. Collective action in forest health features broadly inclusive stakeholder engagement to build trust and set goals; accountability for destructive pest introductions; pooled support for weakest-link partners; and inclusion of intrinsic and nonmarket values of forest ecosystems in risk assessment. We provide short-term and longer-term measures that incorporate the above principles to shift the societal and ecological forest health paradigm to a more resilient state.", "generated_text": "The global forest health crisis, exacerbated by biological invasions and climate change, presents a significant public-good social dilemma requiring urgent international collective action. Forests, vital for biodiversity conservation and climate regulation, are increasingly threatened by invasive species and anthropogenic pressures. This paper explores the intersection of natural resource policy and global change, highlighting the need for coordinated international efforts to address these challenges. Current policies often fall short due to fragmented governance and lack of global cooperation, leading to ineffective management of forest ecosystems. By examining case studies and policy frameworks, this study underscores the importance of integrating scientific research with policy-making to enhance forest resilience. It advocates for a unified global strategy that prioritizes biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource management, emphasizing the role of international collaboration in mitigating the impacts of climate change and biological invasions on forest health.", "label": 1}
