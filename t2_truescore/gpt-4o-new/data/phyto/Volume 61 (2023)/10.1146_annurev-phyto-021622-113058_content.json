{"grounding": "Plant-parasitic nematodes are one of the most insidious pests limiting agricultural production, parasitizing mostly belowground and occasionally aboveground plant parts. They are an important and underestimated component of the estimated 30% yield loss inflicted on crops globally by biotic constraints. Nematode damage is intensified by interactions with biotic and abiotic factors constraints: soilborne pathogens, soil fertility degradation, reduced soil biodiversity, climate variability, and policies influencing the development of improved management options. This review focuses on the following topics: (a) biotic and abiotic constraints, (b) modification of production systems, (c) agricultural policies, (d) the microbiome, (e) genetic solutions, and (f) remote sensing. Improving integrated nematode management (INM) across all scales of agricultural production and along the Global North\u2013Global South divide, where inequalities influence access to technology, is discussed. The importance of the integration of technological development in INM is critical to improving food security and human well-being in the future.", "generated_text": "The global agricultural landscape is undergoing significant transitions, necessitating innovative approaches to pest management, particularly for nematodes, which pose substantial threats to crop productivity. This study explores the multifaceted strategies of Integrated Nematode Management (INM) in the context of evolving constraints, policies, and technological advancements. Emphasizing the role of the microbiome and genetic insights, the research highlights genome editing as a promising tool for enhancing root health and nematode resistance. The integration of remote sensing technologies offers novel opportunities for real-time monitoring and precise management of nematode populations. Policy frameworks are examined to identify barriers and enablers for the adoption of these advanced processes. By synthesizing current knowledge and future prospects, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of INM strategies that align with sustainable agricultural practices, ensuring food security in a rapidly changing world. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing the complex challenges of nematode management.", "label": 1}
