{"grounding": "Immunity to infection has been extensively studied in humans and mice bearing naturally occurring or experimentally introduced germline mutations. Mouse studies are sometimes neglected by human immunologists, on the basis that mice are not humans and the infections studied are experimental and not natural. Conversely, human studies are sometimes neglected by mouse immunologists, on the basis of the uncontrolled conditions of study and small numbers of patients. However, both sides would agree that the infectious phenotypes of patients with inborn errors of immunity often differ from those of the corresponding mutant mice. Why is that? We argue that this important question is best addressed by revisiting and reinterpreting the findings of both mouse and human studies from a genetic perspective. Greater caution is required for reverse-genetics studies than for forward-genetics studies, but genetic analysis is sufficiently strong to define the studies likely to stand the test of time. Genetically robust mouse and human studies can provide invaluable complementary insights into the mechanisms of immunity to infection common and specific to these two species.", "generated_text": "The study of immunology has long relied on murine models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune responses and susceptibility to infectious diseases. However, the translational gap between mouse and human immunology remains a significant challenge, particularly in understanding genetic susceptibility and inborn errors of immunity. This review explores the intersection of mouse and human genetics in the context of immunodeficiency and infectious diseases, highlighting recent advances that bridge this gap. By examining genetic parallels and divergences, we aim to reconcile differences in immune function and disease susceptibility across species. Key insights from human genetics, including the identification of novel inborn errors of immunity, are juxtaposed with murine models to enhance our understanding of genetic predispositions to infectious diseases. The integration of genomic technologies and cross-species genetic analyses offers a promising avenue for uncovering the genetic underpinnings of immune responses. Ultimately, this synthesis of mouse and human immunology at the genetic level holds the potential to inform the development of targeted therapies and improve clinical outcomes for individuals with immunodeficiencies.", "label": 1}
