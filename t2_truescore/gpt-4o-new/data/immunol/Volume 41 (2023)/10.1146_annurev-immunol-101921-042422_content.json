{"grounding": "Autoreactive B cells and interferons are central players in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. The partial success of drugs targeting these pathways, however, supports heterogeneity in upstream mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent insights from genetic and immune monitoring studies of patients that are refining our understanding of these basic mechanisms. Among them, novel mutations in genes affecting intrinsic B cell activation or clearance of interferogenic nucleic acids have been described. Mitochondria have emerged as relevant inducers and/or amplifiers of SLE pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms that include disruption of organelle integrity or compartmentalization, defective metabolism, and failure of quality control measures. These result in extra- or intracellular release of interferogenic nucleic acids as well as in innate and/or adaptive immune cell activation. A variety of classic and novel SLE autoantibody specificities have been found to recapitulate genetic alterations associated with monogenic lupus or to trigger interferogenic amplification loops. Finally, atypical B cells and novel extrafollicular T helper cell subsets have been proposed to contribute to the generation of SLE autoantibodies. Overall, these novel insights provide opportunities to deepen the immunophenotypic surveillance of patients and open the door to patient stratification and personalized, rational approaches to therapy.", "generated_text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies and widespread inflammation. Recent advances in understanding SLE pathogenesis have highlighted the pivotal role of type I interferons (IFNs) in disease progression. IFNs contribute to the dysregulation of immune responses, promoting the survival and activation of autoreactive B cells and the production of autoantibodies. Beyond IFNs, emerging evidence suggests that aberrant cell death pathways, particularly involving mitochondria, play a crucial role in SLE. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which further stimulate the immune system and perpetuate inflammation. Additionally, the extrafollicular response, a process where B cells rapidly differentiate into plasma cells outside of germinal centers, has been implicated in the production of pathogenic autoantibodies in SLE. This extrafollicular pathway may bypass traditional tolerance checkpoints, contributing to the persistence of autoreactive B cells. Understanding the interplay between these mechanisms is essential for developing targeted therapies. Current research is focused on identifying novel therapeutic targets that can modulate these pathways, offering hope for more effective treatments for SLE patients. This review synthesizes recent findings on the multifaceted pathogenesis of SLE, emphasizing the roles of IFNs, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extrafollicular B cell responses.", "label": 1}
