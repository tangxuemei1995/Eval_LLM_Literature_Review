{"grounding": "The complement system is an ancient collection of proteolytic cascades with well-described roles in regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. With the convergence of a revolution in complement-directed clinical therapeutics, the discovery of specific complement-associated targetable pathways in the central nervous system, and the development of integrated multi-omic technologies that have all emerged over the last 15 years, precision therapeutic targeting in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases and processes appears to be within reach. As a sensor of tissue distress, the complement system protects the brain from microbial challenge as well as the accumulation of dead and/or damaged molecules and cells. Additional more recently discovered diverse functions of complement make it of paramount importance to design complement-directed neurotherapeutics such that the beneficial roles in neurodevelopment, adult neural plasticity, and neuroprotective functions of the complement system are retained.", "generated_text": "The complement system, traditionally recognized for its role in immune defense, has emerged as a critical player in the central nervous system (CNS), influencing neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. This review explores the multifaceted contributions of complement proteins, particularly C1q, in the brain. C1q, a key initiator of the classical complement pathway, is implicated in synaptic pruning, a process essential for neuronal plasticity and cognitive function. Dysregulation of complement activity, however, can lead to excessive synaptic loss and neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, interact with complement components to mediate these processes, highlighting their dual role in maintaining homeostasis and driving pathology. Understanding the balance of complement activity in the brain may offer novel therapeutic targets for modulating neuroinflammation and preserving cognitive function in neurodegenerative disorders.", "label": 1}
