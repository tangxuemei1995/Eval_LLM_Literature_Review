{"grounding": "Characterization of RNA modifications has identified their distribution features and molecular functions. Dynamic changes in RNA modification on various forms of RNA are essential for the development and function of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the value of innovative RNA modification profiling technologies to uncover the function of these diverse, dynamic RNA modifications in various immune cells within healthy and diseased contexts. Further, we explore our current understanding of the mechanisms whereby aberrant RNA modifications modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment and point out outstanding research questions.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), play crucial roles in regulating immune responses. This review explores the epitranscriptomic landscape, highlighting how m6A modifications influence antiviral and antitumor immunity. By modulating mRNA stability, translation, and splicing, m6A impacts immune cell differentiation and function. In the tumor microenvironment, m6A modifications can either promote or inhibit tumor progression, affecting immune surveillance and response. Understanding these mechanisms offers potential therapeutic avenues for enhancing immune responses against infections and cancer, underscoring the significance of RNA modifications in immune regulation.", "label": 1}
