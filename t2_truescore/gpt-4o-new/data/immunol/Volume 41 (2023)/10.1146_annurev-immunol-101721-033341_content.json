{"grounding": "Our defenses against infection rely on the ability of the immune system to distinguish invading pathogens from self. This task is exceptionally challenging, if not seemingly impossible, in the case of retroviruses that have integrated almost seamlessly into the host. This review examines the limits of innate and adaptive immune responses elicited by endogenous retroviruses and other retroelements, the targets of immune recognition, and the consequences for host health and disease. Contrary to theoretical expectation, endogenous retroelements retain substantial immunogenicity, which manifests most profoundly when their epigenetic repression is compromised, contributing to autoinflammatory and autoimmune disease and age-related inflammation. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that regulated immune reactivity to endogenous retroelements is integral to immune system development and function, underpinning cancer immunosurveillance, resistance to infection, and responses to the microbiota. Elucidation of the interaction points with endogenous retroelements will therefore deepen our understanding of immune system function and contribution to disease.", "generated_text": "Endogenous retroelements, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), represent a significant portion of the mammalian genome and play complex roles in host immunity. This study explores the immunological paradox posed by these elements, which can both trigger and evade immune responses. ERVs are known to activate the interferon response, a critical component of the innate immune system, through the recognition of viral-like sequences. However, they also contribute to immune regulation and the development of adaptive immunity by influencing gene expression and genomic stability. The dual nature of ERVs in modulating immune responses presents a conundrum, as they can act as both pathogens and symbionts. Understanding the balance between these roles is crucial for elucidating their impact on immune homeostasis and disease. This review synthesizes current research on the mechanisms by which endogenous retroelements interact with the immune system, highlighting their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune and infectious diseases.", "label": 1}
