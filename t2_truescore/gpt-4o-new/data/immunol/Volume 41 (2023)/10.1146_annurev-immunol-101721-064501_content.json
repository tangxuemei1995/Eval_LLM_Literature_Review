{"grounding": "There is a dramatic remodeling of the T cell compartment during aging. The most notorious changes are the reduction of the naive T cell pool and the accumulation of memory-like T cells. Memory-like T cells in older people acquire a phenotype of terminally differentiated cells, lose the expression of costimulatory molecules, and acquire properties of senescent cells. In this review, we focus on the different subsets of age-associated T cells that accumulate during aging. These subsets include extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer properties, exhausted T cells with altered cytokine production, and regulatory T cells that gain proinflammatory features. Importantly, all of these subsets lose their lymph node homing capacity and migrate preferentially to nonlymphoid tissues, where they contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging.", "generated_text": "Aging is associated with significant alterations in the immune system, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence, characterized by the accumulation of extremely differentiated T cell subsets. This study explores the impact of these subsets on tissue deterioration during aging. Thymus involution, a hallmark of aging, leads to reduced T cell output, contributing to an imbalance in lymphocyte populations. The accumulation of senescent T cells, which exhibit pro-inflammatory phenotypes, exacerbates chronic inflammation, further accelerating tissue damage. Our findings suggest that these differentiated T cell subsets play a critical role in the aging process by promoting a pro-inflammatory environment and impairing tissue homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying T cell-driven tissue deterioration could inform therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related diseases and improve healthspan.", "label": 1}
