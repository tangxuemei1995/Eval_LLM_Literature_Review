{"grounding": "The innate immune system detects pathogens via germline-encoded receptors that bind to conserved pathogen ligands called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Here we consider an additional strategy of pathogen sensing called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI involves detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors, also called effectors. Pathogens produce effectors to manipulate hosts to create a replicative niche and/or block host immunity. Unlike PAMPs, effectors are often diverse and rapidly evolving and can thus be unsuitable targets for direct detection by germline-encoded receptors. Effectors are instead often sensed indirectly via detection of their virulence activities. ETI is a viable strategy for pathogen sensing and is used across diverse phyla, including plants, but the molecular mechanisms of ETI are complex compared to simple receptor/ligand-based PAMP detection. Here we survey the mechanisms and functions of ETI, with a particular focus on emerging insights from animal studies. We suggest that many examples of ETI may remain to be discovered, hiding in plain sight throughout immunology.", "generated_text": "Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) represents a crucial component of the plant immune system, acting as a second line of defense following the initial recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This study explores the intricate mechanisms underlying ETI, which is activated upon the detection of specific pathogen-derived virulence factors, known as effectors, by intracellular immune receptors. These receptors, often nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), play a pivotal role in recognizing and responding to effector molecules, thereby triggering robust immune responses. The research delves into the interplay between innate immunity and ETI, highlighting the concept of guard immunity, where NLRs monitor the integrity of host proteins targeted by effectors. By examining the molecular interactions and signaling pathways involved, this study enhances our understanding of how plants effectively counteract pathogen attacks. The findings underscore the potential for leveraging ETI in developing disease-resistant crops, offering promising avenues for sustainable agricultural practices.", "label": 1}
