{"grounding": "Type 2 immunity mediates protective responses to helminths and pathological responses to allergens, but it also has broad roles in the maintenance of tissue integrity, including wound repair. Type 2 cytokines are known to promote fibrosis, an overzealous repair response, but their contribution to healthy wound repair is less well understood. This review discusses the evidence that the canonical type 2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, are integral to the tissue repair process through two main pathways. First, essential for the progression of effective tissue repair, IL-4 and IL-13 suppress the initial inflammatory response to injury. Second, these cytokines regulate how the extracellular matrix is modified, broken down, and rebuilt for effective repair. IL-4 and/or IL-13 amplifies multiple aspects of the tissue repair response, but many of these pathways are highly redundant and can be induced by other signals. Therefore, the exact contribution of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling remains difficult to unravel.", "generated_text": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-13 (IL-13) are pivotal cytokines in the regulation and execution of wound repair processes, particularly within the context of type 2 immunity. These cytokines are integral to the modulation of inflammation and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which are crucial for effective tissue repair following injury. IL-4 and IL-13 orchestrate a complex network of cellular responses that facilitate the resolution of inflammation and promote tissue regeneration. Their roles extend to the modulation of macrophage activation states, influencing the transition from a pro-inflammatory to a reparative phenotype. Additionally, these cytokines are involved in the response to helminth infections, where they contribute to the repair of tissue damage caused by parasitic invasion. Understanding the dual roles of IL-4 and IL-13 as both regulators and effectors in wound healing provides insights into therapeutic strategies for enhancing tissue repair and managing chronic inflammatory conditions.", "label": 1}
