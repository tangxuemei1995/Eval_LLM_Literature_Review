{"grounding": "As an important sensor in the innate immune system, NLRP3 detects exogenous pathogenic invasions and endogenous cellular damage and responds by forming the NLRP3 inflammasome, a supramolecular complex that activates caspase-1. The three major components of the NLRP3 inflammasome are NLRP3, which captures the danger signals and recruits downstream molecules; caspase-1, which elicits maturation of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and processing of gasdermin D to mediate cytokine release and pyroptosis; and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), which functions as a bridge connecting NLRP3 and caspase-1. In this article, we review the structural information that has been obtained on the NLRP3 inflammasome and its components or subcomplexes, with special focus on the inactive NLRP3 cage, the active NLRP3-NEK7 (NIMA-related kinase 7)-ASC inflammasome disk, and the PYD-PYD and CARD-CARD homotypic filamentous scaffolds of the inflammasome. We further implicate structure-derived mechanisms for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "generated_text": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in the host defense against pathogens and in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. This study elucidates the structural mechanisms underlying the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Utilizing advanced cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, we reveal the conformational changes in NLRP3 that facilitate its oligomerization and interaction with the adaptor protein ASC. Our findings demonstrate that ASC forms filamentous structures that serve as a scaffold for the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1. The subsequent cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form initiates a cascade of inflammatory responses. These insights into the molecular architecture of the NLRP3 inflammasome provide a comprehensive understanding of its activation mechanism, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by excessive inflammation. This research advances our knowledge of inflammasome biology and its implications in immune regulation.", "label": 0}
