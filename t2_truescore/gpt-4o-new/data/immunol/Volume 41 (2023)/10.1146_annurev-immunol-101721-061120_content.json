{"grounding": "A large body of evidence generated in the last two and a half years addresses the roles of T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and following vaccination. Infection or vaccination induces multi-epitope CD4 and CD8 T cell responses with polyfunctionality. Early T cell responses have been associated with mild COVID-19 outcomes. In concert with animal model data, these results suggest that while antibody responses are key to prevent infection, T cell responses may also play valuable roles in reducing disease severity and controlling infection. T cell memory after vaccination is sustained for at least six months. While neutralizing antibody responses are impacted by SARS-CoV-2 variants, most CD4 and CD8 T cell responses are preserved. This review highlights the extensive progress made, and the data and knowledge gaps that remain, in our understanding of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines.", "generated_text": "The study investigates T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the impact of viral variants, infection, and vaccination on immune dynamics. T cells play a crucial role in mediating immune protection against COVID-19, influencing disease severity and recovery. We analyzed T cell epitopes across different SARS-CoV-2 variants to assess their immunogenicity and potential escape from immune surveillance. Our findings reveal that while some variants exhibit altered epitope presentation, T cell responses remain robust, suggesting a degree of cross-protection. Furthermore, vaccination enhances T cell reactivity, contributing to reduced disease severity upon breakthrough infections. The study underscores the importance of T cell immunity in the context of evolving viral variants and highlights the need for vaccines that elicit broad and durable T cell responses. These insights are critical for guiding future vaccine design and public health strategies to combat COVID-19 effectively.", "label": 1}
