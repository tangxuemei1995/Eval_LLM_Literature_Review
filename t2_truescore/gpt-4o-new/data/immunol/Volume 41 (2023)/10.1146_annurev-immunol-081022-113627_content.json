{"grounding": "Myeloid cells are a significant proportion of leukocytes within tissues, comprising granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. With the identification of various myeloid cells that perform separate but complementary functions during homeostasis and disease, our understanding of tissue myeloid cells has evolved significantly. Exciting findings from transcriptomics profiling and fate-mapping mouse models have facilitated the identification of their developmental origins, maturation, and tissue-specific specializations. This review highlights the current understanding of tissue myeloid cells and the contributing factors of functional heterogeneity to better comprehend the complex and dynamic immune interactions within the healthy or inflamed tissue. Specifically, we discuss the new understanding of the contributions of granulocyte-monocyte progenitor\u2013derived phagocytes to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity as well as the impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function. Lastly, we explore the developing paradigm of myeloid cell heterogeneity during inflammation and disease.", "generated_text": "The origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, particularly those derived from granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), are critical for understanding immune responses and tissue homeostasis. This study delves into the differentiation pathways of GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, employing advanced fate-mapping techniques to trace their lineage and functional diversification. We explore the influence of microenvironmental niches on the reprogramming of these cells, highlighting the dynamic interplay between intrinsic genetic programs and extrinsic signals. Our findings reveal distinct transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes that govern the fate decisions of GMP-derived cells, contributing to the functional heterogeneity observed in tissue-resident macrophages and neutrophils. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying myeloid cell differentiation and adaptation, this research provides insights into potential therapeutic strategies for modulating immune responses in various pathological conditions, including inflammation and cancer. The study underscores the importance of the tissue microenvironment in shaping the identity and function of myeloid cells.", "label": 1}
