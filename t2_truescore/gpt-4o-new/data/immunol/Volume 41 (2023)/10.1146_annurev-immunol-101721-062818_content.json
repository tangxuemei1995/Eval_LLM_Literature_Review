{"grounding": "The epithelial tissues that line our body, such as the skin and gut, have remarkable regenerative prowess and continually renew throughout our lifetimes. Owing to their barrier function, these tissues have also evolved sophisticated repair mechanisms to swiftly heal and limit the penetration of harmful agents following injury. Researchers now appreciate that epithelial regeneration and repair are not autonomous processes but rely on a dynamic cross talk with immunity. A wealth of clinical and experimental data point to the functional coupling of reparative and inflammatory responses as two sides of the same coin. Here we bring to the fore the immunological signals that underlie homeostatic epithelial regeneration and restitution following damage. We review our current understanding of how immune cells contribute to distinct phases of repair. When unchecked, immune-mediated repair programs are co-opted to fuel epithelial pathologies such as cancer, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, understanding the reparative functions of immunity may advance therapeutic innovation in regenerative medicine and epithelial inflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between the immune system and epithelial tissues is pivotal in orchestrating effective regeneration and repair processes. This review delves into the dynamic cross talk between immune cells and epithelial stem cells, highlighting their collaborative roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to injury. The immune system, through its diverse cell types and signaling molecules, not only orchestrates the initial inflammatory response but also modulates the subsequent phases of tissue repair and regeneration. Epithelial stem cells, in turn, respond to immune-derived signals to proliferate and differentiate, ensuring the restoration of tissue integrity. Dysregulation in this cross talk can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases and impaired healing. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying immune-epithelial interactions offer promising therapeutic avenues for enhancing tissue repair and treating inflammatory disorders. This review underscores the importance of a balanced immune response in epithelial regeneration and the potential of targeting immune-epithelial pathways to improve clinical outcomes in regenerative medicine.", "label": 1}
