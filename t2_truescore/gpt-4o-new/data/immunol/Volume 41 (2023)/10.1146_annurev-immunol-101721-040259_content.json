{"grounding": "Modulation of the immune system is an important therapeutic strategy in a wide range of diseases, and is fundamental to the development of vaccines. However, optimally safe and effective immunotherapy requires precision in the delivery of stimulatory cues to the right cells at the right place and time, to avoid toxic overstimulation in healthy tissues or incorrect programming of the immune response. To this end, biomaterials are being developed to control the location, dose, and timing of vaccines and immunotherapies. Here we discuss fundamental concepts of how biomaterials are used to enhance immune modulation, and evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of how biomaterials-mediated immune engineering can impact the development of new therapeutics. We focus on immunological mechanisms of action and in vivo modulation of the immune system, and we also discuss challenges to be overcome to speed translation of these technologies to the clinic.", "generated_text": "The engineering of the immune system through biomaterials represents a transformative approach in immunotherapy and vaccine development. This study explores the integration of biomaterials, such as nanoparticles, as innovative platforms for modulating immune responses. By leveraging the unique properties of biomaterials, researchers can design vaccine adjuvants that enhance antigen presentation and stimulate robust immune responses. The versatility of nanoparticles allows for precise delivery of immunomodulatory agents, improving the efficacy and specificity of therapeutic interventions. This review highlights recent advancements in biomaterials-mediated immune engineering, emphasizing their potential to overcome current limitations in immunotherapy, such as off-target effects and limited efficacy. Furthermore, the study discusses the challenges and future directions in the field, including the need for biocompatibility and scalability in clinical applications. Overall, biomaterials offer a promising avenue for the development of next-generation immunotherapies and vaccines, with the potential to significantly impact global health outcomes.", "label": 1}
