{"grounding": "Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a key cytokine regulating the development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death of T cells. In CD4+ T cells, TGF-\u03b2 maintains the quiescence and controls the activation of naive T cells. While inhibiting the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells. TGF-\u03b2 is required for the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells and the development of regulatory T cells. TGF-\u03b2 is crucial in the differentiation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells and their retention in the tissue, whereas it suppresses effector T cell function. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 also regulates the generation or function of natural killer T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes. Here I highlight the major findings and recent advances in our understanding of TGF-\u03b2 regulation of T cells and provide a personal perspective of the field.", "generated_text": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a pivotal cytokine in the regulation of T cell biology, influencing a diverse array of T cell subsets including CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), innate lymphoid cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. TGF-\u03b2 plays a crucial role in maintaining T cell quiescence and modulating activation, thereby ensuring immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. It orchestrates the differentiation and function of Tregs, promoting immune tolerance, while also modulating the effector functions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In innate lymphoid cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes, TGF-\u03b2 influences tissue-specific immune responses and barrier integrity. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b2 signaling is integral to the development and function of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which are key players in mucosal immunity. This review synthesizes current insights into the multifaceted roles of TGF-\u03b2 in T cell regulation, highlighting its therapeutic potential in immune-mediated diseases.", "label": 1}
