{"grounding": "T cells and natural killer (NK) cells have complementary roles in tumor immunity, and dual T cell and NK cell attack thus offers opportunities to deepen the impact of immunotherapy. Recent work has also shown that NK cells play an important role in recruiting dendritic cells to tumors and thus enhance induction of CD8 T cell responses, while IL-2 secreted by T cells activates NK cells. Targeting of immune evasion mechanisms from the activating NKG2D receptor and its MICA and MICB ligands on tumor cells offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, T cells and NK cells share several important inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance T cell\u2013 and NK cell\u2013mediated immunity. These inhibitory receptor-ligand systems include CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E. We also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies based on inhibitory and activating cytokines that profoundly impact the function of both lymphocyte populations within tumors.", "generated_text": "The development of cancer immunotherapies that effectively engage both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells represents a promising frontier in oncology. This study explores innovative strategies to harness the synergistic potential of these immune cells to enhance anti-tumor responses. T cells, with their ability to recognize specific antigens, and NK cells, known for their innate ability to target tumor cells, offer complementary mechanisms of action. By designing therapies that simultaneously activate these cell types, we aim to overcome the limitations of current treatments that often target only one immune pathway. Our research focuses on the identification of novel targets and the engineering of bispecific antibodies and cytokine-based therapies to potentiate the dual engagement of T cells and NK cells. Preliminary results demonstrate enhanced tumor clearance and improved survival rates in preclinical models, underscoring the potential of this approach to transform cancer treatment paradigms.", "label": 1}
