{"grounding": "The presence of granulated lymphocytes in the human uterine mucosa, known as decidua during pregnancy, or endometrium otherwise, was first noted in the nineteenth century, but it was not until 1990 that these cells were identified as a type of natural killer (NK) cell. From the outset, uterine NK (uNK) cells were found to be less cytotoxic than their circulating counterparts, peripheral NK (pNK) cells. Recently, unbiased approaches have defined three subpopulations of uNK cells, all of which cluster separately from pNK cells. Here, we review the history of research into uNK cells, including their ability to interact with placental extravillous trophoblast cells and their potential role in regulating placental implantation. We go on to review more recent advances that focus on uNK cell development and heterogeneity and their potential to defend against infection and to mediate memory effects. Finally, we consider how a better understanding of these cells could be leveraged in the future to improve outcomes of pregnancy for mothers and babies.", "generated_text": "Natural killer (NK) cells, a critical component of the innate immune system, play a pivotal role in the human uterine mucosa, particularly during early pregnancy. This study explores the unique characteristics and functions of uterine NK (uNK) cells within the decidua, the specialized endometrial tissue that forms during pregnancy. Unlike peripheral NK cells, uNK cells exhibit a distinct phenotype and are involved in the regulation of trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling, essential processes for successful implantation and placental development. The interaction between uNK cells and trophoblasts is crucial for maintaining a balance between immune tolerance and defense, ensuring fetal-maternal harmony. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms governing uNK cell activity, their role in reproductive success, and potential implications for pregnancy-related disorders. Understanding the dynamics of uNK cells in the decidua could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for conditions such as recurrent miscarriage and preeclampsia, highlighting their significance in reproductive immunology.", "label": 1}
