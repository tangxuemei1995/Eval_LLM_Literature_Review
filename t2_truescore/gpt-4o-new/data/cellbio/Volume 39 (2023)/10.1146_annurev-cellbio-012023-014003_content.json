{"grounding": "Our understanding of cell and developmental biology has been greatly aided by a focus on a small number of model organisms. However, we are now in an era where techniques to investigate gene function can be applied across phyla, allowing scientists to explore the diversity and flexibility of developmental mechanisms and gain a deeper understanding of life. Researchers comparing the eyeless cave-adapted Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, with its river-dwelling counterpart are revealing how the development of the eyes, pigment, brain, cranium, blood, and digestive system evolves as animals adapt to new environments. Breakthroughs in our understanding of the genetic and developmental basis of regressive and constructive trait evolution have come from A. mexicanus research. They include understanding the types of mutations that alter traits, which cellular and developmental processes they affect, and how they lead to pleiotropy. We review recent progress in the field and highlight areas for future investigations that include evolution of sex differentiation, neural crest development, and metabolic regulation of embryogenesis.", "generated_text": "The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a powerful model system in cell and developmental biology, offering unique insights into evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). This species comprises two distinct morphs: the surface-dwelling form and the blind cave-dwelling form, which have diverged in response to contrasting environmental pressures. The cavefish morph, in particular, provides a natural experiment in regressive evolution, characterized by the loss of eyes and pigmentation, alongside enhanced non-visual sensory systems. These phenotypic changes are underpinned by genetic and developmental modifications, making A. mexicanus an ideal organism for studying the genetic basis of adaptation and the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity. Recent advances in genomic and transcriptomic technologies have facilitated the identification of key regulatory pathways and genes involved in these processes. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of surface and cave morphs offers valuable insights into the interplay between genetic drift, natural selection, and developmental constraints. This review highlights the potential of A. mexicanus to advance our understanding of evolutionary and developmental processes.", "label": 1}
