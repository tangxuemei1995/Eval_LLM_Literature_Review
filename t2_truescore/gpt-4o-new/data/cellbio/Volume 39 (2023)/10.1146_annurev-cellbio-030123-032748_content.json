{"grounding": "Microtubules are essential dynamic polymers composed of \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin heterodimers. They support intracellular trafficking, cell division, cellular motility, and other essential cellular processes. In many species, both \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin are encoded by multiple genes with distinct expression profiles and functionality. Microtubules are further diversified through abundant posttranslational modifications, which are added and removed by a suite of enzymes to form complex, stereotyped cellular arrays. The genetic and chemical diversity of tubulin constitute a tubulin code that regulates intrinsic microtubule properties and is read by cellular effectors, such as molecular motors and microtubule-associated proteins, to provide spatial and temporal specificity to microtubules in cells. In this review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding tubulin code literature and highlight limitations and opportunities for the field. As complex microtubule arrays underlie essential physiological processes, a better understanding of how cells employ the tubulin code has important implications for human disease ranging from cancer to neurological disorders.", "generated_text": "The tubulin code, a complex system of tubulin isoforms and posttranslational modifications (PTMs), plays a crucial role in the functional diversity of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton. This review explores the molecular intricacies of the tubulin code, focusing on the various PTMs such as detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation, and their impact on microtubule dynamics and interactions. By examining the differential expression of tubulin isoforms and the spatial-temporal regulation of PTMs, we highlight their significance in cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and signaling pathways. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of dysregulated tubulin modifications in the pathogenesis of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Understanding the tubulin code not only provides insights into fundamental cellular mechanisms but also opens avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting microtubule-associated pathologies. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of the tubulin code as a biomarker and a target for drug development.", "label": 0}
