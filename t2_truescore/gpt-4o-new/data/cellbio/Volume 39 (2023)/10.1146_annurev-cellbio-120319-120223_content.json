{"grounding": "Toll signaling plays a crucial role in pathogen defense throughout the animal kingdom. It was discovered, however, for its function in dorsoventral (DV) axis formation in Drosophila. In all other insects studied so far, but not outside the insects, Toll is also required for DV patterning. However, in insects more distantly related to Drosophila, Toll's patterning role is frequently reduced and substituted by an expanded influence of BMP signaling, the pathway implicated in DV axis formation in all major metazoan lineages. This suggests that Toll was integrated into an ancestral BMP-based patterning system at the base of the insects or during insect evolution. The observation that Toll signaling has an immune function in the extraembryonic serosa, an early differentiating tissue of most insect embryos, suggests a scenario of how Toll was co-opted from an ancestral immune function for its new role in axis formation.", "generated_text": "The Toll signaling pathway, originally characterized for its role in embryonic dorsoventral patterning in Drosophila, has undergone significant neofunctionalization across various insect lineages. This study explores the evolutionary trajectory of Toll signaling in insects, focusing on its dual roles in immunity and embryonic development. By examining model organisms such as Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus, alongside non-insect hexapods, we elucidate the diversification of Toll pathway functions. Our findings highlight the pathway's involvement in germ layer evolution, particularly in mesoderm and serosa formation, and the development of serosal and blastodermal cuticles. Comparative analyses reveal how these adaptations have contributed to the evolutionary success of insects, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying embryonic patterning. This research underscores the importance of Toll signaling in the context of evolutionary developmental biology, offering a comprehensive understanding of its role in shaping insect diversity and complexity.", "label": 1}
