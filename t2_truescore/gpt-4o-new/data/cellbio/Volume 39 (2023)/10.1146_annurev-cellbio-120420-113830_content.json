{"grounding": "Animal tissues are made up of multiple cell types that are increasingly well-characterized, yet our understanding of the core principles that govern tissue organization is still incomplete. This is in part because many observable tissue characteristics, such as cellular composition and spatial patterns, are emergent properties, and as such, they cannot be explained through the knowledge of individual cells alone. Here we propose a complex systems theory perspective to address this fundamental gap in our understanding of tissue biology. We introduce the concept of cell categories, which is based on cell relations rather than cell identity. Based on these notions we then discuss common principles of tissue modularity, introducing compositional, structural, and functional tissue modules. Cell diversity and cell relations provide a basis for a new perspective on the underlying principles of tissue organization in health and disease.", "generated_text": "The study of tissue biology is undergoing a transformative shift as researchers seek a new paradigm that transcends traditional cell type classifications. This paper explores the intricate organization of tissues through the lens of tissue modules, emphasizing the dynamic relationships between cells rather than static categories. By examining the evolutionary processes and self-organizing principles that govern tissue architecture, we propose a framework that integrates cellular interactions and functional modules. This approach not only enhances our understanding of tissue complexity but also provides insights into the adaptive mechanisms that drive tissue evolution. By redefining cell relations and categories, this paradigm shift has the potential to revolutionize our comprehension of biological systems, offering novel perspectives on tissue development, regeneration, and disease. Our findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary research in unraveling the complexities of tissue biology and advancing biomedical science.", "label": 0}
