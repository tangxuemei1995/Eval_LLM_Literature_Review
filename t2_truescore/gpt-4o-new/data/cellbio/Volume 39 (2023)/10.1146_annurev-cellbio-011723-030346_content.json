{"grounding": "Every eukaryotic cell contains two distinct multisubunit protein kinase complexes that each contain a TOR (target of rapamycin) protein as the catalytic subunit. These ensembles, designated TORC1 and TORC2, serve as nutrient and stress sensors, signal integrators, and regulators of cell growth and homeostasis, but they differ in their composition, localization, and function. TORC1, activated on the cytosolic surface of the vacuole (or, in mammalian cells, on the cytosolic surface of the lysosome), promotes biosynthesis and suppresses autophagy. TORC2, located primarily at the plasma membrane (PM), maintains the proper levels and bilayer distribution of all PM components (sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterols, and integral membrane proteins), which are needed for the membrane expansion that accompanies cell growth and division and for combating insults to PM integrity. This review summarizes our current understanding of the assembly, structural features, subcellular distribution, and function and regulation of TORC2, obtained largely through studies conducted with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "generated_text": "The Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TORC2) is a pivotal protein kinase complex that regulates cell growth and survival in response to environmental cues. In yeast, TORC2's function and localization are intricately controlled by its subunits and interactions with cellular membranes. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms governing TORC2 activity, focusing on its association with the plasma membrane (PM) and endosomes. We explore the role of phosphoinositides in modulating TORC2 localization, revealing that specific lipid interactions are crucial for its recruitment to the PM. Additionally, we examine the phosphorylation events that influence TORC2's kinase activity and its subunit composition, highlighting the dynamic nature of its regulation. Our findings provide insights into the spatial and temporal control of TORC2, emphasizing the importance of membrane interactions and post-translational modifications in its functional modulation. This research advances our understanding of TORC2's role in cellular signaling and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.", "label": 1}
