{"grounding": "Intercellular signaling molecules, known as morphogens, act at a long range in developing tissues to provide spatial information and control properties such as cell fate and tissue growth. The production, transport, and removal of morphogens shape their concentration profiles in time and space. Downstream signaling cascades and gene regulatory networks within cells then convert the spatiotemporal morphogen profiles into distinct cellular responses. Current challenges are to understand the diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying morphogen gradient formation, as well as the logic of downstream regulatory circuits involved in morphogen interpretation. This knowledge, combining experimental and theoretical results, is essential to understand emerging properties of morphogen-controlled systems, such as robustness and scaling.", "generated_text": "Morphogens are crucial signaling molecules that orchestrate tissue development by forming concentration gradients across developing embryos. These gradients provide positional information that influences gene regulatory networks, guiding cellular differentiation and spatial organization. The diffusion of morphogens through tissues establishes these gradients, which are interpreted by cells to activate specific genetic programs. This process is essential for the precise patterning and formation of complex structures during embryogenesis. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of morphogen action have revealed intricate feedback loops and cross-talk within gene regulatory networks, highlighting the dynamic nature of tissue development. This review synthesizes current knowledge on morphogen-mediated control of tissue development, emphasizing the interplay between diffusion dynamics and genetic regulation.", "label": 1}
