{"grounding": "The uterine lining (endometrium) regenerates repeatedly over the life span as part of its normal physiology. Substantial portions of the endometrium are shed during childbirth (parturition) and, in some species, menstruation, but the tissue is rapidly rebuilt without scarring, rendering it a powerful model of regeneration in mammals. Nonetheless, following some assaults, including medical procedures and infections, the endometrium fails to regenerate and instead forms scars that may interfere with normal endometrial function and contribute to infertility. Thus, the endometrium provides an exceptional platform to answer a central question of regenerative medicine: Why do some systems regenerate while others scar? Here, we review our current understanding of diverse endometrial disruption events in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents, and the associated mechanisms of regenerative success and failure. Elucidating the determinants of these disparate repair processes promises insights into fundamental mechanisms of mammalian regeneration with substantial implications for reproductive health.", "generated_text": "The endometrium is a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical regeneration and remodeling during menstruation and pregnancy. This study explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial regeneration and fibrosis, with a focus on the roles of stem cells and signaling pathways. We examine how endometrial stem cells contribute to tissue repair and regeneration, and how dysregulation in these processes can lead to pathological conditions such as Asherman syndrome and intrauterine adhesions. The interplay between hormonal signals and local cellular environments during parturition is also analyzed to understand their impact on endometrial health. Our findings highlight the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting stem cell pathways to enhance regeneration and prevent fibrosis. This research provides insights into the balance between regeneration and fibrosis in the endometrium, offering new avenues for the treatment of reproductive disorders associated with impaired endometrial function.", "label": 1}
