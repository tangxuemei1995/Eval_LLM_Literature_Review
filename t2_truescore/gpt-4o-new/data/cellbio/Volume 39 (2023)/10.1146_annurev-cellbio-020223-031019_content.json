{"grounding": "Multicellular organisms generate tissues of diverse shapes and functions from cells and extracellular matrices. Their adhesion molecules mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which not only play crucial roles in maintaining tissue integrity but also serve as key regulators of tissue morphogenesis. Cells constantly probe their environment to make decisions: They integrate chemical and mechanical information from the environment via diffusible ligand- or adhesion-based signaling to decide whether to release specific signaling molecules or enzymes, to divide or differentiate, to move away or stay, or even whether to live or die. These decisions in turn modify their environment, including the chemical nature and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. Tissue morphology is the physical manifestation of the remodeling of cells and matrices by their historical biochemical and biophysical landscapes. We review our understanding of matrix and adhesion molecules in tissue morphogenesis, with an emphasis on key physical interactions that drive morphogenesis.", "generated_text": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process orchestrated by dynamic interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study explores the pivotal roles of cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins and cadherins, in mediating these interactions. Integrins facilitate cell-ECM adhesion, influencing cellular responses to mechanical cues and interfacial tension, while cadherins are crucial for cell-cell adhesion, maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating communication. The basement membrane, a specialized ECM component, provides structural support and biochemical signals essential for tissue architecture. Our research highlights how variations in interfacial tension and ECM composition can modulate cell behavior, driving morphogenetic processes. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions, we aim to advance our understanding of tissue development and regeneration. This knowledge could inform therapeutic strategies for tissue engineering and repair, emphasizing the importance of integrin and cadherin pathways in maintaining tissue homeostasis and function.", "label": 1}
