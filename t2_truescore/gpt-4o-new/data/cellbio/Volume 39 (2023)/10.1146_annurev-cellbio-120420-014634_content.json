{"grounding": "The life of eukaryotic cells requires the transport of lipids between membranes, which are separated by the aqueous environment of the cytosol. Vesicle-mediated traffic along the secretory and endocytic pathways and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) cooperate in this transport. Until recently, known LTPs were shown to carry one or a few lipids at a time and were thought to mediate transport by shuttle-like mechanisms. Over the last few years, a new family of LTPs has been discovered that is defined by a repeating \u03b2-groove (RBG) rod-like structure with a hydrophobic channel running along their entire length. This structure and the localization of these proteins at membrane contact sites suggest a bridge-like mechanism of lipid transport. Mutations in some of these proteins result in neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. Here we review the known properties and well-established or putative physiological roles of these proteins, and we highlight the many questions that remain open about their functions.", "generated_text": "RBG motif bridge-like lipid transport proteins (BLTPs) such as VPS13, ATG2, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164 play crucial roles in lipid transport across cellular membranes, impacting various cellular processes. These proteins are characterized by their unique RBG motifs, which facilitate the bridging of lipid molecules between membranes, thus maintaining lipid homeostasis. Recent structural studies have provided insights into the architecture of these proteins, revealing elongated structures that span membrane contact sites. Functionally, BLTPs are implicated in autophagy, membrane trafficking, and organelle biogenesis, with VPS13 and ATG2 being particularly significant in these pathways. Despite advances in understanding their structure and function, several questions remain unanswered, including the precise mechanisms of lipid transfer and regulation, and the full spectrum of their physiological roles. Further research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms and to explore the potential of targeting BLTPs in therapeutic strategies for diseases linked to lipid dysregulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge and highlights future research directions.", "label": 1}
