{"grounding": "Cell-cell communication is critical for the development and function of multicellular organisms. A crucial means by which cells communicate with one another is physical interactions between receptors on one cell and their ligands on a neighboring cell. Trans ligand:receptor interactions activate the receptor, ultimately leading to changes in the fate of the receptor-expressing cells. Such trans signaling is known to be critical for the functions of cells in the nervous and immune systems, among others. Historically, trans interactions are the primary conceptual framework for understanding cell-cell communication. However, cells often coexpress many receptors and ligands, and a subset of these has been reported to interact in cis and profoundly impact cell functions. Cis interactions likely constitute a fundamental, understudied regulatory mechanism in cell biology. Here, I discuss how cis interactions between membrane receptors and ligands regulate immune cell functions, and I also highlight outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "Cis interactions, where membrane receptors and ligands on the same cell surface engage, play a crucial role in modulating cellular signaling pathways. Unlike trans interactions, which involve receptor-ligand binding between adjacent cells, cis interactions can influence receptor availability, ligand presentation, and signal transduction efficiency. This study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying cis interactions, highlighting their impact on receptor conformation and downstream signaling cascades. By employing advanced imaging techniques and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that cis interactions can either potentiate or inhibit signal propagation, depending on the receptor-ligand pair involved. Our findings suggest that these interactions are not merely passive but actively contribute to the spatial and temporal regulation of signaling networks. Understanding the dynamics of cis interactions offers new insights into cellular communication and presents potential therapeutic targets for modulating immune responses and other receptor-mediated processes. This research underscores the complexity and significance of membrane receptor-ligand interactions in cellular function.", "label": 1}
