{"grounding": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) decode messenger RNA codons to peptides at the ribosome. The nuclear genome contains many tRNA genes for each amino acid and even each anticodon. Recent evidence indicates that expression of these tRNAs in neurons is regulated, and they are not functionally redundant. When specific tRNA genes are nonfunctional, this results in an imbalance between codon demand and tRNA availability. Furthermore, tRNAs are spliced, processed, and posttranscriptionally modified. Defects in these processes lead to neurological disorders. Finally, mutations in the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) also lead to disease. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs cause syndromic disorders, while dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs lead to peripheral neuropathy, again due to an imbalance between tRNA supply and codon demand. While it is clear that disrupting tRNA biology often leads to neurological disease, additional research is needed to understand the sensitivity of neurons to these changes.", "generated_text": "Transfer RNA (tRNA) dysregulation has emerged as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the multifaceted roles of tRNA, focusing on its synthesis, modification, and degradation processes. Key enzymes such as aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and tRNA-modifying enzymes are highlighted for their roles in maintaining tRNA homeostasis. Disruptions in tRNA splicing and modifications can lead to aberrant protein synthesis, contributing to disease phenotypes. Additionally, the role of angiogenin in tRNA cleavage and its impact on the integrated stress response is examined, providing insights into cellular stress mechanisms. Recent studies suggest that tRNA fragments may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in neurological disorders. Understanding the complex interplay between tRNA dynamics and neuronal function could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in treating these debilitating diseases. This review underscores the need for further research into tRNA-related pathways in neurobiology.", "label": 1}
