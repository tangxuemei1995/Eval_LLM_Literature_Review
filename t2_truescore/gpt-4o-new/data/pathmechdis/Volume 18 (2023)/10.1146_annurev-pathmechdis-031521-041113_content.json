{"grounding": "Reprogrammed metabolism is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC cells are geared toward rapid proliferation, requiring nutrients and the removal of cellular waste in nutrient-poor environments. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs), the primary cell of origin for CRCs, must adapt their metabolism along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to the unique features of their complex microenvironment that include interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, stromal cells, commensal microbes, and dietary components. Emerging evidence implicates modifiable risk factors related to the environment, such as diet, as important in CRC pathogenesis. Here, we focus on describing the metabolism of ISCs, diets that influence CRC initiation, CRC genetics and metabolism, and the tumor microenvironment. The mechanistic links between environmental factors, metabolic adaptations, and the tumor microenvironment in enhancing or supporting CRC tumorigenesis are becoming better understood. Thus, greater knowledge of CRC metabolism holds promise for improved prevention and treatment.", "generated_text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy with complex etiological factors, including metabolic alterations, dietary influences, and microbiome interactions. This review explores the intricate relationship between metabolism and CRC, highlighting how metabolic dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. Key metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and lipid metabolism, are often reprogrammed in CRC cells, promoting growth and survival. Dietary factors, including high-fat and low-fiber diets, are implicated in CRC risk, potentially through their impact on metabolic pathways and the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in modulating host metabolism and immune responses, influencing CRC development. Understanding the interplay between diet, metabolism, and the microbiome offers potential for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on elucidating these complex interactions to develop targeted interventions that could mitigate CRC risk and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
