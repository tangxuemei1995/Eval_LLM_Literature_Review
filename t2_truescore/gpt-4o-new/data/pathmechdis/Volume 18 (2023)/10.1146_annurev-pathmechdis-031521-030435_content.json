{"grounding": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one of the major diseases arising from chronic alcohol consumption and is one of the most common causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality. ALD includes asymptomatic liver steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and alcohol-associated hepatitis and its complications. The progression of ALD involves complex cell-cell and organ-organ interactions. We focus on the impact of alcohol on dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms and regulation of injury and repair in the liver. In particular, we discuss recent advances in understanding the disruption of balance between programmed cell death and prosurvival pathways, such as autophagy and membrane trafficking, in the pathogenesis of ALD. We also summarize current understanding of innate immune responses, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction and hepatic stellate cell activation, and gut-liver and adipose-liver cross talk in response to ethanol. In addition,we describe the current potential therapeutic targets and clinical trials aimed at alleviating hepatocyte injury, reducing inflammatory responses, and targeting gut microbiota, for the treatment of ALD.", "generated_text": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) remains a significant global health challenge, with its pathogenesis being a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Recent advances have elucidated the role of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, in the progression of ALD. These pathways contribute to hepatocyte injury and inflammation, exacerbating liver damage. Additionally, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been identified as critical mediators in the immune response to alcohol-induced liver injury, recognizing damage-associated molecular patterns and activating inflammatory cascades. The complement system, traditionally known for its role in innate immunity, has also been implicated in ALD pathogenesis, influencing both inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, the gut-liver axis has emerged as a pivotal factor, with gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability contributing to liver inflammation and injury. Understanding these mechanisms offers potential therapeutic targets for ALD, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to manage and treat this complex disease.", "label": 1}
