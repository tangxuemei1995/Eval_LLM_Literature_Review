{"grounding": "Molecular monitoring of tumor-derived alterations has an established role in the surveillance of leukemias, and emerging nucleic acid sequencing technologies are likely to similarly transform the clinical management of lymphomas. Lymphomas are well suited for molecular surveillance due to relatively high cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA concentrations, high somatic mutational burden, and the existence of stereotyped variants enabling focused interrogation of recurrently altered regions. Here, we review the clinical scenarios and key technologies applicable for the molecular monitoring of lymphomas, summarizing current evidence in the literature regarding molecular subtyping and classification, evaluation of treatment response, the surveillance of active cellular therapies, and emerging clinical trial strategies.", "generated_text": "Molecular monitoring of lymphomas through circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers a promising approach for assessing measurable residual disease (MRD) and treatment response. Utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS), ctDNA provides a non-invasive method to detect minimal disease levels, offering insights into tumor dynamics and therapeutic efficacy. This approach enhances traditional imaging and biopsy methods, allowing for real-time monitoring and personalized treatment adjustments. Recent advancements in NGS technology have improved the sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA detection, enabling earlier intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes. This review highlights the current methodologies, clinical applications, and future directions of ctDNA in lymphoma management, emphasizing its role in precision oncology.", "label": 1}
