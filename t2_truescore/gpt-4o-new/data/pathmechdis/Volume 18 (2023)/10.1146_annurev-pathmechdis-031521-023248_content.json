{"grounding": "Nerves not only regulate the homeostasis and energetic metabolism of normal epithelial cells but also are critical for cancer, as cancer recapitulates the biology of neural regulation of epithelial tissues. Cancer cells rarely develop in denervated organs, and denervation affects tumorigenesis, in vivo and in humans. Axonogenesis occurs to supply the new malignant epithelial growth with nerves. Neurogenesis happens later, first in ganglia around organs or the spinal column and subsequently through recruitment of neuroblasts from the central nervous system. The hallmark of this stage is regulation of homeostasis and energetic metabolism. Perineural invasion is the most efficient interaction between cancer cells and nerves. The hallmark of this stage is increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Finally, carcinoma cells transdifferentiate into a neuronal profile in search of neural independence. The latter is the last stage in neuroepithelial interactions. Treatments for cancer must address the biology of neural regulation of cancer.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between neuroepithelial components and cancerous tissues has emerged as a pivotal area of oncological research. This study delves into the mechanisms by which nerves influence tumor progression, focusing on axonogenesis and neurogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. We explore the phenomenon of perineural invasion, where cancer cells encroach upon and utilize nerve structures to facilitate metastasis. Additionally, the potential for neuronal transdifferentiation within tumors is examined, highlighting how cancer cells may acquire neuronal-like properties to enhance their survival and dissemination. By elucidating these neuroepithelial interactions, we aim to uncover novel therapeutic targets that could disrupt the supportive role of nerves in cancer progression. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating neurobiology and oncology, to better understand and combat the complex dynamics of cancer growth and spread. This research contributes to a growing body of evidence that positions the nervous system as a critical player in cancer biology.", "label": 1}
