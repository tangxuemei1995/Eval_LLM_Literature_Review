{"grounding": "Hepatocytes are the main workers in the hepatic factory, managing metabolism of nutrients and xenobiotics, production and recycling of proteins, and glucose and lipid homeostasis. Division of labor between hepatocytes is critical to coordinate complex complementary or opposing multistep processes, similar to distributed tasks at an assembly line. This so-called metabolic zonation has both spatial and temporal components. Spatial distribution of metabolic function in hepatocytes of different lobular zones is necessary to perform complex sequential multistep metabolic processes and to assign metabolic tasks to the right environment. Moreover, temporal control of metabolic processes is critical to align required metabolic processes to the feeding and fasting cycles. Disruption of this complex spatiotemporal hepatic organization impairs key metabolic processes with both local and systemic consequences. Many metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetes, are associated with impaired metabolic liver zonation. Recent technological advances shed new light on the spatiotemporal gene expression networks controlling liver function and how their deregulation may be involved in a large variety of diseases. We summarize the current knowledge about spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and consequences on liver pathobiology.", "generated_text": "The liver's unique spatial lobular organization and its dynamic metabolic zonation are critical for maintaining homeostasis and responding to physiological demands. This study explores the intricate interplay between spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and its implications for liver pathophysiology. We focus on the role of circadian rhythms and WNT signaling in regulating metabolic processes across different liver zones, highlighting their impact on hepatic detoxification and overall metabolic function. The research underscores the significance of these mechanisms in the context of liver monogenic diseases and broader liver pathologies. By examining the spatial and temporal aspects of liver function, we provide insights into how disruptions in these processes can lead to pathological states. Furthermore, the study discusses the potential of chronopharmacology as a therapeutic strategy to optimize drug efficacy and minimize toxicity by aligning treatment regimens with the liver's metabolic cycles. Our findings emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of liver zonation and its temporal dynamics to develop targeted interventions for liver diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches.", "label": 1}
