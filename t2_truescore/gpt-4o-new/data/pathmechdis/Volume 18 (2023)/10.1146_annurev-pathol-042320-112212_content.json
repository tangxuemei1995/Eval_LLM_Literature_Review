{"grounding": "Tuft cells are found in tissues with distinct stem cell compartments, tissue architecture, and luminal exposures but converge on a shared transcriptional program, including expression of taste transduction signaling pathways. Here, we summarize seminal and recent findings on tuft cells, focusing on major categories of function\u2014instigation of type 2 cytokine responses, orchestration of antimicrobial responses, and emerging roles in tissue repair\u2014and describe tuft cell\u2013derived molecules used to affect these functional programs. We review what is known about the development of tuft cells from epithelial progenitors under homeostatic conditions and during disease. Finally, we discuss evidence that immature, or nascent, tuft cells with potential for diverse functions are driven toward dominant effector programs by tissue- or perturbation-specific contextual cues, which may result in heterogeneous mature tuft cell phenotypes both within and between tissues.", "generated_text": "Tuft cells, a conserved epithelial lineage, exhibit context- and tissue-specific programming, playing pivotal roles in various physiological and immunological processes. These cells are characterized by type II taste transduction pathways and are known to secrete signaling molecules such as IL-25, acetylcholine, and cysteinyl leukotrienes. Their ability to modulate mucociliary clearance and promote type 2 immunity highlights their importance in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and responding to parasitic infections. Recent studies have elucidated the diverse functions of tuft cells across different tissues, emphasizing their adaptability and specialized roles. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing tuft cell differentiation and function could provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for diseases involving epithelial dysfunction and immune dysregulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge on tuft cell biology, focusing on their tissue-specific roles and contributions to immune responses.", "label": 1}
