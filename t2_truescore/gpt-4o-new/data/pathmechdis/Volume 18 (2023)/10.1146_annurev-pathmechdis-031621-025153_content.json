{"grounding": "African trypanosomes are bloodstream protozoan parasites that infect mammals including humans, where they cause sleeping sickness. Long-lasting infection is required to favor parasite transmission between hosts. Therefore, trypanosomes have developed strategies to continuously escape innate and adaptive responses of the immune system, while also preventing premature death of the host. The pathology linked to infection mainly results from inflammation and includes anemia and brain dysfunction in addition to loss of specificity and memory of the antibody response. The serum of humans contains an efficient trypanolytic factor, the membrane pore-forming protein apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). In the two human-infective trypanosomes, specific parasite resistance factors inhibit APOL1 activity. In turn, many African individuals express APOL1 variants that counteract these resistance factors, enabling them to avoid sleeping sickness. However, these variants are associated with chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of virus-induced inflammation such as coronavirus disease 2019. Vaccination perspectives are discussed.", "generated_text": "African trypanosomiasis, commonly known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease caused by African trypanosomes. The pathogenesis of this disease is intricately linked to the parasite's ability to evade the host immune system through antigenic variation, primarily mediated by the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). This mechanism allows the trypanosomes to persist in the host by continuously altering their surface antigens, thereby avoiding immune detection. Recent studies have highlighted the role of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) in the host's defense against trypanosomes, as certain APOL1 variants confer resistance to the parasite. However, these variants are also associated with an increased risk of kidney disease, presenting a complex interplay between host defense and disease susceptibility. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying VSG switching and APOL1-mediated resistance is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies against African trypanosomiasis and mitigating associated kidney disease risks.", "label": 1}
