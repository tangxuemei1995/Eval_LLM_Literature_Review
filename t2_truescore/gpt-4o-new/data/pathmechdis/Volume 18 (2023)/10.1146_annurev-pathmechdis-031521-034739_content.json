{"grounding": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging virus from the Flaviviridae family that is transmitted to humans by mosquito vectors and represents an important health problem. Infections in pregnant women are of major concern because of potential devastating consequences during pregnancy and have been associated with microcephaly in newborns. ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis. We discuss recent reports on the mechanisms used by ZIKV to replicate efficiently, and we highlight potential new areas of research for the development of therapeutic approaches.", "generated_text": "The pathogenesis of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection involves complex interactions between viral and host factors, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. ZIKV exhibits a broad tropism, infecting various cell types, including neural progenitor cells, which contributes to its neurotropic effects and associated congenital abnormalities. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in ZIKV pathogenesis, particularly the involvement of TRIM7, a ubiquitin E3 ligase. TRIM7 has been shown to facilitate ZIKV replication by modulating the host's antiviral immune responses. ZIKV employs multiple strategies to antagonize host immune defenses, including the inhibition of type I interferon signaling pathways, which are crucial for controlling viral infections. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV's immune evasion and tissue tropism is essential for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on ZIKV pathogenesis, emphasizing the interplay between viral factors and host immune responses, and identifies potential avenues for future research.", "label": 1}
