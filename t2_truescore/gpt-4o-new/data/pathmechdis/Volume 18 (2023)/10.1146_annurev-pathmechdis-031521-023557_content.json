{"grounding": "Metastatic dissemination has lethal consequences for cancer patients. Accruing evidence supports the hypothesis that tumor cells can migrate and metastasize as clusters of cells while maintaining contacts with one another. Collective metastasis enables tumor cells to colonize secondary sites more efficiently, resist cell death, and evade the immune system. On the other hand, tumor cell clusters face unique challenges for dissemination particularly during systemic dissemination. Here, we review recent progress toward understanding how tumor cell clusters overcome these disadvantages as well as mechanisms they utilize to gain advantages throughout the metastatic process. We consider useful models for studying collective metastasis and reflect on how the study of collective metastasis suggests new opportunities for eradicating and preventing metastatic disease.", "generated_text": "Collective metastasis, a process where tumor cell clusters migrate and colonize distant organs, plays a pivotal role in cancer progression. This study investigates the orchestration of collective migration and metastasis by tumor cell clusters, emphasizing the mechanisms of polyclonal seeding and collective signaling. Circulating tumor cell clusters exhibit enhanced metastatic potential compared to single cells, attributed to their ability to maintain intercellular communication and cooperative behavior. The research highlights the significance of collective signaling pathways in facilitating the survival and adaptation of these clusters in the bloodstream and during colonization. Understanding these processes provides insights into potential therapeutic targets aimed at disrupting collective migration and reducing metastatic spread, offering promising avenues for cancer treatment.", "label": 1}
