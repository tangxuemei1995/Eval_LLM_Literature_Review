{"grounding": "Tumor cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can function as mediators of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment. EVs contain a host of bioactive cargo, including membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins, in addition to noncoding RNAs, other RNA types, and double-stranded DNA fragments. These shed vesicles may deposit paracrine information and can also be taken up by stromal cells, causing the recipient cells to undergo phenotypic changes that profoundly impact diverse facets of cancer progression. For example, this unique form of cellular cross talk helps condition the premetastatic niche, facilitates evasion of the immune response, and promotes invasive and metastatic activity. These findings, coupled with those demonstrating that the number and content of EVs produced by tumors can vary depending on their tumor of origin, disease stage, or response to therapy, have raised the exciting possibility that EVs can be used for risk stratification, diagnostic, and even prognostic purposes. We summarize recent developments and the current knowledge of EV cargoes, their impact on disease progression, and implementation of EV-based liquid biopsies as tumor biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), encompassing exosomes and microvesicles, are increasingly recognized as pivotal players in the tumor microenvironment. These multifunctional entities facilitate intercellular communication by transferring bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, to various recipient cells such as carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating cells. This transfer modulates the behavior of these cells, promoting processes like cell migration and tumor invasion, which are critical for cancer progression. The diverse cargoes of EVs reflect the dynamic state of the tumor, offering insights into tumor biology and potential biomarkers for liquid biopsies. Recent studies highlight the role of EVs in remodeling the tumor microenvironment, enhancing angiogenesis, and evading immune surveillance. Understanding the mechanisms governing EV biogenesis, release, and uptake is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting these pathways. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the functional roles of tumor-derived EVs, emphasizing their potential as diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets in oncology, thereby advancing the field of cancer research and treatment.", "label": 1}
