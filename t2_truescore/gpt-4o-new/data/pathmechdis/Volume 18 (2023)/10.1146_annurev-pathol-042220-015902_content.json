{"grounding": "Despite the advent of sophisticated and efficient new biologics to treat inflammation in asthma, the disease persists. Even following treatment, many patients still experience the well-known symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. What are we missing? Here we examine the evidence that mucus plugs contribute to a substantial portion of disease, not only by physically obstructing the airways but also by perpetuating inflammation. In this way, mucus plugs may act as an immunogenic stimulus even in the absence of allergen or with the use of current therapeutics. The alterations of several parameters of mucus biology, driven by type 2 inflammation, result in sticky and tenacious sputum, which represents a potent threat, first due to the difficulties in expectoration and second by acting as a platform for viral, bacterial, or fungal colonization that allows exacerbations. Therefore, in this way, mucus plugs are an overlooked but critical feature of asthmatic airway disease.", "generated_text": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation and obstruction, often leading to significant morbidity. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying airway obstruction in asthma remain incompletely understood. This review explores the role of mucus hypersecretion and its components, particularly focusing on galectin-10, a protein implicated in the formation of Charcot-Leyden crystals, which are frequently observed in asthmatic airways. The interaction between galectin-10 and neutrophils, a type of immune cell involved in the inflammatory response, is examined to elucidate their contribution to airway obstruction. Neutrophils, traditionally associated with bacterial infections, are increasingly recognized for their role in non-infectious inflammatory conditions like asthma. Understanding the complex interplay between these factors is crucial for developing targeted therapies aimed at reducing mucus production and improving airway patency. This review highlights the need for further research to clarify these mechanisms and improve clinical outcomes for asthma patients.", "label": 1}
