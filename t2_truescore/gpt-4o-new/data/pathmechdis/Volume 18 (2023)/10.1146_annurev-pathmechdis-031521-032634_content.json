{"grounding": "Among human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-associated disorders, celiac disease has an immunopathogenesis that is particularly well understood. The condition is characterized by hypersensitivity to cereal gluten proteins, and the disease lesion is localized in the gut. Still, the diagnosis can be made by detection of highly disease-specific autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 in the blood. We now have mechanistic insights into how the disease-predisposing HLA-DQ molecules, via presentation of posttranslationally modified gluten peptides, are connected to the generation of these autoantibodies. This review presents our current understanding of the immunobiology of this common disorder that is positioned in the border zone between food hypersensitivity and autoimmunity.", "generated_text": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals, primarily associated with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 alleles. The pathogenesis involves an aberrant immune response where gluten peptides, modified by transglutaminase 2, are presented by antigen-presenting cells to CD4+ T cells, leading to an inflammatory cascade. This response results in the activation of B cells, producing autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2, and subsequent intestinal tissue damage. Understanding the immunobiology of celiac disease, including the roles of T and B cells, is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving diagnostic strategies. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying celiac disease pathogenesis.", "label": 1}
