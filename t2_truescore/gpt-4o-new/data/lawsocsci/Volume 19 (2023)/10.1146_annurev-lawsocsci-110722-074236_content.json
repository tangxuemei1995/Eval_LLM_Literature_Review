{"grounding": "My scholarly career has centered around articulating and testing a model of legitimacy-based law and governance. In recent decades, that model has achieved considerable success in shaping the way legal authority is understood and exercised. At the same time the legitimacy of legal, political, and social institutions and authorities has declined, raising questions about the future viability of a legitimacy-based model. In this review, I discuss the ascension and potential decline of legitimacy-based governance and outline alternative models of authority that may emerge in the twenty-first century. Three issues are addressed: whether there are ways to reinvigorate legitimacy-based law and governance; whether social norms, moral values, or ideologies are viable alternative forms of authority; and whether it is better to accept that no single form of authority works best in all situations and theories should focus on identifying the contingencies under which different forms of authority are most desirable.", "generated_text": "This study explores the evolving concept of legitimacy in legal authority within the context of the twenty-first century, focusing on the interplay between trust, confidence, and normative alignment. As societies become increasingly complex and interconnected, traditional notions of legal legitimacy are challenged by diverse cultural, social, and technological factors. This research examines how these dynamics influence compliance, cooperation, and engagement with legal systems. By analyzing autobiographical narratives, the study provides insights into individual and collective perceptions of legal authority, highlighting the role of personal and societal experiences in shaping legitimacy. The findings suggest that fostering trust and confidence in legal institutions requires a nuanced understanding of normative alignment, where legal frameworks resonate with the values and expectations of the populace. This research contributes to the broader discourse on legal legitimacy, offering a framework for enhancing the effectiveness and acceptance of legal systems in contemporary society.", "label": 0}
