{"grounding": "Medical aid in dying (MAID) has been a productive target for social scientific inquiry at the intersections of law and medicine over the past two decades. Insofar as MAID crystallizes and reflects personal and cultural understandings of key concepts such as individualism, dependency, dignity, and care, it is a rich site for social scientific theorizing. This article reviews and assesses the contributions of social scientific perspectives to research on MAID. We propose that social scientific research on MAID offers four distinctive contributions: its descriptive (rather than normative) orientation, its focus on cultural meanings, its insights into processes of knowledge production, and its comparative lens. The article's major sections describe (a) attitudes toward MAID, (b) MAID-related social movements, (c) legalization approaches, and (d) lived experiences of MAID in permissive jurisdictions. We conclude by reflecting on how MAID scholarship can inform social inquiry into other areas in which law and medicine converge.", "generated_text": "Medical aid in dying (MAID) represents a significant intersection of medicine, law, and cultural values, challenging traditional perspectives on death and dying. This paper explores the evolving landscape of MAID, examining its implications for healthcare professionals, legal systems, and societal norms. As more jurisdictions legalize assisted suicide and euthanasia, the discourse surrounding the right to die has intensified, driven by social movements advocating for patient autonomy and dignity in end-of-life care. The study analyzes the ethical considerations and legal frameworks that govern MAID, highlighting the diverse approaches adopted globally. It also investigates the cultural shifts that influence public opinion and policy-making, reflecting broader changes in how societies perceive death. By integrating perspectives from medicine, law, and cultural studies, this research provides a comprehensive overview of the new frontiers in MAID, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in balancing individual rights with ethical and societal responsibilities.", "label": 1}
