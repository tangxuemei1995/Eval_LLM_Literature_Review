{"grounding": "Research on vaccines in the law and social sciences skews heavily toward an instrumentalist approach to knowledge in service of vaccine promotion. Overcoming hesitancy and promoting vaccine acceptance have been major goals, but successful levers for behavioral change remain elusive. Research with constructivist approaches to vaccines from feminist sociology and anthropology has uncovered ethnographic richness to describe how vaccine debates illuminate inequalities in parenting and re-entrench patterns of racism and colonialism. There is considerable potential in science and technology studies approaches that take seriously the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics, though there are considerable methodological challenges for these research designs. This review charts the lopsided bibliography of law and social science research on vaccines, asking why scholars rarely move away from instrumentalist conceptions of law in the service of public health and, when they do, explaining what theoretical tools enable it.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of law, public health, and science through the lens of vaccines, employing an interdisciplinary approach that integrates sociolegal studies, ethnography, and science and technology studies (STS). By moving beyond the traditional view of law as merely a regulatory tool, this research examines how legal frameworks interact with social, cultural, and technological dimensions in the context of vaccination. Through ethnographic methods, the study captures the lived experiences and perceptions of various stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public. It highlights the complex sociolegal landscapes that shape vaccine development, distribution, and acceptance. The findings underscore the importance of understanding vaccines not only as medical interventions but as socio-technical artifacts embedded within broader societal structures. This research contributes to a more nuanced comprehension of public health strategies, advocating for policies that are informed by interdisciplinary insights and responsive to the dynamic interplay of law, society, and technology.", "label": 0}
