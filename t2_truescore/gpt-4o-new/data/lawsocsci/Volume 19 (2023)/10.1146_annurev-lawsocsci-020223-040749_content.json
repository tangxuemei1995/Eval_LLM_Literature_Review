{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a salient but polarizing issue of recent times. Actors around the world are engaged in building a governance regime around it. What exactly the \u201cit\u201d is that is being governed, how, by who, and why\u2014these are all less clear. In this review, we attempt to shine some light on those questions, considering literature on AI, the governance of computing, and regulation and governance more broadly. We take critical stock of the different modalities of the global governance of AI that have been emerging, such as ethical councils, industry governance, contracts and licensing, standards, international agreements, and domestic legislation with extraterritorial impact. Considering these, we examine selected rationales and tensions that underpin them, drawing attention to the interests and ideas driving these different modalities. As these regimes become clearer and more stable, we urge those engaging with or studying the global governance of AI to constantly ask the important question of all global governance regimes: Who benefits?", "generated_text": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has prompted a critical examination of their implications for global governance. This study explores the modalities and rationales underpinning AI regulation, highlighting the complex interplay between technological innovation and regulatory frameworks. By analyzing the diverse approaches to algorithmic regulation, the research identifies key tensions that arise in the pursuit of harmonized global governance structures. These tensions include the balance between innovation and control, the protection of individual rights versus collective security, and the challenges of ensuring equitable access to AI benefits across different geopolitical landscapes. The paper argues for a nuanced understanding of AI's transformative potential, advocating for collaborative international efforts to establish coherent regulatory standards. Such efforts are essential to mitigate risks while fostering an environment conducive to ethical AI development and deployment. Ultimately, this research contributes to the discourse on how global governance can adapt to the evolving landscape of AI, ensuring its alignment with broader societal goals.", "label": 1}
