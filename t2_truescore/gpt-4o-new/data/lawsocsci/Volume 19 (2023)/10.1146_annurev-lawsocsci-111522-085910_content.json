{"grounding": "In 1978, Congress created a new federal bankruptcy law that has since become a key part of the American capital markets. I examine how large companies and their investors contract to make bankruptcy more or less likely, how distressed firms negotiate with creditors outside of bankruptcy, and how companies plan for a Chapter 11 filing and navigate the bankruptcy system. I also survey the strategic moves, ranging from litigation to financing, that activist investors deploy to improve their bargaining power and earn higher returns. The American bankruptcy system is evolving constantly, and prevailing accounts of bankruptcy law quickly become stale, creating a constant need for new empirical research to establish a foundation for policy making.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the complexities of bankruptcy law, focusing on the intricacies of Chapter 11 and its role in corporate reorganization. Despite its critical importance in corporate law, significant gaps remain in understanding its full implications and effectiveness. The research examines known aspects of Chapter 11, such as its procedural framework and intended outcomes, while highlighting lesser-known challenges, including its impact on stakeholders and long-term corporate viability. By synthesizing existing literature and identifying areas for further investigation, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of bankruptcy law, offering insights into potential reforms and strategies to enhance the efficacy of corporate reorganization under Chapter 11.", "label": 1}
