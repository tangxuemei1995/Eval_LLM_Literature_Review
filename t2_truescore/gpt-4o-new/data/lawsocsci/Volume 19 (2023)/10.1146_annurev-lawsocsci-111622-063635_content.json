{"grounding": "This review addresses three questions surrounding authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China. First, what is legality, and does it exist in China's Leninist single-party state? Scholars who characterize the system as order maintenance find the absence of legality. Those employing dual-state and instrumentalist views of law find partial legality. Scholars promoting the notion of bare legality find complete legality. Second, does authoritarian legality strengthen regime legitimacy? Scholars agree that the state seeks legitimation through its embrace of authoritarian legality. Empirical research tests this claim. Third, is China in transition from plan to market, and what is the role of law in state capitalism? The teleology of the transition paradigm overlooks illiberal underpinnings of property rights and factor markets. Answers to these questions help explain regime resilience, economic growth, economic crisis, and inequality in China. Both the institution of the dual state and the perpetuation of plan elements reinforce state power.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate relationship between authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China, focusing on the dual state system's impact on property rights, markets, land, and labor. The research explores how China's unique blend of authoritarian governance and market-oriented reforms has shaped its legal framework, particularly in terms of rule of law and economic development. By analyzing the dual state concept, which differentiates between the formal legal system and the informal practices that often override it, the study highlights the complexities of property rights enforcement and market regulation. The findings suggest that while the Chinese state employs legal mechanisms to facilitate economic growth and maintain social stability, it simultaneously exercises discretionary power to control key resources such as land and labor. This dual approach enables the state to sustain its authoritarian rule while promoting a form of state capitalism that is distinctively Chinese, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of this model.", "label": 1}
