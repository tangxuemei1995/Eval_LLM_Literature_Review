{"grounding": "International agreements on Intellectual Property (IP) have proven to be a good example to study global lawmaking. Beginning by looking at the 1990s Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and into the negotiation and implementation of regional and national trade agreements, this article reflects on the intricate relationship between international IP agreements and public health. The comprehensive analysis of these international rules and their effect provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping health policies. Building upon the IP case, we categorize existing scholarship on global lawmaking into three methodological approaches: (a) methodological internationalism, (b) methodological nationalism, and (c) the interplay between domestic and international factors. We close with a call for researchers to advocate and integrate into their methods a co-constitutive approach that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of global lawmaking, intellectual property rights, and international health emergencies, emphasizing the need to transcend methodological nationalism. By examining the evolution of international agreements, the research highlights how intellectual property frameworks influence global health responses. The analysis reveals that traditional nation-centric approaches often overlook the complexities of global governance and the transnational nature of health crises. Through case studies of recent health emergencies, the study demonstrates the impact of intellectual property laws on access to essential medicines and vaccines. It argues for a more integrated approach to global lawmaking that considers diverse stakeholders and cross-border challenges. The findings underscore the importance of collaborative international efforts in crafting legal frameworks that balance innovation incentives with public health needs, ultimately contributing to more effective global health governance.", "label": 1}
