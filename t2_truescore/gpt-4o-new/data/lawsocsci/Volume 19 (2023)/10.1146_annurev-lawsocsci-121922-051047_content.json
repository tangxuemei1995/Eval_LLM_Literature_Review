{"grounding": "Feminists have long demonstrated the invisibility of women's reproductive labor, performed in bearing and raising children, maintaining households, and socially sustaining male labor. Every wave of feminist struggle from the late nineteenth century onward has actively queried the inequalities that characterize women's performance of such work, variously referred to as unpaid domestic and care work, domestic labor, or care work. Robust traditions of scholarship on women's unpaid work animate various disciplines, often spilling into political struggles for adequate recognition of this work. As the pandemic has rendered visible once again the reproductive labor of women the world over, this article offers an overview of social reproduction theory, feminist legal theorizations of reproductive labor, and how we might recuperate a rich tradition of theorizing on social reproduction to develop a materialist approach to law's regulation of reproductive labor across the marriage-market spectrum with a view to social and economic justice.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between social reproduction and legal frameworks, emphasizing the often-overlooked roles of unpaid domestic and care work. By integrating perspectives from legal realism and materialist feminism, the research highlights how legal systems perpetuate gendered divisions of labor, reinforcing economic and social inequalities. The analysis delves into the historical and contemporary legal structures that shape and sustain the undervaluation of domestic work, arguing for a reconceptualization of law and political economy to address these disparities. Through a critical examination of legal texts and policies, the study reveals the systemic biases that marginalize unpaid labor, advocating for legal reforms that recognize and redistribute the burdens of social reproduction. This work contributes to the broader discourse on gender justice and economic equity, proposing a transformative legal approach that aligns with the realities of care and domestic work in modern societies.", "label": 1}
