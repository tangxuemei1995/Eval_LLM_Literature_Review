{"grounding": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many complexities involved in using data and advanced technologies to help resolve public health emergencies. These complexities highlight the need to embrace a broader framework of data governance with three foundational questions: (a) who decides about data flows, (b) on what basis, and (c) with what accountability and oversight. These questions can accommodate the issues that have arisen in the literature regarding new types of data harms. However, these questions also foreground important issues of power, authority, and legitimacy. Data governance can provide an organizing normative framework to address emerging data themes including access to data, collective decision making, data intermediaries, data sovereignty, design and digital infrastructure, regulatory technologies, the rule of law, and social trust and license. The pandemic experience with contact tracing apps, in particular, showed the many unresolved governance challenges.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored significant gaps in data governance, particularly in the context of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for public health interventions. This study examines the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid deployment of data-driven technologies, such as contact tracing apps, which have raised critical concerns about privacy and trust. The analysis highlights the inadequacies in existing data governance frameworks to address these concerns, emphasizing the need for robust privacy by design principles. By exploring case studies and policy responses, the research identifies key areas where data governance must evolve to balance public health imperatives with individual privacy rights. The findings suggest that fostering trust through transparent and accountable data practices is essential for the effective use of AI in managing future health crises, thereby closing the data governance gap exposed by the pandemic.", "label": 1}
