{"grounding": "This review examines the historical and contemporary factors driving immigrant worker precarity and the central role of race in achieving worker justice. We build from the framework of racial capitalism and historicize the legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession, which have cemented an exclusionary economic system in the United States and globally. We consider how racism and colonial legacies create migrant displacement and shape the experiences of immigrant workers. We also detail how racism permeates the immigration bureaucracy, driving migrant worker precarity. The traditional labor movement has played an important role in closing this gap, but increasingly so have worker centers and the immigrant rights movement as a whole. These partnerships have had to navigate coalitional tensions as they build new strategies for realizing immigrant worker rights.", "generated_text": "This study critically examines the intersection of race and low-wage immigrant labor, highlighting the pervasive influence of racism in shaping labor experiences and rights. By centering race in the analysis, the research reveals how racial hierarchies and discrimination exacerbate vulnerabilities among immigrant workers, often relegating them to precarious employment conditions. The study draws on a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating sociological, economic, and legal perspectives to explore the systemic barriers faced by these workers. It argues for a justice-oriented framework that acknowledges the racialized dimensions of labor exploitation and advocates for policy reforms to enhance the rights and protections of immigrant laborers. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the racial dynamics in labor markets and calls for more inclusive and equitable labor practices.", "label": 1}
