{"grounding": "In this review, we explore the impact of technology on US and UK law firms, focusing in particular on the recent machine learning wave of artificial intelligence. Technology has not so far ushered the end of law firms as we know them. Adoption of artificial intelligence/machine learning is in its early stages in the sector, and its impact has been constrained by the scope of use cases for which it is so far well-suited. Technology is nevertheless transforming law firms, in the sense of leading to material changes to their current forms, in the following novel ways: (a) deployment not only in the back office but in the front office, affecting lawyers\u2019 core tasks of advising clients; (b) opportunities for lawyers to pursue alternative career paths with different skill sets across the profession; and (c) emerging options for law firms to adopt business models creating value from nonhuman capital and nonlegal human capital.", "generated_text": "The integration of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), into law firms is reshaping the legal profession, though the extent of this transformation varies. This study examines the impact of technological advancements on law firms, focusing on AI's role in enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and client service. While some firms have embraced these innovations, leading to significant organizational changes and improved service delivery, others remain resistant, citing concerns over cost, security, and the potential loss of traditional legal skills. The concept of organizational complementarity is explored, highlighting how technology can complement human expertise rather than replace it. The research identifies key factors influencing the adoption of technology, including firm size, client demands, and regulatory environments. Ultimately, the study concludes that while technology holds the potential to transform law firms, its success depends on strategic implementation and the willingness of legal professionals to adapt to new tools and methodologies.", "label": 1}
