{"grounding": "Talpid moles and spotted hyenas have become the paradigms of anatomical and behavioral female masculinization. Females of many mole species develop ovotestes that produce testosterone, show external genitalia that resemble that of males, and close their vaginal orifice after every estrus, and female spotted hyenas lack an external vaginal orifice and develop a pseudoscrotum and a large pseudopenis through which they urinate, mate, and give birth. We review current knowledge about several significant aspects of the biology and evolution of these females, including (a) their specific study methods; (b) their unique anatomical features, and how these peculiarities influence certain physiological functions; and (c) the role that steroid hormones as well as genetic and environmental factors may have in urogenital system development, aggressive behavior, and social dominance. Nevertheless, both mole and hyena females are exceptionally efficient mothers, so their peculiar genitalia should not call into question their femininity.", "generated_text": "This study explores the unique biological and evolutionary adaptations of female masculinization in talpid moles and spotted hyenas, focusing on their reproductive and behavioral traits. Both species exhibit remarkable female characteristics, such as the presence of ovotestes in moles and the development of a pseudopenis in hyenas, which are linked to elevated androgen levels. These adaptations are hypothesized to confer advantages in social dominance and reproductive success, facilitating aggressive behavior that is typically associated with males. The research delves into the genetic and hormonal mechanisms underlying these traits, examining how they have evolved in response to environmental pressures and social structures. By comparing these two distinct species, the study provides insights into the convergent evolution of female masculinization and its implications for understanding sexual dimorphism and adaptive strategies in mammals. This work contributes to a broader understanding of the evolutionary biology of gender and reproductive strategies.", "label": 1}
