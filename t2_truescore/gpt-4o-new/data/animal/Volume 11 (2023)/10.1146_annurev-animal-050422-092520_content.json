{"grounding": "For nearly a century, evolutionary biologists have observed chromosomes that cause lethality when made homozygous persisting at surprisingly high frequencies (>25%) in natural populations of many species. The evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of such detrimental mutations have been heavily debated\u2014are some lethal mutations under balancing selection? We suggest that mutation\u2013selection balance alone cannot explain lethal variation in nature and the possibility that other forces play a role. We review the potential that linked selection in particular may drive maintenance of lethal alleles through associative overdominance or linkage to beneficial mutations or by reducing effective population size. Over the past five decades, investigation into this mystery has tapered. During this time, key scientific advances have provided the ability to collect more accurate data and analyze them in new ways, making the underlying genetic bases and evolutionary forces of lethal alleles timely for study once more.", "generated_text": "The persistence of recessive lethal alleles in natural populations poses intriguing questions about the underlying evolutionary mechanisms. This study explores the roles of mutation\u2013selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in maintaining such genetic variation. Mutation\u2013selection balance suggests that recurrent mutations introduce lethal alleles, which are then purged by selection. However, heterozygote advantage, where heterozygotes exhibit superior fitness, may also contribute to the retention of these alleles. Additionally, associative overdominance, a form of linked selection, can preserve lethal alleles when they are in linkage disequilibrium with beneficial alleles, potentially forming supergenes. By integrating theoretical models with empirical data, this research elucidates the complex interplay of these mechanisms, highlighting their relative contributions to genetic diversity. The findings underscore the importance of considering multiple evolutionary forces in understanding the maintenance of deleterious alleles, offering insights into broader questions of genetic variation and adaptation in natural populations.", "label": 1}
