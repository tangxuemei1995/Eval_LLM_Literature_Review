{"grounding": "Homeostatic control and reproductive functions of humans are regulated at the molecular levels largely by peptide hormones secreted from endocrine and/or neuroendocrine cells in the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Homologs of those hormones and their receptors function similarly in many vertebrate species distantly related to humans, but the evolutionary history of the endocrine system involving those factors has been obscured by the scarcity of genome DNA sequence information of some taxa that potentially contain their orthologs. Focusing on non-osteichthyan vertebrates, namely jawless and cartilaginous fishes, this article illustrates how investigating genome sequence information assists our understanding of the diversification of vertebrate gene repertoires in four broad themes: (a) the presence or absence of genes, (b) multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, (c) differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and (d) the evolutionary timing of gene origins.", "generated_text": "The evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors is a pivotal aspect of understanding vertebrate physiology and adaptation. This study delves into the genomic data of non-osteichthyan species, particularly cartilaginous fishes and cyclostomes, to trace the evolutionary trajectories of key hormones such as leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin. By analyzing these ancient lineages, we uncover the molecular innovations and diversifications that predate the osteichthyan lineage, offering insights into the ancestral roles and regulatory mechanisms of these hormones. Our findings suggest that the hormonal systems in these early vertebrates exhibit both conserved and unique features, reflecting their ecological niches and evolutionary pressures. This research not only enhances our understanding of vertebrate endocrinology but also provides a framework for exploring the functional evolution of hormone-receptor interactions across diverse vertebrate taxa.", "label": 0}
