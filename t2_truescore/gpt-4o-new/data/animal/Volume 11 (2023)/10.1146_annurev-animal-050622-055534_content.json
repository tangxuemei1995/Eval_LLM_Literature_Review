{"grounding": "Advances in DNA sequencing and other technologies have greatly facilitated the identification of genetic risk factors for inherited diseases in dogs. We review recent technological developments based on selected examples from canine disease genetics. The identification of disease-causing variants in dogs with monogenic diseases may become a widely employed diagnostic approach in clinical veterinary medicine in the not-too-distant future. Diseases with complex modes of inheritance continue to pose challenges to researchers but have also become much more tangible than in the past. In addition to strategies for identifying genetic risk factors, we provide some thoughts on the interpretation of sequence variants that are largely inspired by developments in human clinical genetics.", "generated_text": "The study of genetic risk factors in Canis lupus familiaris offers significant insights into both monogenic and complex diseases, enhancing our understanding of veterinary and human medicine. Utilizing advanced genomic technologies, this research identifies specific genetic variants associated with canine diseases, providing a foundation for precision medicine in veterinary practice. The findings underscore the importance of dogs as a model for human diseases, aligning with the One Health initiative that emphasizes interconnected health of humans, animals, and ecosystems. By elucidating genetic predispositions, this study contributes to improved diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies, ultimately advancing the field of veterinary medicine and offering translational benefits to human health.", "label": 0}
