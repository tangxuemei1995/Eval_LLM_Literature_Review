{"grounding": "Zoonoses are diseases and infections naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals. Over the years, zoonoses have become increasingly significant threats to global health. They form the dominant group of diseases among the emerging infectious diseases (EID) and currently account for 73% of EID. Approximately 25% of zoonoses originate in domestic animals. The etiological agents of zoonoses include different pathogens, with viruses accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly, by contact, via aerosols, through a vector, or vertically in utero. Zoonotic diseases are found in every continent except Antarctica. Numerous factors associated with the pathogen, human activities, and the environment play significant roles in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Effective response and control of zoonotic diseases call for multiple-sector involvement and collaboration according to the One Health concept.", "generated_text": "Domestic animals play a crucial role in the epidemiology of zoonotic viral diseases, acting as potential reservoir hosts that facilitate the transmission of pathogens to humans. This study explores the dynamics of emerging and endemic viral zoonoses within domestic animal populations, emphasizing their significance in the context of global health threats and pandemics. By integrating the One Health approach, which considers the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, this research highlights the necessity of monitoring domestic animals for early detection and control of zoonotic viruses. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in identifying and mitigating the risks posed by these animals as reservoirs, ultimately contributing to the development of effective strategies for preventing future outbreaks. This work calls for enhanced surveillance and research efforts to better understand the complex interactions between domestic animals and zoonotic viral pathogens.", "label": 0}
