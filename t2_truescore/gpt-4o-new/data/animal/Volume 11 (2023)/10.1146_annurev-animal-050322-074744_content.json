{"grounding": "Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are the longest-lived rodents with a maximum life span exceeding 37 years. They exhibit a delayed aging phenotype and resistance to age-related functional decline/diseases. Specifically, they do not display increased mortality with age, maintain several physiological functions until nearly the end of their lifetime, and rarely develop cancer and Alzheimer's disease. NMRs live in a hypoxic environment in underground colonies in East Africa and are highly tolerant of hypoxia. These unique characteristics of NMRs have attracted considerable interest from zoological and biomedical researchers. This review summarizes previous studies of the ecology, hypoxia tolerance, longevity/delayed aging, and cancer resistance of NMRs and discusses possible mechanisms contributing to their healthy aging. In addition, we discuss current issues and future perspectives to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying delayed aging and resistance to age-related diseases in NMRs.", "generated_text": "The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has emerged as a remarkable model for studying healthy aging due to its exceptional longevity and resistance to age-related diseases, such as cancer. This eusocial rodent, native to East Africa, exhibits a lifespan significantly longer than that of other rodents, often exceeding 30 years. Key factors contributing to its longevity include unique cellular mechanisms that enhance genomic stability, efficient protein homeostasis, and a robust antioxidant defense system. Additionally, the naked mole-rat's ability to thrive in low-oxygen environments (hypoxia) and its complex social structure provide insights into the interplay between environmental adaptation and sociality in promoting healthspan. Understanding these mechanisms offers potential translational applications for human aging and age-related diseases. This review synthesizes current research on the biological and environmental factors underpinning the naked mole-rat's resistance to aging, highlighting its potential as a model organism for developing interventions to promote healthy aging in humans.", "label": 1}
