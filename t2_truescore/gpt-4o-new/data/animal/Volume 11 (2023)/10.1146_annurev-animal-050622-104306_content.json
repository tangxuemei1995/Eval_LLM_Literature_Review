{"grounding": "Zoos and aquariums have evolved significantly. From their origins as enclosures for the mere entertainment of the public, these institutions have undertaken new functions responding to the biodiversity crisis and social demands. Modern zoos and aquariums have the opportunity to educate people, contribute to species conservation, and produce animal-related research. However, there is increasing criticism toward the outcomes of their actions and the holding of species in their facilities. This review offers an integrated analysis of the state of knowledge about the role that zoos and aquariums play today. It describes their performance regarding their conservation, education, and research functions, highlighting general patterns and offering future perspectives. It identifies some challenges common to all these institutions, concluding that the way they keep up with the ever-growing social and environmental expectations will be decisive hereafter.", "generated_text": "In a rapidly changing world, zoos and aquariums play a pivotal role in biodiversity conservation and environmental education. This study examines their contributions to captive breeding and species reintroduction programs, which are crucial for preserving endangered species. By providing controlled environments, these institutions facilitate scientific research that enhances our understanding of animal behavior, genetics, and ecology. Furthermore, zoos and aquariums serve as educational platforms, raising public awareness about environmental issues and promoting conservation efforts. However, the ethical considerations of animal welfare remain a significant concern, necessitating ongoing evaluation and improvement of living conditions. This research underscores the importance of balancing conservation goals with ethical responsibilities, highlighting the need for zoos and aquariums to adapt and innovate in response to global environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
