{"grounding": "Addressing important questions in animal ecology, physiology, and environmental science often requires in situ information from wild animals. This difficulty is being overcome by biologging and biotelemetry, or the use of miniaturized animal-borne sensors. Although early studies recorded only simple parameters of animal movement, advanced devices and analytical methods can now provide rich information on individual and group behavior, internal states, and the surrounding environment of free-ranging animals, especially those in marine systems. We summarize the history of technologies used to track marine animals. We then identify seven major research categories of marine biologging and biotelemetry and explain significant achievements, as well as future opportunities. Big data approaches via international collaborations will be key to tackling global environmental issues (e.g., climate change impacts), and curiosity about the secret lives of marine animals will also remain a major driver of biologging and biotelemetry studies.", "generated_text": "Biologging and biotelemetry have revolutionized the study of marine animals, offering unprecedented insights into their movement ecology, field physiology, and interactions within their ecosystems. These technologies enable researchers to track the spatial and temporal patterns of marine species, shedding light on predator\u2013prey dynamics and social interactions that are otherwise challenging to observe. By providing detailed data on the physiological responses of marine animals to environmental changes, biologging and biotelemetry facilitate a deeper understanding of how these species adapt to natural and anthropogenic stressors. This research is crucial for assessing the impacts of human activities, such as climate change and pollution, on marine biodiversity. The integration of these tools into marine research not only enhances our knowledge of marine life but also informs conservation strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of human-induced pressures on ocean ecosystems. This paper reviews recent advancements and applications of these technologies in marine research.", "label": 1}
