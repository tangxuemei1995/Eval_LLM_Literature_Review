{"grounding": "This article addresses the underrepresentation of Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences by challenging the exclusive use of Western scientific paradigms in research and education. Because of the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples, Indigenous perspectives have rarely been represented through empirical study, leading us to believe this is a key reason for the underrepresentation of Native people in these fields. We conducted a literature review, searching for Indigenous contributions in animal sciences and finding a handful of articles in three areas: human\u2013animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Given the interconnected paradigm of Indigenous worldviews, we suggest that the ongoing siloes of scientific disciplines and the hierarchy of methodology contribute to the dearth of Indigenous perspectives. We suggest increased support for proper tribal consultation, contextualization of the history of research in Native communities, and the creation of scholarly spaces to support these conversations.", "generated_text": "This review explores the integration of Indigenous perspectives within the field of animal biosciences, emphasizing the contributions of American Indian and Native American knowledge systems. By examining the intersection of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and contemporary scientific practices, the study highlights the potential for a more holistic approach to animal health and management. The One Health framework, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, serves as a pivotal concept in bridging these diverse knowledge systems. Indigenous perspectives offer valuable insights into sustainable practices and biodiversity conservation, challenging conventional methodologies in animal sciences. This review underscores the importance of respecting and incorporating Indigenous knowledge to enhance scientific understanding and address global challenges in animal health. The findings advocate for collaborative efforts between Indigenous communities and scientific researchers to foster innovation and resilience in the face of ecological and health-related challenges.", "label": 0}
