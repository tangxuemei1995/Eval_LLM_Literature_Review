{"grounding": "Deleterious mutations decrease reproductive fitness and are ubiquitous in genomes. Given that many organisms face ongoing threats of extinction, there is interest in elucidating the impact of deleterious variation on extinction risk and optimizing management strategies accounting for such mutations. Quantifying deleterious variation and understanding the effects of population history on deleterious variation are complex endeavors because we do not know the strength of selection acting on each mutation. Further, the effect of demographic history on deleterious mutations depends on the strength of selection against the mutation and the degree of dominance. Here we clarify how deleterious variation can be quantified and studied in natural populations. We then discuss how different demographic factors, such as small population size, nonequilibrium population size changes, inbreeding, and gene flow, affect deleterious variation. Lastly, we provide guidance on studying deleterious variation in nonmodel populations of conservation concern.", "generated_text": "Deleterious mutations, which can accumulate in natural populations, pose significant challenges for conservation biology. This study explores the implications of genetic load and inbreeding depression on the viability of small and isolated populations. Using advanced simulation models, we assess the impact of deleterious variation on population fitness and survival. Our findings indicate that genetic load can exacerbate the effects of inbreeding depression, leading to reduced reproductive success and increased extinction risk. The simulations highlight the importance of maintaining genetic diversity to mitigate these effects. Conservation strategies should prioritize genetic monitoring and management to minimize the accumulation of harmful mutations. This research underscores the need for integrated approaches that combine genetic data with ecological and demographic factors to enhance the resilience of endangered species. Our results provide critical insights for developing effective conservation policies aimed at preserving biodiversity in the face of genetic challenges.", "label": 1}
