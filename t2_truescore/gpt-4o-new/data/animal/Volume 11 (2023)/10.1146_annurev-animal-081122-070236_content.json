{"grounding": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid of the plant Cannabis sativa L. CBD is increasingly being explored as an alternative to conventional therapies to treat health disorders in dogs and cats. Mechanisms of action of CBD have been investigated mostly in rodents and in vitro and include modulation of CB1, CB2, 5-HT, GPR, and opioid receptors. In companion animals, CBD appears to have good bioavailability and safety profile with few side effects at physiological doses. Some dog studies have found CBD to improve clinical signs associated with osteoarthritis, pruritus, and epilepsy. However, further studies are needed to conclude a therapeutic action of CBD for each of these conditions, as well as for decreasing anxiety and aggression in dogs and cats. Herein, we summarize the available scientific evidence associated with the mechanisms of action of CBD, including pharmacokinetics, safety, regulation, and efficacy in ameliorating various health conditions in dogs and cats.", "generated_text": "The therapeutic potential of cannabidiol (CBD) in veterinary medicine, particularly for dogs and cats, is gaining attention due to its anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, and anticonvulsant properties. This review examines the pharmacokinetics of CBD in these species, highlighting its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Current studies suggest that CBD may effectively manage anxiety and inflammation, with promising results in reducing seizure frequency in epileptic animals. However, the pharmacokinetic profile varies significantly between dogs and cats, necessitating species-specific dosing regimens. Regulatory challenges persist, as the legal status of CBD products for pets remains ambiguous in many regions. Further research is needed to establish standardized dosing guidelines and to fully understand the long-term effects of CBD use in companion animals. This paper underscores the importance of rigorous scientific validation to ensure the safe and effective integration of CBD into veterinary practice.", "label": 1}
