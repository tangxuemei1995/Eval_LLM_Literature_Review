{"grounding": "Over the past three decades, coronavirus (CoV) diseases have impacted humans more than any other emerging infectious disease. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), has resulted in huge economic disruptions and loss of human lives. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was found to mutate more rapidly due to sustained transmission in humans and potentially animals, resulting in variants of concern (VOCs) that threaten global human health. However, the primary difficulties are filling in the current knowledge gaps in terms of the origin and modalities of emergence for these viruses. Because many CoVs threatening human health are suspected to have a zoonotic origin, identifying the animal hosts implicated in the spillover or spillback events would be beneficial for current pandemic management and to prevent future outbreaks. In this review, wesummarize the animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission of the emerging human CoVs. Finally, we comment on potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOCs and the new SARS-CoV-2 recombinants currently under investigation.", "generated_text": "The emergence of human-infecting coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, underscores the critical need to understand zoonotic reservoirs and cross-species transmission dynamics. This study reviews the role of animal models in elucidating the mechanisms of coronavirus spillover from wildlife to humans. We explore the genetic recombination events that facilitate viral adaptation and highlight the importance of identifying and monitoring potential zoonotic reservoirs, including bats and intermediate hosts like camels and civets. The review emphasizes the utility of animal models in simulating human disease, providing insights into viral pathogenesis, immune response, and transmission pathways. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of cross-species transmission for public health surveillance and the development of preventive strategies. By integrating data from virology, ecology, and epidemiology, this research aims to enhance our understanding of the factors driving coronavirus emergence and inform the design of effective surveillance systems. Ultimately, this work contributes to the global effort to predict and mitigate future zoonotic outbreaks, safeguarding human health against emerging infectious diseases.", "label": 1}
