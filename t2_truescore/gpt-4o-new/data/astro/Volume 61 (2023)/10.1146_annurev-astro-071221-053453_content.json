{"grounding": "The first generation of stars, often called Population III (or Pop III), form from metal-free primordial gas at redshifts z \u223c 30 and below. They dominate the cosmic star-formation history until z \u223c 15\u201320, at which point the formation of metal-enriched Population II stars takes over. We review current theoretical models for the formation, properties, and impact of Pop III stars and discuss existing and future observational constraints. Key takeaways from this review include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tPrimordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III stars form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFeedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation, but major uncertainties remain regarding its immediate impact.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIn extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 105M\u2299. Their remnants may be the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDirect observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe remain extremely challenging. Indirect constraints from the global 21-cm signal or gravitational waves are more promising.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tStellar archeological surveys allow us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation and evolution of the first stars, known as Population III stars, represent a pivotal epoch in cosmic history, marking the transition from the primordial Universe to one enriched with heavy elements. This study delves into the complex processes that governed the birth of these stars, which formed from pristine gas clouds in the high-redshift Universe. Utilizing advanced cosmological simulations and observational data, we explore the conditions necessary for the formation of Population III stars, including the role of dark matter halos and the cooling mechanisms of primordial gas. We also examine the properties of these stars, which are hypothesized to be massive, short-lived, and influential in the reionization of the Universe. Furthermore, the transition to Population II stars, which formed from gas enriched by the first supernovae, is analyzed to understand the chemical evolution and the subsequent star formation processes. The impact of these early stellar populations on galactic archeology is significant, as they provide insights into the initial mass function, nucleosynthesis, and the early stages of galaxy formation. By integrating theoretical models with high-redshift observations, this research enhances our understanding of the first stars' role in shaping the Universe's structure and composition, offering a comprehensive view of their legacy in the cosmic timeline.", "label": 1}
