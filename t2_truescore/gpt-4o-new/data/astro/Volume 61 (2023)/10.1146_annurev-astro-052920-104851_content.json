{"grounding": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) is a critical stepping stone in the gas evolution cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way. Hi traces both the cold, premolecular state before star formation and the warm, diffuse ISM before and after star formation. This review describes new, sensitive Hi absorption and emission surveys, which, together with high angular and spectral resolution Hi emission data, have revealed the physical properties of Hi, its structure, and its association with magnetic fields. We give an overview of the Hi phases and discuss how Hi properties depend on the environment and what its structure can tell us about feedback in the ISM. Key findings include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe mass fraction of the cold neutral medium is \u227240% on average, increasing with A\nV due to the increase of mean gas density.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe cold disk extends to at least R \u223c 25 kpc.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tApproximately 40% of the Hi is warm, with structural characteristics that derive from feedback events.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCold Hi is highly filamentary, whereas warm Hi is more smoothly distributed.\n\n\n\nWe summarize future observational and simulation opportunities that can be used to unravel the 3D structure of the atomic ISM and the effects of heating and cooling on Hi properties.", "generated_text": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies, serving as a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and a precursor to molecular hydrogen, which fuels star formation. This study delves into the distribution, dynamics, and role of Hi within the Milky Way, providing insights into its contribution to galactic evolution. Utilizing data from recent radio surveys, we map the spatial distribution of Hi, revealing its complex structure influenced by gravitational forces, magnetic fields, and stellar feedback processes. Our analysis highlights the interaction between Hi and magnetic fields, which are crucial in shaping the ISM and regulating star formation rates. We explore the mechanisms by which Hi transitions to molecular hydrogen, emphasizing the conditions under which this transformation is most efficient. Furthermore, we examine the role of Hi in the broader context of galaxy evolution, considering its impact on the formation of galactic structures and its interaction with other phases of the ISM. Our findings underscore the importance of Hi as a stepping stone in the lifecycle of galaxies, offering a deeper understanding of the processes that govern their growth and transformation. This research contributes to a more comprehensive model of galactic evolution, integrating the multifaceted roles of atomic hydrogen and magnetic fields.", "label": 1}
