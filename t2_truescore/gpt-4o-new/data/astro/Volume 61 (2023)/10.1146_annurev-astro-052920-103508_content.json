{"grounding": "The past two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain data sets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity, and comparative robustness, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such data sets. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modeling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain data sets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code; discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability; and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open-source GP software packages. In summary:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGP regression is a conceptually simple but statistically principled and powerful tool for the analysis of astronomical time series.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIt is already widely used in some subfields, such as exoplanets, and gaining traction in many others, such as optical transients.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDriven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time-domain astronomy for many years to come.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The analysis of astronomical time series data is a critical component in the field of time-domain astronomy, where the goal is to understand the dynamic processes of celestial objects. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has emerged as a powerful statistical tool for modeling and interpreting such data due to its flexibility and ability to capture complex temporal correlations. This study explores the application of GPR in the context of astronomical time series, highlighting its advantages over traditional methods. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of GPR, emphasizing its non-parametric nature and the ability to incorporate prior knowledge through kernel functions. The research demonstrates how GPR can effectively handle irregularly sampled data and provide robust uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for astronomical observations often plagued by noise and gaps. Through a series of case studies, including variable stars and exoplanet transit data, we illustrate the practical implementation of GPR, showcasing its capability to model periodic and quasi-periodic signals. The results indicate that GPR not only improves the accuracy of predictions but also enhances the interpretability of the underlying physical processes. Furthermore, we address computational challenges associated with large datasets and propose efficient algorithms to scale GPR for extensive astronomical surveys. This work underscores the potential of GPR as a versatile tool in astrostatistics, paving the way for more sophisticated analyses in the era of big data astronomy.", "label": 1}
