{"grounding": "Planets form in disks of gas and dust around young stars. The disk molecular reservoirs and their chemical evolution affect all aspects of planet formation, from the coagulation of dust grains into pebbles to the elemental and molecular compositions of the mature planet. Disk chemistry also enables unique probes of disk structures and dynamics, including those directly linked to ongoing planet formation. We review the protoplanetary disk chemistry of the volatile elements H, O, C, N, S, and P; the associated observational and theoretical methods; and the links between disk and planet chemical compositions. Three takeaways from this review are:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe disk chemical composition, including the organic reservoirs, is set by both inheritance and in situ chemistry.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDisk gas and solid O/C/N/H elemental ratios often deviate from stellar values due to a combination of condensation of molecular carriers, chemistry, and dynamics.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChemical, physical, and dynamical processes in disks are closely linked, which complicates disk chemistry modeling, but these links also present an opportunity to develop chemical probes of different aspects of disk evolution and planet formation.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets, are rich in chemical complexity, playing a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems. This study delves into the intricate chemistry of protoplanetary disks, focusing on the processes that govern the synthesis and distribution of organic and inorganic molecules. Utilizing advanced observational techniques and theoretical models, we explore the influence of disk temperature, density, and radiation fields on chemical reactions. Our findings highlight the significance of astrochemical pathways in the formation of prebiotic molecules, which may seed nascent planets with the building blocks of life. We also examine the impact of stellar and disk dynamics on the spatial and temporal variation of chemical species. By integrating data from recent missions and telescopes, such as ALMA and JWST, this research provides new insights into the initial conditions for planet formation. The results underscore the importance of understanding protoplanetary disk chemistry to unravel the origins of planetary systems and the potential for habitability beyond our solar system.", "label": 1}
