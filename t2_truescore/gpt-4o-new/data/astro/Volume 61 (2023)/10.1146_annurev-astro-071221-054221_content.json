{"grounding": "Interstellar interlopers are bodies formed outside of the Solar System but observed passing through it. The first two identified interlopers, 1I/\u2018Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited unexpectedly different physical properties. 1I/\u2018Oumuamua appeared unresolved and asteroid-like, whereas 2I/Borisov was a more comet-like source of both gas and dust. Both objects moved under the action of nongravitational acceleration. These interlopers and their divergent properties provide our only window so far onto an enormous and previously unknown galactic population. The number density of such objects is \u223c0.1 AU\u22123 which, if uniform across the galactic disk, would imply 1025 to 1026 similar objects in the Milky Way. The interlopers likely formed in, and were ejected from, the protoplanetary disks of young stars. However, we currently possess too little data to firmly reject other explanations.", "generated_text": "The discovery of interstellar interlopers, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has opened new avenues for understanding the dynamics and composition of objects originating outside our solar system. This study explores the characteristics of these interstellar comets, focusing on their trajectories, physical properties, and potential origins within protoplanetary disks. By analyzing observational data and employing advanced modeling techniques, we aim to elucidate the processes that eject these bodies from their parent systems and their subsequent journey through interstellar space. Our findings suggest that interstellar interlopers provide unique insights into the diversity of planetary formation environments and the chemical makeup of distant protoplanetary disks. This research underscores the importance of continued observation and study of these rare visitors to enhance our understanding of the broader galactic context of planetary system formation.", "label": 1}
