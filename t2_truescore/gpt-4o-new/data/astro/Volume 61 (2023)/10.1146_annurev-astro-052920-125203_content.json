{"grounding": "Spurred by rich, multiwavelength observations and enabled by new simulations, ranging from cosmological to subparsec scales, the past decade has seen major theoretical progress in our understanding of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We review key physical processes in the CGM. Our conclusions include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe properties of the CGM depend on a competition between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. When cooling is slow relative to free fall, the gas is hot (roughly virial temperature), whereas the gas is cold (T \u223c 104 K) when cooling is rapid.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGas inflows and outflows play crucial roles, as does the cosmological environment. Large-scale structure collimates cold streams and provides angular momentum. Satellite galaxies contribute to the CGM through winds and gas stripping.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIn multiphase gas, the hot and cold phases continuously exchange mass, energy, and momentum. The interaction between turbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical. A broad spectrum of cold gas structures, going down to subparsec scales, arises from fragmentation, coagulation, and condensation onto gas clouds.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMagnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays can substantially modify how the cold and hot phases interact, although microphysical uncertainties are presently large.\n\n\nKey open questions for future work include the mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics, and how the CGM affects the evolution of galaxies.", "generated_text": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in the lifecycle of galaxies, acting as a reservoir for gas that fuels star formation and a sink for feedback processes. This study delves into the key physical processes governing the CGM, with a focus on the interplay between galactic halos and the intergalactic medium. Utilizing advanced hydrodynamic simulations, we explore the dynamics of gas accretion, cooling, and feedback mechanisms that shape the CGM's structure and evolution. Our findings highlight the significance of plasma physics in understanding the thermal and ionization states of the CGM, which are crucial for interpreting observational data. We also examine the impact of cosmological parameters on the CGM, providing insights into how variations in dark matter and dark energy influence its properties. Theoretical models are compared against recent observational data, revealing a complex interaction between inflows and outflows that regulate the mass and metallicity of the CGM. This research underscores the importance of multi-scale simulations in capturing the intricate processes at play, offering a comprehensive framework for future studies. By advancing our understanding of the CGM, this work contributes to a broader comprehension of galaxy formation and evolution, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that consider both local and cosmological influences.", "label": 1}
