{"grounding": "After decades of fast-paced technical advances, optical/infrared (O/IR) interferometry has seen a revolution in recent years:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with four 8-m telescopes reaches thousand-times-fainter objects than possible with earlier interferometers, and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array (CHARA) routinely offers up to 330-m baselines and aperture synthesis with six 1-m telescopes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe observed objects are fainter than 19 mag, the images have submilliarcsecond resolution, and the astrometry reaches microarcsecond precision.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThis led to breakthrough results on the Galactic Center, exoplanets, active galactic nuclei, young stellar objects, and stellar physics.\n\n\n\nFollowing a primer in interferometry, we summarize the advances that led to the performance boost of modern interferometers:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSingle-mode beam combiners now combine up to six telescopes, and image reconstruction software has advanced over earlier developments for radio interferometry.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWith a combination of large telescopes, adaptive optics (AO), fringe tracking, and especially dual-beam interferometry, GRAVITY has boosted the sensitivity by many orders of magnitude.\n\n\n\nAnother order-of-magnitude improvement will come from laser guide star AO. In combination with large separation fringe tracking, O/IR interferometry will then provide complete sky coverage for observations in the Galactic plane and substantial coverage for extragalactic targets.", "generated_text": "Optical/infrared interferometry has emerged as a transformative technique in astronomical observations, offering unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Recent advancements in instrumentation have significantly enhanced the capabilities of interferometric arrays, enabling detailed studies of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. This paper reviews the latest developments in interferometric technology and their applications to key astronomical targets. In the Galactic Center, interferometry has provided insights into the dynamics and properties of the supermassive black hole and its surrounding environment. The technique has also been instrumental in the characterization of exoplanets, allowing for the direct imaging and atmospheric analysis of these distant worlds. In the realm of active galactic nuclei, interferometry has contributed to our understanding of the structure and kinematics of the central regions, shedding light on the processes driving their immense energy output. Furthermore, studies of young stellar objects have benefited from interferometric observations, revealing the complex interactions and formation processes within protostellar disks. The paper also discusses the application of interferometry to stellar astrophysics, where it has been used to resolve surface features and measure fundamental parameters of stars with high precision. These advancements underscore the critical role of optical/infrared interferometry in expanding our understanding of the universe, paving the way for future discoveries.", "label": 1}
