{"grounding": "We review the progress in modeling the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations of the \u039bCDM cosmogony. State-of-the-art simulations now broadly reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies; the distributions of key characteristics, such as mass, size, and SFR; and scaling relations connecting diverse properties to mass. Such improvements engender confidence in the insight drawn from simulations. Many important outcomes, however, particularly the properties of circumgalactic gas, are sensitive to the details of the subgrid models used to approximate the macroscopic effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback processes. We compare the outcomes of leading simulation suites with observations, and with each other, to identify the enduring successes they have cultivated and the outstanding challenges to be tackled with the next generation of models. Our key conclusions include the following:", "generated_text": "Hydrodynamical simulations have become a cornerstone in understanding galaxy formation and evolution, offering insights into the complex interplay between gas dynamics, star formation, and feedback processes. These simulations have successfully reproduced key properties of galaxy populations, such as the stellar mass function and the distribution of galaxy halos. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in accurately modeling the baryonic processes that govern gas accretion and star formation within galaxies. Discrepancies between simulated and observed galaxy morphologies and the role of feedback mechanisms in regulating galaxy growth highlight areas for further refinement. This review synthesizes the enduring successes of current hydrodynamical models while identifying outstanding challenges that must be addressed to enhance the predictive power of simulations in the context of galaxy formation theories.", "label": 1}
