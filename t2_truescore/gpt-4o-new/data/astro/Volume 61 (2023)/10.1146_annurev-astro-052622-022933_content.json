{"grounding": "We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in big disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCircumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at P\nb (the binary period) or \u223c5P\nb, depending on the binary eccentricity e\nb and mass ratio q\nb.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical processes (e.g., planet migration) taking place in the disk.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tOver long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary parameters (e\nb and q\nb) and on the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tA misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when e\nb is significant, the disk can evolve toward \u201cpolar alignment,\u201d with the disk plane perpendicular to the binary plane.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Circumbinary accretion, a process where material from a surrounding disk is accreted onto a binary system, plays a pivotal role in the evolution of both stellar and black hole binaries. This study explores the dynamics of circumbinary accretion across a range of astrophysical contexts, from binary stars to massive binary black holes. Utilizing advanced hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the influence of binary mass ratios, orbital eccentricities, and disk properties on accretion rates and disk morphology. Our findings reveal that circumbinary disks exhibit complex structures, including spiral arms and gaps, which significantly affect the accretion flow onto the binary components. In the context of star formation, these processes are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of binary star systems and their associated protoplanetary disks, which may host exoplanets. For massive binary black holes, circumbinary accretion is a key mechanism influencing their coalescence and the emission of gravitational waves, with implications for the detection of such events by observatories like LIGO and Virgo. Additionally, the study highlights the potential for circumbinary accretion to drive the growth of supermassive black holes in galactic centers. By bridging the gap between stellar and black hole binaries, this research provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the universal principles governing circumbinary accretion, offering insights into the complex interplay between binary dynamics and accretion processes across different astrophysical environments.", "label": 1}
