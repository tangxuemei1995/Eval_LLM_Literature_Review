{"grounding": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different approaches with lentiviral vector\u2013mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation. Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality.", "generated_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, leading to severe clinical complications. Recent advancements in gene therapy offer promising avenues for curative treatments. This review explores diverse approaches, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which remains the only established cure but is limited by donor availability and risks. Gene therapy strategies, such as lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition, aim to introduce functional hemoglobin genes into patient-derived stem cells. Additionally, gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 offer precise correction of the sickle mutation or reactivation of fetal hemoglobin production. These innovative approaches are in various stages of clinical development, showing potential to transform SCD management. Challenges remain in optimizing delivery, ensuring safety, and achieving widespread clinical application, necessitating continued research and collaboration.", "label": 1}
