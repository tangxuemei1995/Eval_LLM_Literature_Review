{"grounding": "Understanding how biases originate in medical technologies and developing safeguards to identify, mitigate, and remove their harms are essential to ensuring equal performance in all individuals. Drawing upon examples from pulmonary medicine, this article describes how bias can be introduced in the physical aspects of the technology design, via unrepresentative data, or by conflation of biological with social determinants of health. It then can be perpetuated by inadequate evaluation and regulatory standards. Research demonstrates that pulse oximeters perform differently depending on patient race and ethnicity. Pulmonary function testing and algorithms used to predict healthcare needs are two additional examples of medical technologies with racial and ethnic biases that may perpetuate health disparities.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies, focusing on pulse oximetry and pulmonary function testing. Disparities in these medical devices and algorithms often stem from structural racism embedded in their design and implementation. Historical exclusion of diverse populations in clinical trials and data collection has led to inaccuracies in readings for non-white individuals, exacerbating health inequities. By analyzing the development processes and underlying assumptions of these technologies, this research highlights the need for inclusive practices and equitable standards. Addressing these biases is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and health outcomes across diverse racial and ethnic groups, ultimately fostering a more just healthcare system.", "label": 1}
