{"grounding": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is an important subtype of myocardial infarction (MI) that occurs in approximately 6\u20138% of patients with spontaneous MI who are referred for coronary angiography. MINOCA disproportionately affects women, but men are also affected. Pathogenesis is more variable than in MI with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD). Dominant mechanisms include atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and coronary artery spasm. Management of MINOCA varies based on the underlying mechanism of infarction. Therefore, systematic approaches to diagnosis are recommended. The combination of invasive coronary angiography, multivessel intracoronary imaging, provocative testing for coronary spasm, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides the greatest diagnostic yield. Current clinical practice guidelines for the secondary prevention of MI are based largely on data from patients with MI-CAD. Thus, optimal medications after MINOCA are uncertain. Clinical trials focused on the treatment of patients with MINOCA are urgently needed to define optimal care.", "generated_text": "Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) represents a distinct clinical entity characterized by myocardial infarction symptoms without significant coronary artery obstruction. This condition challenges traditional paradigms of myocardial infarction, necessitating a nuanced understanding of its pathophysiology. Potential mechanisms include coronary spasm, microvascular dysfunction, and myocardial injury, with takotsubo syndrome also contributing to its etiology. Despite the absence of obstructive coronary disease, patients with MINOCA exhibit similar adverse outcomes to those with typical myocardial infarction, underscoring the importance of accurate diagnosis and management. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, and underlying mechanisms of MINOCA, highlighting the need for tailored therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise pathophysiological pathways and developing targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. Understanding MINOCA is crucial for advancing cardiovascular care and optimizing treatment for this unique patient population.", "label": 1}
