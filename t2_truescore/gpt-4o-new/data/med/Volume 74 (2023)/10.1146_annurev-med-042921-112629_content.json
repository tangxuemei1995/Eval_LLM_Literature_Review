{"grounding": "Polygenic scores quantify inherited risk by integrating information from many common sites of DNA variation into a single number. Rapid increases in the scale of genetic association studies and new statistical algorithms have enabled development of polygenic scores that meaningfully measure\u2014as early as birth\u2014risk of coronary artery disease. These newer-generation polygenic scores identify up to 8% of the population with triple the normal risk based on genetic variation alone, and these individuals cannot be identified on the basis of family history or clinical risk factors alone. For those identified with increased genetic risk, evidence supports risk reduction with at least two interventions, adherence to a healthy lifestyle and cholesterol-lowering therapies, that can substantially reduce risk. Alongside considerable enthusiasm for the potential of polygenic risk estimation to enable a new era of preventive clinical medicine is recognition of a need for ongoing research into how best to ensure equitable performance across diverse ancestries, how and in whom to assess the scores in clinical practice, as well as randomized trials to confirm clinical utility.", "generated_text": "The advent of polygenic scores (PGS) has revolutionized the field of genomics, offering novel insights into the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD). This review explores recent advances in the development and application of PGS for CAD, highlighting their potential in enhancing risk prediction and informing prevention strategies. By aggregating the effects of numerous genetic variants, PGS provide a quantifiable measure of an individual's genetic predisposition to CAD, surpassing traditional risk factors in predictive accuracy. Recent studies demonstrate the utility of PGS in stratifying individuals into different risk categories, thereby facilitating personalized interventions and lifestyle modifications. Furthermore, the integration of PGS with clinical and environmental data holds promise for refining risk assessment models. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the need for diverse population studies and the ethical considerations surrounding genetic data usage. This review underscores the transformative potential of PGS in CAD management and calls for continued research to optimize their clinical application and accessibility.", "label": 1}
