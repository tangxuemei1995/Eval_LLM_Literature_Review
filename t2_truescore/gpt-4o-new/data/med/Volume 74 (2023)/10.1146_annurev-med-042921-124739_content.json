{"grounding": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral pathogen in the transplant population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CMV prevention is paramount; however, selecting the best preventive strategy depends on many factors including donor\u2013recipient CMV serostatus, transplant-specific risks, antiviral toxicities and cost. Novel CMV therapeutics such as letermovir (LTV) are desperately needed to optimize CMV management. Uniquely among CMV antiviral therapies, LTV inhibits the viral terminase complex in the CMV DNA synthesis pathway and disrupts viral genome packaging. Further, it lacks side effects frequently associated with other CMV antiviral therapies and evades common mechanisms of resistance. LTV is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CMV prevention in adult CMV-seropositive hematopoietic cell transplant recipients but is increasingly applied off-label for prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes important concepts of CMV management in transplantation, with a specific focus on LTV pharmacology and clinical experience to date alongside future prospects for its application.", "generated_text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant challenge in transplant recipients, often leading to severe complications. Letermovir, a novel antiviral agent, has emerged as a promising option for CMV prophylaxis and treatment, particularly in the context of solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplants. This review examines the efficacy and safety profile of letermovir, highlighting its unique mechanism of action as a CMV terminase complex inhibitor. Clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing CMV infection rates and associated morbidity in transplant patients, with a favorable safety profile compared to traditional antivirals. Letermovir's role in prophylaxis is well-established, offering a significant reduction in CMV reactivation and disease. However, its application in active CMV treatment requires further investigation. The review also discusses potential resistance issues and the integration of letermovir into existing CMV management protocols. Overall, letermovir represents a significant advancement in CMV management, improving outcomes for transplant recipients.", "label": 1}
