{"grounding": "Nearly half of Americans are projected to have obesity by 2030, underscoring the pressing need for effective treatments. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) represent the first agents in a rapidly evolving, highly promising landscape of nascent hormone-based obesity therapeutics. With the understanding of the neurobiology of obesity rapidly expanding, these emerging entero-endocrine and endo-pancreatic agents combined or coformulated with GLP-1 RAs herald a new era of targeted, mechanism-based treatment of obesity. This article reviews GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of obesity and previews the imminent future of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based anti-obesity therapeutics.", "generated_text": "This study explores innovative obesity treatments focusing on GLP-1 receptor agonists and emerging nutrient-stimulated hormone-based (NuSH) therapies. Recent advancements in dual and triple receptor agonists offer promising antiobesity effects by enhancing metabolic regulation and appetite suppression. NuSH-based therapies represent a novel approach, leveraging endogenous hormone pathways to optimize energy balance and weight management. This review synthesizes current research on these therapeutic strategies, highlighting their potential to revolutionize obesity treatment paradigms. Future directions include clinical trials to assess efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes, aiming to address the global obesity epidemic with more effective interventions.", "label": 1}
