{"grounding": "Increasing numbers of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth, from early puberty through late adolescence, are seeking medical services to bring their physical sex characteristics into alignment with their gender identity\u2014their inner sense of self as male or female or elsewhere on the gender spectrum. Numerous studies, primarily of short- and medium-term duration (up to 6 years), demonstrate the clearly beneficial\u2014even lifesaving\u2014mental health impact of gender-affirming medical care in TGD youth. However, there are significant gaps in knowledge and challenges to such care. Long-term safety and efficacy studies are needed to optimize medical care for TGD youth.", "generated_text": "This study explores current concepts in gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth, focusing on the use of pubertal blockers and gender-affirming hormone treatments. Pubertal blockers, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, are critical in delaying puberty, allowing time for youth to explore their gender identity without the added stress of unwanted physical changes. Gender-affirming hormone treatments further support the alignment of physical characteristics with gender identity. The research highlights the importance of individualized care plans and the role of healthcare providers in supporting the mental and physical well-being of transgender and gender-diverse youth.", "label": 0}
