{"grounding": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) were originally developed as antidiabetic agents, with cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials demonstrating improved CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Secondary analyses of CV outcome trials and later dedicated kidney outcome trials consistently reported improved kidney-related outcomes independent of T2D status and across a range of kidney function and albuminuria. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trials and real-world analyses demonstrating a decrease in the risk of acute kidney injury. The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors generally extend across different members of the class, possibly on the basis of hemodynamic, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in diverse patient populations.", "generated_text": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a transformative class of medications with significant renal benefits beyond glycemic control. This review explores the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in both diabetic and nondiabetic populations. Recent studies demonstrate their efficacy in slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, reducing albuminuria, and preserving renal function. Furthermore, evidence suggests potential benefits in nondiabetic kidney disease, highlighting their role in a broader spectrum of renal pathologies. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors have shown a protective effect against acute kidney injury, offering a novel therapeutic avenue. These findings underscore the importance of SGLT2 inhibitors in nephrology, marking a paradigm shift in the management of kidney diseases and emphasizing their role in improving long-term renal outcomes.", "label": 1}
