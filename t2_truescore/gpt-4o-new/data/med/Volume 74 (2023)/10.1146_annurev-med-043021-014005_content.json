{"grounding": "Heterogeneity in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is increasingly being recognized as one of the principal barriers to finding efficacious targeted therapies. The advent of multiple high-throughput biological data (\u201comics\u201d), coupled with the widespread access to increased computational power, has led to the emergence of phenotyping in critical care. Phenotyping aims to use a multitude of data to identify homogenous subgroups within an otherwise heterogenous population. Increasingly, phenotyping schemas are being applied to sepsis and ARDS to increase understanding of these clinical conditions and identify potential therapies. Here we present a selective review of the biological phenotyping schemas applied to sepsis and ARDS. Further, we outline some of the challenges involved in translating these conceptual findings to bedside clinical decision-making tools.", "generated_text": "Sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are complex, heterogeneous conditions that pose significant challenges in critical care. Recent advances in biological phenotyping have enabled the identification of distinct phenotypes and subphenotypes within these conditions, offering potential pathways for precision medicine. This review synthesizes current research on the biological markers and clinical characteristics that define these phenotypes, highlighting their implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies. By integrating multi-omics data and machine learning approaches, researchers aim to tailor therapeutic interventions to individual patient profiles, thereby improving outcomes. The study underscores the necessity for continued exploration of phenotypic variability in sepsis and ARDS to enhance the precision of critical care management and to facilitate the development of targeted therapies.", "label": 1}
