{"grounding": "Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) have radically transformed the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed rare/ultrarare Mendelian diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), the technology integral for ES, GS, and most large (100+) gene panels, has enabled previously unimaginable diagnoses, changes in medical management, new treatments, and accurate reproductive risk assessments for patients, as well as new disease gene discoveries. Yet, challenges remain, as most individuals remain undiagnosed with current NGS. Improved NGS technology has resulted in long-read sequencing, which may resolve diagnoses in some patients who do not obtain a diagnosis with current short-read ES and GS, but its effectiveness is unclear, and it is expensive. Other challenges that persist include the resolution of variants of uncertain significance, the urgent need for patients with ultrarare disorders to have access to therapeutics, the need for equity in patient access to NGS-based testing, and the study of ethical concerns. However, the outlook for undiagnosed disease resolution is bright, due to continual advancements in the field.", "generated_text": "The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, particularly exome and genome sequencing, has revolutionized the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed syndromes, especially those suspected to be of genetic origin. This study explores the efficacy of exome and genome sequencing in identifying causative genetic variants in patients with rare and ultrarare diseases, often characterized by Mendelian inheritance patterns. By analyzing a cohort of individuals with previously undiagnosed conditions, we demonstrate that exome sequencing can effectively pinpoint pathogenic variants in coding regions, while genome sequencing offers a more comprehensive analysis, including non-coding regions and structural variants. Our findings underscore the importance of these technologies in clinical diagnostics, providing a molecular diagnosis in a significant proportion of cases that were previously elusive. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of genome sequencing to uncover novel genetic mechanisms underlying rare diseases, thereby expanding our understanding of human genetics and facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. This research supports the integration of sequencing technologies into routine clinical practice for undiagnosed syndromes.", "label": 1}
