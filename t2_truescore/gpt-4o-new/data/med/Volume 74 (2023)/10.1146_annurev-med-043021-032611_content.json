{"grounding": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating autoimmune disease that can result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and treatment of SLE are clinical challenges. Patient presentation and response to therapy are heterogeneous because of the complex immune dysregulation that results in SLE disease pathogenesis. An intricate interplay between genetic risk and skewing of adaptive and innate immune system responses leads to overproduction of type I interferons and other cytokines, complement activation, immune-complex deposition, and ultimately inflammation and tissue damage. Here, we review the classification criteria as well as standard and emerging diagnostic tools available to identify patients with SLE. We then focus on medical management, including novel therapeutics, nonpharmacologic interventions, and comorbidity management.", "generated_text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by diverse clinical manifestations and significant morbidity. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of SLE have highlighted the pivotal role of type I interferons in disease progression. This has led to the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and targeted biologic therapies aimed at modulating the interferon pathway. Emerging biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting specific cytokines, offer promising therapeutic options with improved efficacy and safety profiles. This review synthesizes current research on interferon-targeted diagnostics and biologic therapies, emphasizing their potential to transform SLE management. Future directions include personalized medicine approaches to optimize treatment outcomes and reduce disease burden.", "label": 1}
