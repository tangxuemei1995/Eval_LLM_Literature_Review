{"grounding": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension but is frequently underrecognized and undertreated. Patients with PA are at a markedly increased risk for target organ damage to the heart and kidneys. While patients with unilateral PA can be treated surgically, many patients with PA are not eligible or willing to undergo surgery. Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are highly effective for treating PA and reducing the risk of target organ damage. However, steroidal MRAs are often underprescribed and can be poorly tolerated by some patients due to side effects. Nonsteroidal MRAs reduce adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetic kidney disease and are bettertolerated than steroidal MRAs. While their blood pressure\u2013lowering effects remain unclear, these agents may have a potential role in reducing target organ damage in patients with PA.", "generated_text": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a prevalent cause of secondary hypertension, characterized by excessive aldosterone production, leading to cardiovascular and renal complications. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms by which aldosterone contributes to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy in managing PA, offering significant benefits for heart and kidney health. By blocking aldosterone's effects, MRAs mitigate hypertension and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and renal deterioration. Recent studies highlight the efficacy of MRAs in improving clinical outcomes, emphasizing their role in personalized treatment plans for PA patients. This paper underscores the importance of early diagnosis and intervention with MRAs to prevent long-term organ damage, advocating for their integration into standard care protocols for individuals with PA.", "label": 1}
