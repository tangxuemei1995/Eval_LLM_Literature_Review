{"grounding": "Aging is associated with increased mutational burden in every tissue studied. Occasionally, fitness-increasing mutations will arise, leading to stem cell clonal expansion. This process occurs in several tissues but has been best studied in blood. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, which result if additional cooperating mutations occur. Surprisingly, it is also associated with an increased risk of nonmalignant diseases, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This may be due to enhanced inflammation in mutated innate immune cells, which could be targeted clinically with anti-inflammatory drugs. Recent studies have uncovered other factors that predict poor outcomes in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, such as size of the mutant clone, mutated driver genes, and epigenetic aging. Though clonality is inevitable and largely a function of time, recent work has shown that inherited genetic variation can also influence this process. Clonal hematopoiesis provides a paradigm for understanding how age-related changes in tissue stem cell composition and function influence human health.", "generated_text": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-associated phenomenon characterized by the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells harboring somatic mutations. This condition has garnered significant attention due to its implications for human health, particularly in the context of aging and disease. CHIP is prevalent in the elderly population and has been linked to an increased risk of hematological malignancies and non-hematological conditions, such as coronary artery disease (CAD). The underlying mechanisms involve alterations in DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications, which may influence clonal trajectories and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have highlighted the role of CHIP in promoting inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, thereby exacerbating cardiovascular risk. Understanding the biological underpinnings of CHIP and its impact on health is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on CHIP, emphasizing its clinical significance and potential as a biomarker for disease risk stratification, while also exploring future research directions to mitigate its adverse health effects.", "label": 1}
