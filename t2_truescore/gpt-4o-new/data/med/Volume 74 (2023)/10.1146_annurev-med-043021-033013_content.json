{"grounding": "In vivo gene therapy is rapidly emerging as a new therapeutic paradigm for monogenic disorders. For almost three decades, hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) have served as model disorders for the development of gene therapy. This effort is soon to bear fruit with completed pivotal adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene addition trials reporting encouraging results and regulatory approval widely anticipated in the near future for the current generation of HA and HB AAV vectors. Here we review the clinical development of AAV gene therapy for HA and HB and examine outstanding questions that have recently emerged from AAV clinical trials for hemophilia and other monogenic disorders.", "generated_text": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for hemophilia, a genetic disorder characterized by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII (hemophilia A) and IX (hemophilia B). This therapy involves the delivery of functional copies of the deficient genes using AAV vectors, aiming to restore normal clotting factor levels. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements in bleeding control and reduced need for factor replacement therapy. AAV gene therapy offers a potential long-term solution, with ongoing research focusing on optimizing vector design, enhancing transgene expression, and addressing immune responses. This innovative approach holds the potential to transform the management of hemophilia, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.", "label": 1}
