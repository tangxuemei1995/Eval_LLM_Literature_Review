{"grounding": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited multisystemic disease that can cause progressive bronchiectasis, pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, liver dysfunction, and other disorders. Traditional therapies focused on the treatment or prevention of damage to each organ system with incremental modalities such as nebulized medications for the lungs, insulin for diabetes, and supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. However, the advent of highly effective modulator therapies that target specific cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein malformations resulting from individual genetic mutations has transformed the lives and prognosis for persons with CF.", "generated_text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to dysfunctional ion transport and viscous secretions. Recent advancements in CFTR modulator therapies have revolutionized CF management by targeting the underlying protein defect. These modulators, including potentiators, correctors, and amplifiers, enhance CFTR function, improving pulmonary outcomes and quality of life. This review explores the mechanisms, efficacy, and limitations of current CFTR modulators, highlighting their impact on disease progression and future therapeutic directions. Continued research is essential to optimize treatment strategies and address unmet needs in CF care.", "label": 1}
