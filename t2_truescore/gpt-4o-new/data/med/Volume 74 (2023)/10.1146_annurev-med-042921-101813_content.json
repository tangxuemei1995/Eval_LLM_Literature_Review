{"grounding": "Hundreds of different genetic causes of chronic kidney disease are now recognized, and while individually rare, taken together they are significant contributors to both adult and pediatric diseases. Traditional genetics approaches relied heavily on the identification of large families with multiple affected members and have been fundamental to the identification of genetic kidney diseases. With the increased utilization of massively parallel sequencing and improvements to genotype imputation, we can analyze rare variants in large cohorts of unrelated individuals, leading to personalized care for patients and significant research advancements. This review evaluates the contribution of rare disorders to patient care and the study of genetic kidney diseases and highlights key advancements that utilize new techniques to improve our ability to identify new gene\u2013disease associations.", "generated_text": "The study of genetic kidney disease has unveiled the significant impact of rare disorders on the broader spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Utilizing massively parallel sequencing and collapsing analysis, researchers have identified novel genetic variants that contribute to CKD, highlighting the importance of genomics in understanding disease mechanisms. This approach has revealed unexpected genetic contributors, offering new insights into the pathophysiology of kidney disorders. The integration of these findings into precision medicine strategies promises to enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic interventions. By focusing on the genetic underpinnings of rare kidney disorders, this research underscores the potential for genomics to transform the management of CKD, paving the way for personalized treatment plans that address the unique genetic profiles of patients.", "label": 1}
