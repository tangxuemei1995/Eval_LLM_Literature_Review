{"grounding": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described in 1906 as a dementing disease marked by the presence of two types of fibrillar aggregates in the brain: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. The process of aggregation and formation of the aggregates has been a major focus of investigation ever since the discoveries that the tau protein is the predominant protein in tangles and amyloid \u03b2 is the predominant protein in plaques. The idea that smaller, oligomeric species of amyloid may also be bioactive has now been clearly established. This review examines the possibility that soluble, nonfibrillar, bioactive forms of tau\u2014the \u201ctau we cannot see\u201d\u2014comprise a dominant driver of neurodegeneration in AD.", "generated_text": "The accumulation of tau protein and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease, yet much remains unknown about the invisible aspects of tau pathology. This review explores the latest advancements in understanding tau's role as a biomarker and its potential as a therapeutic target. We discuss novel imaging techniques and molecular approaches that reveal previously undetectable tau species, offering insights into disease progression and diagnosis. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating tau pathology, highlighting their promise and challenges. This comprehensive analysis underscores the critical need for continued research to unravel the complexities of tau in Alzheimer's disease.", "label": 1}
