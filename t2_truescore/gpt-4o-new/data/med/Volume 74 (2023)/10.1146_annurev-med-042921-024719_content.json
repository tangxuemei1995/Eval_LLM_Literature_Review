{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell therapy has transformed the management of relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. Despite high overall response rates, relapse post CAR T treatment remains a clinical challenge. Loss of target antigen, specifically CD19, is one well-defined mechanism of disease relapse. The mechanism of CD19 loss and which patients are at higher risk of CD19 loss remain poorly understood. To overcome CD19 loss, CARs targeting multiple antigens are being tested in clinical trials. CD19/20 and CD19/22 bispecific CARs demonstrate cytotoxicity against CD19-negative cells in preclinical studies. These CARs have also shown efficacy, safety, and a relatively low rate of CD19-negative relapse in phase I trials. These small studies suggest that multispecific CAR T cells can deprive lymphomas of escape via antigen loss. However, the selection of an ideal target, the right CAR construct, and whether these multispecific CARs can induce long-term remissions are still under investigation.", "generated_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of lymphomas, yet its efficacy is often compromised by tumor antigen loss, leading to disease relapse. This study explores the potential of multispecific CAR T cells, including bispecific and trispecific constructs, to overcome this challenge. By targeting multiple antigens simultaneously, these engineered T cells aim to prevent tumor escape mechanisms associated with single antigen targeting. Our research demonstrates that multispecific CAR T cells exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity against lymphoma cells, maintaining efficacy even when one or more target antigens are downregulated. In vitro and in vivo models confirm that these CAR T cells can adapt to antigenic shifts, reducing the likelihood of tumor evasion. These findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cell therapy could offer a robust and durable treatment option for lymphoma patients, addressing a critical limitation of current CAR T cell strategies and paving the way for improved clinical outcomes.", "label": 1}
