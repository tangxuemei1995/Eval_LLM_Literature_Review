{"grounding": "Billions of individuals worldwide have benefited from the unprecedented large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Given the sheer number of people that have received these vaccines, it is not surprising that rare side effects are reported that were not previously detected in the phase III vaccine trials. This review addresses one rare complication called SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It occurs in approximately 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 recipients of the adenovirus vector\u2013based COVID-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca-Oxford or Johnson & Johnson. Information on VITT syndrome was disseminated quickly via social media and publications after it was first discovered. Initial observations associating VITT with specific patient populations, thrombus locations, and outcomes associated with heparin therapy have since been refined with additional clinical experience. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of VITT.", "generated_text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been pivotal in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, rare cases of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have raised concerns. This study reviews the pathophysiology, incidence, and clinical management of VITT, characterized by thrombosis and low platelet counts following vaccination. The condition is hypothesized to be an immune-mediated response, similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, involving platelet factor 4 antibodies. Epidemiological data suggest a low incidence, predominantly associated with adenoviral vector vaccines. Clinical manifestations include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis, often occurring within weeks post-vaccination. Early recognition and treatment with non-heparin anticoagulants and intravenous immunoglobulin are crucial for favorable outcomes. Despite its rarity, understanding VITT is essential for healthcare providers to balance the benefits of vaccination against potential risks, ensuring informed decision-making and patient safety.", "label": 1}
