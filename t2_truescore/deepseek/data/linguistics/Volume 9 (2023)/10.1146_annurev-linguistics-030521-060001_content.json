{"grounding": "The term homesign has been used to describe the signing of deaf individuals who have not had sustained access to the linguistic resources of a named language. Early studies of child homesigners focused on documenting their manual communication systems through the lens of developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics, but a recent wave of linguistic ethnographic investigations is challenging many of the established theoretical presuppositions that underlie the foundational homesign research. Sparked by a larger critical movement within Deaf Studies led by deaf scholars, this new generation of scholarship interrogates how researchers portray deaf individuals and their communication practices and questions the conceptualization of language in the foundational body of homesign research. In this review, we discuss these contested issues and the current moment of transition within research on homesign.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the multifaceted phenomenon of homesign, a gestural communication system developed by deaf individuals without exposure to a conventional sign language. Through the lens of linguistic ethnography and sociolinguistics, we explore the contested issues surrounding homesign, including its classification as a language, its role in the emergence of new sign languages, and its implications for understanding language acquisition and development in deaf communities. By analyzing case studies and existing literature, this research highlights the unique linguistic structures of homesign systems and their significance in the broader context of language evolution. The findings underscore the importance of recognizing homesign as a legitimate form of communication and its potential to inform theories of language emergence and sociolinguistic diversity.", "label": 1}
