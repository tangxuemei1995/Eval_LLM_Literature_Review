{"grounding": "In linguistics, ethics has long encompassed matters typically covered under regulatory oversight, but it is increasingly understood as relational and reciprocal, conferring responsibilities and obligations that extend beyond the work produced for other researchers. Those who study language are also coming to interrogate their professional responsibilities not only in how research is done but also in how research is conceived, framed, reported, discussed, and taught, as part of larger discussions around decolonization, intersectionality, and social justice. In this article, we review existing literature on ethics in linguistics, both as it relates to research and as it relates to broader practices, which we then situate within ongoing conversations across subfields. The overarching frame for our discussion is that ethical practice and scientific validity are aligned, and that dismantling dominant discourses and normative practices will serve to advance the work linguists do in meaningful ways.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the multifaceted domain of ethics within the field of linguistics, exploring the intricate balance between ethical praxis, regulatory ethics, and relational ethics, all while maintaining scientific validity. Ethical praxis in linguistics involves the application of moral principles in research and practice, ensuring that linguistic studies respect the dignity and rights of all participants. Regulatory ethics, on the other hand, pertains to the adherence to established guidelines and standards that govern linguistic research, safeguarding against ethical breaches. Relational ethics emphasizes the importance of the relationships between researchers and participants, advocating for a respectful and reciprocal interaction. The paper argues that the integration of these ethical dimensions is crucial for the advancement of linguistics as a discipline that not only seeks to understand human language but also respects the ethical implications of its research methodologies and findings.", "label": 1}
