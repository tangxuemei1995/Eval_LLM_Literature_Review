{"grounding": "Interpreting anaphoric references is a fundamental aspect of our language competence that has long attracted the attention of computational linguists. The appearance of ever-larger anaphorically annotated data sets covering more and more anaphoric phenomena in ever-greater detail has spurred the development of increasingly more sophisticated computational models; as a result, the most recent state-of-the-art neural models are able to achieve impressive performance by leveraging linguistic, lexical, discourse, and encyclopedic information. This article provides a thorough survey of anaphora resolution (coreference) throughout this development, reviewing the available data sets and covering both the preneural history of the field and—in more detail—current neural models, including research on less-studied aspects of anaphoric interpretation such as bridging reference resolution and discourse deixis interpretation.", "generated_text": "This study explores the advancements in computational models of anaphora, focusing on anaphora resolution and coreference within natural language processing. By leveraging neural models for coreference, the research delves into the complexities of bridging reference and discourse deixis, utilizing diverse corpora for anaphora to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Special attention is given to the Winograd Schema Challenge as a benchmark for evaluating the nuanced understanding of context and reference in computational systems. The findings highlight the potential of neural approaches in overcoming traditional limitations, offering insights into the development of more sophisticated models capable of handling the intricacies of anaphoric references in varied linguistic contexts.", "label": 1}
