{"grounding": "The physician–patient relationship has evolved significantly in the past century. Physician authority has been reduced while patients have been empowered. This review focuses on face-to-face clinical care and argues that current physician–patient relations range from partnerships between social actors who each play critical roles in negotiating care to a more adversarial duel in which both participants advocate for goals that are not necessarily shared. While the former is the hope of increased patient involvement, the latter is increasingly common. Through our discussion of existing studies, we document that while high levels of patient participation are beneficial to treatment outcomes, this engagement also has a dark side that threatens treatment outcomes. We discuss some communication resources patients use that affect treatment outcomes, exemplify how patient engagement affects physician communication, and discuss some strategies that current research finds effective for communicating about treatment with today's engaged patients.", "generated_text": "This study explores the pivotal role of health care communication in influencing treatment outcomes, focusing on the dynamics of physician–patient interactions. Utilizing conversation analysis as a methodological framework, the research delves into the nuances of negotiation and decision-making processes within these social interactions. By examining real-life consultations, the study identifies key communication strategies that facilitate effective treatment planning and patient adherence. The findings underscore the importance of mutual understanding and collaborative dialogue in achieving optimal health outcomes. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on health communication by highlighting the critical interplay between conversational practices and treatment efficacy, offering valuable insights for health care professionals aiming to enhance patient care through improved communication techniques.", "label": 1}
