{"grounding": "Classical syntactic theory was designed to permit the type of movement called raising to proceed out of infinitival, but not finite, clausesâ€”a positive result for languages such as English. But crosslinguistic investigation reveals that many languages actually allow raising out of finite clauses (hyperraising), challenging certain commonly assumed locality constraints on movement. This article reviews three types of Minimalist analyses of hyperraising and how they address these challenges, noting the strengths and shortcomings of each. Defectiveness/nonphase analyses commendably tie a clause's ability to launch hyperraising to independent observables, but such analyses struggle to derive the former from the latter. Deactivation analyses boast empirical successes but do not straightforwardly rule out hyperraising in English. Phase-edge analyses also boast empirical successes but face empirical and/or conceptual problems (to which a solution is sketched out) and open questions about learnability. These evaluations are intended to spur syntacticians to develop stronger versions of all three types of analyses, bringing us closer to fully understanding the factors regulating movement, a subcase of the fundamental structure-building operation Merge.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the phenomenon of hyperraising, a syntactic operation that involves the movement of a constituent out of a finite clause, challenging traditional constraints on movement. By examining a range of crosslinguistic data, we investigate the conditions under which hyperraising occurs, focusing on the interplay between movement constraints and clause structure. We critically assess three major theoretical approaches to hyperraising: defectiveness/nonphase analyses, which argue that certain clauses lack phase properties, thereby permitting movement; deactivation analyses, suggesting that phase properties can be deactivated under specific conditions; and phase-edge analyses, which propose that movement targets the edge of a phase. Our analysis reveals significant crosslinguistic variation in the acceptability and realization of hyperraising, shedding light on the underlying syntactic mechanisms and constraints. This study contributes to the broader understanding of movement operations and phase theory, offering new insights into the syntax of finite clauses and the limits of syntactic movement.", "label": 1}
