{"grounding": "Language documentation as a subfield of linguistics has arisen over the past roughly two and a half decades more or less simultaneously with the widespread availability of inexpensive hardware and software for creating, storing, and sharing digital objects. Thus, in some ways the history of advancements within the discipline is also a history of how technological tools have been developed, tested, adopted, and eventually abandoned as newer technologies appear. In this article we examine some recent technologies used both for creating documentary resources, usually considered to include recorded language events in a variety of genres and settings and enough annotation to make them decipherable, and for then mobilizing those resources so that they can be used and shared in language learning, reclamation, revitalization, and analysis.", "generated_text": "The field of language documentation has witnessed significant technological advancements in recent years, revolutionizing the way linguistic resources are created and mobilized. This paper explores the latest innovations in technology that have enhanced the efficiency and accessibility of language documentation efforts. From sophisticated audio and video recording equipment to advanced software for data analysis and archiving, these tools have enabled researchers to capture and preserve linguistic diversity with unprecedented accuracy. Furthermore, the integration of digital platforms and online repositories has facilitated the mobilization of linguistic resources, making them accessible to a global audience. This study highlights the impact of these technological advancements on the field of language documentation, emphasizing their role in promoting linguistic preservation and fostering cross-cultural understanding. The findings underscore the importance of continued investment in technology to support the vital work of language documentation and resource mobilization.", "label": 1}
