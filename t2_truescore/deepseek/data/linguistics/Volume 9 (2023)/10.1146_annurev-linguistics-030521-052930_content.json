{"grounding": "In this review, we discuss the limits of the concept of the modern nation-state to explore language issues in postcolonial contexts, as in Africa. We argue in favor of a revision of the history of the field of language policy and planning (LPP) and sociolinguistics, paying attention to how the colonial issue has been erased and downplayed. We first explore the colonial history of LPP and how this field contributed to frame African multilingualisms as problems to be solved. Second, we briefly discuss how the contemporary understanding of citizenship in Africa is entangled with the colonial history of a particular version of the state in Africa; we focus on Sudan as an example. We problematize the construct of “developing nation” inscribed in the methodological nationalism that characterizes the early LPP framework, which reverberates in contemporary public policies. By doing so, we advocate for a perspective of language that is historically and locally embedded, following a politics that recognizes the importance of Southern epistemologies to language studies.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between postcolonial language policy and planning (LPP) and the concept of the modern nation-state, with a particular focus on Sudan. Employing a postcolonial approach, it critically examines how the legacy of colonialism continues to influence language policies in postcolonial states, challenging the universal applicability of the modern state model. By integrating Southern perspectives, the research highlights the limitations of traditional LPP frameworks in addressing the linguistic diversity and complex socio-political landscapes of postcolonial societies. Through an analysis of Sudan's language policy evolution, the study reveals the tensions between national identity construction and the recognition of linguistic plurality. It argues for a reimagined LPP that transcends the confines of the nation-state paradigm, advocating for policies that are more inclusive and reflective of the postcolonial condition. This research contributes to the broader discourse on LPP by offering insights into the challenges and possibilities of language planning in postcolonial contexts, emphasizing the need for approaches that are sensitive to local histories and realities.", "label": 1}
