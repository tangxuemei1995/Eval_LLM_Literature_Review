{"grounding": "In today's global economy, most people all over the world need to speak a second language (L2) for study, work, or social purposes. Assessment of speaking, either in the classroom or as an external exam, is therefore an important task. However, because of its fleeting nature, the assessment of speaking proficiency is difficult. For valid assessment, a speaking test must measure speaking proficiency without construct-irrelevant variance, for instance, due to tasks, raters, and interlocutors. This article begins by bringing together insights from different disciplines to develop a multi-componential construct of speaking proficiency, which includes linguistic and strategic competencies. Because speaking usually takes place in conversation, the ability to take part in interaction, including rapid prediction, is described as part of the speaking construct. Next, the factors that need to be controlled when making a speaking assessment are discussed. Finally, challenges and ideas for future research are briefly described.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the multifaceted nature of second language speaking proficiency, emphasizing the critical role of interaction in language assessment. By analyzing a comprehensive corpus of spoken language data from learners at various proficiency levels, the research aims to identify key indicators of speaking proficiency that are observable in interactive contexts. The methodology incorporates both quantitative and qualitative analyses, including the use of advanced linguistic software to measure fluency, accuracy, and complexity, alongside expert evaluations of communicative effectiveness. Findings suggest that interaction not only serves as a practical context for assessing speaking skills but also significantly influences the development of these skills. The study concludes with recommendations for integrating interaction-based tasks into language assessment frameworks, thereby providing a more holistic and authentic measure of speaking proficiency. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on language assessment by highlighting the importance of interaction in both evaluating and enhancing second language speaking abilities.", "label": 1}
