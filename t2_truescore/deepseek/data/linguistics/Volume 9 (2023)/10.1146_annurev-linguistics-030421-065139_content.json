{"grounding": "In response to uncovering brain mechanisms underlying vocal communication and searching for biomarkers for mental illnesses, speech prosody has been increasingly studied in recent years in multiple disciplines, including psycholinguistics. In this article, we provide an up-to-date synthesis of the theoretical foundation and empirical evidence to profile linguistic and emotional prosody in the proper characterization of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. Our review reveals a need to develop theoretically motivated and methodologically integrated approaches to the study of context-driven comprehension and expression of pragmatic-affective prosody, which will help elucidate the core features of socio-communicative problems in individuals with mental disorders. We propose that comprehensive models within and across the conventional cognition-emotion-language trichotomy need to be developed to integrate current findings and guide future research. In particular, there needs to be due emphasis on investigating multisensory and cross-modal effects in normal and pathological prosody research. Our review calls for multidisciplinary efforts to address the challenging issues to inform and inspire the advancement of linguistic theories and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between speech prosody and mental disorders, focusing on both prosody recognition and production. Speech prosody, encompassing pragmatic and affective dimensions, plays a pivotal role in communication, conveying emotions and intentions beyond the literal meaning of words. Individuals with mental disorders often exhibit distinct prosodic patterns, which can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research identifies key prosodic features associated with various mental disorders, including but not limited to depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder. The analysis highlights the challenges in prosody recognition and production faced by individuals with these conditions, shedding light on the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the study discusses the implications of these findings for clinical practice, emphasizing the potential of prosody-based interventions in improving communication skills and emotional expression in patients. By bridging the gap between linguistic research and psychiatric practice, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of speech prosody in mental health and disorder.", "label": 1}
