{"grounding": "A heritage language is a sociopolitically minority and/or minoritized language acquired as the first or one of the first languages in a bilingual or multilingual context. Heritage languages are typically acquired under conditions of reduced exposure and are often used less than the majority language during late childhood and adolescence. Heritage languages show structural differences and changes at all levels of linguistic analysis from baseline grammars that arise from the complex interaction between the nature and quantity of input and the age of bilinguals. Although many situations give rise to heritage languages, this article focuses on immigrants and their children and reviews foundational studies of the linguistic properties of heritage languages; studies of age effects that have shed light on critical differences between first, second, and heritage language acquisition; and recent studies of heritage language relearning and reactivation. The implications of the study of heritage languages for bilingualism and society and for the language and cognitive sciences are discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex dynamics of heritage languages, focusing on the processes of language acquisition, loss, and potential reactivation among heritage speakers. Heritage languages, typically acquired in a bilingual context, often undergo attrition when the dominant language of the environment overshadows the native language (L1). This research delves into the factors contributing to L1 attrition and examines the mechanisms through which heritage speakers can regain proficiency in their heritage language through relearning and reactivation strategies. By comparing heritage speakers with native speakers, the study highlights the unique linguistic profiles and challenges faced by bilingual individuals. The findings underscore the importance of supportive linguistic environments and targeted educational interventions in facilitating the maintenance and revival of heritage languages. This investigation contributes to the broader understanding of bilingualism and the resilience of linguistic identity in multilingual contexts.", "label": 1}
