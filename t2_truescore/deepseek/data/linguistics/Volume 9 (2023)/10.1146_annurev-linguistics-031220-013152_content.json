{"grounding": "Environmental linguistics is an emerging field at the intersection of linguistics and natural sciences. It recognizes the mutual relationship between cultural and ecological diversity, documenting linguistic structures and verbal practices by which speakers conceptualize, encode, and transmit knowledge about the natural world. It surpasses the largely metaphorical and narrative program of ecolinguistics to position language as the preeminent conceptual framework and channel for environmental knowledge. Natural phenomena—as Indigenous experts explain—cannot be understood apart from the languages that encode them, and vice versa. Language diversity is thus the key to safeguarding biodiversity and a balanced human relationship with nature. Environmental linguistics helps decolonize linguistics as our field evolves to prioritize knowledge coproduction over data extraction. Examples from my fieldwork in Tuva cover six domains of knowledge: landscapes, lifeforms, time, sound, memory, and survival. This article reviews recent literature from many cultures, emphasizing works by Indigenous authors.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of environmental linguistics, biodiversity, and decolonization through the lens of native science, with a focus on the Tuva region. Environmental linguistics, as a field, examines the intricate relationships between language, culture, and the environment, offering insights into how indigenous knowledge systems contribute to environmental intelligence and sustainable practices. By analyzing the linguistic and cultural practices of the Tuvan people, this research highlights the role of native science in preserving biodiversity and fostering a decolonized approach to environmental management. The findings underscore the importance of integrating indigenous linguistic and ecological knowledge into broader environmental strategies, advocating for a more inclusive and respectful engagement with native sciences. This paper contributes to the growing discourse on environmental linguistics by demonstrating how indigenous languages and knowledge systems can inform and enhance global efforts towards biodiversity conservation and environmental sustainability.", "label": 1}
