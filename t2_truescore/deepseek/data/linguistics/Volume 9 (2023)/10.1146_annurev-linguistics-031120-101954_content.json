{"grounding": "Current empirical work on prosodic prominence is based on theoretical developments in the mid-twentieth century, in which a generalized notion of stress (in word pairs like English insight/incite and in sentence pairs like THEY left/they LEFT) was replaced by a distinction between an abstract notion of word stress and a concrete notion of phrasal accent or prominence that applies to specific words in an utterance. Much research since then has focused on phonetic and other cues that signal such prominence. Early findings emphasized the role of intonational pitch movements; more recent research demonstrates the importance of other phonetic cues, categorical differences between pitch movement types, and nonphonetic factors like word frequency. However, the definition of prominence itself remains informal and depends on intuitions that are well motivated primarily in European languages. Recent findings point to important differences between languages. These might be accommodated in a more comprehensive theory of word and sentence stress that treats both as manifestations of a hierarchical prosodic structure of the sort assumed in metrical phonology, while at the same time allowing for significant differences of prosodic typology.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the manifestation and perception of prosodic prominence across a diverse range of languages, focusing on the interplay between pitch accent, lexical stress, and metrical phonology. Utilizing the Rapid Prosody Transcription (RPT) method, we collected and analyzed data from native speakers of languages with varying prosodic typologies. Our findings reveal significant cross-linguistic differences in the realization of prosodic prominence, particularly in the use of pitch accents and the distribution of lexical stress. Languages with fixed stress systems exhibit more predictable patterns of prominence, whereas those with free stress systems show greater variability. Additionally, we observed that the perception of prominence is influenced by both phonetic cues and metrical structure, with listeners relying on a combination of pitch, duration, and intensity to identify prominent syllables. The results contribute to our understanding of prosodic typology and highlight the importance of considering both production and perception in the study of prosodic prominence. This research has implications for theories of metrical phonology and the development of computational models of prosody.", "label": 0}
