{"grounding": "Chinese developmental dyslexia (DD) research provides important insights into the language-universal and language-specific mechanisms underlying dyslexia. In this article, we review recent advances in Chinese DD. Converging behavioral evidence suggests that, while phonological and rapid automatized naming deficits are language universal, orthographic and morphological deficits are specific to the linguistic properties of Chinese. At the neural level, hypoactivation in the left superior temporal/inferior frontal regions in dyslexic children across Chinese and alphabetic languages may indicate a shared phonological processing deficit, whereas hyperactivation in the right inferior occipital/middle temporal regions and atypical activation in the left frontal areas in Chinese dyslexic children may indicate a language-specific compensatory strategy for impaired visual-spatial analysis and a morphological deficit in Chinese DD, respectively. The findings call for further theoretical endeavors to understand the language-universal and Chinese-specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying dyslexia and to design more effective and efficient intervention programs.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in the study of Chinese developmental dyslexia have highlighted the unique linguistic profiles and neurobiological underpinnings associated with this condition. Unlike alphabetic languages, Chinese dyslexia is characterized by difficulties in character recognition and writing, attributed to the language's logographic nature. Neuroimaging studies have identified specific brain abnormalities, particularly in the left middle frontal gyrus, which plays a crucial role in Chinese character processing. Genetic research has begun to uncover susceptibility genes that may contribute to the disorder, offering insights into its heritability and potential biomarkers. Furthermore, investigations into the universality versus specificity of dyslexia across languages have revealed both shared and distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms, underscoring the importance of considering language-specific factors in dyslexia research. These findings not only enhance our understanding of Chinese developmental dyslexia but also contribute to the broader discourse on language processing and learning disabilities.", "label": 1}
