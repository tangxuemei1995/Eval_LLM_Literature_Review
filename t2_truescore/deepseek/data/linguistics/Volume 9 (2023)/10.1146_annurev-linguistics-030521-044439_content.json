{"grounding": "Neural models greatly outperform grammar-based models across many tasks in modern computational linguistics. This raises the question of whether linguistic principles, such as the Principle of Compositionality, still have value as modeling tools. We review the recent literature and find that while an overly strict interpretation of compositionality makes it hard to achieve broad coverage in semantic parsing tasks, compositionality is still necessary for a model to learn the correct linguistic generalizations from limited data. Reconciling both of these qualities requires the careful exploration of a novel design space; we also review some recent results that may help in this exploration.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the principle of compositionality within computational linguistics, emphasizing its pivotal role in understanding and generating human language through computational models. Compositionality, the concept that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them, is scrutinized in the context of neural networks and neurosymbolic models. These advanced computational frameworks are analyzed for their ability to perform semantic parsing, a task that requires the decomposition of sentences into their semantic components. The study highlights the challenges and advancements in achieving compositional understanding in machines, offering insights into the future of natural language processing technologies.", "label": 1}
