{"grounding": "Research on vaccines in the law and social sciences skews heavily toward an instrumentalist approach to knowledge in service of vaccine promotion. Overcoming hesitancy and promoting vaccine acceptance have been major goals, but successful levers for behavioral change remain elusive. Research with constructivist approaches to vaccines from feminist sociology and anthropology has uncovered ethnographic richness to describe how vaccine debates illuminate inequalities in parenting and re-entrench patterns of racism and colonialism. There is considerable potential in science and technology studies approaches that take seriously the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics, though there are considerable methodological challenges for these research designs. This review charts the lopsided bibliography of law and social science research on vaccines, asking why scholars rarely move away from instrumentalist conceptions of law in the service of public health and, when they do, explaining what theoretical tools enable it.", "generated_text": "This study explores the multifaceted role of vaccines beyond their conventional perception as mere tools of public health, delving into their sociolegal and scientific dimensions. By integrating sociolegal studies with science and technology studies (STS), alongside ethnographic methods, the research investigates how vaccines are embedded within complex networks of law, policy, and societal norms. It examines the interplay between legal frameworks and public health strategies, highlighting how vaccines are not only biological entities but also sociolegal constructs that influence and are influenced by cultural, ethical, and political factors. The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of vaccines as objects of interdisciplinary inquiry, shedding light on their implications for governance, equity, and trust in public health systems. Through this lens, the research contributes to broader discussions on the role of law and science in shaping public health interventions and societal responses to vaccination.", "label": 0}
