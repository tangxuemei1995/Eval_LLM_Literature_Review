{"grounding": "A significant body of social science research is now working with the concept of refeudalization—as well as related terms such as neo-feudalism and neo-medievalism—to analyze a variety of contemporary developments. The social science scholars who use these terms challenge an oversimplified modernization model that regards power relations such as serfdom, vassalage, suzerainty, and fiefdom as merely historical relics. The refeudalization process has significant legal dimensions, which this review outlines to draw out the central implications of the concept of refeudalization for an adequate understanding of current developments in law, society, and politics. Topics covered include the changing relationship between public and private law; the privatization of public authority and responsibilities; the territorial unbundling of sovereignty and the tendency toward multiple, overlapping authorities and jurisdictions; the contractualization of groups and political units as well as individuals; and the changing relationship between sovereignty and political representation.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the concept of refeudalization within the context of modern legal and political systems, examining the transition from the rule of law to ties of allegiance. It argues that contemporary shifts in governance and sovereignty reflect a resurgence of feudal characteristics, where personal and corporate loyalties increasingly overshadow democratic principles and legal impartiality. Through an analysis of the contractualization of public services and the privatization of state functions, the study highlights how these processes contribute to the erosion of democratic representation and the rule of law. By drawing on historical and theoretical perspectives, the paper seeks to illuminate the mechanisms through which refeudalization occurs and its implications for democracy and legal governance. The findings suggest a need for renewed attention to the foundational principles of democracy and the rule of law to counteract the tendencies towards refeudalization in contemporary society.", "label": 0}
