{"grounding": "Feminists have long demonstrated the invisibility of women's reproductive labor, performed in bearing and raising children, maintaining households, and socially sustaining male labor. Every wave of feminist struggle from the late nineteenth century onward has actively queried the inequalities that characterize women's performance of such work, variously referred to as unpaid domestic and care work, domestic labor, or care work. Robust traditions of scholarship on women's unpaid work animate various disciplines, often spilling into political struggles for adequate recognition of this work. As the pandemic has rendered visible once again the reproductive labor of women the world over, this article offers an overview of social reproduction theory, feminist legal theorizations of reproductive labor, and how we might recuperate a rich tradition of theorizing on social reproduction to develop a materialist approach to law's regulation of reproductive labor across the marriage-market spectrum with a view to social and economic justice.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intersection of social reproduction theory, legal realism, and materialist feminism to analyze the legal frameworks governing unpaid domestic and care work. Social reproduction, a concept central to understanding the perpetuation of social and economic systems, encompasses the unpaid labor predominantly performed by women in households. Despite its critical role in sustaining economies, this labor remains largely invisible in legal and economic discourses. Drawing on the insights of legal realism and materialist feminism, this study examines how laws and policies either reinforce or challenge the gendered division of labor. It argues for a reimagining of legal frameworks to recognize and redistribute the burdens of social reproduction more equitably. By integrating perspectives from law and political economy, the paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing debate on how legal systems can better address the material conditions of social reproduction, advocating for transformative legal reforms that acknowledge the value of unpaid work in the broader socio-economic context.", "label": 1}
