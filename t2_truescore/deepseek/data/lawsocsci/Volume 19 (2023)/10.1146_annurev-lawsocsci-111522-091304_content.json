{"grounding": "International agreements on Intellectual Property (IP) have proven to be a good example to study global lawmaking. Beginning by looking at the 1990s Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and into the negotiation and implementation of regional and national trade agreements, this article reflects on the intricate relationship between international IP agreements and public health. The comprehensive analysis of these international rules and their effect provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping health policies. Building upon the IP case, we categorize existing scholarship on global lawmaking into three methodological approaches: (a) methodological internationalism, (b) methodological nationalism, and (c) the interplay between domestic and international factors. We close with a call for researchers to advocate and integrate into their methods a co-constitutive approach that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complexities of global lawmaking through the lens of intellectual property rights (IPR) and international health emergencies, offering a critical analysis of the interplay between these domains. By examining the evolution of international agreements and the challenges posed by methodological nationalism, the research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of global legal frameworks. The paper argues that traditional approaches to studying law, which often prioritize national perspectives, are inadequate for addressing the transnational nature of contemporary legal issues. Through a comparative analysis of IPR and global health governance, the study identifies key lessons for the development of more effective and inclusive global lawmaking processes. The findings underscore the importance of fostering international cooperation and adopting a global perspective to tackle pressing legal and health challenges in an increasingly interconnected world.", "label": 1}
