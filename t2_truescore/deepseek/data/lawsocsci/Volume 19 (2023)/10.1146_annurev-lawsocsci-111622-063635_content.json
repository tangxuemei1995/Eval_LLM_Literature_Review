{"grounding": "This review addresses three questions surrounding authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China. First, what is legality, and does it exist in China's Leninist single-party state? Scholars who characterize the system as order maintenance find the absence of legality. Those employing dual-state and instrumentalist views of law find partial legality. Scholars promoting the notion of bare legality find complete legality. Second, does authoritarian legality strengthen regime legitimacy? Scholars agree that the state seeks legitimation through its embrace of authoritarian legality. Empirical research tests this claim. Third, is China in transition from plan to market, and what is the role of law in state capitalism? The teleology of the transition paradigm overlooks illiberal underpinnings of property rights and factor markets. Answers to these questions help explain regime resilience, economic growth, economic crisis, and inequality in China. Both the institution of the dual state and the perpetuation of plan elements reinforce state power.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China, focusing on the dual state framework where the rule of law coexists with authoritarian governance. It examines how property rights, markets, land, and labor are regulated within this unique political-economic system. The research highlights the tension between the formal legal structures that support market operations and the informal mechanisms of state control that ensure political stability. Through an analysis of legal reforms and economic policies, the paper reveals how the Chinese state leverages its legal system to facilitate economic growth while maintaining tight political control. The findings suggest that the dual state model enables the Chinese government to navigate the complexities of global capitalism, balancing the demands of market efficiency with the imperatives of authoritarian rule. This study contributes to the broader discourse on the adaptability of authoritarian regimes in the face of economic liberalization and global integration.", "label": 1}
