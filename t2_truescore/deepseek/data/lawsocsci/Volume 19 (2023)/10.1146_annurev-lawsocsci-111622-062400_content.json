{"grounding": "This review examines the historical and contemporary factors driving immigrant worker precarity and the central role of race in achieving worker justice. We build from the framework of racial capitalism and historicize the legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession, which have cemented an exclusionary economic system in the United States and globally. We consider how racism and colonial legacies create migrant displacement and shape the experiences of immigrant workers. We also detail how racism permeates the immigration bureaucracy, driving migrant worker precarity. The traditional labor movement has played an important role in closing this gap, but increasingly so have worker centers and the immigrant rights movement as a whole. These partnerships have had to navigate coalitional tensions as they build new strategies for realizing immigrant worker rights.", "generated_text": "This study critically examines the intersection of race, immigration, and labor within the context of low-wage work, aiming to center race in the analysis of immigrant labor experiences. By synthesizing existing literature and incorporating empirical data, the research highlights how systemic racism shapes the working conditions, rights, and justice for immigrant workers. It explores the mechanisms through which racial hierarchies are perpetuated in the labor market, affecting immigrants' access to fair wages, safe working environments, and legal protections. The study argues for a more nuanced understanding of the racialized dimensions of immigrant labor, advocating for policies and practices that address racial inequities and promote justice and rights for all workers. This research contributes to the broader discourse on immigration, labor, and race, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities for achieving equitable labor conditions.", "label": 1}
