{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a salient but polarizing issue of recent times. Actors around the world are engaged in building a governance regime around it. What exactly the “it” is that is being governed, how, by who, and why—these are all less clear. In this review, we attempt to shine some light on those questions, considering literature on AI, the governance of computing, and regulation and governance more broadly. We take critical stock of the different modalities of the global governance of AI that have been emerging, such as ethical councils, industry governance, contracts and licensing, standards, international agreements, and domestic legislation with extraterritorial impact. Considering these, we examine selected rationales and tensions that underpin them, drawing attention to the interests and ideas driving these different modalities. As these regimes become clearer and more stable, we urge those engaging with or studying the global governance of AI to constantly ask the important question of all global governance regimes: Who benefits?", "generated_text": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into global governance structures presents a transformative shift in the mechanisms of international regulation and policy-making. This paper explores the modalities through which AI technologies are being deployed in global governance, focusing on the rationales that underpin their adoption and the tensions that arise from their implementation. By examining case studies of algorithmic regulation and the use of machine learning in decision-making processes, the study highlights the potential of AI to enhance efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity in governance. However, it also identifies significant challenges, including ethical concerns, the risk of bias, and the implications for sovereignty and human rights. The paper argues for a nuanced approach to AI regulation, one that balances the benefits of technological innovation with the need to safeguard democratic values and social equity. Through this analysis, the study contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of AI in shaping the future of global governance.", "label": 1}
