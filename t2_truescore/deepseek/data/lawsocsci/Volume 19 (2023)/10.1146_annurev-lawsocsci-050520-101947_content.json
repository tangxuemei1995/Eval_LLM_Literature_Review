{"grounding": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many complexities involved in using data and advanced technologies to help resolve public health emergencies. These complexities highlight the need to embrace a broader framework of data governance with three foundational questions: (a) who decides about data flows, (b) on what basis, and (c) with what accountability and oversight. These questions can accommodate the issues that have arisen in the literature regarding new types of data harms. However, these questions also foreground important issues of power, authority, and legitimacy. Data governance can provide an organizing normative framework to address emerging data themes including access to data, collective decision making, data intermediaries, data sovereignty, design and digital infrastructure, regulatory technologies, the rule of law, and social trust and license. The pandemic experience with contact tracing apps, in particular, showed the many unresolved governance challenges.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of effective data governance, particularly in the context of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for public health responses such as contact tracing. This research explores the intersection of pandemic management, data privacy, and AI, highlighting the existing gaps in data governance frameworks. It examines how the rapid deployment of AI-driven solutions has raised significant privacy concerns, undermining public trust. The study advocates for the adoption of 'privacy by design' principles to ensure that data governance strategies are robust, transparent, and capable of protecting individual privacy while facilitating the effective use of data for pandemic response. By analyzing case studies and existing literature, this paper aims to contribute to the development of more resilient data governance models that can address the challenges posed by future public health crises.", "label": 1}
