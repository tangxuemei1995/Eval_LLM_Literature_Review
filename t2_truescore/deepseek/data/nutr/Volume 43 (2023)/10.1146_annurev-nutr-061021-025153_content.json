{"grounding": "As dietary guidance for populations shifts from preventing deficiency disorders to chronic disease risk reduction, the biology supporting such guidance becomes more complex due to the multifactorial risk profile of disease and inherent population heterogeneity in the dietâ€“disease relationship. Diet is a primary driver of chronic disease risk, and population-based guidance should account for individual responses. Cascading effects on evidentiary standards for population-based guidance are not straightforward. Precision remains a consideration for dietary guidance to prevent deficiency through the identification of population subgroups with unique nutritional needs. Reducing chronic disease through diet requires greater precision in (a) establishing essential nutrient needs throughout the life cycle in both health and disease; (b) considering effects of nutrients and other food substances on metabolic, immunological, inflammatory, and other physiological responses supporting healthy aging; and (c) considering healthy eating behaviors. Herein we provide a template for guiding population-based eating recommendations for reducing chronic diseases in heterogenous populations.", "generated_text": "Precision nutrition has emerged as a promising approach to tailor dietary recommendations to individual characteristics, aiming to optimize health outcomes and prevent chronic diseases. However, the enthusiasm surrounding precision nutrition often surpasses the current scientific evidence and evidentiary standards required to inform public health recommendations. This review critically examines the state of the science in precision nutrition, focusing on the interplay between nutrient requirements, biological variation, and the development of nutrition policy. We highlight the gaps in research that need to be addressed to ensure that precision nutrition can be effectively integrated into public health strategies. The discussion underscores the importance of rigorous scientific validation and the establishment of robust evidentiary standards before precision nutrition can be widely adopted for the prevention of chronic disease. This analysis calls for a balanced approach that combines the potential of precision nutrition with the foundational principles of public health nutrition.", "label": 1}
