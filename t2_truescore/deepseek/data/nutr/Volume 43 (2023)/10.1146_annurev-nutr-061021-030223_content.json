{"grounding": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic fatty liver disease worldwide, particularly in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals. Currently, there are no therapies for NAFLD that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Herein, we examine the rationale for using ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in NAFLD therapy. This focus is based on the finding that NAFLD severity is associated with a reduction of hepatic C20–22 ω3 PUFAs. Because C20–22 ω3 PUFAs are pleiotropic regulators of cell function, loss of C20–22 ω3 PUFAs has the potential to significantly impact hepatic function. We describe NAFLD prevalence and pathophysiology as well as current NAFLD therapies. We also present evidence from clinical and preclinical studies that evaluated the capacity of C20–22 ω3 PUFAs to treat NAFLD. Given the clinical and preclinical evidence, dietary C20–22 ω3 PUFA supplementation has the potential to decrease human NAFLD severity by reducing hepatosteatosis and liver injury.", "generated_text": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of liver disorders, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. The pathogenesis of NAFLD involves complex interactions between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have emerged as potential therapeutic agents due to their anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties. This review explores the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids modulate hepatic lipid metabolism, reduce inflammation, and prevent fibrosis in NAFLD. Clinical studies suggest that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids can improve liver enzyme levels, reduce hepatic steatosis, and attenuate the progression of NASH. However, the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing fibrosis and cirrhosis remains under investigation. This abstract highlights the potential of omega-3 fatty acids as a therapeutic strategy in NAFLD, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize dosing regimens and understand long-term outcomes.", "label": 1}
