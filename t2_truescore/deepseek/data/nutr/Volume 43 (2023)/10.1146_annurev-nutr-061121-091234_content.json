{"grounding": "Childhood undernutrition is a major global health burden that is only partially resolved by nutritional interventions. Both chronic and acute forms of child undernutrition are characterized by derangements in multiple biological systems including metabolism, immunity, and endocrine systems. A growing body of evidence supports a role of the gut microbiome in mediating these pathways influencing early life growth. Observational studies report alterations in the gut microbiome of undernourished children, while preclinical studies suggest that this can trigger intestinal enteropathy, alter host metabolism, and disrupt immune-mediated resistance against enteropathogens, each of which contribute to poor early life growth. Here, we compile evidence from preclinical and clinical studies and describe the emerging pathophysiological pathways by which the early life gut microbiome influences host metabolism, immunity, intestinal function, endocrine regulation, and other pathways contributing to child undernutrition. We discuss emerging microbiome-directed therapies and consider future research directions to identify and target microbiome-sensitive pathways in child undernutrition.", "generated_text": "Child undernutrition remains a critical global health challenge, manifesting primarily as stunting and wasting, with profound implications for physical and cognitive development. Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in mediating the effects of undernutrition, highlighting a complex interplay between dietary intake, microbial communities, and host physiology. This study delves into the mechanisms by which malnourished microbes contribute to the pathophysiology of child undernutrition, focusing on alterations in microbial diversity, metabolic functions, and immune modulation. By integrating findings from clinical studies and animal models, we explore how dysbiosis exacerbates nutrient malabsorption and systemic inflammation, thereby perpetuating the cycle of undernutrition. Furthermore, this research evaluates the potential of microbiome-targeted interventions, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiota transplantation, in restoring microbial balance and improving nutritional outcomes. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift towards microbiome-informed strategies in combating child undernutrition, offering new avenues for therapeutic innovation and public health policy.", "label": 1}
