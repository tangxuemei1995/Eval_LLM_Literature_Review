{"grounding": "Diet is an important determinant of health and consequently is often implicated in the development of disease, particularly gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, given the high prevalence of meal-related symptoms. The mechanisms underlying diet-driven pathophysiology are not well understood, but recent studies suggest that gut microbiota may mediate the effect of diet on GI physiology. In this review, we focus primarily on two distinct GI diseases where the role of diet has been best studied: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. We discuss how the concurrent and sequential utilization of dietary nutrients by the host and gut microbiota determines the eventual bioactive metabolite profiles in the gut and the biological effect of these metabolites on GI physiology. We highlight several concepts that can be gleaned from these findings, such as how distinct effects of an individual metabolite can influence diverse GI diseases, the effect of similar dietary interventions on multiple disease states, and the need for extensive phenotyping and data collection to help make personalized diet recommendations.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between diet and the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, influencing the gutâ€“brain axis, inflammation, and metabolic processes. This review explores the dynamic relationship between dietary components and microbial communities, highlighting how dietary patterns can modulate the gut microbiota composition and function, thereby impacting host health. We delve into the mechanisms by which diet-induced changes in the microbiome contribute to GI disorders, including alterations in microbial fermentation products and metabolomic profiles. Furthermore, we discuss emerging microbiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions, aimed at restoring microbial balance and alleviating GI symptoms. By integrating findings from recent studies, this review underscores the potential of dietary strategies and microbiome modulation as therapeutic avenues for managing GI disorders, offering insights into personalized nutrition approaches based on individual microbiome profiles.", "label": 1}
