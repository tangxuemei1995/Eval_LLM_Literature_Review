{"grounding": "Together, loss- and gain-of-function experiments have identified the bone-derived secreted molecule osteocalcin as a hormone with a broad reach in rodents and primates. Following its binding to one of three receptors, osteocalcin exerts a profound influence on various aspects of energy metabolism as well as steroidogenesis, neurotransmitter biosynthesis and thereby male fertility, electrolyte homeostasis, cognition, the acute stress response, and exercise capacity. Although this review focuses mostly on the regulation of energy metabolism by osteocalcin, it also touches on its other functions. Lastly, it proposes what could be a common theme between the functions of osteocalcin and between these functions and the structural functions of bone.", "generated_text": "Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes beyond its traditional association with bone metabolism. This review highlights the multifaceted functions of osteocalcin, particularly its undercarboxylated form, which has emerged as a significant regulator of energy metabolism. It influences glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and sensitivity, thereby linking bone health with energy regulation. Furthermore, recent studies have unveiled its role as a danger repellent, protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation. The intricate mechanisms through which osteocalcin exerts these effects underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders and bone-related diseases, offering new insights into the bone-endocrine axis.", "label": 1}
