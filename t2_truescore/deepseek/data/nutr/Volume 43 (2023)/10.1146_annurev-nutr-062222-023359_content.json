{"grounding": "The US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service leads the federal government in data development and research on food security in US households. Nutrition security is an emerging concept that, although closely related, is distinct from food security. No standard conceptualization or measure of nutrition security currently exists. We review the existing research on nutrition security and how it is informed by the more robust literature on food security and diet quality. Based on this review, we propose a conceptual framework for understanding nutrition security and its relationship to food security. We identify two constructs (healthy diets and nutritional status) and multiple subconstructs that form the basis of nutrition security. The proposed framework and corresponding constructs are intended to provide (a) understanding of how nutrition security arises and how it differs from food security, (b) background on why assessment and monitoring of nutrition security is important, and (c) guidance for a research agenda that will further clarify the meaning of nutrition security and its measurement.", "generated_text": "Nutrition security, an extension of food security, emphasizes the importance of access to not just sufficient food, but to nutritious food that supports a healthy dietary intake and positive health outcomes. This study aims to assess and monitor the state of nutrition security in the United States, identifying key factors that influence dietary quality and health disparities among different populations. By analyzing existing data on food access, dietary patterns, and health outcomes, alongside conducting surveys and interviews with diverse communities, this research seeks to uncover the barriers to achieving nutrition security. Furthermore, it evaluates the effectiveness of current policies and programs designed to improve dietary intake and health outcomes. The findings will contribute to the development of targeted interventions and strategies to enhance nutrition security, thereby promoting healthier dietary practices and reducing health disparities across the United States. This study underscores the critical need for a comprehensive approach to monitoring and addressing nutrition security as a fundamental component of public health.", "label": 0}
