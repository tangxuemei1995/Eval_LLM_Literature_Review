{"grounding": "Gluconeogenesis is a critical biosynthetic process that helps maintain whole-body glucose homeostasis and becomes altered in certain medical diseases. We review gluconeogenic flux in various medical diseases, including common metabolic disorders, hormonal imbalances, specific inborn genetic errors, and cancer. We discuss how the altered gluconeogenic activity contributes to disease pathogenesis using data from experiments using isotopic tracer and spectroscopy methodologies. These in vitro, animal, and human studies provide insights into the changes in circulating levels of available gluconeogenesis substrates and the efficiency of converting those substrates to glucose by gluconeogenic organs. We highlight ongoing knowledge gaps, discuss emerging research areas, and suggest future investigations. A better understanding of altered gluconeogenesis flux may ultimately identify novel and targeted treatment strategies for such diseases.", "generated_text": "Gluconeogenesis, a critical metabolic pathway, plays a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, especially under fasting conditions. This process, however, is intricately linked with various metabolic diseases, including insulin resistance and enzyme deficiencies, which can significantly alter its flux. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between hormones and gluconeogenesis, revealing how hormonal imbalances can exacerbate metabolic disorders. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a connection between altered gluconeogenesis flux and cancer metabolism, indicating potential therapeutic targets. This review aims to explore the mechanisms by which gluconeogenesis flux is regulated in the context of metabolic disease, the impact of hormonal regulation, and the implications of enzyme deficiencies. Additionally, it will discuss the emerging role of gluconeogenesis in cancer metabolism, providing insights into novel intervention strategies for metabolic and oncological diseases.", "label": 1}
