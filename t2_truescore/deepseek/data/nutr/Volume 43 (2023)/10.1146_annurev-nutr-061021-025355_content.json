{"grounding": "The prenatal and early postnatal periods are stages during which dynamic changes and the development of the brain and gut microbiota occur, and nutrition is one of the most important modifiable factors that influences this process. Given the bidirectional cross talk between the gut microbiota and the brain through the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), there is growing interest in evaluating the potential effects of nutritional interventions administered during these critical developmental windows on gut microbiota composition and function and their association with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We review recent preclinical and clinical evidence from animal studies and infant/child populations. Although further research is needed, growing evidence suggests that different functional nutrients affect the establishment and development of the microbiota–gut–brain axis and could have preventive and therapeutic use in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, more in-depth knowledge regarding the effect of nutrition on the MGBA during critical developmental windows may enable the prevention of later neurocognitive and behavioral disorders and allow the establishment of individualized nutrition-based programs that can be used from the prenatal to the early and middle stages of life.", "generated_text": "The microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) plays a pivotal role in the early development of infants, influencing both physical and mental health outcomes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how maternal and infant nutrition impact the development of the MGBA. Key nutritional components, including milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics, are examined for their roles in shaping the infant gut microbiota and, consequently, the MGBA. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is highlighted as a critical factor that can modulate the composition of the infant gut microbiota, with implications for neurodevelopment and immune system maturation. The review also explores the potential of dietary interventions in infancy to support a healthy MGBA, emphasizing the importance of breastfeeding and the strategic use of nutritional supplements. By integrating findings from recent studies, this abstract underscores the significance of early nutritional strategies in promoting optimal development of the MGBA, offering insights for future research and clinical practice.", "label": 1}
