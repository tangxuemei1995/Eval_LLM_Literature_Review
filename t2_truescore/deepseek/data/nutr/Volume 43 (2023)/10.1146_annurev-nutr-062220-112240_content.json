{"grounding": "Fatty acidâ€“binding proteins (FABPs) are small lipid-binding proteins abundantly expressed in tissues that are highly active in fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Ten mammalian FABPs have been identified, with tissue-specific expression patterns and highly conserved tertiary structures. FABPs were initially studied as intracellular FA transport proteins. Further investigation has demonstrated their participation in lipid metabolism, both directly and via regulation of gene expression, and in signaling within their cells of expression. There is also evidence that they may be secreted and have functional impact via the circulation. It has also been shown that the FABP ligand binding repertoire extends beyond long-chain FAs and that their functional properties also involve participation in systemic metabolism. This article reviews the present understanding of FABP functions and their apparent roles in disease, particularly metabolic and inflammation-related disorders and cancers.", "generated_text": "The mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) represent a crucial family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins that play pivotal roles in lipid metabolism and transport. These proteins facilitate the solubilization and intracellular trafficking of fatty acids and other lipophilic substances, thereby influencing various cellular processes including energy homeostasis, signaling pathways, and gene expression regulation. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of FABPs in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a link between FABPs and cancer progression, with certain FABP isoforms being implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the multifunctional roles of FABPs in health and disease, with a particular focus on their contributions to lipid metabolism, metabolic diseases, and cancer, thereby offering insights into their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.", "label": 1}
