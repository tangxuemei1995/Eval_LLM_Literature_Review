{"grounding": "Modernization of society from a rural, hunter-gatherer setting into an urban and industrial habitat, with the associated dietary changes, has led to an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic and additional noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. However, while dietary sciences have been rapidly evolving to meet these challenges, validation and translation of experimental results into clinical practice remain limited for multiple reasons, including inherent ethnic, gender, and cultural interindividual variability, among other methodological, dietary reporting–related, and analytical issues. Recently, large clinical cohorts with artificial intelligence analytics have introduced new precision and personalized nutrition concepts that enable one to successfully bridge these gaps in a real-life setting. In this review, we highlight selected examples of case studies at the intersection between diet–disease research and artificial intelligence. We discuss their potential and challenges and offer an outlook toward the transformation of dietary sciences into individualized clinical translation.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between diet and disease has long been a focal point of nutritional science, yet the complexity of these interactions often eludes traditional analytical methods. This study explores the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly neural networks, in unraveling the nuanced connections between dietary patterns and disease outcomes. By leveraging AI's capacity for processing vast datasets and identifying subtle patterns, we present case studies that demonstrate its efficacy in advancing precision and personalized nutrition. Our findings underscore AI's role in facilitating a deeper understanding of diet–disease relationships, enabling the development of tailored dietary recommendations that could significantly impact public health. This research highlights the synergy between AI and nutritional science, paving the way for innovative approaches to disease prevention and management through diet.", "label": 1}
