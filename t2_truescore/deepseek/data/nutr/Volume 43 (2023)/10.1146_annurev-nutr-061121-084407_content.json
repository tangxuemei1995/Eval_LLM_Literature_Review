{"grounding": "Riboflavin, in its cofactor forms flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), plays fundamental roles in energy metabolism, cellular antioxidant potential, and metabolic interactions with other micronutrients, including iron, vitamin B6, and folate. Severe riboflavin deficiency, largely confined to low-income countries, clinically manifests as cheilosis, angular stomatitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and severe anemia with erythroid hypoplasia. Subclinical deficiency may be much more widespread, including in high-income countries, but typically goes undetected because riboflavin biomarkers are rarely measured in human studies. There are adverse health consequences of low and deficient riboflavin status throughout the life cycle, including anemia and hypertension, that could contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. This review considers the available evidence on causes, detection, and consequences of riboflavin deficiency, ranging from clinical deficiency signs to manifestations associated with less severe deficiency, and the related research, public health, and policy priorities.", "generated_text": "Riboflavin, a crucial water-soluble vitamin, plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism and cellular function. Deficiency in riboflavin, often assessed through the Erythrocyte Glutathione Reductase Activation Coefficient (EGRac), can lead to significant clinical sequelae, including anemia and hypertension. This review explores the causes of riboflavin deficiency, ranging from inadequate dietary intake to impaired absorption and increased metabolic demand. Furthermore, it examines the relationship between riboflavin status and its impact on health outcomes, particularly focusing on the mechanisms by which deficiency contributes to the development of anemia and hypertension. The importance of adhering to dietary reference intakes for riboflavin is highlighted, emphasizing the need for public health strategies to prevent deficiency and its associated health risks. This synthesis of current literature aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of riboflavin's role in human health and the consequences of its deficiency.", "label": 1}
