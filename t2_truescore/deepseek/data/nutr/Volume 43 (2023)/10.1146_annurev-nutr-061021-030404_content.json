{"grounding": "Pregnancy entails a large negative balance of iron, an essential micronutrient. During pregnancy, iron requirements increase substantially to support both maternal red blood cell expansion and the development of the placenta and fetus. As insufficient iron has long been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, universal iron supplementation is common practice before and during pregnancy. However, in high-resource countries with iron fortification of staple foods and increased red meat consumption, the effects of too much iron supplementation during pregnancy have become a concern because iron excess has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we address physiologic iron homeostasis of the mother, placenta, and fetus and discuss perturbations in iron homeostasis that result in pathological pregnancy. As many mechanistic regulatory systems have been deduced from animal models, we also discuss the principles learned from these models and how these may apply to human pregnancy.", "generated_text": "Iron homeostasis during pregnancy is a complex process that involves intricate regulatory mechanisms to ensure adequate iron supply for both the mother and the developing fetus. This review explores the roles of maternal, placental, and fetal systems in maintaining iron balance, with a focus on the hormone hepcidin, which is a central regulator of iron metabolism. During pregnancy, maternal hepcidin levels are typically suppressed to enhance iron absorption and mobilization, facilitating iron transfer to the fetus. The placenta plays a critical role in this process, acting as a selective barrier and transporter of iron. Disruptions in these regulatory mechanisms can lead to iron deficiency, which is a common nutritional deficiency in pregnancy and can have significant implications for maternal and fetal health. Additionally, inflammation can alter iron homeostasis, complicating the management of iron status during pregnancy. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective interventions to prevent and treat iron deficiency in pregnant women.", "label": 1}
