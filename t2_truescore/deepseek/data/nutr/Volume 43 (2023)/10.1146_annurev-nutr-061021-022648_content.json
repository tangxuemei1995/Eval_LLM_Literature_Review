{"grounding": "Amino acid dysregulation has emerged as an important driver of disease progression in various contexts. l-Serine lies at a central node of metabolism, linking carbohydrate metabolism, transamination, glycine, and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism to protein synthesis and various downstream bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways. l-Serine is produced locally in the brain but is sourced predominantly from glycine and one-carbon metabolism in peripheral tissues via liver and kidney metabolism. Compromised regulation or activity of l-serine synthesis and disposal occurs in the context of genetic diseases as well as chronic disease states, leading to low circulating l-serine levels and pathogenesis in the nervous system, retina, heart, and aging muscle. Dietary interventions in preclinical models modulate sensory neuropathy, retinopathy, tumor growth, and muscle regeneration. A serine tolerance test may provide a quantitative readout of l-serine homeostasis that identifies patients who may be susceptible to neuropathy or responsive to therapy.", "generated_text": "Serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a pivotal role in various metabolic pathways, serving as a precursor for the synthesis of glycine, cysteine, and other critical biomolecules. This review explores the intricate balance of serine sources and sinks within the human body, emphasizing its significance in nutrition, health, and disease. Through the lens of metabolic flux analysis and metabolomics, we delve into the dynamic regulation of serine metabolism and its implications for conditions such as neuropathy and diabetes. The synthesis and degradation of serine are tightly regulated, with dietary intake, biosynthesis, and inter-organ transport contributing to its homeostasis. Disruptions in serine metabolism have been linked to a range of pathological states, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of its metabolic pathways. This abstract underscores the importance of serine in maintaining metabolic balance and its potential as a therapeutic target in disease management.", "label": 1}
