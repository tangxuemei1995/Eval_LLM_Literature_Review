{"grounding": "The subcellular localization of a biopolymer often informs its function. RNA is traditionally confined to the cytosolic and nuclear spaces, where it plays critical and conserved roles across nearly all biochemical processes. Our recent observation of cell surface glycoRNAs may further explain the extracellular role of RNA. While cellular membranes are efficient gatekeepers of charged polymers such as RNAs, a large body of research has demonstrated the accumulation of specific RNA species outside of the cell, termed extracellular RNAs (exRNAs). Across various species and forms of life, protein pores have evolved to transport RNA across membranes, thus providing a mechanistic path for exRNAs to achieve their extracellular topology. Here, we review types of exRNAs and the pores capable of RNA transport to provide a logical and testable path toward understanding the biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs.", "generated_text": "The discovery of extracellular RNA (exRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs has opened new avenues in understanding RNA's role beyond the intracellular environment. This study delves into the systems and mechanisms facilitating RNA crossing membranes, focusing on the contextualization of exRNA and glycoRNAs on cell surfaces. By integrating findings from recent literature, we explore the biogenesis, trafficking, and functional implications of these RNA species. Special attention is given to the molecular interactions and pathways that enable RNA to traverse cellular membranes and localize on the cell surface, where they partake in cell-to-cell communication and signaling. This research underscores the significance of glycoRNAs in cellular recognition processes and their potential as biomarkers for disease. The findings contribute to a broader comprehension of RNA's extracellular functions and its implications for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.", "label": 1}
