{"grounding": "Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis across many individuals at single-cell resolution. Compared with bulk RNA sequencing, which averages gene expression across cell types and cell states, single-cell assays capture the transcriptional states of individual cells, including fine-grained, transient, and difficult-to-isolate populations at unprecedented scale and resolution. Single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) mapping can identify context-dependent eQTLs that vary with cell states, including some that colocalize with disease variants identified in genome-wide association studies. By uncovering the precise contexts in which these eQTLs act, single-cell approaches can unveil previously hidden regulatory effects and pinpoint important cell states underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. Here, we present an overview of recently deployed experimental designs in sc-eQTL studies. In the process, we consider the influence of study design choices such as cohort, cell states, and ex vivo perturbations. We then discuss current methodologies, modeling approaches, and technical challenges as well as future opportunities and applications.", "generated_text": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting the genetic basis of gene regulation at an unprecedented resolution. By leveraging single-cell sequencing technologies, sc-eQTL studies enable the identification of genetic variants that influence gene expression in individual cells, offering insights into the cellular heterogeneity and context-specific regulatory mechanisms. This review highlights the methodologies employed in sc-eQTL mapping, including the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with genomic information to pinpoint noncoding variants that modulate gene expression across different cell states. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in sc-eQTL research, such as the need for scalable computational frameworks and the potential to uncover novel regulatory elements that drive cell-type-specific phenotypes. Furthermore, we explore the implications of sc-eQTL findings for understanding complex traits and diseases, emphasizing the role of cell state dynamics in mediating the effects of genetic variation on gene expression. This synthesis underscores the transformative potential of sc-eQTL analysis in advancing our knowledge of gene regulation and its impact on cellular function and organismal biology.", "label": 1}
