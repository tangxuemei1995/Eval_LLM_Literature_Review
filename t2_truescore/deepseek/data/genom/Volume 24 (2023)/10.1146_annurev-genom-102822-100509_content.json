{"grounding": "DECIPHER (Database of Genomic Variation and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources) shares candidate diagnostic variants and phenotypic data from patients with genetic disorders to facilitate research and improve the diagnosis, management, and therapy of rare diseases. The platform sits at the boundary between genomic research and the clinical community. DECIPHER aims to ensure that the most up-to-date data are made rapidly available within its interpretation interfaces to improve clinical care. Newly integrated cardiac case–control data that provide evidence of gene–disease associations and inform variant interpretation exemplify this mission. New research resources are presented in a format optimized for use by a broad range of professionals supporting the delivery of genomic medicine. The interfaces within DECIPHER integrate and contextualize variant and phenotypic data, helping to determine a robust clinico-molecular diagnosis for rare-disease patients, which combines both variant classification and clinical fit. DECIPHER supports discovery research, connecting individuals within the rare-disease community to pursue hypothesis-driven research.", "generated_text": "The DECIPHER project represents a pioneering approach to enhancing genetic diagnosis by dynamically integrating genomic and clinical data. This initiative focuses on rare diseases and genetic disorders, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of genetic diagnosis through advanced genotype–phenotype correlation and variant interpretation techniques. By leveraging a comprehensive database that amalgamates genetic information with detailed clinical phenotypes, DECIPHER facilitates the identification of pathogenic variants and their association with specific diseases. This integrated approach not only aids in the elucidation of the genetic basis of rare diseases but also supports the development of personalized treatment strategies. The project underscores the importance of collaborative data sharing among researchers and clinicians, thereby accelerating the pace of genetic discovery and improving patient outcomes. DECIPHER's innovative framework sets a new standard for genetic diagnosis, offering hope for individuals affected by rare and complex genetic conditions.", "label": 1}
