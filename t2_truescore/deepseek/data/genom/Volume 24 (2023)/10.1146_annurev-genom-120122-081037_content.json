{"grounding": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic blood disease caused by a point mutation in the gene coding for Î²-globin. The abnormal hemoglobin [sickle hemoglobin (HbS)] polymerizes under low-oxygen conditions and causes red blood cells to sickle. The clinical presentation varies from very severe (with acute pain, chronic pain, and early mortality) to normal (few complications and a normal life span). The variability of SCD might be due (in part) to various genetic modulators. First, we review the main genetic factors, polymorphisms, and modifier genes that influence the expression of globin or otherwise modulate the severity of SCD. Considering SCD as a complex, multifactorial disorder is important for the development of appropriate pharmacological and genetic treatments. Second, we review the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of the latest advances in gene therapy for SCD, from lentiviral-vector-based approaches to gene-editing strategies.", "generated_text": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells, leading to various complications. This review delves into the genetic underpinnings of SCD, highlighting the role of genetic modifiers that influence disease severity. Recent advancements in curative approaches, particularly gene therapy and gene editing technologies, are explored, with a focus on ongoing clinical trials. The utilization of viral vectors for gene delivery and concerns regarding genotoxicity are critically examined. These innovative strategies offer promising avenues for the treatment of SCD, potentially transforming the therapeutic landscape for patients suffering from this debilitating condition.", "label": 1}
