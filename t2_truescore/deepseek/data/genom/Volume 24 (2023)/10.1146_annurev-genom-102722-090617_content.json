{"grounding": "The axial length of the eye is critical for normal visual function by enabling light to precisely focus on the retina. The mean axial length of the adult human eye is 23.5 mm, but the molecular mechanisms regulating ocular axial length remain poorly understood. Underdevelopment can lead to microphthalmia (defined as a small eye with an axial length of less than 19 mm at 1 year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood) within the first trimester of pregnancy. However, continued overgrowth can lead to axial high myopia (an enlarged eye with an axial length of 26.5 mm or more) at any age. Both conditions show high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity associated with significant visual morbidity worldwide. More than 90 genes can contribute to microphthalmia, and several hundred genes are associated with myopia, yet diagnostic yields are low. Crucially, the genetic pathways underpinning the specification of eye size are only now being discovered, with evidence suggesting that shared molecular pathways regulate under- or overgrowth of the eye. Improving our mechanistic understanding of axial length determination will help better inform us of genotype–phenotype correlations in both microphthalmia and myopia, dissect gene–environment interactions in myopia, and develop postnatal therapies that may influence overall eye growth.", "generated_text": "The axial length of the eye is a critical determinant of its refractive status, with deviations from the norm leading to significant visual impairments such as microphthalmia and high myopia. This study delves into the genetic underpinnings that influence axial length, focusing on the spectrum from microphthalmia, characterized by abnormally small eyes, to high myopia, where the eye is excessively elongated. Through a comprehensive review of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and familial linkage analyses, we identify key genetic loci and pathways implicated in the regulation of ocular growth. Our findings highlight the role of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, signaling pathways governing eye development, and factors influencing scleral biomechanics. Furthermore, we explore the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as near work and outdoor activity, in the manifestation of axial length anomalies. This research underscores the complexity of genetic contributions to axial length and offers insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing or mitigating the progression of refractive errors in childhood.", "label": 1}
