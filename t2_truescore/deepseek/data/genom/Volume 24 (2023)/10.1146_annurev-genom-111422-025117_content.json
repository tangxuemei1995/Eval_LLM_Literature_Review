{"grounding": "Genetic data contain a record of our evolutionary history. The availability of large-scale datasets of human populations from various geographic areas and timescales, coupled with advances in the computational methods to analyze these data, has transformed our ability to use genetic data to learn about our evolutionary past. Here, we review some of the widely used statistical methods to explore and characterize population relationships and history using genomic data. We describe the intuition behind commonly used approaches, their interpretation, and important limitations. For illustration, we apply some of these techniques to genome-wide autosomal data from 929 individuals representing 53 worldwide populations that are part of the Human Genome Diversity Project. Finally, we discuss the new frontiers in genomic methods to learn about population history. In sum, this review highlights the power (and limitations) of DNA to infer features of human evolutionary history, complementing the knowledge gleaned from other disciplines, such as archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics.", "generated_text": "The advent of genomic data has revolutionized our understanding of population relationships and history, offering unprecedented insights into demographic inference, admixture, ancestry, effective population size, and the calibration of molecular clocks. This study reviews the methodologies employed in the analysis of genomic data to unravel the complex tapestry of human and non-human populations. We focus on the computational and statistical frameworks that facilitate the estimation of demographic parameters, the detection of admixture events, and the reconstruction of ancestral relationships. Furthermore, we explore the application of molecular clocks in dating evolutionary events, emphasizing the integration of genomic data with fossil and archaeological records to enhance temporal resolution. The review highlights the challenges and opportunities in the field, including the impact of selection, mutation rates, and population structure on the accuracy of demographic inferences. By synthesizing current approaches, this work aims to guide future research in leveraging genomic data to decode the intricate history of populations.", "label": 1}
