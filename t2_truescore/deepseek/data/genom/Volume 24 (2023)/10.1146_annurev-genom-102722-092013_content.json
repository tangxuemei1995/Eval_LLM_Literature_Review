{"grounding": "Elucidating spatiotemporal changes in gene expression has been an essential goal in studies of health, development, and disease. In the emerging field of spatially resolved transcriptomics, gene expression profiles are acquired with the tissue architecture maintained, sometimes at cellular resolution. This has allowed for the development of spatial cell atlases, studies of cell–cell interactions, and in situ cell typing. In this review, we focus on padlock probe–based in situ sequencing, which is a targeted spatially resolved transcriptomic method. We summarize recent methodological and computational tool developments and discuss key applications. We also discuss compatibility with other methods and integration with multiomic platforms for future applications.", "generated_text": "Padlock probe–based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) represents a cutting-edge approach in spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT), enabling the precise localization and identification of RNA molecules within intact tissue sections. This method leverages the specificity of padlock probes and the amplification power of rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve high-resolution, multiplexed detection of gene expression patterns. By facilitating the construction of detailed spatial cell atlases and enabling in situ cell typing, ISS offers profound insights into the spatial organization and functional states of cells within their native tissue context. This overview highlights the methodological advancements and diverse applications of ISS in advancing our understanding of complex biological systems and disease mechanisms.", "label": 1}
