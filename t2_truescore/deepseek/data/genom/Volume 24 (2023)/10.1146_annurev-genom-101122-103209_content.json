{"grounding": "Genome sequencing is increasingly used in research and integrated into clinical care. In the research domain, large-scale analyses, including whole genome sequencing with variant interpretation and curation, virtually guarantee identification of variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic and actionable. Multiple guidelines recommend that findings associated with actionable conditions be offered to research participants in order to demonstrate respect for autonomy, reciprocity, and participant interests in health and privacy. Some recommendations go further and support offering a wider range of findings, including those that are not immediately actionable. In addition, entities covered by the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be required to provide a participant's raw genomic data on request. Despite these widely endorsed guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. This article analyzes the ethical and legal foundations for researcher duties to offer adult participants their interpreted results and raw data as the new normal in genomic research.", "generated_text": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in genomic research has significantly enhanced our understanding of human genetics, yet it also presents complex ethical challenges, particularly concerning the return of results (RoR) to participants. This paper explores the evolving landscape of RoR in the context of genomic research, focusing on the implications of secondary and incidental findings. As WGS becomes increasingly integrated into research protocols, the traditional norms governing RoR are being reevaluated to accommodate the vast amount of data generated. We argue for the establishment of a 'new normal' in RoR practices that balances the ethical obligations to participants with the practical limitations of interpreting and communicating complex genomic information. This discussion underscores the need for clear guidelines, participant autonomy, and the consideration of potential psychological impacts, aiming to foster a more participant-centered approach in genomic research.", "label": 1}
