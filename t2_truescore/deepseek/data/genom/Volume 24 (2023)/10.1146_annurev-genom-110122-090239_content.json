{"grounding": "In meiosis, homologous chromosome synapsis is mediated by a supramolecular protein structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), that assembles between homologous chromosome axes. The mammalian SC comprises at least eight largely coiled-coil proteins that interact and self-assemble to generate a long, zipper-like structure that holds homologous chromosomes in close proximity and promotes the formation of genetic crossovers and accurate meiotic chromosome segregation. In recent years, numerous mutations in human SC genes have been associated with different types of male and female infertility. Here, we integrate structural information on the human SC with mouse and human genetics to describe the molecular mechanisms by which SC mutations can result in human infertility. We outline certain themes in which different SC proteins are susceptible to different types of disease mutation and how genetic variants with seemingly minor effects on SC proteins may act as dominant-negative mutations in which the heterozygous state is pathogenic.", "generated_text": "Meiosis is a critical process for sexual reproduction, ensuring genetic diversity through the formation of haploid gametes. Central to this process is the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure that facilitates homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination. Disruptions in the formation or function of the SC can lead to meiotic errors, which are implicated in various forms of infertility, including azoospermia, primary ovarian failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss. This review explores the intricate relationship between meiotic chromosome structure, the SC, and infertility, highlighting recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions. By elucidating the role of the SC in meiosis, this research aims to provide insights into the genetic and molecular basis of infertility, offering potential avenues for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.", "label": 1}
