{"grounding": "The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play a pivotal role in bone development and skeletal health. More than 30 different types of skeletal dysplasia are now known to be caused by pathogenic variants in genes that belong to the TGF-β superfamily and/or regulate TGF-β/BMP bioavailability. This review describes the latest advances in skeletal dysplasia that is due to impaired TGF-β/BMP signaling and results in short stature (acromelic dysplasia and cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome) or tall stature (Marfan syndrome). We thoroughly describe the clinical features of the patients, the underlying genetic findings, and the pathomolecular mechanisms leading to disease, which have been investigated mainly using patient-derived skin fibroblasts and mouse models. Although no pharmacological treatment is yet available for skeletal dysplasia due to impaired TGF-β/BMP signaling, in recent years advances in the use of drugs targeting TGF-β have been made, and we also discuss these advances.", "generated_text": "Skeletal dysplasia encompasses a group of disorders characterized by abnormal growth and development of bone and cartilage, leading to a spectrum of phenotypes including short and tall stature. This review focuses on the pivotal roles of Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of skeletal dysplasia. TGF-β and BMP signaling are crucial for the regulation of bone formation, remodeling, and homeostasis. Dysregulation of these pathways can result in aberrant skeletal development, manifesting as either short or tall stature. Through an extensive literature review, we explore the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in TGF-β and BMP signaling components contribute to the phenotypic variability observed in skeletal dysplasia. Furthermore, we discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these pathways for the treatment of skeletal dysplasia. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of TGF-β and BMP signaling in skeletal biology and highlights the need for further research to elucidate their roles in skeletal dysplasia.", "label": 1}
