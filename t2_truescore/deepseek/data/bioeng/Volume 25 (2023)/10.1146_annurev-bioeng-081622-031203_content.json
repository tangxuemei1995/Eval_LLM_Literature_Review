{"grounding": "Hemolysis (i.e., red blood cell lysis) can increase circulatory levels of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) and its degradation by-products, namely heme (h) and iron (Fe). Under homeostasis, minor increases in these three hemolytic by-products (Hb/h/Fe) are rapidly scavenged and cleared by natural plasma proteins. Under certain pathophysiological conditions, scavenging systems become overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of Hb/h/Fe in the circulation. Unfortunately, these species cause various side effects such as vasoconstriction, hypertension, and oxidative organ damage. Therefore, various therapeutics strategies are in development, ranging from supplementation with depleted plasma scavenger proteins to engineered biomimetic protein constructs capable of scavenging multiple hemolytic species. In this review, we briefly describe hemolysis and the characteristics of the major plasma-derived protein scavengers of Hb/h/Fe. Finally, we present novel engineering approaches designed to address the toxicity of these hemolytic by-products.", "generated_text": "Hemolysis, the breakdown of red blood cells, releases hemoglobin, heme, and iron into the bloodstream, posing significant oxidative stress and toxicity risks. This research focuses on engineering therapeutic strategies to detoxify these byproducts, leveraging the natural scavengers haptoglobin and hemopexin. Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin, preventing its oxidative damage, while hemopexin sequesters heme, mitigating its toxic effects. Our approach involves enhancing the efficacy of these proteins through genetic and protein engineering techniques, aiming to develop novel therapeutics that can effectively neutralize the harmful effects of hemolysis. By targeting the detoxification pathways of hemoglobin, heme, and iron, this study aims to provide innovative solutions for treating hemolysis-related conditions, offering potential benefits for patients with hemolytic disorders, sepsis, and other conditions characterized by excessive hemolysis.", "label": 1}
