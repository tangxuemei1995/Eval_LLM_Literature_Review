{"grounding": "Over the past decade, the increased adoption of electroporation-based technologies has led to an expansion of clinical research initiatives. Electroporation has been utilized in molecular biology for mammalian and bacterial transfection; for food sanitation; and in therapeutic settings to increase drug uptake, for gene therapy, and to eliminate cancerous tissues. We begin this article by discussing the biophysics required for understanding the concepts behind the cell permeation phenomenon that is electroporation. We then review nano- and microscale single-cell electroporation technologies before scaling up to emerging in vivo applications.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in electroporation technologies have significantly impacted both research and clinical applications, bridging the gap from bench to clinic. This review highlights the latest developments in pulsed field ablation, transfection, gene therapy, electrochemotherapy, and microfluidics. These innovations have enhanced the precision, efficiency, and safety of electroporation, enabling targeted therapeutic delivery and improved patient outcomes. The integration of microfluidic systems has further miniaturized and automated electroporation processes, facilitating high-throughput applications. Collectively, these advancements underscore the transformative potential of electroporation technologies in advancing biomedical research and therapeutic interventions.", "label": 0}
