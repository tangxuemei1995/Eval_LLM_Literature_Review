{"grounding": "Penetrating neural electrodes provide a powerful approach to decipher brain circuitry by allowing for time-resolved electrical detections of individual action potentials. This unique capability has contributed tremendously to basic and translational neuroscience, enabling both fundamental understandings of brain functions and applications of human prosthetic devices that restore crucial sensations and movements. However, conventional approaches are limited by the scarce number of available sensing channels and compromised efficacy over long-term implantations. Recording longevity and scalability have become the most sought-after improvements in emerging technologies. In this review, we discuss the technological advances in the past 5â€“10 years that have enabled larger-scale, more detailed, and longer-lasting recordings of neural circuits at work than ever before. We present snapshots of the latest advances in penetration electrode technology, showcase their applications in animal models and humans, and outline the underlying design principles and considerations to fuel future technological development.", "generated_text": "The field of electrophysiology has witnessed significant advancements with the development of emerging penetrating neural electrodes, aimed at achieving large-scale neural recordings and long-term stability. These electrodes are designed to penetrate the neural tissue, enabling direct access to individual neurons or neural ensembles, thus providing high-resolution insights into neural activity. The pursuit of large-scale recordings is driven by the need to understand complex neural circuits and their dynamics, which is crucial for advancing neuroscience research and developing effective neural prosthetics. Concurrently, the challenge of ensuring chronic stability of these electrodes is paramount, as it directly impacts the quality and duration of neural recordings. This abstract explores the latest innovations in penetrating electrode technology, focusing on materials, design strategies, and integration techniques that enhance their scalability and longevity. The implications of these advancements for both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications are discussed, highlighting the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain and improve therapeutic outcomes.", "label": 1}
