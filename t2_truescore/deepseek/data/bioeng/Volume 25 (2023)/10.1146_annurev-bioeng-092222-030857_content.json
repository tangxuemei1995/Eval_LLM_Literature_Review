{"grounding": "Although sex differences have been noted in cellular function and behavior, therapy efficacy, and disease incidence and outcomes, the adoption of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine remains limited. Furthering the development of personalized, precision medicine requires considering biological sex at the bench and in the clinic. This review provides the basis for considering biological sex when designing tissue-engineered constructs and regenerative therapies by contextualizing sex as a biological variable within the tissue engineering triad of cells, matrices, and signals. To achieve equity in biological sex within medicine requires a cultural shift in science and engineering research, with active engagement by researchers, clinicians, companies, policymakers, and funding agencies.", "generated_text": "The integration of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is pivotal for advancing precision medicine. Sexual dimorphism influences cellular behavior, tissue regeneration, and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, underscoring the necessity to consider sex differences in research and clinical applications. This review highlights the impact of sex characteristics on stem cell biology, the development of sex-specific tissue models, and the implications for personalized treatment strategies. By elucidating the molecular and physiological distinctions between sexes, we aim to foster the creation of more accurate and effective regenerative therapies. Emphasizing SABV in experimental design and clinical trials will enhance our understanding of sex-specific responses, ultimately improving outcomes in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.", "label": 1}
