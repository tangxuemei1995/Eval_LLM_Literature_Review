{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are currently widely employed in medicine and healthcare. A PubMed search returns more than 100,000 articles on these topics published between 2018 and 2022 alone. Notwithstanding several recent reviews in various subfields of AI and ML in medicine, we have yet to see a comprehensive review around the methodsâ€™ use in longitudinal analysis and prediction of an individual patient's health status within a personalized disease pathway. This review seeks to fill that gap. After an overview of the AI and ML methods employed in this field and of specific medical applications of models of this type, the review discusses the strengths and limitations of current studies and looks ahead to future strands of research in this field. We aim to enable interested readers to gain a detailed impression of the research currently available and accordingly plan future work around predictive models for deterioration in health status.", "generated_text": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has revolutionized the field of personalized medicine, offering unprecedented opportunities to predict health deterioration and understand complex disease pathways. This study focuses on the development of predictive models that leverage time series data from digital health pathways to forecast disease trajectories with high accuracy. By integrating advanced ML algorithms with comprehensive datasets, we aim to identify key biomarkers and risk factors that contribute to disease progression. Our approach not only enhances the precision of early diagnosis but also facilitates the customization of treatment plans tailored to individual patient profiles. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven models in transforming healthcare delivery, enabling proactive interventions, and improving patient outcomes. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on personalized medicine, highlighting the critical role of predictive analytics in navigating the complexities of disease pathways.", "label": 0}
