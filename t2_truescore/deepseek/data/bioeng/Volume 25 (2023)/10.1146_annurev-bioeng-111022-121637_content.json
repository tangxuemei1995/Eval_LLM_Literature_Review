{"grounding": "Neurotechnologies for treating pain rely on electrical stimulation of the central or peripheral nervous system to disrupt or block pain signaling and have been commercialized to treat a variety of pain conditions. While their adoption is accelerating, neurotechnologies are still frequently viewed as a last resort, after many other treatment options have been explored. We review the pain conditions commonly treated with electrical stimulation, as well as the specific neurotechnologies used for treating those conditions. We identify barriers to adoption, including a limited understanding of mechanisms of action, inconsistent efficacy across patients, and challenges related to selectivity of stimulation and off-target side effects. We describe design improvements that have recently been implemented, as well as some cutting-edge technologies that may address the limitations of existing neurotechnologies. Addressing these challenges will accelerate adoption and change neurotechnologies from last-line to first-line treatments for people living with chronic pain.", "generated_text": "Chronic pain, a pervasive and debilitating condition, significantly impacts the quality of life for millions worldwide. This paper explores the forefront of neurotechnology applications in pain management, focusing on innovative techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). These methods offer promising avenues for alleviating chronic pain by targeting the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system pathways. DBS and SCS, through precise electrical stimulation, modulate neural activity to disrupt pain signals, while TENS provides a non-invasive approach to pain relief by stimulating nerve fibers through the skin. The review highlights recent advancements, clinical outcomes, and the potential of these technologies to revolutionize pain management strategies. By integrating findings from recent studies, this paper underscores the importance of neurotechnology in developing effective, personalized treatment plans for chronic pain sufferers, paving the way for future research and therapeutic innovations.", "label": 1}
