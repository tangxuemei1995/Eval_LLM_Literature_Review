{"grounding": "Photoacoustic techniques have shown promise in identifying molecular changes in bone tissue and visualizing tissue microstructure. This capability represents significant advantages over gold standards (i.e., dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) for bone evaluation without requiring ionizing radiation. Instead, photoacoustic imaging uses light to penetrate through bone, followed by acoustic pressure generation, resulting in highly sensitive optical absorption contrast in deep biological tissues. This review covers multiple bone-related photoacoustic imaging contributions to clinical applications, spanning bone cancer, joint pathologies, spinal disorders, osteoporosis, bone-related surgical guidance, consolidation monitoring, and transsphenoidal and transcranial imaging. We also present a summary of photoacoustic-based techniques for characterizing biomechanical properties of bone, including temperature, guided waves, spectral parameters, and spectroscopy. We conclude with a future outlook based on the current state of technological developments, recent achievements, and possible new directions.", "generated_text": "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has emerged as a powerful tool in medical diagnostics, offering unique capabilities for the characterization of bone tissue. This technique combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the deep penetration of ultrasound, enabling detailed visualization of bone structure and composition. The application of PAI in bone analysis leverages its ability to provide quantitative information on bone density, microarchitecture, and mineral content, which are critical for the assessment of bone health and the diagnosis of related pathologies. Spectral unmixing techniques further enhance the utility of PAI by allowing the differentiation of various bone components based on their optical absorption spectra. This overview explores the principles of PAI, its applications in bone imaging, and the integration with quantitative ultrasound for comprehensive bone characterization. The outlook for PAI in bone medicine is promising, with ongoing advancements aimed at improving resolution, depth penetration, and quantitative accuracy, paving the way for its broader clinical adoption.", "label": 1}
