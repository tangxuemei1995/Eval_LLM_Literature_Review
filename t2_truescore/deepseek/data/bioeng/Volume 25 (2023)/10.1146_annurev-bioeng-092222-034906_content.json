{"grounding": "Accompanying the increasing translational impact of immunotherapeutic strategies to treat and prevent disease has been a broadening interest across both bioscience and bioengineering in the lymphatic system. Herein, the lymphatic system physiology, ranging from its tissue structures to immune functions and effects, is described. Design principles and engineering approaches to analyze and manipulate this tissue system in nanoparticle-based drug delivery applications are also elaborated.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of nanotechnologies with physiology-informed strategies to enhance drug delivery to the lymphatic system. Focusing on lymph nodes, we investigate bioengineered and immunoengineered biomaterials for targeted delivery. Our approach aims to optimize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure, leveraging the unique physiological characteristics of the lymphatic system. This research underscores the potential of nanotechnology in advancing precision medicine for lymphatic-targeted therapies.", "label": 1}
