{"grounding": "Lipids are essential cellular components forming membranes, serving as energy reserves, and acting as chemical messengers. Dysfunction in lipid metabolism and signaling is associated with a wide range of diseases including cancer and autoimmunity. Heterogeneity in cell behavior including lipid signaling is increasingly recognized as a driver of disease and drug resistance. This diversity in cellular responses as well as the roles of lipids in health and disease drive the need to quantify lipids within single cells. Single-cell lipid assays are challenging due to the small size of cells (âˆ¼1 pL) and the large numbers of lipid species present at concentrations spanning orders of magnitude. A growing number of methodologies enable assay of large numbers of lipid analytes, perform high-resolution spatial measurements, or permit highly sensitive lipid assays in single cells. Covered in this review are mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, and fluorescence-based assays including microscopy and microseparations.", "generated_text": "The study of lipids at the single-cell level presents unique challenges and opportunities for understanding cellular function and disease mechanisms. This review focuses on the latest analytical techniques employed for single-cell biochemical assays of lipids, including mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, capillary electrophoresis, and thin layer chromatography. Mass spectrometry offers high sensitivity and specificity for lipid identification and quantification, while Raman imaging provides label-free, spatially resolved chemical information. Capillary electrophoresis enables the separation of complex lipid mixtures with minimal sample volumes, and thin layer chromatography serves as a cost-effective method for lipid separation and preliminary analysis. Each technique's advantages, limitations, and applications in single-cell lipidomics are discussed, highlighting their potential to uncover novel insights into lipid metabolism, signaling, and interactions at the cellular level. This comprehensive overview aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methodologies for their specific single-cell lipid analysis needs.", "label": 1}
