{"grounding": "Brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to treat sensorimotor neurological disorders by creating artificial motor and/or sensory pathways. Introducing artificial pathways creates new relationships between sensory input and motor output, which the brain must learn to gain dexterous control. This review highlights the role of learning in BMIs to restore movement and sensation, and discusses how BMI design may influence neural plasticity and performance. The close integration of plasticity in sensory and motor function influences the design of both artificial pathways and will be an essential consideration for bidirectional devices that restore both sensory and motor function.", "generated_text": "This study explores the role of neural plasticity in the development and optimization of sensorimotor brain–machine interfaces (BMIs). By integrating sensory and motor functions, BMIs offer a unique platform to investigate how neural circuits adapt and reorganize through learning. We review recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms of plasticity that facilitate the seamless integration of artificial devices with the nervous system. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive neural circuits in enhancing BMI performance and suggest future directions for leveraging plasticity to improve the efficacy and user experience of these interfaces.", "label": 1}
