{"grounding": "The need for hydration monitoring is significant, especially for the very young and elderly populations who are more vulnerable to becoming dehydrated and suffering from the effects that dehydration brings. This need has been among the drivers of considerable effort in the academic and commercial sectors to provide a means for monitoring hydration status, with a special interest in doing so outside the hospital or clinical setting. This review of emerging technologies provides an overview of many technology approaches that, on a theoretical basis, have sensitivity to water and are feasible as a routine measurement. We review the evidence of technical validation and of their use in humans. Finally, we highlight the essential need for these technologies to be rigorously evaluated for their diagnostic potential, as a necessary step to meet the need for hydration monitoring outside of the clinical environment.", "generated_text": "Dehydration poses significant health risks, necessitating accurate and timely detection to prevent adverse outcomes. This review explores the current state of noninvasive monitoring technologies aimed at detecting dehydration, with a focus on wearable devices and medical devices designed for hydration monitoring. Despite advancements in sensor technology and data analytics, challenges remain in achieving reliable, real-time hydration status assessment outside clinical settings. We evaluate the efficacy of existing solutions, including wearable sensors that measure physiological parameters such as skin conductivity, bioimpedance, and optical properties, to infer hydration levels. The discussion extends to the integration of these technologies with mobile health platforms for continuous monitoring and early warning systems. While promising, the field requires further research to enhance accuracy, user compliance, and accessibility, ensuring these innovations can effectively contribute to public health by preventing dehydration-related complications.", "label": 1}
