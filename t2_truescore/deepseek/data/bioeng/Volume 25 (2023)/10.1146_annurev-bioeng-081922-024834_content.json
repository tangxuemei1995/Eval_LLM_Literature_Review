{"grounding": "A shift in the traditional technocentric view of medical device design to a human-centered one is needed to bridge existing translational gaps and improve health equity. To ensure the successful and equitable adoption of health technology innovations, engineers must think beyond the device and the direct end user and must seek a more holistic understanding of broader stakeholder needs and the intended context of use early in a design process. The objectives of this review article are (a) to provide rationale for the need to incorporate meaningful stakeholder analysis and contextual investigation in health technology development and biomedical engineering pedagogy, (b) to review existing frameworks and human- and equity-centered approaches to stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation for improved adoption of innovative technologies, and (c) to present case studyexamples of medical device design that apply these approaches to bridge the gaps between biomedical engineers and the contexts for which they are designing.", "generated_text": "The integration of health technologies into daily life has the potential to significantly improve healthcare outcomes. However, the design of these technologies often overlooks the nuanced needs of diverse populations, leading to disparities in access and effectiveness. This paper provides an overview of human- and equity-centered approaches for health technology design, emphasizing the importance of contextual investigation and community engagement. By prioritizing the perspectives and experiences of end-users, including marginalized communities, designers can create more inclusive and effective health solutions. The discussion highlights the role of stakeholder engagement in identifying and addressing barriers to technology adoption, ensuring that health technologies are not only accessible but also equitable. Through a review of current methodologies and case studies, this paper advocates for a paradigm shift in health technology designâ€”one that moves beyond the device to consider the broader social, cultural, and economic contexts in which technologies are used.", "label": 1}
