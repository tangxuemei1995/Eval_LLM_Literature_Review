{"grounding": "Over the last half century, the autofluorescence of the metabolic cofactors NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) has been quantified in a variety of cell types and disease states. With the spread of nonlinear optical microscopy techniques in biomedical research, NADH and FAD imaging has offered an attractive solution to noninvasively monitor cell and tissue status and elucidate dynamic changes in cell or tissue metabolism. Various tools and methods to measure the temporal, spectral, and spatial properties of NADH and FAD autofluorescence have been developed. Specifically, an optical redox ratio of cofactor fluorescence intensities and NADH fluorescence lifetime parameters have been used in numerous applications, but significant work remains to mature this technology for understanding dynamic changes in metabolism. This article describes the current understanding of our optical sensitivity to different metabolic pathways and highlights current challenges in the field. Recent progress in addressing these challenges and acquiring more quantitative information in faster and more metabolically relevant formats is also discussed.", "generated_text": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging represents a transformative approach for studying cellular and tissue metabolism in situ, leveraging endogenous fluorophores such as NADH and FAD. This technique capitalizes on the autofluorescence properties of these coenzymes, which are pivotal in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, to provide insights into the redox state and metabolic activity of cells without the need for exogenous labels. By employing advanced imaging modalities, including multiphoton microscopy and two-photon excited fluorescence, researchers can achieve high-resolution, three-dimensional visualization of metabolic processes in living tissues. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) offers a powerful tool for distinguishing between free and protein-bound NADH, enabling a deeper understanding of metabolic shifts in response to physiological and pathological stimuli. This review highlights the principles, applications, and recent advancements in label-free optical metabolic imaging, underscoring its potential to revolutionize our understanding of metabolism in health and disease.", "label": 0}
