{"grounding": "One of the greatest concerns in the subzero storage of cells, tissues, and organs is the ability to control the nucleation or recrystallization of ice. In nature, evidence of these processes, which aid in sustaining internal temperatures below the physiologic freezing point for extended periods of time, is apparent in freeze-avoidant and freeze-tolerant organisms. After decades of studying these proteins, we now have easily accessible compounds and materials capable of recapitulating the mechanisms seen in nature for biopreser-vation applications. The output from this burgeoning area of research can interact synergistically with other novel developments in the field of cryobiology, making it an opportune time for a review on this topic.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development and application of engineered compounds designed to control ice nucleation and recrystallization, with a focus on antifreeze (glyco)proteins (AF(G)Ps). These proteins exhibit unique properties such as thermal hysteresis, which allows them to inhibit ice growth at sub-zero temperatures. By leveraging the molecular mechanisms of AF(G)Ps, we engineered synthetic analogs that mimic their ice-binding activities. Our findings demonstrate that these compounds effectively modulate ice crystal formation and growth, offering potential applications in cryopreservation, food storage, and climate research. The research highlights the importance of understanding the structural and functional aspects of AF(G)Ps in designing novel materials for ice control, paving the way for advancements in various scientific and industrial fields.", "label": 0}
