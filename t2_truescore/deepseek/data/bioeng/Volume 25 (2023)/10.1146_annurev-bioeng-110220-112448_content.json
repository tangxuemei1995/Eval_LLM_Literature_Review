{"grounding": "Energy-efficient sensing with physically secure communication for biosensors on, around, and within the human body is a major area of research for the development of low-cost health care devices, enabling continuous monitoring and/or secure perpetual operation. When used as a network of nodes, these devices form the Internet of Bodies, which poses challenges including stringent resource constraints, simultaneous sensing and communication, and security vulnerabilities. Another major challenge is to find an efficient on-body energy-harvesting method to support the sensing, communication, and security submodules. Due to limitations in the amount of energy harvested, we require a reduction in energy consumed per unit information, making the use of in-sensor analytics and processing imperative. In this article, we review the challenges and opportunities of low-power sensing, processing, and communication with possible powering modalities for future biosensor nodes. Specifically, we analyze, compare, and contrast (a) different sensing mechanisms such as voltage/current domain versus time domain, (b) low-power, secure communication modalities including wireless techniques and human body communication, and (c) different powering techniques for wearable devices and implants.", "generated_text": "The integration of biosensors into the Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative approach to personalized healthcare, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological data. This paper explores the development of bioelectronic sensor nodes that are pivotal for the IoB, a subset of the Internet of Things (IoT) focused on human body-centric applications. These sensor nodes are designed to perform in-sensor analytics, reducing the need for data transmission and thereby conserving energy. They incorporate advanced sensing technologies, computational capabilities, and secure communication protocols to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive health data. Furthermore, innovative powering strategies are discussed to address the challenge of energy autonomy in wearable and implantable devices. The convergence of these technologies within bioelectronic sensor nodes offers a promising pathway towards enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and security of IoB systems, paving the way for their widespread adoption in healthcare and beyond.", "label": 0}
