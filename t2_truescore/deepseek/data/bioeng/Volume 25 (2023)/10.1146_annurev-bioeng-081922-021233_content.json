{"grounding": "The central dogma of gene expression involves DNA transcription to RNA and RNA translation into protein. As key intermediaries and modifiers, RNAs undergo various forms of modifications such as methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation. These modifications, termed epitranscriptional regulations, lead to functional changes in RNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated crucial roles for RNA modifications in gene translation, DNA damage response, and cell fate regulation. Epitranscriptional modifications play an essential role in development, mechanosensing, atherogenesis, and regeneration in the cardiovascular (CV) system, and their elucidation is critically important to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CV physiology and pathophysiology. This review aims at providing biomedical engineers with an overview of the epitranscriptome landscape, related key concepts, recent findings in epitranscriptional regulations, and tools for epitranscriptome analysis. The potential applications of this important field in biomedical engineering research are discussed.", "generated_text": "The epitranscriptome, encompassing all RNA modifications, plays a pivotal role in gene regulation and has emerged as a critical area of study in cardiovascular bioengineering. This review delves into the mechanisms of epitranscriptional regulation and its implications for cardiovascular health and disease. By examining the dynamic landscape of RNA modifications, including methylation and acetylation, we explore how these alterations influence RNA stability, translation, and function within the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of targeting the epitranscriptome for therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and hypertension. Advances in bioengineering technologies, including CRISPR-based tools and high-throughput sequencing, are enabling unprecedented insights into the epitranscriptome's role in cardiovascular biology. This synthesis of current knowledge underscores the importance of epitranscriptional regulation in cardiovascular bioengineering and its promise for innovative therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
