{"grounding": "From the first clinical trial by Dr. W.F. Anderson to the most recent US Food and Drug Administration–approved Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics, 2017) and Zolgensma (Novartis, 2019), gene therapy has revamped thinking and practice around cancer treatment and improved survival rates for adult and pediatric patients with genetic diseases. A major challenge to advancing gene therapies for a broader array of applications lies in safely delivering nucleic acids to their intended sites of action. Peptides offer unique potential to improve nucleic acid delivery based on their versatile and tunable interactions with biomolecules and cells. Cell-penetrating peptides and intracellular targeting peptides have received particular focus due to their promise for improving the delivery of gene therapies into cells. We highlight key examples of peptide-assisted, targeted gene delivery to cancer-specific signatures involved in tumor growth and subcellular organelle–targeting peptides, as well as emerging strategies to enhance peptide stability and bioavailability that will support long-term implementation.", "generated_text": "The development of peptide-based vectors represents a cutting-edge biomolecular engineering strategy for gene delivery, addressing the critical need for efficient, targeted, and safe therapeutic delivery systems. This approach leverages intracellular targeting peptides to facilitate the delivery of nucleic acids, including silencing RNA (siRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and oligonucleotides, into specific cellular compartments. The unique properties of these peptides, such as their ability to mediate endosomal escape, enhance the intracellular bioavailability of therapeutic nucleic acids, thereby overcoming one of the major barriers in gene therapy. Recent advancements in peptide engineering have led to the design of vectors with improved specificity, reduced immunogenicity, and enhanced stability, paving the way for their application in clinical trials. This review highlights the potential of peptide-based vectors in revolutionizing gene delivery, offering insights into their mechanism of action, current challenges, and future directions in the field of biomolecular engineering.", "label": 1}
