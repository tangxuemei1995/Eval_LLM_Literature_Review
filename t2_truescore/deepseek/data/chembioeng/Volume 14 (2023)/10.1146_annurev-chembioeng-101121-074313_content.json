{"grounding": "In the past two decades, we have witnessed a rapid emergence of new and powerful photochemical and photocatalytic synthetic methods. Although these methods have been used mostly on a small scale, there is a growing need for efficient scale-up of photochemistry in the chemical industry. This review summarizes and contextualizes the advancements made in the past decade regarding the scale-up of photo-mediated synthetic transformations. Simple scale-up concepts and important fundamental photochemical laws have been provided along with a discussion concerning suitable reactor designs that should facilitate scale-up of this challenging class of organic reactions.", "generated_text": "The transition of photochemical reactions from laboratory scale to industrial production presents unique challenges and opportunities. This study explores the critical aspects of scaling up photochemical processes, focusing on strategies such as numbering up and sizing up, alongside the integration of flow chemistry. By examining the interplay between photocatalysis efficiency, reactor design, and process optimization, we aim to identify key factors that facilitate the successful scale-up of photochemical reactions. Our findings highlight the importance of innovative reactor technologies and process intensification techniques in achieving scalable, efficient, and sustainable photochemical production methods for industrial applications.", "label": 1}
