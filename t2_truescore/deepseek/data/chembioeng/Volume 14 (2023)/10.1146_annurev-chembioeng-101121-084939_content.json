{"grounding": "Active colloids use energy input at the particle level to propel persistent motion and direct dynamic assemblies. We consider three types of colloids animated by chemical reactions, time-varying magnetic fields, and electric currents. For each type, we review the basic propulsion mechanisms at the particle level and discuss their consequences for collective behaviors in particle ensembles. These microscopic systems provide useful experimental models of nonequilibrium many-body physics in which dissipative currents break time-reversal symmetry. Freed from the constraints of thermodynamic equilibrium, active colloids assemble to form materials that move, reconfigure, heal, and adapt. Colloidal machines based on engineered particles and their assemblies provide a basis for mobile robots with increasing levels of autonomy. This review provides a conceptual framework for understanding and applying active colloids to create material systems that mimic the functions of living matter. We highlight opportunities for chemical engineers to contribute to this growing field.", "generated_text": "Active colloids represent a burgeoning field of study that bridges the gap between nonequilibrium physics, materials science, and engineering. These self-propelled particles, driven by external energy sources, exhibit unique collective behaviors and dynamic patterns that are not observed in their passive counterparts. This research explores the fundamental principles governing the behavior of active colloids, emphasizing their role as models for understanding complex nonequilibrium systems. Furthermore, it investigates the potential of active colloids in the design of novel materials with tunable properties and functionalities. By harnessing the intrinsic dynamics of these particles, we aim to develop advanced colloidal assemblies that can perform specific tasks, paving the way for the creation of autonomous machines at the microscale. This study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of active matter but also offers practical insights into the development of innovative technologies based on active colloidal systems.", "label": 1}
