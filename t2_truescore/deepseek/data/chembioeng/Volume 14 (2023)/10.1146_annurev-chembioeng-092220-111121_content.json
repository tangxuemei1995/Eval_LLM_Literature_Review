{"grounding": "The storage of electric energy in a safe and environmentally friendly way is of ever-growing importance for a modern, technology-based society. With future pressures predicted for batteries that contain strategic metals, there is increasing interest in metal-free electrode materials. Among candidate materials, nonconjugated redox-active polymers (NC-RAPs) have advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, good processability, unique electrochemical properties, and precise tuning for different battery chemistries. Here, we review the current state of the art regarding the mechanisms of redox kinetics, molecular design, synthesis, and application of NC-RAPs in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Different redox chemistries are compared, including polyquinones, polyimides, polyketones, sulfur-containing polymers, radical-containing polymers, polyphenylamines, polyphenazines, polyphenothiazines, polyphenoxazines, and polyviologens. We close with cell design principles considering electrolyte optimization and cell configuration. Finally, we point to fundamental and applied areas of future promise for designer NC-RAPs.", "generated_text": "Nonconjugated redox-active polymers (NRAPs) have emerged as a promising class of materials for energy storage applications, owing to their unique electron transfer mechanisms, chemical versatility, and potential for high energy density. Unlike their conjugated counterparts, NRAPs rely on redox-active moieties embedded within a nonconductive polymer backbone, facilitating electron transfer through hopping mechanisms rather than extended Ï€-conjugation. This review delves into the fundamental aspects of electron transfer kinetics in NRAPs, exploring how structural modifications can enhance conductivity and overall electrochemical performance. Additionally, the chemical versatility of NRAPs allows for tailored synthesis to meet specific energy storage requirements, making them adaptable for various battery technologies. By examining recent advancements and challenges, this study highlights the potential of NRAPs in revolutionizing energy storage systems, offering insights into future research directions for optimizing their performance in practical applications.", "label": 1}
