{"grounding": "Are deep eutectic solvents (DESs) a promising alternative to conventional solvents? Perhaps, but their development is hindered by a plethora of misconceptions. These are carefully analyzed here, beginning with the very meaning of DESs, which has strayed far beyond its original scope of eutectic mixtures of Lewis or Brønsted acids and bases. Instead, a definition that is grounded on thermodynamic principles and distinguishes between eutectic and deep eutectic is encouraged, and the types of precursors that can be used to prepare DESs are reviewed. Landmark works surrounding the sustainability, stability, toxicity, and biodegradability of these solvents are also discussed, revealing piling evidence that numerous DESs reported thus far, particularly those that are choline based, lack sufficient sustainability-related traits to be considered green solvents. Finally, emerging DES applications are reviewed, emphasizing their most remarkable feature: the ability to liquefy a solid compound with a target property, allowing its use as a liquid solvent.", "generated_text": "Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) have emerged as a pivotal innovation in green chemistry, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional solvents. This study delves into the fundamental principles underlying DESs, focusing on their unique solid–liquid equilibrium properties and the role of hydrogen bonding in their formation. By examining the mechanisms of melting temperature depression, we elucidate how DESs achieve their liquid state at significantly lower temperatures than their individual components, a phenomenon central to their utility in various applications. Furthermore, this research explores the composition and behavior of eutectic mixtures, providing insights into their design and optimization for specific chemical processes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we aim to demystify DESs, highlighting their potential to revolutionize industries by offering environmentally benign solutions without compromising on efficiency or performance.", "label": 0}
