{"grounding": "Oxidative stress is an important and pervasive physical stress encountered by all kingdoms of life, including bacteria. In this review, we briefly describe the nature of oxidative stress, highlight well-characterized protein-based sensors (transcription factors) of reactive oxygen species that serve as standards for molecular sensors in oxidative stress, and describe molecular studies that have explored the potential of direct RNA sensitivity to oxidative stress. Finally, we describe the gaps in knowledge of RNA sensorsâ€”particularly regarding the chemical modification of RNA nucleobases. RNA sensors are poised to emerge as an essential layer of understanding and regulating dynamic biological pathways in oxidative stress responses in bacteria and, thus, also represent an important frontier of synthetic biology.", "generated_text": "Oxidative stress, induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), poses a significant threat to bacterial survival, necessitating robust stress response mechanisms. Recent advancements have highlighted the role of RNAs as pivotal sensors of oxidative stress in bacteria, offering a novel perspective on bacterial stress response strategies. This review delves into the mechanisms by which RNA molecules detect and respond to oxidative stress, including the direct oxidation of RNA and the subsequent activation of stress response pathways. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these findings for synthetic biology, where engineered RNA sensors could enhance bacterial resilience to oxidative stress. Understanding the interplay between RNA sensors and oxidative stress not only sheds light on bacterial survival mechanisms but also opens new avenues for biotechnological applications.", "label": 1}
