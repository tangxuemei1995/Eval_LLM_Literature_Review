{"grounding": "There is growing interest in identifying antibodies that protect against infectious diseases, especially for high-risk individuals and pathogens for which no vaccine is yet available. However, pathogens that manifest as opportunistic or latent infections express complex arrays of virulence-associated proteins and are adept at avoiding immune responses. Some pathogens have developed strategies to selectively destroy antibodies, whereas others create decoy epitopes that trick the host immune system into generating antibodies that are at best nonprotective and at worst enhance pathogenesis. Antibody engineering strategies can thwart these efforts by accessing conserved neutralizing epitopes, generating Fc domains that resist capture or degradation and even accessing pathogens hidden inside cells. Design of pathogen-resistant antibodies can enhance protection and guide development of vaccine immunogens against these complex pathogens. Here, we discuss general strategies for design of antibodies resistant to specific pathogen defense mechanisms.", "generated_text": "In the relentless battle against infectious diseases, antibody engineering emerges as a pivotal strategy to outmaneuver pathogens. This review delves into the cutting-edge advancements in passive immunization, highlighting the role of engineered antibodies in circumventing immune evasion tactics employed by pathogens. We explore the innovative approaches of Fc engineering and the development of bispecific antibodies, which enhance the efficacy of immune responses. Furthermore, the integration of antibodyâ€“drug conjugates represents a promising frontier in targeted therapy, offering a dual mechanism of action against resistant strains. By leveraging these sophisticated technologies, the scientific community is poised to revolutionize the landscape of vaccines and therapeutic interventions, paving the way for more effective and precise combat against infectious diseases.", "label": 1}
