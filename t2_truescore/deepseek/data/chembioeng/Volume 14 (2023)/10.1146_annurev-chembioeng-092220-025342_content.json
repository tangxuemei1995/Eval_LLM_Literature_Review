{"grounding": "Thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures are important in many fields of science and engineering. However, experimental data are scarce in this field, so prediction methods are vital. Different types of physical prediction methods are available, ranging from molecular models over equations of state to models of excess properties. These well-established methods are currently being complemented by new methods from the field of machine learning (ML). This review focuses on the rapidly developing interface between these two approaches and gives a structured overview of how physical modeling and ML can be combined to yield hybrid models. We illustrate the different options with examples from recent research and give an outlook on future developments.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques with established physical knowledge to enhance the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures. By leveraging the predictive power of ML and the interpretability of physical models, we propose a hybrid modeling approach that significantly improves accuracy and efficiency in predicting thermodynamic properties. The methodology involves training ML algorithms on extensive datasets derived from experimental measurements and simulations, while incorporating physical constraints to ensure consistency with thermodynamic principles. Our findings demonstrate that this hybrid model outperforms traditional methods in capturing complex interactions within fluid mixtures, offering a promising direction for future research in thermodynamic modeling and its applications in chemical engineering and material science.", "label": 0}
