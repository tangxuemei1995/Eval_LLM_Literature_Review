{"grounding": "Electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable chemicals and fuels driven by renewable energy plays a crucial role in achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Understanding the structureâ€“activity relationship and the reaction mechanism is significant for tuning electrocatalyst selectivity. Therefore, characterizing catalyst dynamic evolution and reaction intermediates under reaction conditions is necessary but still challenging. We first summarize the most recent progress in mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous CO2/CO reduction using in situ/operando techniques, including surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies, X-ray- and electron-based techniques, and mass spectroscopy, along with discussing remaining limitations. We then offer insights and perspectives to accelerate the future development of in situ/operando techniques.", "generated_text": "The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) presents a promising pathway for sustainable fuel production and carbon cycle closure. This study delves into the in situ/operando characterization techniques pivotal for unraveling the complex mechanisms underlying CO2 electroreduction. By employing advanced spectroscopic and microscopic methods, we aim to provide mechanistic insights into the roles of catalysts and electrolytes, and the nature of reaction intermediates. These techniques enable real-time observation of the electrochemical processes, offering a deeper understanding of the factors influencing efficiency and selectivity. Our findings underscore the importance of in situ/operando approaches in optimizing CO2 reduction technologies for enhanced performance and sustainability.", "label": 1}
