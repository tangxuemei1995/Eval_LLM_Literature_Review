{"grounding": "Climate change poses an existential threat. Theoretical and empirical research suggest that carbon pricing and green R&D support are the right tools, but their implementation can be improved. Other policies, such as standards, bans, and targeted subsidies, also all have a role to play, but they have often been incoherent, and their implementation is delicate.", "generated_text": "This study explores the portfolio of economic policies essential for combating climate change, focusing on carbon pricing, green R&D investments, carbon border adjustments, and climate finance mechanisms. By analyzing the interplay between these strategies, the research aims to identify the most effective policy mix for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering sustainable economic growth in the face of global climate challenges.", "label": 0}
