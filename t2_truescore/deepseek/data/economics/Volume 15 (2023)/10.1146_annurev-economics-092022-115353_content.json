{"grounding": "Gender differences in negotiation are seen as contributing to the persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes. We review the literature on interventions aiming to mute differences in negotiation and assess their effectiveness in reducing the gender pay gap. We present research on initiatives that aspire to increase how often and how women negotiate, as well as institutional changes that ban negotiations, ban requests for employee salary history, and improve wage transparency. Along with reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of these initiatives, we point to unintended consequences that warrant caution at implementation. The review makes clear that initial efforts to push women to negotiate more like men have shifted to alter instead the conditions of the negotiation. This shift results not only from wanting to consider policies that “fix the institutions” rather than “fixing the women,” but also from evidence that these interventions are more successful in securing pay equity.", "generated_text": "This study investigates gender differences in negotiation outcomes and the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing these disparities. Despite advancements in gender equality, women often negotiate less favorable terms than men, particularly in salary discussions. This research explores the impact of various strategies, including negotiation training, the implementation of 'ban the salary history' (BAN) policies, and increased transparency in compensation practices. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, we assess how these interventions influence negotiation behaviors and outcomes for men and women. Our findings suggest that targeted negotiation training and policies like BAN can empower women to negotiate more assertively, thereby narrowing the gender gap. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varies across contexts, highlighting the need for tailored approaches. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on gender equality in the workplace by providing actionable insights for organizations seeking to foster more equitable negotiation environments.", "label": 1}
