{"grounding": "We review theoretical and empirical work on the economic effects of the United States and China trade relations during the past 20 years. We first discuss the origins of the China shock and its measurement and present methods used to study its economic effects on different outcomes. We then focus on the recent US–China trade war. We review methods used to evaluate its effects, describe its economic effects, and analyze whether this increase in trade protectionism reverted the effects of the China shock. The main lessons learned in this review are that (a) the aggregate gains from US–China trade created winners and losers; (b) China's trade expansion seems not to be the main cause of the decline in US manufacturing employment during the same period; and (c) the recent trade war generated welfare losses, had small employment effects, and was ineffective in reversing the distributional effects due to the China shock.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate dynamics of US-China trade relations, focusing on the implications of trade policy shifts and the so-called 'China shock' on US manufacturing employment. Utilizing a framework of dynamic spatial economics and input-output linkages, we analyze how trade wars and policy adjustments have influenced the spatial distribution of economic activities and employment patterns across the United States. Our findings suggest that the 'China shock' has had a profound impact on local labor markets, with significant variations across regions due to differences in industrial composition and trade exposure. The analysis underscores the importance of considering spatial and sectoral interdependencies in understanding the broader economic consequences of US-China trade tensions. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on trade policy by providing a nuanced perspective on the complex interplay between global trade dynamics and local economic outcomes.", "label": 0}
