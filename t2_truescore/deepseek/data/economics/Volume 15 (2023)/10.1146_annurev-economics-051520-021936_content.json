{"grounding": "We attempt to provide a systemic view of the process of regulating collusion, including detection and prosecution as well as bargaining between firms and regulators via consent orders, the production of evidence, and containment measures that may be taken if collusion cannot be addressed with more direct means. In addition, we try to do justice to the peculiarities of the legal system: Modeling the courts as they are, rather than as economists think they should be, is essential for economic analysis to improve the way collusion is regulated.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolving landscape of collusion regulation, focusing on the challenges posed by the Twombly standard in establishing the burden of proof. It explores the efficacy of safe tests and consent orders as regulatory tools, while also considering the potential role of artificial intelligence in detecting and preventing collusive practices. By analyzing recent legal precedents and technological advancements, the research aims to provide insights into more effective regulatory frameworks that balance the need for robust enforcement with the protection of competitive markets.", "label": 0}
