{"grounding": "In this article we survey recent advances in the economic theory of cultural transmission. We highlight three main themes on which the literature has made great progress in the last 10 years: the domain of traits subject to cultural transmission; the microfoundations for the technology of transmission; and feedback effects between culture, institutions, and various socioeconomic environments. We conclude by suggesting interesting areas for future research.", "generated_text": "This paper explores recent advancements in the economic theory of cultural transmission, focusing on its pivotal role in the evolution of institutions. By integrating interdisciplinary insights, we analyze how cultural norms and values are transmitted across generations and their impact on institutional development. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between cultural evolution and economic outcomes, offering a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms driving institutional change and stability in diverse societal contexts.", "label": 0}
