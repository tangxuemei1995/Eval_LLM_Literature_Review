{"grounding": "International trade contributes directly to global greenhouse gas emissions, as the carbon content of high-emission products is priced differently in different countries. This phenomenon is termed carbon leakage. Thus, not putting a price on carbon is theoretically equivalent to an export subsidy, although that would be difficult to challenge in the context of multilateral trade law. Leakage can be alleviated by pricing the carbon embedded in imported products through a border carbon adjustment (BCA), be it a tax, a carbon tariff, or a regulation requiring the purchase of emissions allowances. The design of a BCA is a compromise between environmental effectiveness in preventing leakage, economic effectiveness in preserving competitiveness and ensuring acceptability, technical feasibility of the implementation, and World Trade Organization compatibility. An import-limited BCA is more effective than free emissions allowances in reducing leakage, but it does not preserve the export competitiveness of the country imposing it.", "generated_text": "The concept of Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) has emerged as a pivotal policy tool in the global effort to mitigate climate change, addressing the critical issue of carbon leakage while promoting fair competition. This paper explores the economic rationale behind implementing BCAs, focusing on their potential to level the playing field for domestic industries subject to stringent carbon regulations. By imposing carbon tariffs on imports from countries with laxer environmental standards, BCAs aim to prevent the relocation of carbon-intensive industries and ensure that global climate efforts are not undermined. Furthermore, the study examines the impacts of BCAs on international trade, environmental outcomes, and the formation of climate clubs, which are coalitions of countries committed to ambitious climate action. Through a comprehensive analysis, this research highlights the complexities and challenges of designing effective BCAs, offering insights into their role in achieving global carbon neutrality.", "label": 0}
