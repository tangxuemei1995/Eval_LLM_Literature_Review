{"grounding": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator and its demand system are ubiquitous in business cycles theory, macroeconomic growth and development, international trade and other general equilibrium fields; this is because the CES aggregator has many knife-edge properties that help to keep the analysis tractable in the presence of many goods and factors. However, this also makes it hard to tell which properties of CES are responsible for certain results. Furthermore, it is necessary to relax some of those properties for certain applications. In this article, I review several classes of non-CES aggregators, each of which removes some properties of CES and keeps the rest to introduce some flexibility while retaining the tractability of CES as much as possible. These classes are named after the properties of CES they keep. I explain how these classes are related to each other and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses to indicate which classes are suited for which applications.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of non-CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) aggregators, delving into their theoretical underpinnings and practical implications within economic models. Unlike their CES counterparts, non-CES aggregators accommodate nonhomothetic preferences, allowing for a more nuanced representation of consumer behavior and production processes. We examine the role of constant returns to scale (CRS) production functions in facilitating the aggregation of diverse inputs, highlighting the significance of implicit additivity in ensuring consistent aggregation across different sectors. The analysis further distinguishes between gross substitutes and gross complements, elucidating their impact on market dynamics and resource allocation. Additionally, the paper investigates the categorization of goods into essentials and inessentials, shedding light on how non-CES aggregators can capture the varying degrees of necessity and luxury in consumption patterns. Through this guided tour, we aim to enhance the understanding of non-CES aggregators and their pivotal role in advancing economic theory and empirical research.", "label": 1}
