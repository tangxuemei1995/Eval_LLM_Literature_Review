{"grounding": "Over the last two decades, the unprecedented increase in non-bank financial intermediation, particularly the rise of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, accounts for nearly half of the external financing flows to emerging markets, exceeding cross-border lending by global banks. Evidence suggests that investment fund flows enhance risk sharing across borders and provide emerging markets access to more diverse forms of financing. However, a growing body of evidence also indicates that investment funds are inherently more vulnerable to liquidity and redemption risks during periods of global financial market stress, increasing the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. Benchmark-driven investments, namely passive funds, appear particularly sensitive to global risk shocks, such as tightening US dollar funding conditions, compared to their active fund counterparts. The procyclicality of investment fund flows to emerging markets during times of global stress poses financial stability concerns, with implications for the role of macroprudential policy.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intricate relationship between global risk shocks, non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI), and emerging market vulnerabilities, with a particular focus on the role of investment funds and international capital flows. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple emerging markets, we analyze how benchmark investing and tail risk considerations influence the transmission of global risk shocks through NBFI channels. Our findings reveal that NBFI significantly amplifies the impact of global risk shocks on emerging markets, primarily through heightened volatility in international capital flows. Moreover, the prevalence of benchmark investing exacerbates these vulnerabilities by encouraging herding behavior and reducing market liquidity during periods of stress. The study underscores the importance of monitoring NBFI activities and implementing robust regulatory frameworks to mitigate the adverse effects of global risk shocks on emerging market economies. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on financial stability and the systemic risks posed by the growing prominence of NBFI in the global financial system.", "label": 0}
