{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the methods used for algorithmic text analysis in economics, with a focus on three key contributions. First, we introduce methods for representing documents as high-dimensional count vectors over vocabulary terms, for representing words as vectors, and for representing word sequences as embedding vectors. Second, we define four core empirical tasks that encompass most text-as-data research in economics and enumerate the various approaches that have been taken so far to accomplish these tasks. Finally, we flag limitations in the current literature, with a focus on the challenge of validating algorithmic output.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the transformative role of text algorithms in economics, focusing on the utilization of text as data to uncover insights from unstructured information. We delve into the application of topic models, word embeddings, and large language models, including transformer models, to analyze economic texts. These methodologies enable the extraction of thematic structures, semantic relationships, and predictive patterns from vast corpora, offering novel perspectives on economic phenomena. By bridging computational linguistics and economic analysis, this research highlights the potential of advanced text algorithms to enhance our understanding of economic dynamics, policy impacts, and market behaviors in the digital age.", "label": 0}
