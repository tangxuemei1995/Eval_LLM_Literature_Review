{"grounding": "This article compares early childhood enrichment programs that promote social mobility for disadvantaged children within and across generations. Instead of conducting a standard meta-analysis, we present a harmonized primary data analysis of programs that shape current policy. Our analysis is a template for rigorous syntheses and comparisons across programs. We analyze new long-run life-cycle data collected for iconic programs when participants are middle-aged and their children are in their twenties. The iconic programs are omnibus in nature and offer many services to children and their parents. We compare them with relatively low-cost, more focused home-visiting programs. Participants in programs that enrich home environments grow up with better skills, jobs, earnings, marital stability, and health, as well as reduced participation in crime. The long-run monetized gains are substantially greater than the costs of the iconic programs. A study of focused home-visiting programs that target parents enables us to isolate a crucial component of successful programs: They activate and promote the parenting skills of child caregivers. The home-visiting programs we analyze produce outcomes comparable to those of the iconic omnibus programs. National implementation of the programs with long-run follow-up that we analyze would substantially shrink the overall Black-White earnings gap in the United States.", "generated_text": "This study explores the pivotal role of parenting in fostering social mobility both within and across generations, addressing the intricate dynamics between skill development, inequality, and human development. Drawing on a comprehensive review of interdisciplinary literature, we examine how parental investment in children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills serves as a critical mechanism for breaking the cycle of poverty and enhancing upward mobility. Our analysis highlights the significance of early childhood education, parental involvement, and the transmission of social capital as key factors that influence children's future socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we investigate the intergenerational effects of parenting practices, demonstrating how they can perpetuate or mitigate social inequalities over time. By synthesizing empirical evidence from economics, sociology, and psychology, this research underscores the importance of targeted interventions that support effective parenting strategies to promote equitable opportunities for all children. The findings advocate for policy measures that address systemic barriers to social mobility, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to human development that leverages the transformative power of parenting in creating a more just and inclusive society.", "label": 0}
