{"grounding": "In recent years, experiments have documented a new mechanism that leads to failures of profit maximization: the failure of contingent thinking (FCT). This article summarizes key experimental findings, clarifies what constitutes an FCT, and outlines how FCTs can be tested in other environments. Subsequently, we relate FCTs to recent theoretical work on cognitive limitations in behavioral economics. Finally, we connect FCTs to suboptimal behavior documented in applied environments.", "generated_text": "This study explores cognitive limitations through the lens of behavioral theory and cognitive economics, focusing on failures of contingent thinking. Utilizing controlled experiments, we investigate deviations from the sure-thing principle, a cornerstone of rational decision-making. Our findings reveal significant cognitive biases that impede contingent reasoning, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying decision-making processes. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of cognitive limitations and their implications for economic models and behavioral predictions.", "label": 1}
