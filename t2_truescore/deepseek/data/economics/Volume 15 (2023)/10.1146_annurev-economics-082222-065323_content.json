{"grounding": "This article surveys the development of nonparametric models and methods for estimation of choice models with nonlinear budget sets. The discussion focuses on the budget set regression, that is, the conditional expectation of a choice variable given the budget set. Utility maximization in a nonparametric model with general heterogeneity reduces the curse of dimensionality in this regression. Empirical results using this regression are different from maximum likelihood and give informative inference. The article also considers the information provided by kink probabilities for nonparametric utility with general heterogeneity. Instrumental variable estimation and the evidence it provides of heterogeneity in preferences are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the econometric challenges and methodologies associated with analyzing nonlinear budget sets, focusing on the application of the random utility model, budget set regression, bunching, and instrumental variables. Nonlinear budget sets, characterized by kinks and notches, present unique estimation challenges due to the discontinuities and non-convexities they introduce. We delve into how the random utility model can be adapted to account for these complexities, the role of budget set regression in estimating behavioral responses, the phenomenon of bunching at kink points, and the use of instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of consumer behavior in the presence of nonlinear budget constraints.", "label": 1}
