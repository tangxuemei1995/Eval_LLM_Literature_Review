{"grounding": "China's financial system has been integral to its spectacular economic growth over the past 40 years. We review the recent literature on China's financial system and its connections to the Chinese economy based on the categories of Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (AFRE), a broad measure of the nation's yearly flow of liquidity accounting for unique features of China's financial system. While early work on China's financial system emphasizes the state-owned enterprise reform, the recent literature explores other more market-based financing channels—including shadow banking—that grew rapidly after 2010 and have become important components of AFRE. These new financing channels not only are intertwined with each other, but also, and more importantly, are often ultimately tied back to the dominant banking sector in China. Understanding the mechanisms behind these channels and their intrinsic connections is crucial to alleviate capital allocation distortion and mitigate potential systemic financial risk in China.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of China's financial system and its pivotal role in the nation's economic development. Since the inception of economic reforms in the late 1970s, China's financial markets have undergone significant transformation, evolving from a state-dominated system to a more market-oriented framework. The study highlights the dual role of the government in both promoting and regulating financial markets, with a particular focus on the concept of implicit guarantees and their impact on market stability and risk. Furthermore, the paper explores the rapid rise of fintech in China, examining how technological innovations are reshaping financial services and contributing to financial inclusion. Through a detailed analysis of policy developments, market trends, and empirical data, this review sheds light on the challenges and opportunities facing China's financial system as it continues to support the country's economic growth and global integration.", "label": 1}
