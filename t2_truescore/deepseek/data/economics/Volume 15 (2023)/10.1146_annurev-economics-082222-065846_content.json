{"grounding": "The dynamic causal effect of an intervention on an outcome is of paramount interest to applied macro- and microeconomics research. However, this question has been generally approached differently by the two literatures. In making the transition from traditional time series methods to applied microeconometrics, local projections can serve as a natural bridge. Local projections can translate the familiar language of vector autoregressions and impulse responses into the language of potential outcomes and treatment effects. There are gains to be made by both literatures from greater integration of well-established methods in each. This review shows how to make these connections and points to potential areas of further research.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the application of local projections in the field of applied economics, offering a robust alternative to traditional vector autoregressions (VARs) for estimating impulse responses. By leveraging panel data, we demonstrate how local projections can provide more flexible and interpretable estimates of dynamic causal effects, particularly in settings where the assumptions of VARs may not hold. Our analysis highlights the method's alignment with the potential outcomes framework, facilitating a clearer understanding of causal relationships in economic data. Through a series of empirical examples, we illustrate the advantages of local projections in capturing the heterogeneity and nonlinearities often present in economic phenomena, thereby contributing to more accurate and policy-relevant economic analysis.", "label": 1}
