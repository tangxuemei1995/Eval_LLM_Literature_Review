{"grounding": "The complement system is an ancient collection of proteolytic cascades with well-described roles in regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. With the convergence of a revolution in complement-directed clinical therapeutics, the discovery of specific complement-associated targetable pathways in the central nervous system, and the development of integrated multi-omic technologies that have all emerged over the last 15 years, precision therapeutic targeting in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases and processes appears to be within reach. As a sensor of tissue distress, the complement system protects the brain from microbial challenge as well as the accumulation of dead and/or damaged molecules and cells. Additional more recently discovered diverse functions of complement make it of paramount importance to design complement-directed neurotherapeutics such that the beneficial roles in neurodevelopment, adult neural plasticity, and neuroprotective functions of the complement system are retained.", "generated_text": "The complement system, traditionally recognized for its role in immune defense, has emerged as a critical player in brain physiology and pathology. This review explores the multifaceted contributions of complement components, particularly C1q, to neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. We delve into the mechanisms by which complement influences synaptic pruning, a process essential for the refinement of neural circuits during development and in response to injury. The involvement of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, in complement-mediated synaptic remodeling is highlighted, alongside the implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. By synthesizing recent findings, this abstract underscores the dual role of the complement system in maintaining brain homeostasis and contributing to disease progression, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions.", "label": 1}
