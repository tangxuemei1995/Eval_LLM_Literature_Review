{"grounding": "As an important sensor in the innate immune system, NLRP3 detects exogenous pathogenic invasions and endogenous cellular damage and responds by forming the NLRP3 inflammasome, a supramolecular complex that activates caspase-1. The three major components of the NLRP3 inflammasome are NLRP3, which captures the danger signals and recruits downstream molecules; caspase-1, which elicits maturation of the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and processing of gasdermin D to mediate cytokine release and pyroptosis; and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), which functions as a bridge connecting NLRP3 and caspase-1. In this article, we review the structural information that has been obtained on the NLRP3 inflammasome and its components or subcomplexes, with special focus on the inactive NLRP3 cage, the active NLRP3-NEK7 (NIMA-related kinase 7)-ASC inflammasome disk, and the PYD-PYD and CARD-CARD homotypic filamentous scaffolds of the inflammasome. We further implicate structure-derived mechanisms for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "generated_text": "The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response by mediating the activation of caspase-1, leading to the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and pyroptosis. Despite its critical function, the structural mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes recent advances in the structural biology of the NLRP3 inflammasome, focusing on the roles of the adaptor protein ASC and the formation of ASC filaments in the assembly process. We discuss the structural insights into NLRP3 activation by diverse stimuli, including microbial components and endogenous danger signals, and the subsequent recruitment of ASC and caspase-1. Furthermore, we highlight the implications of these structural findings for understanding the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases. This comprehensive overview aims to bridge the gap between structural data and functional implications, providing a foundation for future research in this field.", "label": 1}
