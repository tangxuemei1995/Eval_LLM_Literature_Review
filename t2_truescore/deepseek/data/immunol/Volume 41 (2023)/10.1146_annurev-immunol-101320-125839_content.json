{"grounding": "Maintaining the correct number of healthy red blood cells (RBCs) is critical for proper oxygenation of tissues throughout the body. Therefore, RBC homeostasis is a tightly controlled balance between RBC production and RBC clearance, through the processes of erythropoiesis and macrophage hemophagocytosis, respectively. However, during the inflammation associated with infectious, autoimmune, or inflammatory diseases this homeostatic process is often dysregulated, leading to acute or chronic anemia. In each disease setting, multiple mechanisms typically contribute to the development of inflammatory anemia, impinging on both sides of the RBC production and RBC clearance equation. These mechanisms include both direct and indirect effects of inflammatory cytokines and innate sensing. Here, we focus on common innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that contribute to inflammatory anemias using examples from several diseases, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome, severe malarial anemia during Plasmodium infection, and systemic lupus erythematosus, among others.", "generated_text": "Inflammatory anemia represents a complex interplay between immune mechanisms and erythropoiesis, often exacerbated by underlying conditions such as malaria, sickle cell anemia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This review delves into the pathophysiological roles of hemophagocytes and inflammatory cytokines in disrupting red blood cell (RBC) homeostasis, leading to anemia. In malaria, the immune response to Plasmodium infection can result in excessive hemophagocytosis, while in sickle cell anemia, chronic inflammation contributes to RBC destruction and impaired erythropoiesis. HLH, characterized by uncontrolled immune activation, further exemplifies the detrimental effects of inflammation on RBC survival. Understanding these immune mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies to mitigate inflammatory anemia. By exploring the intricate relationships between inflammation, hemophagocytes, and anemia, this study aims to shed light on potential therapeutic avenues for managing these challenging conditions.", "label": 1}
