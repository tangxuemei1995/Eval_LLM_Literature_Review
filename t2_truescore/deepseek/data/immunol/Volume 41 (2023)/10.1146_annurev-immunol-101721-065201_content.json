{"grounding": "Immunity to infection has been extensively studied in humans and mice bearing naturally occurring or experimentally introduced germline mutations. Mouse studies are sometimes neglected by human immunologists, on the basis that mice are not humans and the infections studied are experimental and not natural. Conversely, human studies are sometimes neglected by mouse immunologists, on the basis of the uncontrolled conditions of study and small numbers of patients. However, both sides would agree that the infectious phenotypes of patients with inborn errors of immunity often differ from those of the corresponding mutant mice. Why is that? We argue that this important question is best addressed by revisiting and reinterpreting the findings of both mouse and human studies from a genetic perspective. Greater caution is required for reverse-genetics studies than for forward-genetics studies, but genetic analysis is sufficiently strong to define the studies likely to stand the test of time. Genetically robust mouse and human studies can provide invaluable complementary insights into the mechanisms of immunity to infection common and specific to these two species.", "generated_text": "The study of immunology has long relied on mouse models to understand human diseases, particularly infectious diseases and immunodeficiency. However, the translation of findings from mouse to human immunology has been fraught with challenges, primarily due to genetic differences between the species. This research aims to bridge the gap by leveraging advances in human and mouse genetics to reconcile these differences. By focusing on genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases and inborn errors of immunity, we explore how genetic variations influence immune responses across species. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of genetic data from both humans and mice, identifying conserved pathways and species-specific adaptations. This study not only enhances our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of immune responses but also provides a framework for improving the translational relevance of mouse models in human immunology. Through this genetic lens, we aim to refine our strategies for combating infectious diseases and immunodeficiency, paving the way for more effective treatments and therapies.", "label": 1}
