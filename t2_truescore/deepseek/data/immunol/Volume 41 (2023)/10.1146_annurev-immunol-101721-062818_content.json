{"grounding": "The epithelial tissues that line our body, such as the skin and gut, have remarkable regenerative prowess and continually renew throughout our lifetimes. Owing to their barrier function, these tissues have also evolved sophisticated repair mechanisms to swiftly heal and limit the penetration of harmful agents following injury. Researchers now appreciate that epithelial regeneration and repair are not autonomous processes but rely on a dynamic cross talk with immunity. A wealth of clinical and experimental data point to the functional coupling of reparative and inflammatory responses as two sides of the same coin. Here we bring to the fore the immunological signals that underlie homeostatic epithelial regeneration and restitution following damage. We review our current understanding of how immune cells contribute to distinct phases of repair. When unchecked, immune-mediated repair programs are co-opted to fuel epithelial pathologies such as cancer, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, understanding the reparative functions of immunity may advance therapeutic innovation in regenerative medicine and epithelial inflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between the immune system and epithelial tissues plays a pivotal role in the processes of regeneration and repair, particularly in the context of inflammatory diseases. This review delves into the mechanisms of immune-epithelial cross talk, highlighting how immune cells and epithelial stem cells collaborate to restore tissue integrity and function following injury. We explore the signaling pathways and molecular mediators that facilitate this cross talk, emphasizing their significance in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and promoting tissue repair. Furthermore, we discuss the dysregulation of these interactions in chronic inflammatory diseases, which can lead to impaired regeneration and pathological tissue remodeling. By understanding the complex dialogue between immunity and epithelium, we can uncover novel therapeutic targets to enhance tissue repair and mitigate the effects of inflammatory diseases, offering new avenues for regenerative medicine and the treatment of epithelial disorders.", "label": 1}
