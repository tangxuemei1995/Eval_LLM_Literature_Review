{"grounding": "The evolution of IgE in mammals added an extra layer of immune protection at body surfaces to provide a rapid and local response against antigens from the environment. The IgE immune response employs potent expulsive and inflammatory forces against local antigen provocation, at the risk of damaging host tissues and causing allergic disease. Two well-known IgE receptors, the high-affinity FcεRI and low-affinity CD23, mediate the activities of IgE. Unlike other known antibody receptors, CD23 also regulates IgE expression, maintaining IgE homeostasis. This mechanism evolved by adapting the function of the complement receptor CD21. Recent insights into the dynamic character of IgE structure, its resultant capacity for allosteric modulation, and the potential for ligand-induced dissociation have revealed previously unappreciated mechanisms for regulation of IgE and IgE complexes. We describe recent research, highlighting structural studies of the IgE network of proteins to analyze the uniquely versatile activities of IgE and anti-IgE biologics.", "generated_text": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases through its interaction with high-affinity (FcεRI) and low-affinity (CD23) receptors. This review delves into the structural intricacies of IgE and its receptors, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning their interactions. The unique architecture of IgE, characterized by its flexibility and allosteric properties, facilitates its binding to FcεRI on mast cells and basophils, triggering the allergic cascade. Similarly, the interaction between IgE and CD23 influences IgE homeostasis and antigen presentation. Recent advancements in structural biology have elucidated the conformational changes in IgE and its receptors upon binding, offering insights into the design of anti-IgE biologics. These therapeutic agents, by targeting specific epitopes on IgE or its receptors, aim to disrupt the allergic response without compromising the immune system's integrity. This abstract underscores the importance of understanding the structural and mechanistic aspects of IgE and its receptors in developing novel anti-allergic therapies.", "label": 1}
