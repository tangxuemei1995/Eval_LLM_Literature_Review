{"grounding": "Our defenses against infection rely on the ability of the immune system to distinguish invading pathogens from self. This task is exceptionally challenging, if not seemingly impossible, in the case of retroviruses that have integrated almost seamlessly into the host. This review examines the limits of innate and adaptive immune responses elicited by endogenous retroviruses and other retroelements, the targets of immune recognition, and the consequences for host health and disease. Contrary to theoretical expectation, endogenous retroelements retain substantial immunogenicity, which manifests most profoundly when their epigenetic repression is compromised, contributing to autoinflammatory and autoimmune disease and age-related inflammation. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that regulated immune reactivity to endogenous retroelements is integral to immune system development and function, underpinning cancer immunosurveillance, resistance to infection, and responses to the microbiota. Elucidation of the interaction points with endogenous retroelements will therefore deepen our understanding of immune system function and contribution to disease.", "generated_text": "Endogenous retroelements, including endogenous retroviruses, represent a significant portion of the human genome and have been implicated in both physiological processes and pathological conditions. These elements, remnants of ancient viral infections, pose a unique immunological conundrum: they are recognized as 'self' due to their integration into the host genome, yet they retain features that can trigger 'non-self' immune responses. This review explores the dual role of endogenous retroelements in modulating the immune system, focusing on their capacity to elicit interferon responses and influence adaptive immunity. We delve into the mechanisms by which these elements are regulated to prevent autoimmunity and how their dysregulation can contribute to disease. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting endogenous retroelements in autoimmune diseases and cancer, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in harnessing these ancient viral remnants for modern medicine.", "label": 0}
