{"grounding": "Characterization of RNA modifications has identified their distribution features and molecular functions. Dynamic changes in RNA modification on various forms of RNA are essential for the development and function of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the value of innovative RNA modification profiling technologies to uncover the function of these diverse, dynamic RNA modifications in various immune cells within healthy and diseased contexts. Further, we explore our current understanding of the mechanisms whereby aberrant RNA modifications modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment and point out outstanding research questions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the pivotal role of RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), in regulating the immune system's response to viral infections and tumor development. By analyzing the epitranscriptome, we uncover how m6A modifications influence antiviral and antitumor immunity, highlighting their impact on the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that manipulating RNA modifications could offer novel therapeutic strategies for enhancing immune responses against viruses and cancer, providing a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immune regulation and offering potential targets for immunotherapy.", "label": 0}
