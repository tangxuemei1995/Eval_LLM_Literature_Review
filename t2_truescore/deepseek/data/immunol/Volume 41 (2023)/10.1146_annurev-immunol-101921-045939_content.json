{"grounding": "Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a key cytokine regulating the development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death of T cells. In CD4+ T cells, TGF-β maintains the quiescence and controls the activation of naive T cells. While inhibiting the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, TGF-β promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells. TGF-β is required for the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells and the development of regulatory T cells. TGF-β is crucial in the differentiation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells and their retention in the tissue, whereas it suppresses effector T cell function. In addition, TGF-β also regulates the generation or function of natural killer T cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes. Here I highlight the major findings and recent advances in our understanding of TGF-β regulation of T cells and provide a personal perspective of the field.", "generated_text": "Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of T cell biology. This study delves into the multifaceted effects of TGF-β on various T cell subsets, including CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), and γδ T cells. We explore the dual role of TGF-β in promoting T cell quiescence and activation, highlighting its context-dependent functions in immune responses. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which TGF-β influences T cell differentiation, function, and homeostasis. This research underscores the importance of TGF-β signaling in maintaining immune tolerance and its implications in autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases. Understanding the complex regulatory networks governed by TGF-β in T cells could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting immune dysregulation.", "label": 1}
