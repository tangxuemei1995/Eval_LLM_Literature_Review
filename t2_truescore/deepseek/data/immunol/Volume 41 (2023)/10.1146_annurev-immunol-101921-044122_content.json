{"grounding": "T cells and natural killer (NK) cells have complementary roles in tumor immunity, and dual T cell and NK cell attack thus offers opportunities to deepen the impact of immunotherapy. Recent work has also shown that NK cells play an important role in recruiting dendritic cells to tumors and thus enhance induction of CD8 T cell responses, while IL-2 secreted by T cells activates NK cells. Targeting of immune evasion mechanisms from the activating NKG2D receptor and its MICA and MICB ligands on tumor cells offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, T cells and NK cells share several important inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance T cell– and NK cell–mediated immunity. These inhibitory receptor-ligand systems include CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E. We also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies based on inhibitory and activating cytokines that profoundly impact the function of both lymphocyte populations within tumors.", "generated_text": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in oncology, leveraging the body's immune system to combat malignancies. This study focuses on the design of immunotherapies that simultaneously engage T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, two pivotal components of the immune response against cancer. T cells, with their antigen-specific cytotoxicity, and NK cells, known for their innate ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells without prior sensitization, offer complementary mechanisms of action. By integrating strategies that enhance the activation, proliferation, and tumor infiltration of both cell types, we aim to develop more effective and durable cancer treatments. Our approach includes the use of bispecific antibodies, cytokine therapies, and engineered immune cells to create a synergistic immune response. Preliminary findings suggest that such dual-targeting immunotherapies can significantly improve tumor control and patient outcomes, highlighting the potential of harnessing the combined power of T cells and NK cells in cancer immunotherapy.", "label": 1}
