{"grounding": "Type 2 immunity mediates protective responses to helminths and pathological responses to allergens, but it also has broad roles in the maintenance of tissue integrity, including wound repair. Type 2 cytokines are known to promote fibrosis, an overzealous repair response, but their contribution to healthy wound repair is less well understood. This review discusses the evidence that the canonical type 2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, are integral to the tissue repair process through two main pathways. First, essential for the progression of effective tissue repair, IL-4 and IL-13 suppress the initial inflammatory response to injury. Second, these cytokines regulate how the extracellular matrix is modified, broken down, and rebuilt for effective repair. IL-4 and/or IL-13 amplifies multiple aspects of the tissue repair response, but many of these pathways are highly redundant and can be induced by other signals. Therefore, the exact contribution of IL-4RÎ± signaling remains difficult to unravel.", "generated_text": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-13 (IL-13) are pivotal cytokines in the orchestration of type 2 immunity, playing critical roles in the regulation of inflammation and the promotion of wound repair. These cytokines are instrumental in modulating the immune response to tissue injury and helminth infections, facilitating the activation of macrophages and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Through their actions, IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to the resolution of inflammation and the restoration of tissue integrity. This review delves into the mechanisms by which IL-4 and IL-13 influence wound healing processes, highlighting their dual roles as regulators and effectors. By examining the interplay between these cytokines and the ECM, as well as their impact on immune cell behavior, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of their contributions to tissue repair and the potential therapeutic implications for enhancing wound healing in clinical settings.", "label": 1}
