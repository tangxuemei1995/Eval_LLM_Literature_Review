{"grounding": "The innate immune system detects pathogens via germline-encoded receptors that bind to conserved pathogen ligands called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Here we consider an additional strategy of pathogen sensing called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI involves detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors, also called effectors. Pathogens produce effectors to manipulate hosts to create a replicative niche and/or block host immunity. Unlike PAMPs, effectors are often diverse and rapidly evolving and can thus be unsuitable targets for direct detection by germline-encoded receptors. Effectors are instead often sensed indirectly via detection of their virulence activities. ETI is a viable strategy for pathogen sensing and is used across diverse phyla, including plants, but the molecular mechanisms of ETI are complex compared to simple receptor/ligand-based PAMP detection. Here we survey the mechanisms and functions of ETI, with a particular focus on emerging insights from animal studies. We suggest that many examples of ETI may remain to be discovered, hiding in plain sight throughout immunology.", "generated_text": "Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) represents a critical layer of plant innate immunity, activated upon recognition of pathogen virulence factors, known as effectors, by plant resistance proteins. This sophisticated defense mechanism is a cornerstone of the plant immune system, providing a robust response to pathogen invasion. ETI is often contrasted with Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI), which is initiated by the recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). However, ETI is distinguished by its specificity and the intensity of the immune response, often leading to programmed cell death at the infection site to prevent pathogen spread. The concept of guard immunity further elucidates the molecular basis of ETI, where plant resistance proteins 'guard' host proteins targeted by pathogen effectors, triggering a defense response upon effector detection. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying ETI, its role in plant-pathogen interactions, and its implications for developing disease-resistant crops, highlighting the intricate balance between pathogen virulence strategies and plant defense mechanisms.", "label": 1}
