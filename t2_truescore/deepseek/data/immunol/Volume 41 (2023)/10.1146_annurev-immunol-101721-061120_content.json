{"grounding": "A large body of evidence generated in the last two and a half years addresses the roles of T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and following vaccination. Infection or vaccination induces multi-epitope CD4 and CD8 T cell responses with polyfunctionality. Early T cell responses have been associated with mild COVID-19 outcomes. In concert with animal model data, these results suggest that while antibody responses are key to prevent infection, T cell responses may also play valuable roles in reducing disease severity and controlling infection. T cell memory after vaccination is sustained for at least six months. While neutralizing antibody responses are impacted by SARS-CoV-2 variants, most CD4 and CD8 T cell responses are preserved. This review highlights the extensive progress made, and the data and knowledge gaps that remain, in our understanding of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines.", "generated_text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic, with T cell responses playing a crucial role in controlling COVID-19 infection and influencing disease severity. This study explores the dynamics of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the impact of viral variants, the efficacy of vaccination in eliciting T cell immunity, and the identification of immunodominant epitopes. We review recent findings on how T cell responses contribute to protection against severe disease and the potential for cross-reactivity with emerging variants. Additionally, we discuss the implications of T cell memory in long-term immunity and the challenges in designing vaccines that elicit robust T cell responses. Understanding the nuances of T cell immunity is essential for developing effective strategies to combat COVID-19 and mitigate the impact of future variants.", "label": 0}
