{"grounding": "The presence of granulated lymphocytes in the human uterine mucosa, known as decidua during pregnancy, or endometrium otherwise, was first noted in the nineteenth century, but it was not until 1990 that these cells were identified as a type of natural killer (NK) cell. From the outset, uterine NK (uNK) cells were found to be less cytotoxic than their circulating counterparts, peripheral NK (pNK) cells. Recently, unbiased approaches have defined three subpopulations of uNK cells, all of which cluster separately from pNK cells. Here, we review the history of research into uNK cells, including their ability to interact with placental extravillous trophoblast cells and their potential role in regulating placental implantation. We go on to review more recent advances that focus on uNK cell development and heterogeneity and their potential to defend against infection and to mediate memory effects. Finally, we consider how a better understanding of these cells could be leveraged in the future to improve outcomes of pregnancy for mothers and babies.", "generated_text": "The human uterine mucosa harbors a unique population of natural killer (NK) cells, known as uterine NK (uNK) cells, which play a pivotal role in reproduction. These cells are distinct from their peripheral counterparts in phenotype, function, and regulation. uNK cells are most abundant during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy, where they interact closely with the invading trophoblast cells. This interaction is crucial for the remodeling of spiral arteries, a process essential for adequate placental perfusion and successful pregnancy outcomes. uNK cells are characterized by their ability to produce a wide array of cytokines and angiogenic factors, which facilitate trophoblast invasion and vascular transformation. Despite their cytotoxic potential, uNK cells exhibit a tolerant phenotype towards the semi-allogeneic fetus, highlighting their specialized role in immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface. This review summarizes current knowledge on the biology of uNK cells, their interaction with trophoblasts, and their contribution to decidualization and pregnancy maintenance, providing insights into their potential implications in reproductive health and disease.", "label": 1}
