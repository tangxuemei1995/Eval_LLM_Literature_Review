{"grounding": "Autoreactive B cells and interferons are central players in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. The partial success of drugs targeting these pathways, however, supports heterogeneity in upstream mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent insights from genetic and immune monitoring studies of patients that are refining our understanding of these basic mechanisms. Among them, novel mutations in genes affecting intrinsic B cell activation or clearance of interferogenic nucleic acids have been described. Mitochondria have emerged as relevant inducers and/or amplifiers of SLE pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms that include disruption of organelle integrity or compartmentalization, defective metabolism, and failure of quality control measures. These result in extra- or intracellular release of interferogenic nucleic acids as well as in innate and/or adaptive immune cell activation. A variety of classic and novel SLE autoantibody specificities have been found to recapitulate genetic alterations associated with monogenic lupus or to trigger interferogenic amplification loops. Finally, atypical B cells and novel extrafollicular T helper cell subsets have been proposed to contribute to the generation of SLE autoantibodies. Overall, these novel insights provide opportunities to deepen the immunophenotypic surveillance of patients and open the door to patient stratification and personalized, rational approaches to therapy.", "generated_text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, leading to widespread inflammation and tissue damage. The pathogenesis of SLE involves a multifaceted interplay between genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Central to this process is the dysregulation of the interferon (IFN) pathway, particularly type I IFNs, which play a pivotal role in the activation of the immune system and the promotion of autoimmunity. Beyond the IFN signature, recent research has highlighted the importance of aberrant cell death mechanisms, including apoptosis and necroptosis, in the release of autoantigens and the initiation of autoimmune responses. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also emerged as a critical factor, contributing to the oxidative stress and metabolic disturbances observed in SLE patients. Furthermore, the extrafollicular pathway of B cell activation has been implicated in the rapid production of autoantibodies, bypassing the conventional germinal center response. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of SLE pathogenesis, with a focus on the role of IFN signaling, cell death pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extrafollicular B cell activation, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for this debilitating disease.", "label": 1}
