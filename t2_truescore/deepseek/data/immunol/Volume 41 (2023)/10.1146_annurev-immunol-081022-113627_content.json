{"grounding": "Myeloid cells are a significant proportion of leukocytes within tissues, comprising granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. With the identification of various myeloid cells that perform separate but complementary functions during homeostasis and disease, our understanding of tissue myeloid cells has evolved significantly. Exciting findings from transcriptomics profiling and fate-mapping mouse models have facilitated the identification of their developmental origins, maturation, and tissue-specific specializations. This review highlights the current understanding of tissue myeloid cells and the contributing factors of functional heterogeneity to better comprehend the complex and dynamic immune interactions within the healthy or inflamed tissue. Specifically, we discuss the new understanding of the contributions of granulocyte-monocyte progenitorâ€“derived phagocytes to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity as well as the impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function. Lastly, we explore the developing paradigm of myeloid cell heterogeneity during inflammation and disease.", "generated_text": "The origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, particularly those derived from granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP), have been subjects of intense research. This study focuses on the differentiation pathways of GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, employing fate-mapping techniques to trace their lineage commitment and functional specialization within various tissue niches. We explore the dynamic interplay between intrinsic cellular programs and extrinsic niche signals that drive the tissue-specific reprogramming of these myeloid cells. Our findings highlight the plasticity of GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, revealing their capacity to adapt to local tissue environments and contribute to both homeostatic and pathological processes. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying their heterogeneity and functional diversity, this research provides new insights into the regulation of myeloid cell fate and its implications for immune responses and disease progression.", "label": 1}
