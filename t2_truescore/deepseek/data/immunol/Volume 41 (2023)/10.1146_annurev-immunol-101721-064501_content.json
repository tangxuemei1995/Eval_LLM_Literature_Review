{"grounding": "There is a dramatic remodeling of the T cell compartment during aging. The most notorious changes are the reduction of the naive T cell pool and the accumulation of memory-like T cells. Memory-like T cells in older people acquire a phenotype of terminally differentiated cells, lose the expression of costimulatory molecules, and acquire properties of senescent cells. In this review, we focus on the different subsets of age-associated T cells that accumulate during aging. These subsets include extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer properties, exhausted T cells with altered cytokine production, and regulatory T cells that gain proinflammatory features. Importantly, all of these subsets lose their lymph node homing capacity and migrate preferentially to nonlymphoid tissues, where they contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging.", "generated_text": "Aging is characterized by a progressive decline in immune function, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence, which significantly impacts health and longevity. This study explores the role of extremely differentiated T cell subsets in tissue deterioration during aging. With the thymus undergoing involution and the immune system's capacity to generate naive T cells diminishing, the body increasingly relies on memory T cells. However, these cells, particularly the highly differentiated subsets, exhibit signs of senescence and contribute to chronic inflammation, a hallmark of aging. Through a comprehensive analysis of lymphocyte populations in aged tissues, we identify specific T cell subsets that are disproportionately involved in promoting tissue deterioration. Our findings suggest that targeting these subsets could mitigate age-related tissue damage, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention to enhance healthspan in the elderly.", "label": 1}
