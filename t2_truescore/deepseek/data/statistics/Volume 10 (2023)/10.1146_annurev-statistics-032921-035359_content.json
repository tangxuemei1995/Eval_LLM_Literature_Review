{"grounding": "Surrogate markers are often used in clinical trials settings when obtaining a final outcome to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment requires a long wait, is expensive to obtain, or both. Formal definitions of surrogate marker quality resulting from a large variety of estimation approaches have been proposed over the years. I review this work, with a particular focus on approaches that use the causal inference paradigm, as these conceptualize a good marker as one in the causal pathway between the treatment and outcome. I also focus on efforts to evaluate the risk of a surrogate paradox, a damaging situation where the surrogate is positively associated with the outcome, and the causal effect of the treatment on the surrogate is in a helpful direction, but the ultimate causal effect of the treatment on the outcome is harmful. I then review some recent work in robust surrogate marker estimation and conclude with a discussion and suggestions for future research.", "generated_text": "The utilization of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials has become a pivotal strategy for accelerating the development of new therapies, especially in scenarios where direct measurement of clinical outcomes is challenging due to time constraints or ethical considerations. This research delves into the intricate relationship between surrogate markers and clinical endpoints, employing causal inference frameworks to evaluate the validity and reliability of surrogate endpoints. By scrutinizing the Prentice criteria, which serve as a foundational benchmark for surrogate validation, the study explores the nuances of causal effectiveness and causal association in the context of surrogate endpoints. Furthermore, it addresses the surrogate paradox, a phenomenon where a treatment shows a positive effect on the surrogate marker but a negative or null effect on the clinical outcome, through the lens of principal stratification. This comprehensive analysis aims to enhance the understanding of surrogate endpoints, offering insights into their appropriate application and interpretation in clinical trials to ensure the advancement of patient-centered therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
