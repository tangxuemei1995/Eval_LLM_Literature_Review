{"grounding": "For real-valued parameters, significance tests can be motivated as three-decision methods, in which we either assert the sign of the parameter above or below a specified null value, or say nothing either way. Tukey viewed this as a “sensible formulation” of tests, unlike the widely taught null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) system that is today's default. We review the three-decision framework, collecting the substantial literature on how other statistical tools can be usefully motivated in this way. These tools include close Bayesian analogs of frequentist power calculations, p-values, confidence intervals, and multiple testing corrections. We also show how three-decision arguments can straightforwardly resolve some well-known difficulties in the interpretation and criticism of testing results. Explicit results are shown for simple conjugate analyses, but the methods discussed apply generally to real-valued parameters.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the formulation and application of three-decision methods in the context of statistical and significance tests, offering a nuanced approach to decision theory. By integrating considerations of power, multiple testing, and sensitivity analysis, the study presents a comprehensive framework that enhances the interpretability and utility of statistical findings. The three-decision method, which includes options to accept, reject, or remain undecided about a hypothesis, provides a more flexible and sensible approach to hypothesis testing compared to traditional binary decision models. This approach is particularly beneficial in complex research scenarios where the implications of Type I and Type II errors are significant. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper demonstrates how three-decision methods can improve the robustness and reliability of statistical conclusions, thereby contributing to more informed and nuanced scientific decision-making.", "label": 1}
