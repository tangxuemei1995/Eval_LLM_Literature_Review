{"grounding": "This article reviews recent progress in high-dimensional bootstrap. We first review high-dimensional central limit theorems for distributions of sample mean vectors over the rectangles, bootstrap consistency results in high dimensions, and key techniques used to establish those results. We then review selected applications of high-dimensional bootstrap: construction of simultaneous confidence sets for high-dimensional vector parameters, multiple hypothesis testing via step-down, postselection inference, intersection bounds for partially identified parameters, and inference on best policies in policy evaluation. Finally, we also comment on a couple of future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of the empirical bootstrap method in high-dimensional data analysis, focusing on its integration with the high-dimensional central limit theorem for robust statistical inference. We investigate the efficacy of the multiplier bootstrap in addressing challenges associated with multiple testing and simultaneous inference in high-dimensional settings. Through comprehensive simulations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the method's ability to accurately approximate the distribution of high-dimensional test statistics, offering a powerful tool for researchers dealing with complex datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of bootstrap techniques in enhancing the reliability of high-dimensional statistical analyses.", "label": 1}
