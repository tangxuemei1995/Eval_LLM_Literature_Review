{"grounding": "Deep neural network models have become ubiquitous in recent years and have been applied to nearly all areas of science, engineering, and industry. These models are particularly useful for data that have strong dependencies in space (e.g., images) and time (e.g., sequences). Indeed, deep models have also been extensively used by the statistical community to model spatial and spatiotemporal data through, for example, the use of multilevel Bayesian hierarchical models and deep Gaussian processes. In this review, we first present an overview of traditional statistical and machine learning perspectives for modeling spatial and spatiotemporal data, and then focus on a variety of hybrid models that have recently been developed for latent process, data, and parameter specifications. These hybrid models integrate statistical modeling ideas with deep neural network models in order to take advantage of the strengths of each modeling paradigm. We conclude by giving an overview of computational technologies that have proven useful for these hybrid models, and with a brief discussion on future research directions.", "generated_text": "The integration of statistical methodologies with deep learning techniques has emerged as a powerful paradigm for analyzing spatial and spatiotemporal data. This research explores the synergy between Bayesian hierarchical models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep Gaussian processes, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), reinforcement learning, and warping techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability in complex datasets. Bayesian hierarchical models provide a robust framework for incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty, while CNNs and RNNs excel in capturing spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. Deep Gaussian processes offer a flexible approach for modeling non-linear relationships, and reinforcement learning introduces adaptive strategies for dynamic environments. Warping techniques further refine these models by aligning data structures to improve coherence and reduce noise. Together, these methods form a comprehensive toolkit for addressing the challenges inherent in spatial and spatiotemporal data analysis, paving the way for advancements in fields ranging from environmental science to urban planning.", "label": 0}
