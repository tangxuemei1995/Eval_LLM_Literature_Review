{"grounding": "Exoplanets can be detected with various observational techniques. Among them, radial velocity (RV) has the key advantages of revealing the architecture of planetary systems and measuring planetary mass and orbital eccentricities. RV observations are poised to play a key role in the detection and characterization of Earth twins. However, the detection of such small planets is not yet possible due to very complex, temporally correlated instrumental and astrophysical stochastic signals. Furthermore, exploring the large parameter space of RV models exhaustively and efficiently presents difficulties. In this review, we frame RV data analysis as a problem of detection and parameter estimation in unevenly sampled, multivariate time series. The objective of this review is two-fold: to introduce the motivation, methodological challenges, and numerical challenges of RV data analysis to nonspecialists, and to unify the existing advanced approaches in order to identify areas for improvement.", "generated_text": "The detection of exoplanets through radial velocity (RV) measurements is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, yet it is fraught with challenges due to the presence of correlated noise, uneven sampling, and model misspecification. This study explores advanced statistical methods tailored for the analysis of multivariate time series data in the context of exoplanet detection. We focus on the development and comparison of models that account for the complex noise structures inherent in RV datasets, including the effects of stellar activity and instrumental artifacts. By employing a rigorous model comparison framework, we aim to enhance the reliability of exoplanet detection and characterization. Our approach addresses the critical issue of model misspecification, ensuring that the statistical models used are robust against the diverse sources of noise and variability in RV measurements. This research contributes to the refinement of statistical tools for exoplanet discovery, paving the way for more accurate and comprehensive studies of planetary systems beyond our own.", "label": 1}
