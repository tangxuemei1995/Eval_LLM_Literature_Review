{"grounding": "Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation are closely related tasks, with the former concerning in-sample goodness (or lack) of fit and the latter addressing predictive performance out-of-sample. We review the ubiquitous setting in which forecasts are cast in the form of quantiles or quantile-bounded prediction intervals. We distinguish unconditional calibration, which corresponds to classical coverage criteria, from the stronger notion of conditional calibration, as can be visualized in quantile reliability diagrams. Consistent scoring functions—including, but not limited to, the widely used asymmetricpiecewise linear score or pinball loss—provide for comparative assessment and ranking, and link to the coefficient of determination and skill scores. We illustrate the use of these tools on Engel's food expenditure data, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the critical aspects of model diagnostics and forecast evaluation specifically tailored for quantile predictions. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as calibration, coverage plots, Murphy diagrams, and reliability diagrams, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quantile regression models. The research emphasizes the importance of scoring functions in assessing the predictive performance of these models, offering a comprehensive framework for evaluating their effectiveness. Through a series of empirical analyses, we demonstrate how these diagnostic tools can be effectively applied to identify model shortcomings and improve forecast precision. Our findings contribute to the broader field of statistical modeling by providing practitioners with robust techniques for quantile forecast evaluation, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making processes in various applications.", "label": 1}
