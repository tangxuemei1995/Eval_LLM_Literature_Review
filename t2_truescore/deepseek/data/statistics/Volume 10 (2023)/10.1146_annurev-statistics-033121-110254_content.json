{"grounding": "Rich data generating mechanisms are ubiquitous in this age of information and require complex statistical models to draw meaningful inference. While Bayesian analysis has seen enormous development in the last 30 years, benefitting from the impetus given by the successful application of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, the combination of big data and complex models conspire to produce significant challenges for the traditional MCMC algorithms. We review modern algorithmic developments addressing the latter and compare their performance using numerical experiments.", "generated_text": "This paper explores approximate methods for Bayesian computation, focusing on techniques such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), Bayesian synthetic likelihood, coresets, divide and conquer strategies, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and subsampling. These methods address the computational challenges posed by complex models and large datasets, offering scalable and efficient alternatives to traditional Bayesian inference. By leveraging approximation and parallelization, the discussed approaches enable the application of Bayesian methods to a broader range of problems, enhancing their practicality in data-intensive research domains.", "label": 1}
