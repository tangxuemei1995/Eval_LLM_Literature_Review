{"grounding": "In the era of precision medicine, time-to-event outcomes such as time to death or progression are routinely collected, along with high-throughput covariates. These high-dimensional data defy classical survival regression models, which are either infeasible to fit or likely to incur low predictability due to overfitting. To overcome this, recent emphasis has been placed on developing novel approaches for feature selection and survival prognostication. In this article, we review various cutting-edge methods that handle survival outcome data with high-dimensional predictors, highlighting recent innovations in machine learning approaches for survival prediction. We cover the statistical intuitions and principles behind these methods and conclude with extensions to more complex settings, where competing events are observed. We exemplify these methods with applications to the Boston Lung Cancer Survival Cohort study, one of the largest cancer epidemiology cohorts investigating the complex mechanisms of lung cancer.", "generated_text": "High-dimensional survival analysis has emerged as a pivotal area in precision medicine and data science, addressing the challenge of analyzing datasets where the number of predictors vastly exceeds the number of observations. This paper reviews cutting-edge methodologies and applications in the field, focusing on feature screening techniques that efficiently identify relevant predictors from a vast pool, and machine learning approaches, including artificial neural networks, that model complex relationships between predictors and survival outcomes. We also delve into the role of statistical inference in validating these models, ensuring their reliability and interpretability in clinical and research settings. Through a comprehensive examination of recent advancements, this study highlights the transformative potential of high-dimensional survival analysis in enhancing predictive accuracy and personalizing treatment strategies, thereby contributing significantly to the evolution of precision medicine.", "label": 1}
