{"grounding": "By linking conceptual theories with observed data, generative models can support reasoning in complex situations. They have come to play a central role both within and beyond statistics, providing the basis for power analysis in molecular biology, theory building in particle physics, and resource allocation in epidemiology, for example. We introduce the probabilistic and computational concepts underlying modern generative models and then analyze how they can be used to inform experimental design, iterative model refinement, goodness-of-fit evaluation, and agent based simulation. We emphasize a modular view of generative mechanisms and discuss how they can be flexibly recombined in new problem contexts. We provide practical illustrations throughout, and code for reproducing all examples is available at \nhttps://github.com/krisrs1128/generative_review\n. Finally, we observe how research in generative models is currently split across several islands of activity, and we highlight opportunities lying at disciplinary intersections.", "generated_text": "Generative models have emerged as a pivotal tool across various disciplines, offering a robust framework for simulation, decision-making, and experimental design. This paper explores the interdisciplinary applications of generative models, emphasizing their role in agent-based models, particle filters, and the critical evaluation of model performance through goodness-of-fit measures. By synthesizing insights from diverse fields, we highlight the versatility of generative models in capturing complex systems and phenomena. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in model evaluation, advocating for a nuanced approach to assessing model accuracy and reliability. This interdisciplinary perspective not only enriches our understanding of generative models but also paves the way for innovative applications in science and engineering, underscoring the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in advancing model-based research.", "label": 1}
