{"grounding": "I consider the development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, from late-1980s Gibbs sampling to present-day gradient-based methods and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes. In parallel, I show how these ideas have been implemented in successive generations of statistical software for Bayesian inference. These software packages have been instrumental in popularizing applied Bayesian modeling across a wide variety of scientific domains. They provide an invaluable service to applied statisticians in hiding the complexities of MCMC from the user while providing a convenient modeling language and tools to summarize the output from a Bayesian model. As research into new MCMC methods remains very active, it is likely that future generations of software will incorporate new methods to improve the user experience.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the advancements and applications of simulation-based Bayesian analysis, a cornerstone in modern statistical inference. Focusing on Bayesian computation, we delve into the methodologies of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), alongside their implementation in statistical software such as BUGS, Stan, and JAGS. The discussion extends to Gibbs sampling and graphical models, highlighting their role in simplifying complex Bayesian analyses. Additionally, we introduce Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) as an emerging tool for efficient Bayesian computation. Through a comprehensive review, this study aims to provide insights into the selection and application of these techniques, offering a guide for researchers in navigating the landscape of Bayesian inference tools and methodologies.", "label": 1}
