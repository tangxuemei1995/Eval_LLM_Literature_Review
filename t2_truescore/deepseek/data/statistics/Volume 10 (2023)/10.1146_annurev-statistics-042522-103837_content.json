{"grounding": "When assessing causal effects, determining the target population to which the results are intended to generalize is a critical decision. Randomized and observational studies each have strengths and limitations for estimating causal effects in a target population. Estimates from randomized data may have internal validity but are often not representative of the target population. Observational data may better reflect the target population, and hence be more likely to have external validity, but are subject to potential bias due to unmeasured confounding. While much of the causal inference literature has focused on addressing internal validity bias, both internal and external validity are necessary for unbiased estimates in a target population. This article presents a framework for addressing external validity bias, including a synthesis of approaches for generalizability and transportability, and the assumptions they require, as well as tests for the heterogeneity of treatment effects and differences between study and target populations.", "generated_text": "This review delves into the critical concepts of generalizability and transportability within the realm of causal inference, emphasizing their pivotal roles in enhancing external validity across diverse populations and settings. Generalizability refers to the extent to which findings from a study can be applied to broader populations, while transportability focuses on the ability to apply causal effects estimated in one population to another, potentially different, population. The paper systematically explores the challenges posed by treatment effect heterogeneity, a key factor that complicates the extrapolation of causal effects. By synthesizing recent advancements in statistical methodologies and theoretical frameworks, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate or hinder the generalization and transportation of causal inferences. Furthermore, it discusses practical strategies for researchers to assess and improve the external validity of their findings, thereby contributing to more robust and applicable causal evidence in various scientific domains.", "label": 1}
