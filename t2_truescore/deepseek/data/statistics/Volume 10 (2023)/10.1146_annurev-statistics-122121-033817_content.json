{"grounding": "Recent technological advances allow for the collection of massive data in the study of complex phenomena over time and/or space in various fields. Many of these data involve sequences of high-dimensional or non-Euclidean measurements, where change-point analysis is a crucial early step in understanding the data. Segmentation, or offline change-point analysis, divides data into homogeneous temporal or spatial segments, making subsequent analysis easier; its online counterpart detects changes in sequentially observed data, allowing for real-time anomaly detection. This article reviews a nonparametric change-point analysis framework that utilizes graphs representing the similarity between observations. This framework can be applied to data as long as a reasonable dissimilarity distance among the observations can be defined. Thus, this framework can be applied to a wide range of applications, from high-dimensional data to non-Euclidean data, such as imaging data or network data. In addition, analytic formulas can be derived to control the false discoveries, making them easy off-the-shelf data analysis tools.", "generated_text": "This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach for change-point analysis in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data settings. Traditional methods often struggle with the complexities inherent in network data and the absence of Euclidean structure. Our proposed methodology leverages graph-based tests and scan statistics to effectively identify change-points without relying on parametric assumptions, making it particularly suitable for nonparametric analysis. By focusing on tail probabilities, we enhance the sensitivity of our tests to subtle changes in data distributions, even in the presence of high-dimensionality. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world applications, showcasing its robustness and versatility across various data types. This research contributes to the growing body of work on graph-based statistical methods, offering a powerful tool for change-point detection in complex data environments.", "label": 1}
