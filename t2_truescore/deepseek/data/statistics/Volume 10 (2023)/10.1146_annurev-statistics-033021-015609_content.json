{"grounding": "Several major global challenges, including climate change and water scarcity, warrant a scientific approach to generating solutions. Developing high quality and robust capacity in (bio)statistics is key to ensuring sound scientific solutions to these challenges, so collaboration between academic and research institutes should be high on university agendas. To strengthen capacity in the developing world, South–North partnerships should be a priority. The ideas and examples of statistical capacity-building presented in this article are the result of several monthly online discussions between a mixedgroup of authors having international experience and formal links with Hasselt University in Belgium. The discussion focuses on statistical capacity-building through education (teaching), research, and societal impact. We have adopted an example-based approach, and in view of the background of the authors, the examples refer mainly to biostatistical capacity-building. Although many universities worldwide have already initiated university collaborations for development, we hope and believe that our ideas and concrete examples can serve as inspiration to further strengthen South–North partnerships on statistical capacity-building.", "generated_text": "The development of sustainable statistical capacity in Africa is pivotal for informed decision-making and policy formulation across various sectors. This paper focuses on the role of biostatistics in enhancing this capacity, emphasizing the importance of education, human capital development, and research. Through a detailed examination of South–North collaboration, we explore how consulting and partnerships between African institutions and their counterparts in the Global North can foster a robust statistical infrastructure. The study highlights the challenges and opportunities in building statistical expertise, particularly in biostatistics, and proposes a framework for sustainable capacity-building. This framework integrates educational programs, research initiatives, and professional development to create a self-sustaining ecosystem of statistical expertise. By leveraging international collaboration and focusing on local needs, the paper argues for a tailored approach that respects the unique contexts of African countries. The findings underscore the critical role of biostatistics in addressing public health challenges and contributing to the broader agenda of statistical capacity-building in Africa.", "label": 1}
