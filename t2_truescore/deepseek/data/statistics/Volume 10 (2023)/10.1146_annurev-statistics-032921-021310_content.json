{"grounding": "Dependent survival data arise in many contexts. One context is clustered survival data, where survival data are collected on clusters such as families or medical centers. Dependent survival data also arise when multiple survival times are recorded for each individual. Frailty models are one common approach to handle such data. In frailty models, the dependence is expressed in terms of a random effect, called the frailty. Frailty models have been used with both the Cox proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time model. This article reviews recent developments in the area of frailty models in a variety of settings. In each setting we provide a detailed model description, assumptions, available estimation methods, and R packages.", "generated_text": "This review explores recent advancements in shared frailty methods for analyzing complex survival data, addressing challenges such as clustered data, recurrent events, and competing risks. We delve into the application of accelerated failure time models and Cox regression within the shared frailty framework, highlighting their adaptability to various data structures. Additionally, the integration of machine learning techniques, including regression trees and random survival forests, is examined for their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and model flexibility in survival analysis. The paper synthesizes current methodologies, offering insights into their strengths and limitations, and discusses future directions for research in this evolving field. This comprehensive overview aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate models for complex survival data analysis.", "label": 0}
