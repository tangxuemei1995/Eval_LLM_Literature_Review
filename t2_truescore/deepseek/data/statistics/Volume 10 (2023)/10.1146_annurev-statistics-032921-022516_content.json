{"grounding": "Over the past few years, interest has increased in models defined on positive and negative integers. Several application areas lead to data that are differences between positive integers. Some important examples are price changes measured discretely in financial applications, pre- and posttreatment measurements of discrete outcomes in clinical trials, the difference in the number of goals in sports events, and differencing of count-valued time series. This review aims at bringing together a wide range of models that have appeared in the literature in recent decades. We provide an extensive review on discrete distributions defined for integer data and then consider univariate and multivariate time-series models, including the class of autoregressive models, stochastic processes, and ARCH-GARCH– (autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic–generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic–) type models.", "generated_text": "This paper explores advanced models tailored for integer data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models that effectively capture the discrete nature of such data. We delve into the application of thinning operators, a pivotal tool in constructing integer-valued time series, and examine their role in enhancing model flexibility and accuracy. Special attention is given to the Skellam distribution, a discrete probability distribution that is particularly suited for modeling the difference between two independent Poisson-distributed random variables. Through a comprehensive review and analysis, we demonstrate how these models and techniques can be applied to real-world data, offering insights into their practical utility and limitations. Our findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate models for integer data to ensure robust and meaningful statistical analysis.", "label": 1}
