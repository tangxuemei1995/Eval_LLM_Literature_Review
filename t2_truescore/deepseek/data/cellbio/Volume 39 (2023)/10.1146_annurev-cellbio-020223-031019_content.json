{"grounding": "Multicellular organisms generate tissues of diverse shapes and functions from cells and extracellular matrices. Their adhesion molecules mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which not only play crucial roles in maintaining tissue integrity but also serve as key regulators of tissue morphogenesis. Cells constantly probe their environment to make decisions: They integrate chemical and mechanical information from the environment via diffusible ligand- or adhesion-based signaling to decide whether to release specific signaling molecules or enzymes, to divide or differentiate, to move away or stay, or even whether to live or die. These decisions in turn modify their environment, including the chemical nature and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. Tissue morphology is the physical manifestation of the remodeling of cells and matrices by their historical biochemical and biophysical landscapes. We review our understanding of matrix and adhesion molecules in tissue morphogenesis, with an emphasis on key physical interactions that drive morphogenesis.", "generated_text": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex biological process that relies on the dynamic interactions between cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM). This study delves into the pivotal roles of cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins and cadherins, in mediating these interactions. Integrins facilitate cell-ECM adhesion, influencing cell signaling and mechanical properties, while cadherins are crucial for cell-cell adhesion, affecting tissue cohesion and architecture. The basement membrane, a specialized ECM structure, serves as a scaffold for tissue organization and a signaling platform for cellular activities. Interfacial tension, a physical property arising from the differential adhesion and contractility of cells, is also explored as a driving force in tissue shaping and compartmentalization. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, this research highlights the intricate balance between biochemical signaling and biophysical forces in tissue morphogenesis, offering insights into the fundamental principles governing tissue development and regeneration.", "label": 1}
