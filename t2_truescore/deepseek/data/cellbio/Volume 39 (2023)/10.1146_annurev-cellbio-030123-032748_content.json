{"grounding": "Microtubules are essential dynamic polymers composed of α/β-tubulin heterodimers. They support intracellular trafficking, cell division, cellular motility, and other essential cellular processes. In many species, both α-tubulin and β-tubulin are encoded by multiple genes with distinct expression profiles and functionality. Microtubules are further diversified through abundant posttranslational modifications, which are added and removed by a suite of enzymes to form complex, stereotyped cellular arrays. The genetic and chemical diversity of tubulin constitute a tubulin code that regulates intrinsic microtubule properties and is read by cellular effectors, such as molecular motors and microtubule-associated proteins, to provide spatial and temporal specificity to microtubules in cells. In this review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding tubulin code literature and highlight limitations and opportunities for the field. As complex microtubule arrays underlie essential physiological processes, a better understanding of how cells employ the tubulin code has important implications for human disease ranging from cancer to neurological disorders.", "generated_text": "The tubulin code represents a sophisticated regulatory mechanism that governs the functional diversity of microtubules, crucial cytoskeletal elements involved in numerous cellular processes. This code is defined by the expression of specific tubulin isoforms and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation. These modifications confer unique properties to microtubules, influencing their stability, dynamics, and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motors. The precise regulation of the tubulin code is essential for normal cellular function, and its dysregulation has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and ciliopathies. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the tubulin code, its impact on cellular physiology, and its implications for health and disease. Understanding the tubulin code offers promising avenues for therapeutic intervention, highlighting the importance of further research in this field.", "label": 1}
