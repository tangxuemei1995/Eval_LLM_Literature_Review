{"grounding": "Toll signaling plays a crucial role in pathogen defense throughout the animal kingdom. It was discovered, however, for its function in dorsoventral (DV) axis formation in Drosophila. In all other insects studied so far, but not outside the insects, Toll is also required for DV patterning. However, in insects more distantly related to Drosophila, Toll's patterning role is frequently reduced and substituted by an expanded influence of BMP signaling, the pathway implicated in DV axis formation in all major metazoan lineages. This suggests that Toll was integrated into an ancestral BMP-based patterning system at the base of the insects or during insect evolution. The observation that Toll signaling has an immune function in the extraembryonic serosa, an early differentiating tissue of most insect embryos, suggests a scenario of how Toll was co-opted from an ancestral immune function for its new role in axis formation.", "generated_text": "The Toll signaling pathway, initially recognized for its pivotal role in innate immunity across diverse taxa, has undergone neofunctionalization in insects, extending its influence to embryonic dorsoventral (DV) patterning. This study explores the evolutionary trajectory of Toll signaling in insects, focusing on model organisms such as Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus, alongside non-insect hexapods, to elucidate its dual functionality. Through comparative analysis, we investigate the pathway's contribution to germ layer evolution, particularly in mesoderm formation, and its involvement in the development of extraembryonic tissues like the serosa and the synthesis of serosal and blastodermal cuticles. Our findings highlight the adaptive significance of Toll signaling in orchestrating complex developmental processes, underscoring its evolutionary plasticity from a primitive immune response mechanism to a sophisticated regulator of embryonic patterning in insects.", "label": 1}
