{"grounding": "Cell-cell communication is critical for the development and function of multicellular organisms. A crucial means by which cells communicate with one another is physical interactions between receptors on one cell and their ligands on a neighboring cell. Trans ligand:receptor interactions activate the receptor, ultimately leading to changes in the fate of the receptor-expressing cells. Such trans signaling is known to be critical for the functions of cells in the nervous and immune systems, among others. Historically, trans interactions are the primary conceptual framework for understanding cell-cell communication. However, cells often coexpress many receptors and ligands, and a subset of these has been reported to interact in cis and profoundly impact cell functions. Cis interactions likely constitute a fundamental, understudied regulatory mechanism in cell biology. Here, I discuss how cis interactions between membrane receptors and ligands regulate immune cell functions, and I also highlight outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "Membrane receptors and their ligands play pivotal roles in cellular signaling, with their interactions traditionally categorized into cis and trans configurations. This study delves into the less explored cis interactions, where both receptor and ligand are co-expressed on the same cell surface, contrasting with the well-characterized trans interactions involving separate cells. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and experimental data, we explore the mechanisms, regulation, and functional implications of cis interactions in various signaling pathways. Our findings highlight the complexity of receptor-ligand dynamics, revealing that cis interactions can modulate signaling outcomes by competing with or enhancing trans interactions. Furthermore, we discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting cis interactions in diseases characterized by aberrant signaling. This research underscores the importance of considering both cis and trans interactions in the study of membrane receptor signaling, offering new insights into cellular communication and potential avenues for intervention.", "label": 1}
