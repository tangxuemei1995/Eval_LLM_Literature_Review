{"grounding": "Animal tissues are made up of multiple cell types that are increasingly well-characterized, yet our understanding of the core principles that govern tissue organization is still incomplete. This is in part because many observable tissue characteristics, such as cellular composition and spatial patterns, are emergent properties, and as such, they cannot be explained through the knowledge of individual cells alone. Here we propose a complex systems theory perspective to address this fundamental gap in our understanding of tissue biology. We introduce the concept of cell categories, which is based on cell relations rather than cell identity. Based on these notions we then discuss common principles of tissue modularity, introducing compositional, structural, and functional tissue modules. Cell diversity and cell relations provide a basis for a new perspective on the underlying principles of tissue organization in health and disease.", "generated_text": "The study of tissue biology is undergoing a transformative shift, moving beyond the traditional focus on individual cell types to embrace a more holistic understanding of tissue organization and function. This paper explores the emerging paradigm that views tissues as complex systems composed of 'tissue modules'â€”integrated units of cells and extracellular matrix that perform specific functions. By examining the intricate relations between different cell categories and their evolutionary origins, we highlight the importance of self-organization principles in shaping tissue architecture. This new perspective not only enriches our comprehension of tissue biology but also opens novel avenues for research in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and evolutionary studies. Through a synthesis of recent findings, we argue that a deeper understanding of tissue modules and their self-organizing capabilities is crucial for unraveling the complexities of multicellular life.", "label": 1}
