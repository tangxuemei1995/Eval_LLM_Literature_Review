{"grounding": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) decode messenger RNA codons to peptides at the ribosome. The nuclear genome contains many tRNA genes for each amino acid and even each anticodon. Recent evidence indicates that expression of these tRNAs in neurons is regulated, and they are not functionally redundant. When specific tRNA genes are nonfunctional, this results in an imbalance between codon demand and tRNA availability. Furthermore, tRNAs are spliced, processed, and posttranscriptionally modified. Defects in these processes lead to neurological disorders. Finally, mutations in the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) also lead to disease. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs cause syndromic disorders, while dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs lead to peripheral neuropathy, again due to an imbalance between tRNA supply and codon demand. While it is clear that disrupting tRNA biology often leads to neurological disease, additional research is needed to understand the sensitivity of neurons to these changes.", "generated_text": "Transfer RNA (tRNA) plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis, acting as the molecular bridge between mRNA and amino acids. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of tRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the multifaceted roles of tRNA, including its aminoacylation by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, post-transcriptional modifications, and splicing processes, in maintaining neuronal health. Furthermore, we delve into the impact of angiogenin-mediated tRNA cleavage and the activation of the integrated stress response on neuronal function and survival. By synthesizing current evidence, this paper aims to elucidate the complex interplay between tRNA biology and neurological disorders, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the mechanisms underlying tRNA dysregulation could pave the way for novel interventions in the treatment of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.", "label": 1}
