{"grounding": "The uterine lining (endometrium) regenerates repeatedly over the life span as part of its normal physiology. Substantial portions of the endometrium are shed during childbirth (parturition) and, in some species, menstruation, but the tissue is rapidly rebuilt without scarring, rendering it a powerful model of regeneration in mammals. Nonetheless, following some assaults, including medical procedures and infections, the endometrium fails to regenerate and instead forms scars that may interfere with normal endometrial function and contribute to infertility. Thus, the endometrium provides an exceptional platform to answer a central question of regenerative medicine: Why do some systems regenerate while others scar? Here, we review our current understanding of diverse endometrial disruption events in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents, and the associated mechanisms of regenerative success and failure. Elucidating the determinants of these disparate repair processes promises insights into fundamental mechanisms of mammalian regeneration with substantial implications for reproductive health.", "generated_text": "The endometrium undergoes dynamic changes throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and parturition, showcasing remarkable regenerative capabilities. This review explores the mechanisms underlying endometrial regeneration and fibrosis, focusing on the roles of stem cells and the impact of pathological conditions such as Asherman syndrome and intrauterine adhesions. Stem cells within the endometrium are pivotal for its cyclic regeneration and repair post-menstruation, while dysregulation in these processes can lead to fibrosis, impairing fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Asherman syndrome, characterized by intrauterine adhesions, exemplifies the delicate balance between regeneration and fibrosis, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Insights into these processes not only advance our comprehension of endometrial biology but also pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies to treat endometrial disorders, enhancing reproductive health and fertility.", "label": 1}
