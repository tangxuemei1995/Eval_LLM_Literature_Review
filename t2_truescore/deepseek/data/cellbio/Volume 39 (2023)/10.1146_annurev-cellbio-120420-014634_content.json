{"grounding": "The life of eukaryotic cells requires the transport of lipids between membranes, which are separated by the aqueous environment of the cytosol. Vesicle-mediated traffic along the secretory and endocytic pathways and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) cooperate in this transport. Until recently, known LTPs were shown to carry one or a few lipids at a time and were thought to mediate transport by shuttle-like mechanisms. Over the last few years, a new family of LTPs has been discovered that is defined by a repeating Î²-groove (RBG) rod-like structure with a hydrophobic channel running along their entire length. This structure and the localization of these proteins at membrane contact sites suggest a bridge-like mechanism of lipid transport. Mutations in some of these proteins result in neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. Here we review the known properties and well-established or putative physiological roles of these proteins, and we highlight the many questions that remain open about their functions.", "generated_text": "RBG motif bridge-like lipid transport proteins (BLTPs) represent a fascinating class of proteins involved in the intracellular transport of lipids, a process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and membrane integrity. This review focuses on the structural characteristics and functional roles of key BLTP family members, including VPS13, ATG2, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164. These proteins share a conserved RBG (Ras of complex proteins, pleckstrin, and Glycolipid transfer proteins) motif, which is essential for their lipid transport activities. We delve into the mechanisms by which these proteins facilitate lipid transfer between membranes, their involvement in autophagy, and their roles in various cellular processes. Despite significant advances, many questions remain regarding the precise molecular mechanisms of lipid transport, the regulation of BLTP activity, and their interactions with other cellular components. This review highlights these open questions and suggests directions for future research to further elucidate the complex roles of BLTPs in cellular physiology and pathology.", "label": 1}
