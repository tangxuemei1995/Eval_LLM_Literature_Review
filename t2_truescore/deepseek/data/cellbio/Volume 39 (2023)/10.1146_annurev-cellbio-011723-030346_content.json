{"grounding": "Every eukaryotic cell contains two distinct multisubunit protein kinase complexes that each contain a TOR (target of rapamycin) protein as the catalytic subunit. These ensembles, designated TORC1 and TORC2, serve as nutrient and stress sensors, signal integrators, and regulators of cell growth and homeostasis, but they differ in their composition, localization, and function. TORC1, activated on the cytosolic surface of the vacuole (or, in mammalian cells, on the cytosolic surface of the lysosome), promotes biosynthesis and suppresses autophagy. TORC2, located primarily at the plasma membrane (PM), maintains the proper levels and bilayer distribution of all PM components (sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterols, and integral membrane proteins), which are needed for the membrane expansion that accompanies cell growth and division and for combating insults to PM integrity. This review summarizes our current understanding of the assembly, structural features, subcellular distribution, and function and regulation of TORC2, obtained largely through studies conducted with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "generated_text": "The Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TORC2) plays a pivotal role in cellular growth and metabolism by regulating various signaling pathways. In yeast, TORC2 is composed of multiple subunits that orchestrate its function and localization, primarily at the plasma membrane (PM) and endosomes. This study delves into the intricate mechanisms by which TORC2 activity is modulated through its interaction with phosphoinositides and phosphorylation events. Phosphoinositides, key lipid components of the PM, are crucial for the recruitment and stabilization of TORC2 at the membrane, thereby influencing its signaling output. Additionally, phosphorylation of TORC2 subunits emerges as a critical regulatory mechanism, affecting both the complex's localization and its kinase activity. Through a comprehensive analysis of genetic and biochemical data, we uncover the dynamic interplay between TORC2, phosphoinositides, and phosphorylation, shedding light on the complex regulatory network that governs TORC2 function in yeast. This research provides foundational insights into the spatial and temporal control of TORC2 signaling, with implications for understanding cellular homeostasis and disease.", "label": 1}
