{"grounding": "Society is confronted by interconnected threats to ecological sustainability. Among these is the devastation of forests by destructive non-native pathogens and insects introduced through global trade, leading to the loss of critical ecosystem services and a global forest health crisis. We argue that the forest health crisis is a public-good social dilemma and propose a response framework that incorporates principles of collective action. This framework enables scientists to better engage policymakers and empowers the public to advocate for proactive biosecurity and forest health management. Collective action in forest health features broadly inclusive stakeholder engagement to build trust and set goals; accountability for destructive pest introductions; pooled support for weakest-link partners; and inclusion of intrinsic and nonmarket values of forest ecosystems in risk assessment. We provide short-term and longer-term measures that incorporate the above principles to shift the societal and ecological forest health paradigm to a more resilient state.", "generated_text": "The escalating global forest health crisis represents a quintessential public-good social dilemma, necessitating urgent international collective action. This crisis, exacerbated by biological invasions, climate change, and global change, poses significant threats to biodiversity conservation and natural resource sustainability. Biological invasions, in particular, have emerged as a leading cause of forest degradation, disrupting ecosystems and diminishing their capacity to provide essential services. The complexity of these challenges underscores the inadequacy of isolated national efforts and highlights the imperative for a coordinated global response. This paper explores the multifaceted dimensions of the forest health crisis, emphasizing the role of natural resource policy in fostering international cooperation. It argues for the development of integrated strategies that address the root causes of forest degradation, including invasive species management, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation. By framing the crisis as a global public good issue, the paper advocates for collective action mechanisms that transcend national boundaries, ensuring the preservation of forest ecosystems for future generations.", "label": 1}
