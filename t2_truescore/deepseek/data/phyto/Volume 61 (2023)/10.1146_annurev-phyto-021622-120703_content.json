{"grounding": "Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is an emerging tobamovirus. It was first reported in 2015 in Jordan in greenhouse tomatoes and now threatens tomato and pepper crops around the world. ToBRFV is a stable and highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted by mechanical means and via seeds, which enables it to spread locally and over long distances. The ability of ToBRFV to infect tomato plants harboring the commonly deployed Tm resistance genes, as well as pepper plants harboring the L resistance alleles under certain conditions, limits the ability to prevent damage from the virus. The fruit production and quality of ToBRFV-infected tomato and pepper plants can be drastically affected, thus significantly impacting their market value. Herein, we review the current information and discuss the latest areas of research on this virus, which include its discovery and distribution, epidemiology, detection, and prevention and control measures, that could help mitigate the ToBRFV disease pandemic.", "generated_text": "The Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV), a member of the Tobamovirus genus, has emerged as a significant threat to global tomato and pepper production. This highly contagious pathogen is transmitted through seeds, mechanical contact, and contaminated tools, leading to severe economic losses. The virus causes distinctive symptoms, including leaf mottling, fruit discoloration, and deformation, drastically reducing marketability. Despite the implementation of strict hygiene protocols, such as seed disinfection and sanitation measures, ToBRFV continues to spread, highlighting the need for more effective control strategies. Recent research has focused on identifying and developing resistant tomato and pepper varieties through traditional breeding and biotechnological approaches. However, the rapid evolution of the virus poses challenges to the durability of resistance. This review underscores the importance of integrated management practices, combining seed hygiene, cultural controls, and genetic resistance, to mitigate the impact of the ToBRFV pandemic and safeguard the future of tomato and pepper cultivation.", "label": 1}
