{"grounding": "Harvested fruit and vegetables are perishable, subject to desiccation, show increased respiration during ripening, and are colonized by postharvest fungal pathogens. Induced resistance is a strategy to control diseases by eliciting biochemical processes in fruits and vegetables. This is accomplished by modulating the progress of ripening and senescence, which maintains the produce in a state of heightened resistance to decay-causing fungi. Utilization of induced resistance to protect produce has been improved by scientific tools that better characterize physiological changes in plants. Induced resistance slows the decline of innate immunity after harvest and increases the production of defensive responses that directly inhibit plant pathogens. This increase in defense response in fruits and vegetables contributes to higher amounts of phenols and antioxidant compounds, improving both the quality and appearance of the produce. This review summarizes mechanisms and treatments that induce resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables to suppress fungal colonization. Moreover, it highlights the importance of host maturity and stage of ripening as limiting conditions for the improved expression of induced-resistance processes.", "generated_text": "The phenomenon of induced resistance in fruits and vegetables represents a critical host physiological response that significantly limits the development of postharvest diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying induced resistance, focusing on the role of physiological factors such as ripening and maturation delay in enhancing the host's defense capabilities. Through an extensive analysis of recent studies, we explore how these physiological changes can be strategically manipulated to bolster the natural resistance of produce against pathogens. The discussion extends to the implications of induced resistance for postharvest management practices, highlighting its potential to reduce reliance on chemical fungicides and improve the sustainability of fruit and vegetable storage. By integrating findings from diverse research areas, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of induced resistance as a promising approach to mitigating postharvest losses, thereby contributing to food security and the reduction of agricultural waste.", "label": 1}
