{"grounding": "\nPhytophthora capsici is a destructive oomycete pathogen of vegetable, ornamental, and tropical crops. First described by L.H. Leonian in 1922 as a pathogen of pepper in New Mexico, USA, P. capsici is now widespread in temperate and tropical countries alike. Phytophthora capsici is notorious for its capability to evade disease management strategies. High genetic diversity allows P. capsici populations to overcome fungicides and host resistance, the formation of oospores results in long-term persistence in soils, zoospore differentiation in the presence of water increases epidemic potential, and a broad host range maximizes economic losses and limits the effectiveness of crop rotation. The severity of disease caused by P. capsici and management challenges have led to numerous research efforts in the past 100 years. Here, we discuss recent findings regarding the biology, genetic diversity, disease management, fungicide resistance, host resistance, genomics, and effector biology of P. capsici.", "generated_text": "Phytophthora capsici, a devastating oomycete pathogen, has been a significant threat to vegetable production worldwide since its description a century ago. This review highlights recent advancements in understanding the fundamental biology of P. capsici, including its life cycle, genetic diversity, and mechanisms of infection. Additionally, it explores the challenges in disease management posed by the pathogen's ability to develop resistance to fungicides and adapt to various environmental conditions. The integration of traditional and modern approaches, such as genetic resistance breeding, biological control, and precision agriculture, is discussed as a strategy to mitigate the impact of P. capsici on vegetable crops. This synthesis of current knowledge aims to provide a foundation for future research and the development of sustainable management practices to combat this persistent plant pathogen.", "label": 1}
