{"grounding": "Viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic symbionts interact with algae in a variety of ways to cause disease complexes, often shaping marine and freshwater ecosystems. The advent of phyconomy (a.k.a. seaweed agronomy) represents a need for a greater understanding of algal disease interactions, where underestimated cryptic diversity and lack of phycopathological basis are prospective constraints for algal domestication. Here, we highlight the limited yet increasing knowledge of algal pathogen biodiversity and the ecological interaction with their algal hosts. Finally, we discuss how ecology and cultivation experience contribute to and reinforce aquaculture practice, with the potential to reshape biosecurity policies of seaweed cultivation worldwide.", "generated_text": "The study of phycopathology, focusing on algal diseases, has gained renewed interest due to its implications for algal aquaculture, ecology, and biosecurity. This research explores the intricate relationships between algal hosts and their pathogens, shedding light on the ecological dynamics and the potential threats to algal cultivation systems. By integrating algal biology with ecological and biosecurity perspectives, we aim to understand the mechanisms of disease spread and its impact on algal populations. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring and managing algal diseases to safeguard aquatic ecosystems and the burgeoning algal aquaculture industry, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches in addressing these challenges.", "label": 1}
