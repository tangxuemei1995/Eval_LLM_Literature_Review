{"grounding": "The microbiota populating the plant–soil continuum defines an untapped resource for sustainable crop production. The host plant is a driver for the taxonomic composition and function of these microbial communities. In this review, we illustrate how the host genetic determinants of the microbiota have been shaped by plant domestication and crop diversification. We discuss how the heritable component of microbiota recruitment may represent, at least partially, a selection for microbial functions underpinning the growth, development, and health of their host plants and how the magnitude of this heritability is influenced by the environment. We illustrate how host–microbiota interactions can be treated as an external quantitative trait and review recent studies associating crop genetics with microbiota-based quantitative traits. We also explore the results of reductionist approaches, including synthetic microbial communities, to establish causal relationships between microbiota and plant phenotypes. Lastly, we propose strategies to integrate microbiota manipulation into crop selection programs. Although a detailed understanding of when and how heritability for microbiota composition can be deployed for breeding purposes is still lacking, we argue that advances in crop genomics are likely to accelerate wider applications of plant–microbiota interactions in agriculture.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between crops and their associated microbiota plays a pivotal role in plant health, productivity, and resilience to environmental stresses. This study explores the potential of leveraging host genetics to engineer the crop microbiota, focusing on the domestication process, root architecture, and the rhizosphere environment. By analyzing the genetic basis of plant-microbe interactions, we aim to identify key genetic loci that influence microbial community composition and function. Our research highlights the importance of integrating traditional plant breeding techniques with modern genomic tools to select for beneficial microbial traits. We propose that targeted manipulation of the crop microbiota through host genetics can enhance nutrient uptake, disease resistance, and stress tolerance, thereby contributing to sustainable agricultural practices. This approach not only opens new avenues for crop improvement but also underscores the significance of the plant microbiome in the context of global food security. Our findings suggest that a deeper understanding of the genetic factors shaping the crop microbiota is essential for the development of next-generation crops with optimized microbial partnerships.", "label": 1}
