{"grounding": "\nKitaviridae is a family of plant-infecting viruses that have multiple positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic segments. Kitaviruses are assigned into the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, mainly on the basis of the diversity of their genomic organization. Cell-to-cell movement of most kitaviruses is provided by the 30K family of proteins or the binary movement block, considered an alternative movement module among plant viruses. Kitaviruses stand out for producing conspicuously unusual locally restricted infections and showing deficient or nonsystemic movement likely resulting from incompatible or suboptimal interactions with their hosts. Transmission of kitaviruses is mediated by mites of many species of the genus Brevipalpus and at least one species of eriophyids. Kitavirus genomes encode numerous orphan open reading frames but RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the transmembrane helix-containing protein, generically called SP24, typify a close phylogenetic link with arthropod viruses. Kitaviruses infect a large range of host plants and cause diseases of economic concern in crops such as citrus, tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry.", "generated_text": "Kitaviruses represent a unique group of atypical plant viruses that have garnered attention due to their distinctive biological and molecular characteristics. This study delves into the enigmatic world of Kitaviruses, focusing on the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, which are primarily associated with nonsystemic diseases in plants, notably citrus leprosis. These viruses are transmitted by Brevipalpus mites, adding a layer of complexity to their epidemiology and control. The research highlights the evolutionary relationship between Kitaviruses and the recently discovered Negeviruses, shedding light on their shared ancestry and divergent paths. Through comprehensive genomic analysis and field studies, this paper aims to unravel the mechanisms underlying the nonsystemic infection patterns of Kitaviruses, their interaction with host plants and vectors, and the implications for disease management. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of these atypical plant viruses and open new avenues for research into their biology, ecology, and potential control strategies.", "label": 1}
