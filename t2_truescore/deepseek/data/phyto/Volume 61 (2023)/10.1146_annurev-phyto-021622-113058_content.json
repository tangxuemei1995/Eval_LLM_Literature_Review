{"grounding": "Plant-parasitic nematodes are one of the most insidious pests limiting agricultural production, parasitizing mostly belowground and occasionally aboveground plant parts. They are an important and underestimated component of the estimated 30% yield loss inflicted on crops globally by biotic constraints. Nematode damage is intensified by interactions with biotic and abiotic factors constraints: soilborne pathogens, soil fertility degradation, reduced soil biodiversity, climate variability, and policies influencing the development of improved management options. This review focuses on the following topics: (a) biotic and abiotic constraints, (b) modification of production systems, (c) agricultural policies, (d) the microbiome, (e) genetic solutions, and (f) remote sensing. Improving integrated nematode management (INM) across all scales of agricultural production and along the Global Northâ€“Global South divide, where inequalities influence access to technology, is discussed. The importance of the integration of technological development in INM is critical to improving food security and human well-being in the future.", "generated_text": "In the face of global agricultural challenges, Integrated Nematode Management (INM) emerges as a pivotal strategy to safeguard root health and ensure sustainable crop production. This review delves into the multifaceted approach of INM, highlighting the integration of advanced technologies such as genome editing and genetics, alongside traditional practices, to combat nematode infestations effectively. The role of the microbiome in enhancing plant resilience and the potential of remote sensing for early detection of nematode threats are explored. Furthermore, the paper examines the constraints and policy frameworks that shape the adoption of INM practices globally. By synthesizing current research and technological advancements, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the processes and technologies that will drive the future of nematode management, ensuring food security in a world in transition.", "label": 1}
