{"grounding": "Membrane trafficking pathways play a prominent role in plant immunity. The endomembrane transport system coordinates membrane-bound cellular organelles to ensure that immunological components are utilized effectively during pathogen resistance. Adapted pathogens and pests have evolved to interfere with aspects of membrane transport systems to subvert plant immunity. To do this, they secrete virulence factors known as effectors, many of which converge on host membrane trafficking routes. The emerging paradigm is that effectors redundantly target every step of membrane trafficking from vesicle budding to trafficking and membrane fusion. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms adopted by plant pathogens to reprogram host plant vesicle trafficking, providing examples of effector-targeted transport pathways and highlighting key questions for the field to answer moving forward.", "generated_text": "Pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to subvert plant immune responses, with a particular focus on manipulating host membrane trafficking pathways. This review explores the mechanisms by which microbial effectors interfere with plant endomembrane trafficking, autophagy, and protein secretion to promote infection. Special attention is given to the role of the haustorium, a specialized infection structure, in redirecting host resources. By hijacking these critical cellular processes, pathogens effectively suppress plant immunity and establish a conducive environment for their proliferation. Understanding these interactions not only sheds light on the complex interplay between plants and pathogens but also opens new avenues for developing targeted strategies to enhance plant resistance against infectious diseases.", "label": 0}
