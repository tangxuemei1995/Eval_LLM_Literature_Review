{"grounding": "The plant immune system perceives pathogens to trigger defense responses. In turn, pathogens secrete effector molecules to subvert these defense responses. The initiation and maintenance of defense responses involve not only de novo synthesis of regulatory proteins and enzymes but also their regulated degradation. The latter is achieved through protein degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). The UPS regulates all stages of immunity, from the perception of the pathogen to the execution of the response, and, therefore, constitutes an ideal candidate for microbial manipulation of the host. Pathogen effector molecules interfere with the plant UPS through several mechanisms. This includes hijacking general UPS functions or perturbing its ability to degrade specific targets. In this review, we describe how the UPS regulates different immunity-related processes and how pathogens subvert this to promote disease.", "generated_text": "The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) plays a pivotal role in maintaining proteostasis and regulating numerous cellular processes in plants, including immune responses. Pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate the UPS to their advantage, often through the secretion of effector proteins that interfere with ubiquitination processes or proteasomal degradation. This review explores the intricate interplay between the plant UPS and microbial pathogens, highlighting how pathogens exploit the UPS to suppress plant immunity and promote infection. We discuss the mechanisms by which microbial effectors target the UPS, including the modulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes, and the implications for plant-pathogen interactions. Understanding these microbial manipulation strategies offers insights into the development of novel disease resistance mechanisms in plants, potentially leading to the engineering of crops with enhanced immunity against a broad spectrum of pathogens.", "label": 0}
