{"grounding": "Understanding the coevolutionary history of plants, pathogens, and disease resistance is vital for plant pathology. Here, I review Francis O. Holmes's work with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) framed by the foundational work of Nikolai Vavilov on the geographic centers of origin of plants and crop wild relatives (CWRs) and T. Harper Goodspeed's taxonomy of the genus Nicotiana. Holmes developed a hypothesis that the origin of host resistance to viruses was due to coevolution of both at a geographic center. In the 1950s, Holmes proved that genetic resistance to TMV, especially dominant R-genes, was centered in South America for Nicotiana and other solanaceous plants, including Capsicum, potato, and tomato. One seeming exception was eggplant (Solanum melongena). Not until the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s and recent advances in evolutionary taxonomy did it become evident that northeast Africa was the home of eggplant CWRs, far from Holmes's geographic center for TMV–R-gene coevolution. Unbeknownst to most plant pathologists, Holmes's ideas predated those of H.H. Flor, including experimental proof of the gene-for-gene interaction, identification of R-genes, and deployment of dominant host genes to protect crop plants from virus-associated yield losses.", "generated_text": "The intricate dance between viruses and their plant hosts has shaped the evolutionary trajectories of both, particularly within geographic centers of plant diversity. This study delves into the coevolutionary dynamics of host–pathogen interactions, focusing on the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) as a case study within these biodiversity hotspots. By integrating insights from host–microbe interactions and the geological movements dictated by plate tectonics, we explore how the historical and ongoing coevolutionary pressures have influenced the development of host resistance mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that the centers of crop diversity not only serve as reservoirs of genetic variation but also as arenas for intense evolutionary arms races between plants and pathogens. The findings underscore the importance of understanding these coevolutionary processes for the conservation of plant genetic resources and the development of sustainable agricultural practices. This research contributes to the broader discourse on the role of coevolution in shaping the resilience of ecosystems to emerging viral threats, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to tackle the challenges posed by plant viruses in a changing world.", "label": 0}
