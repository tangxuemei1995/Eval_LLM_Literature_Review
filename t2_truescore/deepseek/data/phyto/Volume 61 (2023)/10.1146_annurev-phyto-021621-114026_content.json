{"grounding": "Plant bacterial pathogens rely on host-derived signals to coordinate the deployment of virulence factors required for infection. In this review, I describe how diverse plant-pathogenic bacteria detect and respond to plant-derived metabolic signals for the purpose of virulence gene regulation. I highlight examples of how pathogens perceive host metabolites through membrane-localized receptors as well as intracellular response mechanisms. Furthermore, I describe how individual strains may coordinate their virulence using multiple distinct host metabolic signals, and how plant signals may positively or negatively regulate virulence responses. I also describe how plant defenses may interfere with the perception of host metabolites as a means to dampen pathogen virulence. The emerging picture is that recognition of host metabolic signals for the purpose of virulence gene regulation represents an important primary layer of interaction between pathogenic bacteria and host plants that shapes infection outcomes.", "generated_text": "Plant-pathogenic bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to exploit host metabolites as signals to regulate virulence. This study delves into the intricate interplay between host-derived metabolic signals and bacterial virulence factors, focusing on the role of these signals in modulating the type III secretion system (T3SS) and effector proteins. We explore how inter-kingdom signaling facilitates the adaptation of pathogens to the host environment, enabling them to suppress plant immunity and promote infection. By integrating findings from recent studies, we highlight the significance of metabolic signaling in the co-evolutionary arms race between plants and pathogens. This review underscores the potential of targeting host-pathogen metabolic interactions for developing novel strategies to control plant diseases, offering insights into the complex regulatory networks that govern bacterial virulence and host immunity.", "label": 1}
