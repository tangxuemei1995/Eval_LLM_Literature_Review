{"grounding": "Plant disease control requires novel approaches to mitigate the spread of and losses caused by current, emerging, and re-emerging diseases and to adapt plant protection to global climate change and the restrictions on the use of conventional pesticides. Currently, disease management relies mainly on biopesticides, which are required for the sustainable use of plant-protection products. Functional peptides are candidate biopesticides because they originate from living organisms or are synthetic analogs and provide novel mechanisms of action against plant pathogens. Hundreds of compounds exist that cover an extensive range of activities against viruses, bacteria and phytoplasmas, fungi and oomycetes, and nematodes. Natural sources, chemical synthesis, and biotechnological platforms may provide peptides at large scale for the industry and growers. The main challenges for their use in plant disease protection are (a) the requirement of stability in the plant environment and counteracting resistance in pathogen populations, (b) the need to develop suitable formulations to increase their shelf life and methods of application, (c) the selection of compounds with acceptable toxicological profiles, and (d) the high cost of production for agricultural purposes. In the near future, it is expected that several functional peptides will be commercially available for plant disease control, but more effort is needed to validate their efficacy at the field level and fulfill the requirements of the regulatory framework.", "generated_text": "The escalating demand for sustainable agricultural practices has spurred interest in the development of novel biopesticides, with functional peptides emerging as a promising avenue for plant disease control. This review delves into the mechanisms of action by which functional peptides combat plant pathogens, highlighting their ability to disrupt microbial cell membranes, interfere with essential cellular processes, and modulate plant immune responses. Sourced from natural reservoirs such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, these peptides offer an eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides, reducing the risk of resistance development and environmental contamination. The production of functional peptides, through both natural extraction and synthetic biology approaches, is explored, underscoring the advancements in peptide synthesis and modification techniques that enhance their stability, efficacy, and specificity. The potential of functional peptides as novel biopesticides is further discussed, with emphasis on their application in integrated pest management strategies to safeguard crop health and productivity. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of functional peptides in the quest for sustainable and effective plant disease control solutions, paving the way for their broader adoption in agriculture.", "label": 1}
