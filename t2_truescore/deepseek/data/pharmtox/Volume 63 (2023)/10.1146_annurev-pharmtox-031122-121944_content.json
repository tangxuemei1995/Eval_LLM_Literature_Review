{"grounding": "The actions of estrogens and related estrogenic molecules are complex and multifaceted in both sexes. A wide array of natural, synthetic, and therapeutic molecules target pathways that produce and respond to estrogens. Multiple receptors promulgate these responses, including the classical estrogen receptors of the nuclear hormone receptor family (estrogen receptors α and β), which function largely as ligand-activated transcription factors, and the 7-transmembrane G protein–coupled estrogen receptor, GPER, which activates a diverse array of signaling pathways. The pharmacology and functional roles of GPER in physiology and disease reveal important roles in responses to both natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds in numerous physiological systems. These functions have implications in the treatment of myriad disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. This review focuses on the complex pharmacology of GPER and summarizes major physiological functions of GPER and the therapeutic implications and ongoing applications of GPER-targeted compounds.", "generated_text": "The G protein–coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has emerged as a pivotal mediator of estrogen signaling, distinct from the classical nuclear estrogen receptors. This review delves into the molecular pharmacology of GPER, elucidating its role in various physiological and pathological processes. GPER's involvement in cancer progression, cardiovascular health, endocrine regulation, immune responses, and metabolic control underscores its therapeutic potential. In cancer, GPER influences cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis, presenting a novel target for intervention. Its cardioprotective effects, mediated through vasodilation and anti-inflammatory actions, highlight its significance in cardiovascular diseases. GPER also modulates endocrine functions, impacting hormone-sensitive conditions. Furthermore, its role in immunity and metabolism opens avenues for addressing autoimmune disorders and metabolic syndromes. This comprehensive analysis underscores the therapeutic applications of GPER modulation, advocating for further research to harness its full potential in treating diverse diseases.", "label": 1}
