{"grounding": "Ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cellular metabolism to electrical activity in multiple tissues; their unique assembly as four Kir6 pore-forming subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits has resulted in a large armory of selective channel opener and inhibitor drugs. The spectrum of monogenic pathologies that result from gain- or loss-of-function mutations in these channels, and the potential for therapeutic correction of these pathologies, is now clear. However, while available drugs can be effective treatments for specific pathologies, cross-reactivity with the other Kir6 or SUR subfamily members can result in drug-induced versions of each pathology and may limit therapeutic usefulness. This review discusses the background to KATP channel physiology, pathology, and pharmacology and considers the potential for more specific or effective therapeutic agents.", "generated_text": "The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, composed of Kir6.x subunits (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) and sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1 and SUR2), play a pivotal role in coupling cellular metabolism to electrical activity. Mutations in these subunits are implicated in a spectrum of KATP-dependent pathologies, including congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant√∫ syndrome. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders and highlights the potential of personalized therapeutics tailored to the specific genetic and functional alterations in KATP channels. Advances in understanding the structure-function relationship of KATP channels have paved the way for the development of targeted therapies, offering hope for improved management of these conditions. By focusing on the unique molecular signatures of each pathology, personalized medicine approaches promise to enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects, marking a significant step forward in the treatment of KATP-dependent diseases.", "label": 1}
