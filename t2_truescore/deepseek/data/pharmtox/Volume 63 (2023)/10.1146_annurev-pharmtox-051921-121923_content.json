{"grounding": "Phosphatases and kinases maintain an equilibrium of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins, respectively, that are required for critical cellular functions. Imbalance in this equilibrium or irregularity in their function causes unfavorable cellular effects that have been implicated in the development of numerous diseases. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) catalyze the dephosphorylation of protein substrates on tyrosine residues, and their involvement in cell signaling and diseases such as cancer and inflammatory and metabolic diseases has made them attractive therapeutic targets. However, PTPs have proved challenging in therapeutics development, garnering them the unfavorable reputation of being undruggable. Nonetheless, great strides have been made toward the inhibition of PTPs over the past decade. Here, we discuss the advancement in small-molecule inhibition for the PTP subfamily known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs). We review strategies and inhibitor discovery tools that have proven successful for small-molecule inhibition of the MKPs and discuss what the future of MKP inhibition potentially might yield.", "generated_text": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases (MKPs) play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell signaling pathways by dephosphorylating and inactivating Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs). Despite their critical function in cellular processes and disease states, MKPs have historically been considered 'undruggable' due to the challenges associated with targeting protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases. However, recent advancements in understanding the structural biology of MKPs, including the identification of allosteric sites, have opened new avenues for the development of small molecule inhibitors. This review explores the potential of targeting MKPs as a therapeutic strategy, highlighting the progress in the design and discovery of inhibitors that modulate MKP activity. By focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying MKP function and the innovative approaches to overcome the hurdles of druggability, this article underscores the emerging opportunities for MKP-targeted therapies in the treatment of diseases characterized by dysregulated MAPK signaling.", "label": 0}
