{"grounding": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are endogenous lipid mediators that are synthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during the acute phase or resolution phase of inflammation. Synthetic SPMs possess broad safety profiles and exhibit potent actions in resolving inflammation in preclinical models. Accumulating evidence in the past decade has demonstrated powerful analgesia of exogenous SPMs in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain. Furthermore, endogenous SPMs are produced by sham surgery and neuromodulation (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation). SPMs produce their beneficial actions through multiple G proteinâ€“coupled receptors, expressed by immune cells, glial cells, and neurons. Notably, loss of SPM receptors impairs the resolution of pain. I also highlight the emerging role of SPMs in the control of itch. Pharmacological targeting of SPMs or SPM receptors has the potential to lead to novel therapeutics for pain and itch as emerging approaches in resolution pharmacology.", "generated_text": "Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, play a pivotal role in the resolution of inflammation and pain. This review explores the emerging field of resolution pharmacology, focusing on the therapeutic potential of SPMs, including resolvins and neuroprotectin, in modulating neuroimmune interactions to control pain and itch. SPMs exert their effects by targeting nociceptive sensory neurons and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, key players in the transduction of pain and itch signals. By promoting the resolution of inflammation without compromising the host's defense mechanisms, SPMs offer a novel approach to managing chronic pain and itch conditions. This paper highlights the mechanisms through which SPMs modulate neuroimmune pathways, their interaction with TRP channels, and their potential as therapeutic agents in resolution pharmacology, providing insights into future directions for research and clinical applications.", "label": 1}
