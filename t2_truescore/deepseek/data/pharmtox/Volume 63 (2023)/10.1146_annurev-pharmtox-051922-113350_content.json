{"grounding": "Early human life is considered a critical window of susceptibility to external exposures. Infants are exposed to a multitude of environmental factors, collectively referred to as the exposome. The chemical exposome can be summarized as the sum of all xenobiotics that humans are exposed to throughout a lifetime. We review different exposure classes and routes that impact fetal and infant metabolism and the potential toxicological role of mixture effects. We also discuss the progress in human biomonitoring and present possiblemodels for studying maternalâ€“fetal transfer. Data gaps on prenatal and infant exposure to xenobiotic mixtures are identified and include natural biotoxins, in addition to commonly reported synthetic toxicants, to obtain a more holistic assessment of the chemical exposome. We highlight the lack of large-scale studies covering a broad range of xenobiotics. Several recommendations to advance our understanding of the early-life chemical exposome and the subsequent impact on health outcomes are proposed.", "generated_text": "The concept of the chemical exposome encompasses the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards, playing a crucial role in human health and disease. This review focuses on understanding the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood, a critical window of susceptibility. We explore the pathways through which xenobiotics and natural contaminants can impact prenatal development, with a particular emphasis on the role of the placenta in modulating exposure. Human biomonitoring studies are highlighted as essential tools for assessing the presence and concentration of these chemicals in biological samples, providing insights into exposure levels and potential health risks. The review underscores the importance of integrating chemical exposome data with epidemiological studies to better understand the complex interactions between environmental exposures and developmental outcomes. By synthesizing current knowledge, this paper aims to inform future research directions and public health strategies aimed at reducing harmful exposures during these vulnerable life stages.", "label": 1}
