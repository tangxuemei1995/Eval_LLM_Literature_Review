{"grounding": "With the worldwide increase in life span, surgical patients are becoming older and have a greater propensity for postoperative cognitive impairment, either new onset or through deterioration of an existing condition; in both conditions, knowledge of the patient's preoperative cognitive function and postoperative cognitive trajectory is imperative. We describe the clinical utility of a tablet-based technique for rapid assessment of the memory and attentiveness domains required for executive function. The pathogenic mechanisms for perioperative neurocognitive disorders have been investigated in animal models in which excessive and/or prolonged postoperative neuroinflammation has emerged as a likely contender. The cellular and molecular species involved in postoperative neuroinflammation are the putative targets for future therapeutic interventions that are efficacious and do not interfere with the surgical patient's healing process.", "generated_text": "Age-related perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), including postoperative delirium and long-term cognitive dysfunction, represent significant challenges in perioperative brain health. This review explores experimental models that mimic the complex pathophysiology of PNDs, focusing on neuroinflammation as a central mechanism. We discuss the utility of these models in identifying druggable targets that could mitigate cognitive decline. Furthermore, we evaluate current cognitive assessment tools and their role in early detection and monitoring of PNDs. The integration of these tools into care pathways is crucial for improving outcomes in elderly surgical patients. By synthesizing findings from preclinical and clinical studies, this review aims to highlight promising therapeutic strategies and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to perioperative brain health.", "label": 1}
