{"grounding": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a chemically diverse group of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) that target the endocannabinoid system, triggering a plethora of actions (e.g., elevated mood sensation, relaxation, appetite stimulation) that resemble, but are more intense than, those induced by cannabis. Although some of these effects have been explored for therapeutic applications, anticipated stronger psychoactive effects than cannabis and reduced risk perception have increased the recreational use of SCs, which have dominated the NPS market in the United States and Europe over the past decade. However, rising SC-related intoxications and deaths represent a major public health concern and embody a major challenge for policy makers.\nHere, we review the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs. A thorough characterization of SCsâ€™ pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics is important to better understand the main mechanisms underlying acute and chronic effects of SCs, interpret the clinical/pathological findings related to SC use, and improve SC risk awareness.", "generated_text": "Synthetic cannabinoids, often marketed as 'Spice' or 'K2', represent a significant class of new psychoactive substances that have emerged as popular alternatives to cannabis. These designer drugs, designed to mimic the effects of natural cannabinoids, interact with the endocannabinoid system, leading to a wide range of pharmacological and toxicological effects. Despite their structural similarity to THC, the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids exhibit higher potency and efficacy at cannabinoid receptors, contributing to their unpredictable and often severe adverse effects. This overview aims to explore the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the effects of synthetic cannabinoids, their role in substance use disorders, and the challenges they pose to public health and regulatory bodies. By synthesizing current research, this paper highlights the urgent need for comprehensive studies to better understand the risks associated with synthetic cannabinoid use and to develop effective strategies for prevention and treatment.", "label": 1}
