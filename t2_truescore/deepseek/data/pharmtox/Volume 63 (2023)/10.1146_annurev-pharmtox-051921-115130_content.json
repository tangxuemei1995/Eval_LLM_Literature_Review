{"grounding": "Apoptosis is central for the maintenance of health. In the immune system, apoptosis guarantees proper development of immune cells and shutdown of immune reactions by the coordinated elimination of activated immune cells. Limitation of the life span of granulocytes is important, as overactivation of these cells is associated with chronic inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Consequently, targeted induction of granulocyte apoptosis may be beneficial in the course of respective immune disorders. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids and monoclonal antibodies against IL-5RÎ± exert their function in part by triggering eosinophil apoptosis. Agonistic antibodies targeting Siglec-8 or death receptors are tested (pre)clinically. Moreover, a new class of inhibitors targeting antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins shows great promise for anticancer treatments. Because of their specificity and tolerable side effects, these so-called BH3 mimetics may be worthwhile to evaluate in inflammatory disorders. Here, we review past and recent data on pharmacological apoptosis induction of granulocytes and highlight respective therapeutic potential.", "generated_text": "Granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, play pivotal roles in the immune response but can also contribute to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The pharmacological induction of granulocyte cell death, particularly through apoptosis, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate these adverse effects. This approach aims to selectively target and eliminate overactive or dysregulated granulocytes without compromising the overall immune function. Recent advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying granulocyte apoptosis have facilitated the development of targeted pharmacological agents. These agents can modulate key apoptotic pathways, such as the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, to induce cell death in a controlled manner. This review highlights the potential of pharmacological induction of granulocyte apoptosis as a therapeutic intervention, discusses the challenges associated with this strategy, and explores future directions for research in this field. The ultimate goal is to develop safe and effective treatments for diseases characterized by granulocyte-mediated tissue damage.", "label": 1}
