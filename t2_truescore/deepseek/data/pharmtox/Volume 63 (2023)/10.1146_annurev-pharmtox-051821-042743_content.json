{"grounding": "Chronic diseases that affect our society are made more complex by comorbidities and are poorly managed by the current pharmacology. While all present inflammatory etiopathogeneses, there is an unmet need for better clinical management of these diseases and their multiple symptoms. We discuss here an innovative approach based on the biology of the resolution of inflammation. Studying endogenous pro-resolving peptide and lipid mediators, how they are formed, and which target they interact with, can offer innovative options through augmenting the expression or function of pro-resolving pathways or mimicking their actions with novel targeted molecules. In all cases, resolution offers innovation for the treatment of the primary cause of a given disease and/or for the management of its comorbidities, ultimately improving patient quality of life. By implementing resolution pharmacology, we harness the whole physiology of inflammation, with the potential to bring a marked change in the management of inflammatory conditions.", "generated_text": "Inflammation is a complex biological response to harmful stimuli, and its resolution is crucial for tissue homeostasis and the prevention of chronic diseases. Recent advances in resolution pharmacology have highlighted the therapeutic potential of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and annexin A1 peptides in promoting the resolution of inflammation. SPMs, including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, play pivotal roles in orchestrating the termination of inflammatory responses and facilitating tissue repair. Similarly, annexin A1, a glucocorticoid-regulated protein, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects through its interaction with formyl peptide receptors. This review focuses on the emerging roles of SPMs and annexin A1 peptides in resolution pharmacology, emphasizing their mechanisms of action and therapeutic innovation in inflammatory diseases. By harnessing the pro-resolving properties of these mediators, novel therapeutic strategies can be developed to enhance the resolution of inflammation, offering new avenues for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions.", "label": 1}
