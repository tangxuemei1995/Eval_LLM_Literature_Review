{"grounding": "Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and particulate matter, with adsorbed organic and inorganic contaminants, to which exposure is lifelong. Epidemiological studies increasingly associate air pollution with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, findings supported by experimental animal models. This breadth of neurotoxicity across these central nervous system diseases and disorders likely reflects shared vulnerability of their inflammatory and oxidative stressâ€“based mechanisms and a corresponding ability to produce brain metal dyshomeo-stasis. Future research to define the responsible contaminants of air pollution underlying this neurotoxicity is critical to understanding mechanisms of these diseases and disorders and protecting public health.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the neurotoxic effects of air pollution, focusing on ultrafine particles (UFPs) and PM2.5, across different stages of life. Exposure to these pollutants has been linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders in children and neurodegenerative diseases in adults. The research explores the mechanisms by which air pollution induces brain metal dyshomeostasis, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuronal damage. By reviewing epidemiological and toxicological studies, this paper highlights the critical need for public health interventions to mitigate air pollution exposure and protect vulnerable populations. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the life-span impacts of air pollution on brain health to inform preventive strategies and therapeutic approaches.", "label": 0}
