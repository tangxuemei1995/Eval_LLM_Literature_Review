{"grounding": "Modern antiretroviral therapy safely, potently, and durably suppresses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that, if left untreated, predictably causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which has been responsible for tens of millions of deaths globally since it was described in 1981. In one of the most extraordinary medical success stories in modern times, a combination of pioneering basic science, innovative drug development, and ambitious public health programming resulted in access to lifesaving, safe drugs, taken as an oral tablet daily, for most of the world. However, substantial challenges remain in the fields of prevention, timely access to diagnosis, and treatment, especially in pediatric and adolescent patients. As HIV-positive adults age, treating their comorbidities will require understanding the course of different chronic diseases complicated by HIV-related and antiretroviral toxicities and finding potential treatments. Finally, new long-acting antiretrovirals on the horizon promise exciting new options in both the prevention and treatment fields.", "generated_text": "The global fight against HIV/AIDS has seen significant progress with the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet achieving universal treatment remains a formidable challenge. This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap towards universal antiretroviral treatment, focusing on the 90-90-90 targets set by UNAIDS: 90% of people living with HIV knowing their status, 90% of diagnosed individuals receiving sustained ART, and 90% of those on ART achieving viral suppression. We delve into the critical role of antiretrovirals in immune reconstitution and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment initiation. Strategies to overcome barriers such as stigma, healthcare access, and medication adherence are discussed, alongside the need for innovative financing mechanisms and strengthened health systems. The paper concludes with a call for global solidarity and sustained political commitment to ensure that the benefits of ART reach all individuals affected by HIV, moving us closer to ending the AIDS epidemic.", "label": 0}
