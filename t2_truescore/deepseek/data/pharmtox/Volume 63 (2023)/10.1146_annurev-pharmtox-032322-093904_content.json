{"grounding": "The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, which comprises 22 structurally related proteins, plays diverse roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and metabolism. Among them, two classical members (FGF1 and FGF4) and two endocrine members (FGF19 and FGF21) are important regulators of whole-body energy homeostasis, glucose/lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of these FGFs for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Several genetically engineered FGF19 and FGF21 analogs with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties have been developed and progressed into various stages of clinical trials. These FGF analogs are effective in alleviating hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients, whereas their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects are mildand vary greatly in different clinical trials. This review summarizes recent advances in biopharmaceutical development of FGF-based therapies against obesity-related metabolic complications, highlights major challenges in clinical implementation, and discusses possible strategies to overcome these hurdles.", "generated_text": "Obesity-related metabolic complications, including type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases, pose significant health challenges worldwide. Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) have emerged as promising therapeutic targets due to their critical roles in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. This review explores the potential of FGF-based pharmacotherapies, focusing on FGF19, FGF21, and FGF1 analogs, as well as agonistic antibodies targeting FGF receptors, in ameliorating obesity-induced metabolic dysfunctions. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these protein therapeutics in improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic steatosis, and promoting weight loss. However, challenges such as optimizing pharmacokinetics, minimizing off-target effects, and ensuring long-term safety remain. Advances in protein engineering and delivery systems are expected to enhance the therapeutic potential of FGF-based interventions. This paper highlights the current state of research, discusses the mechanisms of action, and outlines future directions for developing effective FGF-based treatments for obesity-related metabolic complications.", "label": 1}
