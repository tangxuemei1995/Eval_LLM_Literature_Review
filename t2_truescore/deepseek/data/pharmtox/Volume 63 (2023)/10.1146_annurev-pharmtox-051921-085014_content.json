{"grounding": "Leukotrienes are potent immune-regulating lipid mediators with patho-genic roles in inflammatory and allergic diseases, particularly asthma. These autacoids also contribute to low-grade inflammation, a hallmark of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, metabolic, and tumor diseases. Biosynthesis of leukotrienes involves release and oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid and proceeds via a set of cytosolic and integral membrane enzymes that are typically expressed by cells of the innate immune system. In activated cells, these enzymes traffic and assemble at the endoplasmic and perinuclear membrane, together comprising a biosynthetic complex. Here we describe recent advances in our molecular understanding of the protein components of the leukotriene-synthesizing enzyme machinery and also briefly touch upon the leukotriene receptors. Moreover, we discuss emerging opportunities for pharmacological intervention and development of new therapeutics.", "generated_text": "Leukotrienes are potent lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid, playing pivotal roles in inflammation and the pathogenesis of various endemic diseases. The biosynthesis of leukotrienes is catalyzed by a series of enzymes, including 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase, whose structures have been elucidated through advanced crystallographic techniques. Understanding the three-dimensional architectures of these enzymes provides critical insights into their catalytic mechanisms and regulatory features. This knowledge has paved the way for structure-based drug design, aiming to develop novel therapeutics that can selectively inhibit leukotriene biosynthesis. Such inhibitors hold promise for treating inflammatory diseases and conditions exacerbated by leukotrienes, offering a targeted approach to mitigate inflammation and its associated pathologies. This review highlights recent advancements in the structural biology of leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes and the development of new therapeutic agents targeting this pathway.", "label": 1}
