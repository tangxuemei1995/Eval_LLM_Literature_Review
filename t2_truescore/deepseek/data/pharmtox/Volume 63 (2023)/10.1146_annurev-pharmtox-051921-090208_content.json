{"grounding": "The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are found in seafood, supplements, and concentrated pharmaceutical preparations. Prospective cohort studies demonstrate an association between higher intakes of EPA+DHA or higher levels of EPA and DHA in the body and lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and of cardiovascular mortality in the general population. The cardioprotective effect of EPA and DHA is due to the beneficial modulation of a number of risk factors for CVD. Some large trials support the use of EPA+DHA (or EPA alone) in high-risk patients, although the evidence is inconsistent. This review presents key studies of EPA and DHA in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD, briefly describes potential mechanisms of action, and discusses recently published RCTs and meta-analyses. Potential adverse aspects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in relation to CVD are discussed.", "generated_text": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC omega-3 PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their role in cardiovascular health. Found abundantly in fish oil, these fatty acids are known to exert beneficial effects on heart disease risk factors, including reducing triglycerides, blood pressure, and inflammation. However, the evidence regarding their impact on cardiovascular outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke remains mixed. While some studies suggest a significant reduction in cardiovascular events with LC omega-3 PUFA supplementation, others report minimal or no benefit. This discrepancy may be attributed to variations in study design, population characteristics, and dosage. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects of high-dose omega-3 supplementation, including increased bleeding risk and interactions with medications. This review aims to critically evaluate the pros and cons of LC omega-3 PUFAs in cardiovascular health, providing a balanced perspective on their therapeutic potential and limitations.", "label": 1}
