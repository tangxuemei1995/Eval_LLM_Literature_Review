{"grounding": "Antiplatelet therapy is used in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Clopidogrel is the most widely used antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitor in clinical practice. Genetic variation in CYP2C19 may influence its enzymatic activity, resulting in individuals who are carriers of loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles and thus have reduced active clopidogrel metabolites, high on-treatment platelet reactivity, and increased ischemic risk. Prospective studies have examined the utility of CYP2C19 genetic testing to guide antiplatelet therapy, and more recently published meta-analyses suggest that pharmacogenetics represents a key treatment strategy to individualize antiplatelet therapy. Rapid genetic tests, including bedside genotyping platforms that are validated and have high reproducibility, are available to guide selection of P2Y12 inhibitors in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the background and rationale for the role of a guided antiplatelet approach to enhance patient care.", "generated_text": "The field of pharmacogenetics has significantly advanced the understanding of individual variability in response to antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on the role of pharmacogenomics in guiding antiplatelet therapy, with a special emphasis on the CYP2C19 gene, which encodes a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of clopidogrel, a widely used antiplatelet agent. Variants in the CYP2C19 gene have been associated with altered drug metabolism, leading to variability in therapeutic efficacy and risk of adverse events. The integration of pharmacogenetic testing into clinical practice offers a promising approach to precision medicine, enabling the selection of optimal antiplatelet therapy tailored to an individual's genetic makeup. This review highlights the current evidence, challenges, and future directions in the pharmacogenetics of antiplatelet therapy, underscoring its potential to improve patient outcomes through personalized treatment strategies.", "label": 1}
