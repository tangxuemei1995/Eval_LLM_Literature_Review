{"grounding": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to poor functional outcomes. Methods for assessment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are now well established. In addition, there has been increasing appreciation in recent years of the additional role of social cognitive impairment in driving functional outcomes and of the contributions of sensory-level dysfunction to higher-order impairments. At the neurochemical level, acute administration of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists reproduces the pattern of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia, encouraging the development of treatments targeted at both NMDAR and its interactome. At the local-circuit level, an auditory neurophysiological measure, mismatch negativity, has emerged both as a veridical index of NMDAR dysfunction and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in schizophrenia and as a critical biomarker for early-stage translational drug development. Although no compounds have yet been approved for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, several candidates are showing promise in early-phase testing.", "generated_text": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia, significantly impacting patients' functional outcomes and quality of life. This review explores the pathophysiology underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, focusing on the roles of glutamate neurotransmission and NMDA receptor dysfunction. Evidence suggests that abnormalities in the glutamatergic system, particularly at NMDA receptors, contribute to the cognitive symptoms observed in schizophrenia. Additionally, the review examines the potential of mismatch negativity (MMN), an event-related potential, as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. The interplay between dopamine and glutamate systems is also discussed, highlighting how dysregulation in these neurotransmitter systems may lead to cognitive impairments. Finally, current and emerging treatment strategies targeting these pathophysiological mechanisms are reviewed, including pharmacological interventions aimed at modulating glutamatergic and dopaminergic activity. The findings underscore the importance of a multifaceted approach to understanding and treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, with the goal of improving patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
