{"grounding": "In ligand bias different agonist drugs are thought to produce distinct signaling outputs when activating the same receptor. If these signaling outputs mediate therapeutic versus adverse drug effects, then agonists that selectively activate the therapeutic signaling pathway would be extremely beneficial. It has long been thought that μ-opioid receptor agonists that selectively activate G protein– over β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways would produce effective analgesia without the adverse effects such as respiratory depression. However, more recent data indicate that most of the therapeutic and adverse effects of agonist-induced activation of the μ-opioid receptor are actually mediated by the G protein–dependent signaling pathway, and that a number of drugs described as G protein biased in fact may not be biased, but instead may be low-intrinsic-efficacy agonists. In this review we discuss the current state of the field of bias at the μ-opioid receptor and other opioid receptor subtypes.", "generated_text": "Biased agonism at opioid receptors represents a pivotal concept in pharmacology, offering insights into the differential signaling pathways activated by distinct ligands. This phenomenon, where ligands preferentially activate either G protein or β-arrestin pathways, has profound implications for the development of safer and more effective opioid analgesics. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand bias, highlighting the role of receptor conformation and intracellular signaling cascades. By focusing on the differential engagement of G protein versus β-arrestin pathways, researchers aim to harness biased agonism to mitigate adverse effects associated with traditional opioids, such as respiratory depression and addiction. This review synthesizes current knowledge on biased agonism at opioid receptors, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of biased ligands in pain management. The findings underscore the importance of understanding ligand-receptor interactions at a molecular level to design next-generation opioids with improved safety profiles.", "label": 1}
