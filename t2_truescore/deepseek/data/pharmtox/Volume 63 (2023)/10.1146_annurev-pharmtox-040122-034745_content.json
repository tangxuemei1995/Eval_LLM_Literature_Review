{"grounding": "Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), an important intracellular second messenger, mediates cellular functional responses in all vital organs. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is one of the 11 members of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) family that specifically targets cGMP generated by nitric oxideâ€“driven activation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil and tadalafil, are widely used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and certain urological disorders. Preclinical studies have shown promising effects of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, cancer and anticancer-drug-associated cardiotoxicity, diabetes, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and other aging-related conditions. Many clinical trials with PDE5 inhibitors have focused on the potential cardiovascular, anticancer, and neurological benefits. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on PDE5 inhibitors and their potential therapeutic indications for various clinical disorders beyond erectile dysfunction.", "generated_text": "Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, traditionally recognized for their efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for a variety of clinical disorders beyond their conventional use. This review explores the expanding therapeutic landscape of cGMP-specific PDE5 inhibitors, focusing on their potential in addressing endothelial dysfunction, offering cardioprotection, managing metabolic disorders, mitigating aging-related conditions, and their emerging role in cancer therapy. By enhancing the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway, these inhibitors not only improve vascular health but also exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative effects, which are beneficial in a wide range of pathological conditions. The evidence suggests that PDE5 inhibitors could play a pivotal role in the treatment of complex diseases, highlighting the need for further research to fully elucidate their mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential across different clinical settings.", "label": 1}
