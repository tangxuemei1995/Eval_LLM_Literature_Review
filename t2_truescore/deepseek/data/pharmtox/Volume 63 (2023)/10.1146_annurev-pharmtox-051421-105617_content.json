{"grounding": "Pharmacology and toxicology are part of a much broader effort to understand the relationship between chemistry and biology. While biomedicine has necessarily focused on specific cases, typically of direct human relevance, there are real advantages in pursuing more systematic approaches to characterizing how health and disease are influenced by small molecules and other interventions. In this context, the zebrafish is now established as the representative screenable vertebrate and, through ongoing advances in the available scale of genome editing and automated phenotyping, is beginning to address systems-level solutions to some biomedical problems. The addition of broader efforts to integrate information content across preclinical model organisms and the incorporation of rigorous analytics, including closed-loop deep learning, will facilitate efforts to create systems pharmacology and toxicology with the ability to continuously optimize chemical biological interactions around societal needs. In this review, we outline progress toward this goal.", "generated_text": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a pivotal model organism in the realms of systems pharmacology and toxicology, offering a scalable, in vivo platform for the high-throughput screening of drugs and environmental toxins. This review underscores the zebrafish's unique advantages, including its genetic tractability, optical transparency during early development, and physiological similarities to humans, which facilitate the elucidation of complex biological pathways and the assessment of therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. By integrating advanced genetic, imaging, and computational tools, zebrafish models have significantly contributed to our understanding of disease mechanisms, drug discovery, and safety evaluation. The adoption of zebrafish as an alternative model system not only accelerates the pace of biomedical research but also aligns with the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) in animal research, thereby enhancing ethical standards. This paper highlights recent advancements and future directions in leveraging zebrafish for in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology studies.", "label": 1}
