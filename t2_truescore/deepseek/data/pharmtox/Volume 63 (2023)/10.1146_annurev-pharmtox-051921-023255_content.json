{"grounding": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in pharmaceutical research and development has to date focused on research: target identification; docking-, fragment-, and motif-based generation of compound libraries; modeling of synthesis feasibility; rank-ordering likely hits according to structural and chemometric similarity to compounds having known activity and affinity to the target(s); optimizing a smaller library for synthesis and high-throughput screening; and combining evidence from screening to support hit-to-lead decisions. Applying AI/ML methods to lead optimization and lead-to-candidate (L2C) decision-making has shown slower progress, especially regarding predicting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology properties. The present review surveys reasons why this is so, reports progress that has occurred in recent years, and summarizes some of the issues that remain. Effective AI/ML tools to derisk L2C and later phases of development are important to accelerate the pharmaceutical development process, ameliorate escalating development costs, and achieve greater success rates.", "generated_text": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) into the drug discovery pipeline, particularly in the lead-to-candidate decision-making process, represents a transformative shift in pharmaceutical research. This study explores the application of AI and ML techniques to enhance decision quality, streamline the identification of viable drug candidates, and predict potential toxicological outcomes. By leveraging computational toxicology and advanced data analytics, we demonstrate how these technologies can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. Our findings highlight the potential of AI and ML to not only improve the efficiency of lead optimization but also to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of drug action and toxicity. This research underscores the importance of adopting AI and ML tools in the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate the development of safer and more effective therapeutics.", "label": 0}
