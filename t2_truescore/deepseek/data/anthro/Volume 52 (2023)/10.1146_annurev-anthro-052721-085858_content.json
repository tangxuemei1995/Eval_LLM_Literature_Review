{"grounding": "Human habitation and adaptation to extreme environments have a deep history in anthropological research. Anthropologistsâ€™ understanding of these ecological pressures and how humans respond to them has grown substantially over the last 100+ years. This review covers long-standing knowledge on adaptation to classic extreme conditions of heat, cold, and high altitude, while also updating the areas in which recent research has broadened our understanding of human adaptation, acclimatization, and resilience. Unfortunately, the intersecting stresses of structural inequality and climate change have made these extremes more extreme, with drastic negative impacts on health and well-being. Future research will need to explore how extreme environments, structural inequality, and climate change are embodied as well as mitigated so that humans are better prepared to face a rapidly changing world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the physiological and metabolic adaptations of human bodies to extreme environments, focusing on thermoregulation and metabolic adjustments. By analyzing existing literature, we investigate how humans adapt to extreme cold, heat, and high altitudes, and the role of structural inequality in access to resources that facilitate such adaptations. The research highlights the impact of climate change on exacerbating environmental extremes and the consequent challenges to human health and survival. Findings suggest that while physiological adaptations play a crucial role, structural inequalities significantly influence the capacity of individuals and communities to cope with extreme conditions. This study underscores the importance of addressing both physiological and socio-economic factors in developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of extreme environments on human populations.", "label": 1}
