{"grounding": "In this review, we call for heightened attention to the labor of interpreters to think more reflexively about our own professional ethics and the paradoxes of global capitalism within which both interpreters and anthropologists work. Like other forms of communicative labor, interpretation is often devalued, unrecognized, and uncompensated—a form of invisible labor. Professional language ideologies, some paradoxically perpetuated by the profession itself, contribute to interpreters’ invisibility in their workplaces. Global and multilingual organizations depend on ideologies of transparency and the assumption that language transmission is easy; examining interpreters’ labor ethnographically troubles these assumptions. Interpreters also confront an ethical tension in their position that mirrors a tension in anthropology: namely, between ideals of professional neutrality and analytic distance versus intentional advocacy. The study of interpreters offers ways to critically assess anthropologists’ own professional practices and dig deeply into the contradictions of global capitalism.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the nuanced realm of interpreting, shedding light on the often-overlooked aspects of invisible labor and ethical considerations within the profession. Interpreters, pivotal in bridging linguistic and cultural divides, navigate complex terrains of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes, where their voices and identities frequently become obscured. Through an interdisciplinary lens, this research explores the ethical dilemmas interpreters face, including issues of neutrality, confidentiality, and the moral implications of their work in various contexts. By examining the intersection of interpreting with global capitalism and humanitarian efforts, the study aims to uncover the layers of invisible labor that sustain communication across borders. It calls for a reevaluation of the ethical frameworks governing interpreting practices, advocating for greater recognition of interpreters' contributions and the challenges they encounter. This investigation contributes to a deeper understanding of the critical role interpreters play in facilitating global dialogue and the ethical considerations that underpin their work.", "label": 1}
