{"grounding": "“Intervention” is central to global health, but the significance and effects of how intervention is practiced are often taken for granted. This review takes interventions into health and medicine as subjects for ethnographic inquiry. We highlight three lines of anthropological contributions: studies of global health interventions that serve imperial and military objectives, studies of “magic bullet” interventions arising from laboratory science, and studies of interventions based on deterministic modeling techniques. We then outline examples of “intervention otherwise,” in which people build relations of solidarity and care through global health programming, design interventions to be interactive and adaptable, and use data and modeling to support health justice. Whereas many global health interventions reproduce Western power hierarchies, intervention otherwise draws attention to alternative forms of knowledge, action, and expertise. Our analysis of lively and multivalent practices of intervention has implications for debates about the im/possibility of decolonizing global health.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the paradigms of global health interventions, focusing on the roles of military involvement, the pursuit of 'magic bullet' solutions, and the deterministic models that often underpin such efforts. Drawing on a multidisciplinary approach that includes anthropology, global public health, and the history of medicine, we explore how these frameworks have shaped the delivery of health care and aid in post-colonial contexts. By analyzing case studies and historical precedents, we argue that these approaches frequently overlook the complex socio-political and cultural determinants of health, perpetuating a form of neo-colonialism in global health practices. The paper advocates for an 'intervention otherwise'—a more nuanced, context-sensitive approach that prioritizes local knowledge, community engagement, and the dismantling of power asymmetries in global health initiatives. This reimagined framework seeks to foster more equitable and sustainable health outcomes, challenging the status quo of global health interventions.", "label": 1}
