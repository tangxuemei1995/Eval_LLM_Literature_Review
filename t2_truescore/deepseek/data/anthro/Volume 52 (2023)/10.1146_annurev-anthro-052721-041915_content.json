{"grounding": "This review surveys studies of men and masculinities in anthropology and ethnography from other disciplines, as well as theoretical frameworks and debates among anthropologists and other relevant scholars in the field. It also aims to assess developments in these studies since an earlier Annual Review of Anthropology article was published on this subject. By considering the ethnographic boom in men and masculinities studies across the globe since 2000, increasingly authored by anthropologists from the Global South, this review considers anthropology's singular contributions topically and conceptually—for example, masculinity and militarism, men and public health, gender inequalities, and trans* social movements—including through innovative research in biological and linguistic anthropology and archaeology. Throughout, this article reflects on the extent to which anthropologists have moved (and if they should have moved) beyond the study of women or men to instead explore gender, sex, and sexuality of humans and nonhuman animals in less binary frameworks.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the anthropology of masculinity, focusing on the often-unmarked nature of men and masculinity in gender studies. By examining the intersections of gender, sexuality, and inequality, the research aims to uncover the nuanced ways in which masculinity is constructed, performed, and challenged across different cultural contexts. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and incorporating contemporary case studies, the paper explores the dynamic processes of change in masculine identities and practices. It argues that understanding masculinity requires a critical examination of its invisibility in normative discourses and its impact on gender relations. The findings highlight the importance of rethinking masculinity not as a fixed category but as a fluid and contested terrain that shapes and is shaped by broader social, economic, and political forces. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on gender by offering fresh insights into the complexities of masculinity and its implications for achieving gender equality.", "label": 1}
