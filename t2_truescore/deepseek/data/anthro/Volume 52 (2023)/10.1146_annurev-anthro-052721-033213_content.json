{"grounding": "This article reviews key theoretical and methodological contributions that anthropologists have made to the study of what we call security regimes. While anthropologists have been instrumental in denaturalizing discourses of security, much of the existing literature on who security actors are or where their work and force are to be found remains focused on the masculinist frontlines and visibly spectacular instances of security state power. We adopt a transnational feminist lens to rethink what we understand security regimes to be and where they are to be found by drawing attention to the multiscalar sites (e.g., home, family, kinship, intimacy) and technologies of rule (e.g., affect, aesthetics, discourse) through which security regimes are constituted, expanded, and challenged. The final section of the review examines methodological and ethical challenges, which are made more complex by the changing profile of the multiply racialized, gendered, nationalized, and classed researchers of security regimes.", "generated_text": "This article explores the intricate dynamics of security regimes through the lens of transnational and imperial entanglements, employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates political anthropology and transnational feminism. By examining the intersections of security, empire, race, and gender, the study reveals how these regimes are not merely mechanisms of state control but are deeply embedded in historical and ongoing imperial projects. The analysis highlights the ways in which security practices perpetuate racial and gendered hierarchies, often under the guise of protecting national and international order. Through case studies and theoretical insights, the article argues for a reimagined understanding of security that challenges imperial legacies and embraces a feminist, anti-racist framework. This research contributes to broader debates on the politics of security, offering critical perspectives on how to dismantle oppressive structures and foster more inclusive and equitable security practices.", "label": 1}
