{"grounding": "This article reviews the anthropological scholarship that engages with religious conversion as a political phenomenon, broadly defined. It develops the idea of making a difference as an overarching framework with a double meaning. First, this idiom captures how, by framing religious conversion in political terms, anthropologists have claimed to have substantially intervened—have made a difference, so to speak—in the discussion of conversion. Second, the article sets aside the prevalent problematization of conversion as a category of change, showing instead how anthropologists have sought to establish how religious change makes a difference—in the interweaved realities of individuals, collectives, and polities. I scrutinize and contextualize the belated consolidation of this area of inquiry, map its major strands, and identify the interrelated theoretical developments within anthropology. Seeing these strands as a generative domain of inquiry, I conclude with a number of suggestions for future research, such as paying closer attention to political conversions and to the links between religious conversion and political crises.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between religious conversion and political life, focusing on how the act of changing one's religious affiliation can lead to significant shifts in both personal identity and societal structures. By examining the dynamics of religious difference and its impact on political difference, the research delves into the politics of religion, highlighting how conversion is not merely a personal spiritual journey but also a potent political act that can challenge existing power dynamics and social norms. Through a comprehensive analysis of historical and contemporary case studies, this paper argues that religious conversion serves as a critical lens for understanding the interplay between individual agency and collective identity in the shaping of political landscapes. The findings underscore the importance of considering religious conversion as a multifaceted phenomenon that transcends the boundaries of the sacred and the secular, offering new insights into the complexities of religious and political change.", "label": 1}
