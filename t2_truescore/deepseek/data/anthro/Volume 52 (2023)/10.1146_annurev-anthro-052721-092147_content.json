{"grounding": "This review sketches a linguistic anthropology of images. While linguistic anthropology has not historically focalized images as a central theoretical object of concern, linguistic anthropologists’ research has increasingly concerned images of various sorts. Furthermore, in its critique of structuralist reductions of language, the field has advanced an analytic vocabulary for thinking about the image in discourse. In this article, I review scholarship in linguistic anthropology on prototypic images to show how these advances (e.g., entextualization, performativity, perspective, and enregisterment) can be leveraged to theorize images more generally. In doing so, I argue against any hard distinction between language and image. I conclude by expanding out from a linguistic anthropology of images to what I call “a linguistic anthropology of…,” a field characterized by an open-ended horizon of objects and modes of inquiry, all linked together as linguistic anthropology.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intersection of linguistic anthropology and visual culture, exploring the semiotic processes through which images become meaningful within specific cultural contexts. By employing concepts such as entextualization, performativity, and enregisterment, the research examines how images are not merely passive representations but active participants in the construction of social realities. Through a series of case studies, the paper illustrates the dynamic interplay between visual and linguistic signs, highlighting the role of images in the negotiation of identity, power, and social relations. The findings underscore the importance of a linguistic anthropological approach to understanding the complex ways in which images are produced, circulated, and interpreted, offering new insights into the semiotic landscapes of contemporary societies.", "label": 1}
