{"grounding": "This article focuses on how the anthropological study of media—through an examination of its production, circulation, and consumption—elucidates issues of social organization, political economy, and alternative visions for political futures. By bringing together the studies of visual media, social movements, and hegemonic power by anthropologists and ethnographers of media since the turn of the twenty-first century, this review article provides a critical understanding of research about our current media environment, where scholarship within anthropology is heading in these domains, and what looking at these three fields together can mean for a more robust understanding of our political, social, and cultural futures.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate dynamics between social movements, power structures, and mediated visibility in the digital age. Focusing on the role of visual media, it examines how social movements navigate the complex interplay of states and corporations to amplify their messages and mobilize support. The research highlights the transformative impact of technology on visibility strategies, revealing both opportunities and challenges for activists. Through a critical analysis of case studies, it sheds light on the evolving landscape of power and resistance, offering insights into the mechanisms through which social movements leverage mediated visibility to challenge dominant narratives and effect social change.", "label": 0}
