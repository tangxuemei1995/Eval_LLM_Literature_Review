{"grounding": "This review examines the discourses and practices that have produced a lively literature on museum decolonization created by scholars of museum practices and curators. We consider the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, focusing especially on the care of Native North American heritage, with comparison to similar trajectories internationally. We begin with a discussion of decolonizing moments in theory and practice, with particular attention to 1990s critique of ethnographic museums and developments after the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Following this discussion is a review of works on concerns regarding Native American representation and public displays, involvement in collections care, and the varied collaborations that are changing museum practices. The final section foregrounds the fluorescence of tribal museums and their contributions to the decolonization and indigenization of museums, as well as emerging paradigm shifts in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the imperative of decolonizing museums as a critical step toward a paradigm shift in cultural representation and preservation. Drawing on Native American scholarship and the broader discourse on indigenization, it examines the historical and contemporary practices of museums that have often marginalized Indigenous voices and narratives. The study advocates for a transformative approach that prioritizes the inclusion, participation, and leadership of Indigenous communities in museum operations, from curation to governance. By analyzing case studies of museums that have embarked on decolonization efforts, the paper highlights the challenges and opportunities in redefining museum practices to reflect a more equitable and respectful engagement with Indigenous cultures. The findings underscore the importance of decolonization as not merely a theoretical concept but a practical necessity for museums to become spaces of true cultural exchange and understanding. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on decolonization in the arts and cultural sectors, offering insights into how museums can evolve to better serve diverse communities and foster a more inclusive historical narrative.", "label": 0}
