{"grounding": "Anthropological expeditions seeking out algorithms frequently return empty-handed. They are confronted with the challenge of the object: what to study when studying algorithms? In this article, I draw together a number of literatures to outline one possible answer to the question of how to study algorithms in social science. I argue that what we should study are algorithmic ecologies. I sketch five modalities of algorithmic ecologies and review concomitant literatures: (a) imaginaries, (b) infrastructures, (c) interfaces, (d) identities, and (e) investments and interests. The speculative propositions offered here are that algorithms are immanent to ecologies and that they are enacted across all the modalities of algorithmic ecologies.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between algorithms and their ecological contexts, emphasizing the dynamic interplay within digital infrastructures and social imaginaries. By examining the interface of smart technology, we delve into how algorithms are not merely technical entities but are deeply embedded in socio-technical ecosystems. The study proposes a framework for understanding the ecology of algorithms, highlighting their roles in shaping and being shaped by human interactions, environmental factors, and infrastructural dependencies. Through this lens, we aim to uncover the multifaceted impacts of algorithms on society and the environment, advocating for a more holistic approach to their design and implementation in smart technologies.", "label": 0}
