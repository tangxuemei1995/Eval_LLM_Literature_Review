{"grounding": "In this article, we explore critical university studies (CUS), an interdisciplinary body of scholarship that interrogates structures of higher education and their entanglements with national and global institutions and political movements. Favoring an expansive definition of CUS, we draw from scholars who trace the origins of the American university to the slave trade, racial science, and Native American ethnic cleansing projects, as well as scholars who bring abolitionist and decolonial stances to highlight how the university continues to perpetuate state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness. We then bring the lens of CUS to bear on critical work by anthropologists on higher education and on the discipline more broadly. We explore the challenges of advocating for antiracist and anti-imperial anthropology without attending to the structures of Western/white superiority that have enabled its institutionalization. We conclude by considering interventions by the emerging field of abolitionist anthropology.", "generated_text": "This paper delves into the burgeoning field of Critical University Studies (CUS), exploring its intersections with higher education, decolonization, abolition, and Black studies. By examining the historical and contemporary challenges faced by universities, the study highlights the imperative for systemic reform within academic institutions. It argues for a decolonial approach to dismantle the entrenched structures of inequality and oppression, advocating for the abolition of practices that perpetuate racial and social injustices. Drawing on Black studies, the research underscores the importance of centering marginalized voices and epistemologies in the pursuit of a more equitable and inclusive academic environment. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on transforming higher education into a space that fosters social justice, equity, and liberation for all.", "label": 1}
