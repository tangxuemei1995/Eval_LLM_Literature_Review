{"grounding": "Contesting ideas about what is “normal” human behavior or biology is a core contribution of anthropology. In efforts to provide more inclusive views of what it means to be human, anthropologists challenge judgments about diverse ways of being, which include assumptions about what it means to be normal. Meanings of the term normal encompass the descriptive (statistical) and the evaluative (normative), i.e., judgments about a given characteristic. In biomedicine, “healthy” is often the value ascribed to normal, but embedded in healthy are biases that derive from particular cultural and historical contexts. Here I review how the term normal is understood and used in anthropological and related studies of human biology and biological variation. I propose the biological normalcy framework for understanding how the statistical and normative meanings of normal mutually inform each other and their consequences for human population biology. Several examples provide illustrations of the framework.", "generated_text": "The concept of biological normalcy is a multifaceted construct that intersects human biology with cultural norms and statistical variation. This research delves into the intricate balance between what is considered biologically normal and the normative views shaped by societal expectations. By examining a wide array of biological data and cultural contexts, the study aims to uncover the underlying principles that define normalcy in human biology. It challenges the traditional statistical approach to normalcy, which often overlooks the vast spectrum of human variation, and proposes a more inclusive framework that accommodates diversity. The findings suggest that biological normalcy is not a fixed standard but a dynamic concept that evolves with cultural shifts and scientific advancements. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between biology and culture, offering new perspectives on the normative views of human biology.", "label": 1}
