{"grounding": "The trajectory of human aging varies widely from one individual to the next due to complex interactions between the genome and the environment that influence the aging process. Such differences in age-specific mortality and disease risk among same-aged individuals reflect variation in the pace of biological aging. Certain mechanisms involved in the progression of biological aging originate in the epigenome, where chemical modifications to the genome are able to alter gene expression without modifying the underlying DNA sequence. The epigenome serves as an interface for environmental signals, which are able to “get under the skin” to influence health and aging. A number of the molecular mechanisms involved in the aging process have been identified, although few aging phenotypes have been definitively traced to their underlying molecular causes thus far. In this review, we discuss variation in human biological aging and the epigenome's role in promoting heterogeneity in human longevity and healthspan.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between environmental factors and epigenetic mechanisms plays a pivotal role in modulating the pace of human aging and the onset of age-related diseases. This review synthesizes current evidence on how external environmental exposures, ranging from dietary habits to pollution, influence epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA expression. These epigenetic alterations, in turn, affect the expression of genes involved in aging processes and disease susceptibility. The concept of the epigenetic clock, a biomarker of aging based on DNA methylation patterns, is explored as a tool to quantify biological age and predict lifespan. By elucidating the mechanisms through which the environment impacts epigenetic regulation and aging, this research underscores the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate age-related decline and promote healthy longevity. The findings highlight the importance of considering environmental and epigenetic factors in the development of strategies to combat aging and age-associated diseases.", "label": 1}
