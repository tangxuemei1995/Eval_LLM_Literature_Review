{"grounding": "Bacteriophages are enigmatic entities that defy definition. Classically, they are specialist viruses that exclusively parasitize bacterial hosts. Yet this definition becomes limiting when we consider their ubiquity in the body coupled with their vast capacity to directly interact with the mammalian host. While phages certainly do not infect nor replicate within mammalian cells, they do interact with and gain unfettered access to the eukaryotic cell structure. With the growing appreciation for the human virome, coupled with our increased application of phages to patients within clinical settings, the potential impact of phage-mammalian interactions is progressively recognized. In this review, we provide a detailed mechanistic overview of how phages interact with the mammalian cell surface, the processes through which said phages are internalized by the cell, and the intracellular processing and fate of the phages. We then summarize the current state-of-the-field with respect to phage-mammalian interactions and their associations with health and disease states.", "generated_text": "The interaction between mammalian cells and bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, is an emerging area of interest in cellular biology and immunology. This study explores the mechanisms by which mammalian cells process bacteriophages, focusing on endocytosis and intracellular trafficking pathways. We investigate how these processes contribute to the mammalian immune response, including the induction of inflammation and the potential role of bacteriophages in shaping the host's virome. By analyzing the cellular uptake and processing of bacteriophages, this research sheds light on the complex interplay between bacteriophages and mammalian cells, offering insights into their impact on immunity and inflammation. Our findings suggest that mammalian cells possess sophisticated mechanisms to recognize and respond to bacteriophages, highlighting the importance of these interactions in health and disease. This study provides a foundational understanding of the cellular processing of bacteriophages, paving the way for future research into their therapeutic potential and role in the mammalian immune system.", "label": 1}
