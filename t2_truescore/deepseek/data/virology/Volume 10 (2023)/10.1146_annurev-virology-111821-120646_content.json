{"grounding": "Protein synthesis by the ribosome is the final stage of biological information transfer and represents an irreversible commitment to gene expression. Accurate translation of messenger RNA is therefore essential to all life, and spontaneous errors by the translational machinery are highly infrequent (∼1/100,000 codons). Programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1PRF) is a mechanism in which the elongating ribosome is induced at high frequency to slip backward by one nucleotide at a defined position and to continue translation in the new reading frame. This is exploited as a translational regulation strategy by hundreds of RNA viruses, which rely on −1PRF during genome translation to control the stoichiometry of viral proteins. While early investigations of −1PRF focused on virological and biochemical aspects, the application of X-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and the advent of deep sequencing and single-molecule approaches have revealed unexpected structural diversity and mechanistic complexity. Molecular players from several model systems have now been characterized in detail, both in isolation and, more recently, in the context of the elongating ribosome. Here we provide a summary of recent advances and discuss to what extent a general model for −1PRF remains a useful way of thinking.", "generated_text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a critical translational recoding mechanism utilized by viruses to regulate gene expression from overlapping open reading frames. This process is essential for the replication of many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, making it a potential target for antiviral therapies. PRF is typically induced by specific RNA structures, such as pseudoknots, which cause the ribosome to slip and shift reading frames during translation. This review provides structural and functional insights into the mechanisms of viral PRF, focusing on the role of RNA secondary structures and the ribosome's response to these signals. We discuss recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography that have elucidated the molecular details of frameshifting in the context of the ribosome. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these findings for understanding viral replication and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. By integrating structural biology with virology, this review highlights the intricate interplay between viral RNA elements and the host translation machinery, offering new perspectives on combating viral infections through the modulation of PRF.", "label": 1}
