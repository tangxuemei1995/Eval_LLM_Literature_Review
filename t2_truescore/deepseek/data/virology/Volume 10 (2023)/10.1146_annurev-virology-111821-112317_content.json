{"grounding": "Enteric viruses display intricate adaptations to the host mucosal immune system to successfully reproduce in the gastrointestinal tract and cause maladies ranging from gastroenteritis to life-threatening disease upon extraintestinal dissemination. However, many viral infections are asymptomatic, and their presence in the gut is associated with an altered immune landscape that can be beneficial or adverse in certain contexts. Genetic variation in the host and environmental factors including the bacterial microbiota influence how the immune system responds to infections in a remarkably viral strainâ€“specific manner. This immune response, in turn, determines whether a given virus establishes acute versus chronic infection, which may have long-lasting consequences such as susceptibility to inflammatory disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interaction between enteric viruses and the immune system that underlie the impact of these ubiquitous infectious agents on our health.", "generated_text": "Enteric viruses, including norovirus, play a pivotal role in modulating the host immune response within the intestinal environment. This review explores the complex interactions between enteric viruses and the host immune system, highlighting the mechanisms of immunomodulation that contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis. The intestinal virome, a dynamic component of the gut microbiota, is implicated in shaping immune responses and maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Through various strategies, enteric viruses can evade immune detection, suppress immune responses, or induce immune tolerance, thereby facilitating their survival and replication. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of enteric viruses is crucial for developing novel therapeutic and preventive strategies against viral infections and associated diseases. This study underscores the importance of the virome in immune regulation and its potential implications for human health and disease.", "label": 1}
