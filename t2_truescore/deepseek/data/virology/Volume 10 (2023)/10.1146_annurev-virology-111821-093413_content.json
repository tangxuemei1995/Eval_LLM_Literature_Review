{"grounding": "There are at least 21 families of enveloped viruses that infect mammals, and many contain members of high concern for global human health. All enveloped viruses have a dedicated fusion protein or fusion complex that enacts the critical genome-releasing membrane fusion event that is essential before viral replication within the host cell interior can begin. Because all enveloped viruses enter cells by fusion, it behooves us to know how viral fusion proteins function. Viral fusion proteins are also major targets of neutralizing antibodies, and hence they serve as key vaccine immunogens. Here we review current concepts about viral membrane fusion proteins focusing on how they are triggered, structural intermediates between pre- and postfusion forms, and their interplay with the lipid bilayers they engage. We also discuss cellular and therapeutic interventions that thwart virus-cell membrane fusion.", "generated_text": "Viral membrane fusion represents a critical step in the infection process, where viral and host cell membranes merge to facilitate viral entry. This complex process is orchestrated by viral fusion proteins, categorized into classes I, II, and III, each adopting distinct structural conformations and mechanisms to mediate fusion. The transition through conformational intermediates, including the formation of trimers-of-hairpins, is pivotal for driving the fusion energetics. Fusion peptides and loops play essential roles in initiating membrane juxtaposition and merger, while lipid dynamics significantly influence the fusion process. Additionally, fusion restriction factors can modulate the efficiency of viral entry, highlighting the intricate interplay between viral components and host cell defenses. This review delves into the molecular choreography of viral membrane fusion, emphasizing the contributions of viral fusion proteins and lipids, and the regulatory mechanisms that govern this vital biological event.", "label": 1}
