{"grounding": "Phase separation of viral biopolymers is a key factor in the formation of cytoplasmic viral inclusions, known as sites of virus replication and assembly. This review describes the mechanisms and factors that affect phase separation in viral replication and identifies potential areas for future research. Drawing inspiration from studies on cellular RNA-rich condensates, we compare the hierarchical coassembly of ribosomal RNAs and proteins in the nucleolus to the coordinated coassembly of viral RNAs and proteins taking place within viral factories in viruses containing segmented RNA genomes. We highlight the common characteristics of biomolecular condensates in viral replication and how this new understanding is reshaping our views of virus assembly mechanisms. Such studies have the potential to uncover unexplored antiviral strategies targeting these phase-separated states.", "generated_text": "Viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and assembly, often forming specialized structures known as viral factories or viroplasms. These biomolecular condensates, which are liquid-like compartments formed through phase transitions, play a crucial role in the life cycle of viruses, particularly those with segmented RNA genomes like rotaviruses. This review explores the biophysical principles underlying the formation and function of these condensates, emphasizing their role in virus assembly. By examining the interplay between viral components and host factors, we highlight how viruses exploit phase separation to concentrate viral proteins and nucleic acids, thereby enhancing replication efficiency. Understanding these processes not only sheds light on fundamental aspects of virology but also opens new avenues for antiviral strategies targeting the formation and dynamics of viral condensates.", "label": 1}
