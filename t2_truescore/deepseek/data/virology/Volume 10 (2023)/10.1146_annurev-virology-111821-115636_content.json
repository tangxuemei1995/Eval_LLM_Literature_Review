{"grounding": "Host defense against viral pathogens is an essential function for all living organisms. In cell-intrinsic innate immunity, dedicated sensor proteins recognize molecular signatures of infection and communicate to downstream adaptor or effector proteins to activate immune defense. Remarkably, recent evidence demonstrates that much of the core machinery of innate immunity is shared across eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains of life. Here, we review a pioneering example of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity: the animal cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthaseâ€“stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway and its ancestor in bacteria, CBASS (cyclic nucleotide-based antiphage signaling system) antiphage defense. We discuss the unique mechanism by which animal cGLRs (cGAS-like receptors) and bacterial CD-NTases (cGAS/dinucleotide-cyclase in Vibrio (DncV)-like nucleotidyltransferases) in these pathways link pathogen detection with immune activation using nucleotide second messenger signals. Comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we highlight emerging questions in the field and examine evolutionary pressures that may have shaped the origins of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense.", "generated_text": "The discovery of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream signaling effector, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), has revolutionized our understanding of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense and innate immunity. This review delves into the evolutionary origins and mechanistic underpinnings of the cGAS-STING pathway, juxtaposing it with the recently identified CBASS (cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system) and cGLR (cyclic GMP-AMP receptor) systems. These systems collectively represent a sophisticated network of nucleotide second messenger signaling that orchestrates the host's defense against viral infections. By synthesizing current literature, we explore the molecular mechanisms through which these pathways detect viral nucleic acids, the generation and function of cyclic dinucleotides as second messengers, and the subsequent activation of immune responses. This comprehensive analysis not only highlights the complexity and diversity of nucleotide second messenger signaling in innate immunity but also underscores the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these pathways in the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer.", "label": 0}
