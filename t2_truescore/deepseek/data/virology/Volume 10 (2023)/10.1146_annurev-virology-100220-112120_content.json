{"grounding": "Understanding the factors that shape viral evolution is critical for developing effective antiviral strategies, accurately predicting viral evolution, and preventing pandemics. One fundamental determinant of viral evolution is the interplay between viral protein biophysics and the host machineries that regulate protein folding and quality control. Most adaptive mutations in viruses are biophysically deleterious, resulting in a viral protein product with folding defects. In cells, protein folding is assisted by a dynamic system of chaperones and quality control processes known as the proteostasis network. Host proteostasis networks can determine the fates of viral proteins with biophysical defects, either by assisting with folding or by targeting them for degradation. In this review, we discuss and analyze new discoveries revealing that host proteostasis factors can profoundly shape the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins. We also discuss the many opportunities for research progress proffered by the proteostasis perspective on viral evolution and adaptation.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between viral evolution and host proteostasis networks represents a pivotal aspect of viral adaptation and survival. This study delves into the mechanisms by which viruses exploit and manipulate the host's protein folding biophysics, stress response pathways, and quality control systems, including chaperones, to enhance their replication and evade drug and immune system resistance. By analyzing the dynamic interactions between viral proteins and host proteostasis networks, we uncover novel insights into the biophysical constraints and evolutionary pressures that shape viral adaptation. Our findings highlight the critical role of host proteostasis in determining viral fitness and the emergence of resistance mechanisms, offering new perspectives for the development of antiviral strategies that target the virus-host proteostasis interface. This research underscores the importance of understanding the molecular underpinnings of viral evolution in the context of host cellular environments, paving the way for innovative approaches to combat viral infections.", "label": 1}
