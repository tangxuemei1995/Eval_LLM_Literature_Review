{"grounding": "N- and O-glycans are both important constituents of viral envelope glycoproteins. O-linked glycosylation can be initiated by any of 20 different human polypeptide O-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases, resulting in an important functional O-glycan heterogeneity. O-glycans are organized as solitary glycans or in clusters of multiple glycans forming mucin-like domains. They are functional both in the viral life cycle and in viral colonization of their host. Negatively charged O-glycans are crucial for the interactions between glycosaminoglycan-binding viruses and their host. A novel mechanism, based on controlled electrostatic repulsion, explains how such viruses solve the conflict between optimized viral attachment to target cells and efficient egress of progeny virus. Conserved solitary O-glycans appear important for viral uptake in target cells by contributing to viral envelope fusion. Dual roles of viral O-glycans in the host B cell immune response, either epitope blocking or epitope promoting, may be exploitable for vaccine development. Finally, specific virus-induced O-glycans may be involved in viremic spread.", "generated_text": "The intricate structure and function of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins have garnered significant attention in virology, particularly for their roles in viral pathogenesis and immune evasion. This study delves into the mucin-like domains rich in O-linked glycosylation, which are pivotal for the attachment of viruses to host cells, often mediated through interactions with heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. These glycans not only facilitate virion entry but also play a crucial role in the egress of newly formed viral particles, thereby influencing the viral life cycle. Furthermore, the variability in O-linked glycan structures presents a challenge for the immune system, complicating the development of effective vaccines. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins, this research aims to contribute to the design of novel antiviral strategies and vaccine candidates, potentially offering new avenues for combating viral infections.", "label": 0}
