{"grounding": "The nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs), also known as the order Mononegavirales, have a genome consisting of a single strand of negative-sense RNA. Integral to the nsNSV replication cycle is the viral polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing the viral genome, to produce an array of capped and polyadenylated messenger RNAs, and replicating it to produce new genomes. To perform the different steps that are necessary for these processes, the nsNSV polymerases undergo a series of coordinated conformational transitions. While much is still to be learned regarding the intersection of nsNSV polymerase dynamics, structure, and function, recently published polymerase structures, combined with a history of biochemical and molecular biology studies, have provided new insights into how nsNSV polymerases function as dynamic machines. In this review, we consider each of the steps involved in nsNSV transcription and replication and suggest how these relate to solved polymerase structures.", "generated_text": "The replication and transcription of nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs) are facilitated by their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), which are complex, multifunctional enzymes. This study delves into the structural and mechanistic aspects of RdRps from the order Mononegavirales, encompassing families such as Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. Through a comprehensive review of recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures and biochemical studies, we elucidate the intricate architecture of these polymerases, highlighting conserved motifs and unique features that underpin their function. The mechanisms of RNA synthesis, including initiation, elongation, and termination, are explored, with a focus on the role of the polymerase in ensuring fidelity and processivity. Additionally, the interplay between the polymerase and other viral and host factors is examined, shedding light on the regulatory mechanisms that govern viral replication. This research provides critical insights into the molecular biology of nsNSVs, offering potential avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics targeting the viral polymerase.", "label": 1}
