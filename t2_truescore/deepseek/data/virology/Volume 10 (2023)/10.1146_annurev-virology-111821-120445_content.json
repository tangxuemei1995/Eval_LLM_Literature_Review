{"grounding": "Negative-stranded RNA viruses are a large group of viruses that encode their genomes in RNA across multiple segments in an orientation antisense to messenger RNA. Their members infect broad ranges of hosts, and there are a number of notable human pathogens. Here, we examine the development of reverse genetic systems as applied to these virus families, emphasizing conserved approaches illustrated by some of the prominent members that cause significant human disease. We also describe the utility of their genetic systems in the development of reporter strains of the viruses and some biological insights made possible by their use. To conclude the review, we highlight some possible future uses of reporter viruses that not only will increase our basic understanding of how these viruses replicate and cause disease but also could inform the development of new approaches to therapeutically intervene.", "generated_text": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses represent a significant class of pathogens affecting human health, including influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). These viruses possess genomes divided into multiple segments, a feature that facilitates genetic reassortment and contributes to their evolutionary adaptability and pandemic potential. Recent advancements in virology have enabled the development of reporter strains of these viruses, incorporating fluorescent or bioluminescent markers. These genetically modified strains offer powerful tools for studying viral replication, pathogenesis, and host-virus interactions in real-time. By leveraging these reporter strains, researchers can gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying viral infections, assess the efficacy of antiviral drugs, and develop novel vaccine strategies. This review highlights the genetic systems of segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses and explores the experimental applications of reporter strains in advancing our understanding of these human pathogens.", "label": 1}
