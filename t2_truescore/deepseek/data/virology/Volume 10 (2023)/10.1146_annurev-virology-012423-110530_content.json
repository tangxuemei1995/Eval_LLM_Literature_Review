{"grounding": "The global rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and the waning efficacy of antibiotics urge consideration of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Phage therapy is a classic approach where bacteriophages (bacteria-specific viruses) are used against bacterial infections, with many recent successes in personalized medicine treatment of intractable infections. However, a perpetual challenge for developing generalized phage therapy is the expectation that viruses will exert selection for target bacteria to deploy defenses against virus attack, causing evolution of phage resistance during patient treatment. Here we review the two main complementary strategies for mitigating bacterial resistance in phage therapy: minimizing the ability for bacterial populations to evolve phage resistance and driving (steering) evolution of phage-resistant bacteria toward clinically favorable outcomes. We discuss future research directions that might further address the phage-resistance problem, to foster widespread development and deployment of therapeutic phage strategies that outsmart evolved bacterial resistance in clinical settings.", "generated_text": "The escalating crisis of antibiotic resistance necessitates innovative approaches to combat bacterial infections. Phage therapy, the use of bacteriophages to target and kill bacteria, presents a promising alternative. However, the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria poses a significant challenge to its efficacy. This study explores the development of phage therapy strategies that mitigate the emergence of resistance through understanding and leveraging evolutionary trade-offs. By analyzing the genetic and phenotypic changes in bacteria that confer phage resistance, we identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to design more effective phage treatments. Our research highlights the importance of a dynamic approach to phage therapy, incorporating the principles of evolutionary biology to stay ahead of bacterial adaptation. The findings suggest that a combination of phage cocktails, engineered phages, and the exploitation of fitness costs associated with resistance could offer a sustainable solution to the problem of antibiotic resistance.", "label": 1}
