{"grounding": "The mammalian gastrointestinal tract (GIT) hosts a diverse and highly active microbiota composed of bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses. Studies of the GIT microbiota date back more than a century, although modern techniques, including mouse models, sequencing technology, and novel therapeutics in humans, have been foundational to our understanding of the roles of commensal microbes in health and disease. Here, we review the impacts of the GIT microbiota on viral infection, both within the GIT and systemically. GIT-associated microbes and their metabolites alter the course of viral infection through a variety of mechanisms, including direct interactions with virions, alteration of the GIT landscape, and extensive regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Mechanistic understanding of the full breadth of interactions between the GIT microbiota and the host is still lacking in many ways but will be vital for the development of novel therapeutics for viral and nonviral diseases alike.", "generated_text": "The human microbiota, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms residing in and on the human body, plays a pivotal role in modulating host immune responses and influencing the outcome of viral infections. This review explores the intricate interactions between the microbiota, its metabolites, and the virome, highlighting how these interactions can either exacerbate or mitigate viral pathogenesis. We delve into the mechanisms by which microbial metabolites influence host immune signaling pathways, particularly those involving interferons, which are crucial for antiviral defense. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of manipulating the microbiota as a therapeutic strategy to enhance antiviral immunity and reduce viral load. Understanding the dynamic interplay between the microbiota and viral infections opens new avenues for research and therapeutic interventions, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a balanced microbiome for optimal health and disease resistance.", "label": 1}
