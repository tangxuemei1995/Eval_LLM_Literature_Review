{"grounding": "The large genetic and structural divergences between plants and fungi may hinder the transmission of viruses between these two kingdoms to some extent. However, recent accumulating evidence from virus phylogenetic analyses and the discovery of naturally occurring virus cross-infection suggest the occurrence of past and current transmissions of viruses between plants and plant-associated fungi. Moreover, artificial virus inoculation experiments showed that diverse plant viruses can multiply in fungi and vice versa. Thus, virus cross-infection between plants and fungi may play an important role in the spread, emergence, and evolution of both plant and fungal viruses and facilitate the interaction between them. In this review, we summarize current knowledge related to cross-kingdom virus infection in plants and fungi and further discuss the relevance of this new virological topic in the context of understanding virus spread and transmission in nature as well as developing control strategies for crop plant diseases.", "generated_text": "The study of cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses unveils a complex web of ecological and evolutionary dynamics that challenge our understanding of virus-host relationships. This research delves into the mechanisms of cross-kingdom infection, focusing on the transmission pathways and virus-virus interactions that facilitate the movement of viruses between plants and fungi. By examining the role of extracellular transfer in these interactions, we aim to shed light on the potential for biocontrol strategies that leverage these natural processes. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between plant and fungal viruses, offering new insights into their co-evolution and the implications for agricultural practices. This study not only advances our knowledge of viral ecology but also opens up novel avenues for the development of sustainable disease management techniques in crops and fungi.", "label": 0}
