{"grounding": "Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) continue to experience chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which drives the persistence of latent HIV and prevalence of clinical comorbidities. Elucidating the mechanisms that lead to suboptimal immunity is necessary for developing therapeutics that improve the quality of life of PLWH. Although previous studies have found associations between gut dysbiosis and immune dysfunction, the cellular/molecular cascades implicated in the manifestation of aberrant immune responses downstream of microbial perturbations in PLWH are incompletely understood. Recent literature has highlighted that two abundant metabolite families, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), play a crucial role in shaping immunity. These metabolites can be produced and/or modified by bacterial species that make up the gut microbiota and may serve as the causal link between changes to the gut microbiome, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction in PLWH. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the role of the microbiome on HIV acquisition and latent HIV persistence despite ART. Further, we describe cellular/molecular cascades downstream of SCFAs and BAs that drive innate or adaptive immune responses responsible for promoting latent HIV persistence in PLWH. This knowledge can be used to advance HIV cure efforts.", "generated_text": "The human microbiome plays a pivotal role in regulating immune homeostasis and inflammation, with emerging evidence highlighting its influence on HIV persistence and immune dysfunction. This review explores the intricate interplay between the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids in modulating immune responses and their potential impact on HIV infection. SCFAs, produced through microbial fermentation of dietary fibers, have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and enhance gut barrier integrity, thereby influencing systemic immune activation. Bile acids, on the other hand, are not only crucial for lipid digestion but also serve as signaling molecules that can modulate immune cell function and microbial composition. The dysbiosis observed in HIV-infected individuals underscores the importance of the microbiome in viral persistence and the chronic immune activation characteristic of the disease. By elucidating the mechanisms through which microbial metabolites like SCFAs and bile acids regulate immune homeostasis and inflammation, this review aims to shed light on novel therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome to mitigate HIV-associated immune dysfunction and enhance viral eradication efforts.", "label": 1}
