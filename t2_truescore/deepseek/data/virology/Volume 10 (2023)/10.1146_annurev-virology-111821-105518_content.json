{"grounding": "Nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids across the intact nuclear envelope is an exceptional vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic translocation resulting in the delivery of herpesvirus capsids into the cytosol. Budding of the (nucleo)capsid at and scission from the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC) resulting in a transiently enveloped virus particle in the perinuclear space followed by fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The dimeric NEC oligomerizes into a honeycomb-shaped coat underlining the INM to induce membrane curvature and scission. Mutational analyses complemented structural data defining functionally important regions. Questions remain, including where and when the NEC is formed and how membrane curvature is mediated, vesicle formation is regulated, and directionality is secured. The composition of the primary enveloped virion and the machinery mediating fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM is still debated. While NEC-mediated budding apparently follows a highly conserved mechanism, species and/or cell typeâ€“specific differences complicate understanding of later steps.", "generated_text": "Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV), have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to navigate the complex process of nuclear egress, a critical step in their replication cycle. Central to this process is the nuclear egress complex (NEC), which orchestrates the formation and release of primary enveloped virions (PEVs) from the nucleus. Despite significant advances in understanding the roles of NEC components in mediating nuclear membrane fusion and PEV budding, numerous questions remain regarding the precise molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms involved. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the herpesvirus nuclear egress pathway, highlighting the contributions of the NEC to viral replication and the challenges in elucidating the detailed mechanisms of nuclear membrane remodeling. By integrating findings from HSV and PRV studies, we aim to identify key unknowns in the field and propose directions for future research to enhance our understanding of herpesvirus biology and inform the development of novel antiviral strategies.", "label": 1}
