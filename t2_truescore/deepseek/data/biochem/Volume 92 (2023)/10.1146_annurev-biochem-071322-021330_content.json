{"grounding": "The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are abundant polycations of vital importance in mammalian cells. Their cellular levels are tightly regulated by degradation and synthesis, as well as by uptake and export. Here, we discuss the delicate balance between the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of polyamines in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyamine levels decline with aging and are altered in patients with PD, whereas recent mechanistic studies on ATP13A2 (PARK9) demonstrated a driving role of a disturbed polyamine homeostasis in PD. Polyamines affect pathways in PD pathogenesis, such as α-synuclein aggregation, and influence PD-related processes like autophagy, heavy metal toxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and lysosomal/mitochondrial dysfunction. We formulate outstanding research questions regarding the role of polyamines in PD, their potential as PD biomarkers, and possible therapeutic strategies for PD targeting polyamine homeostasis.", "generated_text": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates. Polyamines, small aliphatic molecules involved in various cellular processes, have emerged as significant players in the pathogenesis of PD. This study explores the dual role of polyamines in PD, highlighting their potential to induce neurotoxicity through mechanisms involving endo/lysosomal dysfunction and mitochondrial impairment, while also considering their neuroprotective effects mediated by astrocyte activation. The intricate balance between these opposing actions of polyamines is crucial for understanding their impact on PD progression. By examining the interplay between polyamines, α-synuclein pathology, and cellular stress responses, this research aims to shed light on novel therapeutic strategies targeting polyamine metabolism to mitigate neurodegeneration in PD.", "label": 1}
