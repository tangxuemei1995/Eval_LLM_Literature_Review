{"grounding": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translational efficiency are two crucial aspects of the post-transcriptional process that profoundly impact protein production in a cell. While it is widely known that ribosomes produce proteins, studies during the past decade have surprisingly revealed that ribosomes also control mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner, a process referred to as codon optimality. Therefore, codons, the three-nucleotide words read by the ribosome, have a potent effect on mRNA stability and provide cis-regulatory information that extends beyond the amino acids they encode. While the codon optimality molecular mechanism is still unclear, the translation elongation rate appears to trigger mRNA decay. Thus, transfer RNAs emerge as potential master gene regulators affecting mRNA stability. Furthermore, while few factors related to codon optimality have been identified in yeast, the orthologous genes in vertebrates do not necessary share the same functions. Here, we discuss codon optimality findings and gene regulation layers related to codon composition in different eukaryotic species.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between translation and mRNA stability is a pivotal aspect of gene expression regulation. This study delves into the mechanisms by which codon optimality and tRNA abundance influence translation elongation rates and, consequently, mRNA decay. Codon usage, a critical factor in translation efficiency, is examined for its role in modulating mRNA stability through the recruitment of specific decay factors. By analyzing the interplay between codon optimality and tRNA availability, we uncover how these elements collectively impact the stability of mRNA transcripts. Our findings highlight the significance of translation elongation as a determinant of mRNA lifespan, offering insights into the complex regulatory networks that govern gene expression. This research underscores the importance of codon usage and tRNA dynamics in the control of mRNA stability, providing a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying protein synthesis and mRNA degradation.", "label": 1}
