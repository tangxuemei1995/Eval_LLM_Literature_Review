{"grounding": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and other genotoxic stresses induce bulky DNA lesions, which threaten genome stability and cell viability. Cells have evolved two main repair pathways to remove such lesions: global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The modes by which these subpathways recognize DNA lesions are distinct, but they converge onto the same downstream steps for DNA repair. Here, we first summarize the current understanding of these repair mechanisms, specifically focusing on the roles of stalled RNA polymerase II, Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), CSA and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) in TC-NER. We also discuss the intriguing role of protein ubiquitylation in this process. Additionally, we highlight key aspects of the effect of UV irradiation on transcription and describe the role of signaling cascades in orchestrating this response. Finally, we describe the pathogenic mechanisms underlying xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, the two main diseases linked to mutations in NER factors.", "generated_text": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a critical DNA repair mechanism that specifically targets lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes, ensuring the rapid removal of DNA damage that impedes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) progression. This process is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing the accumulation of mutations that can lead to cellular dysfunction and disease. TC-NER operates in conjunction with global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), which surveys the entire genome for damage. The interplay between TC-NER and the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage highlights the complexity of cellular mechanisms that protect against the deleterious effects of environmental stressors. Defects in TC-NER are associated with severe human disorders, such as Cockayne syndrome, underscoring the importance of this repair pathway in human health. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of TC-NER, its role in the transcriptional response to DNA damage, and the implications of TC-NER dysfunction in disease.", "label": 1}
