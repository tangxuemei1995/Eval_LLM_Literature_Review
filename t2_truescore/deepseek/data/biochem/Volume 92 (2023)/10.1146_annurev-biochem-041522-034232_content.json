{"grounding": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR), discovered as preferential nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers located in transcribed mammalian genes compared to those in nontranscribed regions of the genome, is defined as faster repair of the transcribed strand versus the nontranscribed strand in transcribed genes. The phenomenon, universal in model organisms including Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, mice, and humans, involves a translocase that interacts with both RNA polymerase stalled at damage in the transcribed strand and nucleotide excision repair proteins to accelerate repair. Drosophila, a notable exception, exhibits TCR but lacks an obvious TCR translocase. Mutations inactivating TCR genes cause increased damage-induced mutagenesis in E. coli and severe neurological and UV sensitivity syndromes in humans. To date, only E. coli TCR has been reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins. Detailed investigations of TCR using genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, cryoâ€“electron microscopy, single-molecule analysis, and other approaches have revealed fascinating mechanisms.", "generated_text": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a vital cellular mechanism that preferentially removes bulky DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes, ensuring genomic integrity and preventing mutagenesis. This process is facilitated by transcription-repair coupling factors such as Mfd in prokaryotes and CSB in eukaryotes, which recognize stalled RNA polymerase at the site of damage and recruit the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying TCR, highlighting the intricate interplay between transcription and DNA repair pathways. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a connection between TCR and the circadian clock, indicating that DNA repair processes may be temporally regulated to optimize genomic maintenance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of TCR, emphasizing the roles of key factors, the impact of TCR on mutagenesis, and its potential regulation by the circadian clock, providing insights into the complex network of DNA damage response and repair.", "label": 1}
