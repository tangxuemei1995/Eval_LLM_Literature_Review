{"grounding": "The insulin receptor (IR) is a type II receptor tyrosine kinase that plays essential roles in metabolism, growth, and proliferation. Dysregulation of IR signaling is linked to many human diseases, such as diabetes and cancers. The resolution revolution in cryoâ€“electron microscopy has led to the determination of several structures of IR with different numbers of bound insulin molecules in recent years, which have tremendously improved our understanding of how IR is activated by insulin. Here, we review the insulin-induced activation mechanism of IR, including (a) the detailed binding modes and functions of insulin at site 1 and site 2 and (b) the insulin-induced structural transitions that are required for IR activation. We highlight several other key aspects of the activation and regulation of IR signaling and discuss the remaining gaps in our understanding of the IR activation mechanism and potential avenues of future research.", "generated_text": "The insulin receptor (IR) plays a pivotal role in metabolic regulation, with its activation being crucial for insulin signaling. This study delves into the structural intricacies of IR activation, employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate the molecular dynamics at play. We focus on the interaction between insulin and its receptor, particularly at insulin-binding site 1 and insulin-binding site 2, which are critical for the receptor's conformational changes leading to activation. Our findings reveal a detailed mechanism by which insulin binding induces a structural rearrangement in the IR, transitioning it from an inactive to an active state. This structural perspective not only enhances our understanding of IR activation but also provides a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting insulin signaling pathways. The implications of these findings extend to the treatment of diabetes and other metabolic disorders, offering new avenues for intervention.", "label": 1}
