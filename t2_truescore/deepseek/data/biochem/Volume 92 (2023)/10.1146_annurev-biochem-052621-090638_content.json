{"grounding": "Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes use a site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] cluster and SAM to initiate radical reactions through liberation of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl (5′-dAdo•) radical. They form the largest enzyme superfamily, with more than 700,000 unique sequences currently, and their numbers continue to grow as a result of ongoing bioinformatics efforts. The range of extremely diverse, highly regio- and stereo-specific reactions known to be catalyzed by radical SAM superfamily members is remarkable. The common mechanism of radical initiation in the radical SAM superfamily is the focus of this review. Most surprising is the presence of an organometallic intermediate, Ω, exhibiting an Fe–C5′-adenosyl bond. Regioselective reductive cleavage of the SAM S–C5′ bond produces 5′-dAdo• to form Ω, with the regioselectivity originating in the Jahn–Teller effect. Ω liberates the free 5′-dAdo• as the catalytically active intermediate through homolysis of the Fe–C5′ bond, in analogy to Co–C5′ bond homolysis in B12, which was once viewed as biology's choice of radical generator.", "generated_text": "The Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme superfamily represents a diverse group of enzymes that catalyze a wide range of biochemical reactions through the generation of radical species. Central to their mechanism is the reductive cleavage of SAM to produce a highly reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (5′-dA•), which initiates substrate turnover by abstracting a hydrogen atom. This process is facilitated by a unique [4Fe-4S] cluster that coordinates SAM in a bidentate manner, positioning it for electron transfer from the reduced cluster to the sulfonium of SAM. The resulting organometallic intermediate, featuring a direct iron-carbon bond, is a key species in the radical generation pathway. This review delves into the structural and mechanistic insights into the radical initiation process, highlighting the role of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, the nature of the organometallic intermediate, and the subsequent steps leading to the formation of the 5′-dA• radical. Understanding these mechanisms provides a foundation for exploring the vast catalytic potential of the radical SAM enzyme superfamily in both natural and synthetic contexts.", "label": 1}
