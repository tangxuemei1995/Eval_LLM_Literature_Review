{"grounding": "Over the past decade, mRNA modifications have emerged as important regulators of gene expression control in cells. Fueled in large part by the development of tools for detecting RNA modifications transcriptome wide, researchers have uncovered a diverse epitranscriptome that serves as an additional layer of gene regulation beyond simple RNA sequence. Here, we review the proteins that write, read, and erase these marks, with a particular focus on the most abundant internal modification, N\n6-methyladenosine (m6A). We first describe the discovery of the key enzymes that deposit and remove m6A and other modifications and discuss how our understanding of these proteins has shaped our views of modification dynamics. We then review current models for the function of m6A reader proteins and how our knowledge of these proteins has evolved. Finally, we highlight important future directions for the field and discuss key questions that remain unanswered.", "generated_text": "The dynamic landscape of mRNA modifications, known as the epitranscriptome, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular function. Among these modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) stands out as the most prevalent and well-studied. This review focuses on the proteins involved in the m6A modification process, categorized into three functional groups: writers, readers, and erasers. Writers, such as methyltransferases, are responsible for adding m6A marks to mRNA, while erasers, including demethylases, remove these marks, thereby reversing the modification. Readers, on the other hand, recognize and bind to m6A-modified mRNAs, influencing their fate and function. Understanding the interplay between these proteins offers insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms of the epitranscriptome and its implications in health and disease. This synthesis of current knowledge highlights the significance of m6A modification proteins in the broader context of RNA biology and their potential as therapeutic targets.", "label": 1}
