{"grounding": "In this autobiographical article, I reflect on my Swedish background. Then I discuss endogenous DNA alterations and the base excision repair pathway and alternative repair strategies for some unusual DNA lesions. Endogenous DNA damage, such as loss of purine bases and cytosine deamination, is proposed as a major source of cancer-causing mutations.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical account explores the intricate relationship between DNA fragility and repair mechanisms, focusing on endogenous DNA damage and base excision repair. Highlighting the role of DNA glycosylases in correcting base lesions, it reflects on how understanding these processes has illuminated pathways leading to cancer mutations, offering a personal perspective on decades of research.", "label": 0}
