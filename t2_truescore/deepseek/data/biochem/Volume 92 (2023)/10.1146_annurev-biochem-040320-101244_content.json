{"grounding": "Carbon fixation is the process by which CO2 is converted from a gas into biomass. The Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle (CBB) is the dominant carbon-consuming pathway on Earth, driving >99.5% of the ∼120 billion tons of carbon that are converted to sugar by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The carboxylase enzyme in the CBB, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), fixes one CO2 molecule per turn of the cycle into bioavailable sugars. Despite being critical to the assimilation of carbon, rubisco's kinetic rate is not very fast, limiting flux through the pathway. This bottleneck presents a paradox: Why has rubisco not evolved to be a better catalyst? Many hypothesize that the catalytic mechanism of rubisco is subject to one or more trade-offs and that rubisco variants have been optimized for their native physiological environment. Here, we review the evolution and biochemistry of rubisco through the lens of structure and mechanism in order to understand what trade-offs limit its improvement. We also review the many attempts to improve rubisco itself and thereby promote plant growth.", "generated_text": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) plays a pivotal role in the Calvin cycle, facilitating the primary step of carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. Despite its critical function, Rubisco's efficiency is hampered by its dual activity, catalyzing both carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, the latter leading to photorespiration and reduced photosynthetic efficiency. This review explores the evolutionary trajectory of Rubisco, highlighting the enzyme's adaptation to varying atmospheric CO2 and O2 concentrations over geological timescales. Furthermore, we delve into the latest advancements in enzyme engineering aimed at enhancing Rubisco's carboxylation efficiency and specificity. Through directed evolution, rational design, and synthetic biology approaches, researchers are striving to overcome the inherent limitations of Rubisco, paving the way for improved photosynthetic efficiency and crop productivity. The potential implications of these engineering efforts for sustainable agriculture and carbon sequestration are also discussed, underscoring the importance of Rubisco in addressing global challenges related to food security and climate change.", "label": 1}
