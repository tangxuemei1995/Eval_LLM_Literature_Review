{"grounding": "According to the endosymbiotic theory, most of the DNA of the original bacterial endosymbiont has been lost or transferred to the nucleus, leaving a much smaller (âˆ¼16 kb in mammals), circular molecule that is the present-day mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The ability of mtDNA to escape mitochondria and integrate into the nuclear genome was discovered in budding yeast, along with genes that regulate this process. Mitochondria have emerged as key regulators of innate immunity, and it is now recognized that mtDNA released into the cytoplasm, outside of the cell, or into circulation activates multiple innate immune signaling pathways. Here, we first review the mechanisms through which mtDNA is released into the cytoplasm, including several inducible mitochondrial pores and defective mitophagy or autophagy. Next, we cover how the different forms of released mtDNA activate specific innate immune nucleic acid sensors and inflammasomes. Finally, we discuss how intracellular and extracellular mtDNA release, including circulating cell-free mtDNA that promotes systemic inflammation, are implicated in human diseases, bacterial and viral infections, senescence and aging.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays a pivotal role in innate immune signaling, acting as a key mediator in the body's response to cellular stress and infection. This review explores the mechanisms by which mtDNA is released into the cytosol and extracellular space, focusing on the formation of mitochondrial pores as a critical step in this process. Once released, mtDNA can be recognized by DNA sensors, triggering inflammatory pathways that are essential for host defense but can also contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases. We discuss the dual role of mtDNA in both protecting against and exacerbating disease, highlighting the delicate balance between beneficial immune activation and harmful inflammation. By examining the latest research on mtDNA release and its implications for disease, this review aims to shed light on potential therapeutic targets for modulating innate immune responses and mitigating disease progression.", "label": 1}
