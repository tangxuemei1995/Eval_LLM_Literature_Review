{"grounding": "Ligands of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway are paracrine signaling molecules that coordinate tissue development in metazoans. A remarkable feature of HH signaling is the repeated use of cholesterol in steps spanning ligand biogenesis, secretion, dispersal, and reception on target cells. A cholesterol molecule covalently attached to HH ligands is used as a molecular baton by transfer proteins to guide their secretion, spread, and reception. On target cells, a signaling circuit composed of a cholesterol transporter and sensor regulates transmission of HH signals across the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The repeated use of cholesterol in signaling supports the view that the HH pathway likely evolved by coopting ancient systems to regulate the abundance or organization of sterol-like lipids in membranes.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay between cholesterol and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways plays a pivotal role in cellular development and homeostasis. Cholesterol, a critical component of biological membranes, is essential for the proper functioning of the Hh signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and tissue regeneration. This pathway is mediated through the primary cilium, a cellular organelle that acts as a signaling hub. Cholesterol modification of the Hh proteins is necessary for their activation and subsequent interaction with cell surface receptors, including the G proteinâ€“coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO). This review highlights the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol influences Hh signaling, emphasizing the importance of cholesterol in the regulation of Hh pathway activity and its implications for understanding developmental disorders and cancer.", "label": 1}
