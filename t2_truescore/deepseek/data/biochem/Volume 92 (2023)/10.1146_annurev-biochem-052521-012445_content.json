{"grounding": "Formation of the 3′ end of a eukaryotic mRNA is a key step in the production of a mature transcript. This process is mediated by a number of protein factors that cleave the pre-mRNA, add a poly(A) tail, and regulate transcription by protein dephosphorylation. Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) in humans, or cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) in yeast, coordinates these enzymatic activities with each other, with RNA recognition, and with transcription. The site of pre-mRNA cleavage can strongly influence the translation, stability, and localization of the mRNA. Hence, cleavage site selection is highly regulated. The length of the poly(A) tail is also controlled to ensure that every transcript has a similar tail when it is exported from the nucleus. In this review, we summarize new mechanistic insights into mRNA 3′-end processing obtained through structural studies and biochemical reconstitution and outline outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, involving the cleavage and polyadenylation of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to produce mature mRNA. This process is facilitated by a complex machinery comprising endonucleases, poly(A) polymerases, and a multitude of associated factors that recognize specific sequence elements within the pre-mRNA. The addition of the poly(A) tail not only stabilizes the mRNA but also plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, influencing mRNA export, translation efficiency, and decay. Recent studies have shed light on the intricate regulatory mechanisms that govern 3′-end processing, including the interplay between transcription and processing machineries, and the impact of processing defects on cellular function and disease. Understanding the molecular details of 3′-end processing offers insights into the control of gene expression and the development of therapeutic strategies targeting mRNA processing.", "label": 1}
