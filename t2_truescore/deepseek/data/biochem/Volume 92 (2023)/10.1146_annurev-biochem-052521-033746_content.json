{"grounding": "Thiolases are CoA-dependent enzymes that catalyze the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA, as well as its reverse reaction, which is the thioester-dependent Claisen condensation reaction. Thiolases are dimers or tetramers (dimers of dimers). All thiolases have two reactive cysteines: (a) a nucleophilic cysteine, which forms a covalent intermediate, and (b) an acid/base cysteine. The best characterized thiolase is the Zoogloea ramigera thiolase, which is a bacterial biosynthetic thiolase belonging to the CT-thiolase subfamily. The thiolase active site is also characterized by two oxyanion holes, two active site waters, and four catalytic loops with characteristic amino acid sequence fingerprints. Three thiolase subfamilies can be identified, each characterized by a unique sequence fingerprint for one of their catalytic loops, which causes unique active site properties. Recent insights concerning the thiolase reaction mechanism, as obtained from recent structural studies, as well as from classical and recent enzymological studies, are addressed, and open questions are discussed.", "generated_text": "Thiolase enzymes play a pivotal role in biochemistry, leveraging coenzyme A (CoA)–thioester chemistry to facilitate the making and breaking of carbon–carbon (C–C) bonds. This review delves into the structural and mechanistic intricacies of thiolases, highlighting their versatility as biocatalysts in various metabolic pathways, including the Claisen condensation reaction. Central to their function is the oxyanion hole, a structural feature that stabilizes transition states during catalysis. Additionally, the hydrogen-bond network and proton wire mechanisms are crucial for the precise transfer of protons, ensuring the efficiency and specificity of thiolase-catalyzed reactions. By exploring the interplay between these elements, this study sheds light on the sophisticated design of thiolases, offering insights into their potential applications in synthetic biology and industrial biocatalysis. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of thiolase activity not only advances our knowledge of enzyme mechanisms but also opens new avenues for the development of bio-based chemical processes.", "label": 1}
