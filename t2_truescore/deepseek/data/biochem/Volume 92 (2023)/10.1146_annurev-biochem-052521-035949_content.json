{"grounding": "Chemical modifications on mRNA represent a critical layer of gene expression regulation. Research in this area has continued to accelerate over the last decade, as more modifications are being characterized with increasing depth and breadth. mRNA modifications have been demonstrated to influence nearly every step from the early phases of transcript synthesis in the nucleus through to their decay in the cytoplasm, but in many cases, the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes remain mysterious. Here, we highlight recent work that has elucidated the roles of mRNA modifications throughout the mRNA life cycle, describe gaps in our understanding and remaining open questions, and offer some forward-looking perspective on future directions in the field.", "generated_text": "The regulation of mRNA by RNA modifications represents a pivotal aspect of posttranscriptional gene expression control, intricately linking the epitranscriptome to RNA metabolism. This study delves into the dynamic landscape of RNA modifications, including but not limited to N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and pseudouridine (Ψ), and their profound impact on mRNA stability, splicing, transport, and translation. By employing advanced sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, we uncover the complex regulatory networks governed by these modifications, highlighting their roles in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis. Our findings underscore the significance of RNA modifications in fine-tuning gene expression and offer insights into the therapeutic potential of targeting the epitranscriptome for the treatment of various diseases.", "label": 1}
