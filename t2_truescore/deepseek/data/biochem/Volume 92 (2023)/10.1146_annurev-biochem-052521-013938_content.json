{"grounding": "DNA-editing enzymes perform chemical reactions on DNA nucleobases. These reactions can change the genetic identity of the modified base or modulate gene expression. Interest in DNA-editing enzymes has burgeoned in recent years due to the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems, which can be used to direct their DNA-editing activity to specific genomic loci of interest. In this review, we showcase DNA-editing enzymes that have been repurposed or redesigned and developed into programmable base editors. These include deaminases, glycosylases, methyltransferases, and demethylases. We highlight the astounding degree to which these enzymes have been redesigned, evolved, and refined and present these collective engineering efforts as a paragon for future efforts to repurpose and engineer other families of enzymes. Collectively, base editors derived from these DNA-editing enzymes facilitate programmable point mutation introduction and gene expression modulation by targeted chemical modification of nucleobases.", "generated_text": "The advent of DNA-editing enzymes as base editors has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision in the modification of nucleic acids. This research delves into the design and application of these enzymes, focusing on the roles of deaminases, methyltransferases, demethylases, and glycosylases in the targeted alteration of DNA bases. Through advanced protein engineering techniques, these enzymes have been optimized for enhanced specificity, efficiency, and reduced off-target effects, enabling their application in a wide range of genetic contexts. The study highlights the potential of base editors in therapeutic interventions, agricultural improvements, and the elucidation of genetic mechanisms, underscoring their significance in advancing our understanding and manipulation of the genetic code. This abstract encapsulates the cutting-edge developments in the field, presenting a comprehensive overview of the current state and future prospects of DNA-editing enzymes as base editors.", "label": 0}
