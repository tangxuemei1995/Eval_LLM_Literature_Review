{"grounding": "Since the early 1990s, single-molecule detection in solution at room temperature has enabled direct observation of single biomolecules at work in real time and under physiological conditions, providing insights into complex biological systems that the traditional ensemble methods cannot offer. In particular, recent advances in single-molecule tracking techniques allow researchers to follow individual biomolecules in their native environments for a timescale of seconds to minutes, revealing not only the distinct pathways these biomolecules take for downstream signaling but also their roles in supporting life. In this review, we discuss various single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques developed to date, with an emphasis on advanced three-dimensional (3D) tracking systems that not only achieve ultrahigh spatiotemporal resolution but also provide sufficient working depths suitable for tracking single molecules in 3D tissue models. We then summarize the observables that can be extracted from the trajectory data. Methods to perform single-molecule clustering analysis and future directions are also discussed.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to observe and analyze the dynamic behaviors of individual molecules within complex biological systems. This review highlights the development and application of cutting-edge methodologies, including feedback-control tracking, which allows for the precise monitoring of fast-moving molecules by dynamically adjusting the imaging parameters in real-time. Point-spread-function engineering has emerged as a powerful tool to improve spatial resolution and localization accuracy, enabling the detailed observation of molecular interactions at the nanoscale. Furthermore, multiple plane microscopy has been instrumental in capturing three-dimensional trajectories of molecules, providing deeper insights into their spatial dynamics. Advanced trajectory and clustering analysis techniques have also been developed, facilitating the interpretation of complex molecular behaviors and interactions. These technological innovations not only deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms but also open new avenues for research in biophysics, cell biology, and nanotechnology.", "label": 1}
