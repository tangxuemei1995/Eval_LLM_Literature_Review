{"grounding": "Offering superb speed, chemical specificity, and analytical sensitivity, direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies are highly amenable for the molecular analysis of complex tissues to aid in disease characterization and help identify new diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers. By enabling detection of clinically actionable molecular profiles from tissues and cells, direct MS technologies have the potential to guide treatment decisions and transform sample analysis within clinical workflows. In this review, we highlight recent health-related developments and applications of direct MS technologies that exhibit tangible potential to accelerate clinical research and disease diagnosis, including oncological and neurodegenerative diseases and microbial infections. We focus primarily on applications that employ direct MS technologies for tissue analysis, including MS imaging technologies to map spatial distributions of molecules in situ as well as handheld devices for rapid in vivo and ex vivo tissue analysis.", "generated_text": "Direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies have revolutionized tissue analysis, offering unprecedented insights into molecular compositions with high specificity and sensitivity. This review highlights the advances and emerging medical applications of direct MS technologies, including mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and ambient ionization techniques, for tissue analysis. These technologies enable the direct analysis of tissue samples without extensive preparation, facilitating rapid and accurate clinical diagnostics. The integration of handheld MS-based devices into clinical settings is particularly promising, offering the potential for real-time, on-site tissue analysis. This capability is crucial for intraoperative decision-making and personalized medicine, where immediate tissue characterization can significantly impact patient outcomes. Furthermore, the application of direct MS technologies in cancer research, infectious disease diagnostics, and drug distribution studies underscores their versatility and potential to transform medical diagnostics and research. As these technologies continue to evolve, their role in advancing medical science and improving patient care is expected to grow exponentially.", "label": 1}
