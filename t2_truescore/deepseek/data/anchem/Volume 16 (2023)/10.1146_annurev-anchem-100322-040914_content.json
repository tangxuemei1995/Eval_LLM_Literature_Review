{"grounding": "The goal of protecting the health of future generations is a blueprint for future biosensor design. Systems-level decision support requires that biosensors provide meaningful service to society. In this review, we summarize recent developments in cyber physical systems and biosensors connected with decision support. We identify key processes and practices that may guide the establishment of connections between user needs and biosensor engineering using an informatics approach. We call for data science and decision science to be formally connected with sensor science for understanding system complexity and realizing the ambition of biosensors-as-a-service. This review calls for a focus on quality of service early in the design process as a means to improve the meaningful value of a given biosensor. We close by noting that technology development, including biosensors and decision support systems, is a cautionary tale. The economics of scale govern the success, or failure, of any biosensor system.", "generated_text": "In the era of a connected world, the integration of biosensors into system-level support frameworks presents a transformative approach to enhancing decision-making processes, ensuring meaningful use of technology, and improving the quality of service across various domains. This research explores the pivotal role of biosensors in creating a knowledge network that facilitates real-time data acquisition, analysis, and dissemination. By leveraging the capabilities of biosensors, we propose a comprehensive model that supports decision-making through accurate, timely, and context-aware information. The study delves into the challenges and opportunities of embedding biosensors within existing infrastructures, focusing on optimizing the quality of service while adhering to principles of meaningful use. Through a series of case studies and empirical analyses, we demonstrate how biosensor-enabled knowledge networks can revolutionize healthcare, environmental monitoring, and personalized services, ultimately contributing to a more informed, efficient, and connected society.", "label": 0}
