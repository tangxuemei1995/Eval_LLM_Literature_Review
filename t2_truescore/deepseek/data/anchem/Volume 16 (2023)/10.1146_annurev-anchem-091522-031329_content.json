{"grounding": "Recent developments in ion mobility (IM) technology have expanded the capability to separate and characterize gas-phase ions of biomolecules, especially when paired with mass spectrometry. This next generation of IM technology has been ushered in by creative innovation focused on both instrument architectures and how electric fields are applied. In this review, we focus on the application of high-resolution and multidimensional IM to biomolecular analyses, encompassing the fields of glycomics, lipidomics, peptidomics, and proteomics. We highlight selected research that demonstrates the application of the new IM toolkit to challenging biomolecular systems. Through our review of recently published literature, we outline the current strengths of respective technologies and perspectives for future applications.", "generated_text": "The integration of next-generation ion mobility (IM) techniques with mass spectrometry (MS) has revolutionized the field of multidimensional analysis, offering unprecedented depth in the study of biomolecules. This advancement facilitates enhanced molecular identification and structural elucidation, addressing the complexity and diversity of biological samples.
