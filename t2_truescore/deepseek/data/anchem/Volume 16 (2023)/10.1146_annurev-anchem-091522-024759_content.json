{"grounding": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect tropical and subtropical countries and are caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. These kinds of diseases spread quickly due to the tropical climate and limited access to clean water, sanitation, and health care, which make exposed people more vulnerable. NTDs are reported to be difficult and inefficient to diagnose. As mentioned, most NTDs occur in countries that are socially vulnerable, and the lack of resources and access to modern laboratories and equipment intensify the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment, leading to an increase in the mortality rate. Portable and low-cost microfluidic systems have been widely applied for clinical diagnosis, offering a promising alternative that can meet the needs for fast, affordable, and reliable diagnostic tests in developing countries. This review provides a critical overview of microfluidic devices that have been reported in the literature for the detection of the most common NTDs over the past 5 years.", "generated_text": "Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) continue to pose significant health challenges in low-resource settings, primarily due to the lack of affordable and accessible diagnostic tools. This research explores the development of low-cost microfluidic systems for the detection of NTDs, leveraging advancements in paper-based microfluidics, lateral flow assays, and immunochromatographic tests. By integrating enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques with point-of-care testing (POCT) platforms, we aim to create highly sensitive, specific, and user-friendly diagnostic devices. These systems are designed to operate with minimal infrastructure, making them ideal for deployment in remote and underserved areas. The study highlights the potential of microfluidic technologies to revolutionize clinical diagnosis of NTDs, offering a cost-effective solution that could significantly improve disease management and control strategies. Through this work, we contribute to the global effort to combat NTDs by providing a scalable and sustainable approach to early detection and intervention.", "label": 1}
