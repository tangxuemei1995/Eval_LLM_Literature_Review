{"grounding": "In situ water monitoring sensors are critical to gain an understanding of ocean biochemistry and ecosystem health. They enable the collection of high-frequency data and capture ecosystem spatial and temporal changes, which in turn facilitate long-term global predictions. They are used as decision support tools in emergency situations and for risk mitigation, pollution source tracking, and regulatory monitoring. Advanced sensing platforms exist to support various monitoring needs together with state-of-the-art power and communication capabilities. To be fit-for-purpose, sensors must withstand the challenging marine environment and provide data at an acceptable cost. Significant technological advancements have catalyzed the development of new and improved sensors for coastal and oceanographic applications. Sensors are becoming smaller, smarter, more cost-effective, and increasingly specialized and diversified. This article, therefore, provides a review of the state-of-the art oceanographic and coastal sensors. Progress in sensor development is discussed in terms of performance and the key strategies used for achieving robustness, marine rating, cost reduction, and antifouling protection.", "generated_text": "The monitoring of coastal and oceanic environments is crucial for understanding marine ecosystems, predicting natural disasters, and managing human activities. This review focuses on the advancements and applications of in situ sensors for coastal and ocean monitoring. In situ sensors, deployed directly in the marine environment, provide real-time data on various parameters such as temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen, essential for oceanographic research and environmental monitoring. The integration of these sensors into sensor networks has significantly enhanced data collection, enabling comprehensive spatial and temporal analysis of marine conditions. However, challenges such as biofouling, which can impair sensor accuracy and longevity, remain a significant concern. This paper discusses the latest developments in sensor technology, strategies for mitigating biofouling, and the role of sensor networks in advancing oceanographic studies. The review highlights the importance of continuous innovation in sensor technology to improve the reliability and efficiency of coastal and ocean monitoring systems.", "label": 1}
