{"grounding": "In recent years, there has been a revived appreciation for the importance of spatial context and morphological phenotypes for both understanding disease progression and guiding treatment decisions. Compared with conventional 2D histopathology, which is the current gold standard of medical diagnostics, nondestructive 3D pathology offers researchers and clinicians the ability to visualize orders of magnitude more tissue within their natural volumetric context. This has been enabled by rapid advances in tissue-preparation methods, high-throughput 3D microscopy instrumentation, and computational tools for processing these massive feature-rich data sets. Here, we provide a brief overview of many of these technical advances along with remaining challenges to be overcome. We also speculate on the future of 3D pathology as applied in translational investigations, preclinical drug development, and clinical decision-support assays.", "generated_text": "The advent of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has revolutionized the field of pathology by enabling nondestructive, three-dimensional (3D) imaging of biological specimens with unprecedented speed and resolution. This technique, rooted in optical-sectioning microscopy, offers a powerful tool for computational and digital pathology, facilitating the detailed analysis of tissue architecture and cellular interactions in their native spatial context. By integrating LSFM with advanced computational algorithms, researchers can now extract quantitative, high-dimensional data from complex biological systems, paving the way for breakthroughs in spatial biology and precision medicine. This abstract highlights the transformative potential of LSFM in translational research and clinical assays, underscoring its role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, understanding disease mechanisms, and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies. The convergence of LSFM with computational pathology heralds a new era in biomedical research, where 3D pathology becomes a cornerstone of clinical decision-making and patient care.", "label": 0}
