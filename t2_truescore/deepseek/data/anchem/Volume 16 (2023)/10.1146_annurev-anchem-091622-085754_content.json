{"grounding": "Label-free electrochemical biosensing leverages the advantages of label-free techniques, low cost, and fewer user steps, with the sensitivity and portability of electrochemical analysis. In this review, we identify four label-free electrochemical biosensing mechanisms: (a) blocking the electrode surface, (b) allowing greater access to the electrode surface, (c) changing the intercalation or electrostatic affinity of a redox probe to a biorecognition unit, and (d) modulating ion or electron transport properties due to conformational and surface charge changes. Each mechanism is described, recent advancements are summarized, and relative advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are discussed. Furthermore, two avenues for gaining further diagnostic information from label-free electrochemical biosensors, through multiplex analysis and incorporating machine learning, are examined.", "generated_text": "Label-free electrochemical methods have emerged as a powerful tool in the field of disease detection, offering a blend of sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity. These techniques leverage the intrinsic electrochemical properties of biological molecules, eliminating the need for labels or tags, thus streamlining the diagnostic process. By focusing on the direct interaction between the target analyte and the electrode surface, label-free electrochemical biosensors facilitate real-time monitoring and rapid detection of diseases. This review highlights the principles, advancements, and applications of label-free electrochemical methods in diagnostics, underscoring their potential in early disease detection and personalized medicine. The integration of these methods with nanotechnology and microfluidics is also discussed, pointing towards future directions in analytical chemistry and biosensing.", "label": 1}
