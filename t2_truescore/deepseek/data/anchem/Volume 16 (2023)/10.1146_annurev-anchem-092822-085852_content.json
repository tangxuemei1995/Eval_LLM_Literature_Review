{"grounding": "Cell functions rely on signal transductionâ€”the cascades of molecular interactions and biochemical reactions that relay extracellular signals to the cell interior. Dissecting principles governing the signal transduction process is critical for the fundamental understanding of cell physiology and the development of biomedical interventions. The complexity of cell signaling is, however, beyond what is accessible by conventional biochemistry assays. Thanks to their unique physical and chemical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly used for the quantitative measurement and manipulation of cell signaling. Even though research in this area is still in its infancy, it has the potential to yield new, paradigm-shifting knowledge of cell biology and lead to biomedical innovations. To highlight this importance, we summarize in this review studies that pioneered the development and application of NPs for cell signaling, from quantitative measurements of signaling molecules to spatiotemporal manipulation of cell signal transduction.", "generated_text": "This study explores the innovative application of nanoparticles in the interrogation of cell signaling pathways, leveraging their unique properties for intracellular sensing, magnetic and optical manipulation, and quantitative imaging. Nanoparticles, due to their nanoscale dimensions and modifiable surfaces, offer unprecedented opportunities for the precise detection and manipulation of cellular processes. By integrating magnetic and optical functionalities, these particles enable the targeted delivery of probes to specific intracellular locations, facilitating the real-time monitoring of signaling events with high spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, the use of nanoparticles in quantitative imaging allows for the accurate measurement of signaling molecule concentrations, providing insights into the dynamics of cellular communication. This research highlights the potential of nanoparticles as versatile tools in cell biology, offering new avenues for understanding the complex networks of cell signaling and their implications in health and disease.", "label": 1}
