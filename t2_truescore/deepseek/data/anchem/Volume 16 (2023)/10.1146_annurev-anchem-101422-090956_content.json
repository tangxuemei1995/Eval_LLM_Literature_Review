{"grounding": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging records spatially resolved molecular vibrational spectra, enabling a comprehensive measurement of the chemical makeup and heterogeneity of biological tissues. Combining this novel contrast mechanism in microscopy with the use of artificial intelligence can transform the practice of histopathology, which currently relies largely on human examination of morphologic patterns within stained tissue. First, this review summarizes IR imaging instrumentation especially suited to histopathology, analyses of its performance, and major trends. Second, an overview of data processing methods and application of machine learning is given, with an emphasis on the emerging use of deep learning. Third, a discussion on workflows in pathology is provided, with four categories proposed based on the complexity of methods and the analytical performance needed. Last, a set of guidelines, termed experimental and analytical specifications for spectroscopic imaging in histopathology, are proposed to help standardize the diversity of approaches in this emerging area.", "generated_text": "The integration of infrared spectroscopic imaging with digital histopathology represents a transformative approach in the analysis of tissue samples, offering a non-destructive, label-free method to obtain detailed chemical and molecular information. This technique leverages the unique absorption spectra of molecular vibrations in the mid-infrared region, enabling the visualization of tissue architecture and composition at a microscopic level. The advent of machine learning and deep learning algorithms has further enhanced the capability of infrared spectroscopic imaging by facilitating the automated classification and interpretation of complex spectral data, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This paper reviews the principles of infrared spectroscopic imaging, its application in digital pathology, and the role of advanced computational methods in analyzing the vast datasets generated. The potential of this technology to revolutionize histopathological analysis by providing a comprehensive, chemical imaging-based diagnostic tool is discussed, highlighting its implications for personalized medicine and the future of pathology.", "label": 1}
