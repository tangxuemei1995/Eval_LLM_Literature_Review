{"grounding": "Biofilms are multicellular communities held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix and exhibit a set of properties that distinguish them from free-living bacteria. Biofilms are exposed to a variety of mechanical and chemical cues resulting from fluid motion and mass transport. Microfluidics provides the precise control of hydrodynamic and physicochemical microenvironments to study biofilms in general. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in microfluidics-based biofilm research, including understanding the mechanism of bacterial adhesion and biofilm development, assessment of antifouling and antimicrobial properties, development of advanced in vitro infection models, and advancement in methods to characterize biofilms. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future direction of microfluidics-assisted biofilm research.", "generated_text": "Microfluidics has emerged as a pivotal technology in biofilm studies, offering unparalleled insights into flow dynamics and shear stress effects on biofilm formation and behavior. This review highlights the application of microfluidic devices for in situ visualization of biofilms, enabling real-time monitoring of their development and response to environmental stimuli. The integration of organ-on-chip models and biosensors within microfluidic platforms has facilitated the study of biofilm-associated antimicrobial resistance and the evaluation of novel antifouling strategies. By mimicking physiological conditions, these advanced systems provide a deeper understanding of biofilm mechanics and interactions, paving the way for innovative approaches to combat biofilm-related challenges in medical and industrial settings.", "label": 1}
