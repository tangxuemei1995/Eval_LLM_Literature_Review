{"grounding": "Electrochemical additive manufacturing is an advanced microfabrication technology capable of producing features of almost unlimited geometrical complexity. A unique combination of the capacity to process conductive materials, design freedom, and micro- to nanoscale resolution offered by these electrochemical techniques promises tremendous opportunities for a multitude of future applications spanning microelectronics, sensing, robotics, and energy storage. This review aims to equip readers with the basic principles of electrochemical 3D printing at the small length scale. By describing the basic principles of electrochemical additive manufacturing technology and using the recent advances in the field, this beginner's guide illustrates how controlling the fundamental phenomena that underpin the print process can be used to vary dimensions, morphology, and microstructure of printed structures.", "generated_text": "This paper serves as a beginner's guide to micro- and nanoscale electrochemical additive manufacturing, focusing on the integration of 3D printing technologies with electrochemical processes such as electrodeposition. We explore advanced techniques including meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED), FluidFM, scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), and electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), which utilize nanopipettes for precise material deposition at the micro- and nanoscale. These methods offer unprecedented control over the fabrication of complex structures with high resolution and accuracy, opening new avenues for research and application in fields ranging from electronics to biomedicine. The guide aims to provide a foundational understanding of these technologies, their operational principles, and their potential for revolutionizing manufacturing processes at the smallest scales.", "label": 1}
