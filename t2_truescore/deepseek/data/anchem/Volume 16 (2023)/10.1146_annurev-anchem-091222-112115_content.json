{"grounding": "This article critically reviews analytical method validation and quality control applied to the environmental chemistry field. The review focuses on the determination of organic micropollutants (OMPs), specifically emerging contaminants and pesticides, in the aquatic environment. The analytical technique considered is (gas and liquid) chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), including high-resolution MS for wide-scope screening purposes. An analysis of current research practices outlined in the literature has been performed, and key issues and analytical challenges are identified and critically discussed. It is worth emphasizing the lack of specific guidelines applied to environmental analytical chemistry and the minimal regulation of OMPs in waters, which greatly affect method development and performance, requirements for method validation, and the subsequent application to samples. Finally, a proposal is made for method validation and data reporting, which can be understood as starting points for further discussion with specialists in environmental analytical chemistry.", "generated_text": "The accurate detection and quantification of organic micropollutants in water samples are critical for environmental monitoring and public health protection. This study focuses on the development and application of efficient validation strategies in environmental analytical chemistry, specifically targeting organic micropollutants. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques such as liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we emphasize the importance of method validation, quality assurance, and quality control (QA/QC) protocols to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of analytical results. The research highlights the challenges associated with the analysis of complex water matrices and proposes innovative approaches to overcome these obstacles, including the optimization of sample preparation, the selection of appropriate analytical methods, and the implementation of stringent QA/QC measures. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust validation strategies to enhance the accuracy and precision of environmental monitoring efforts, thereby contributing to the effective management of water quality and the mitigation of pollution risks.", "label": 1}
