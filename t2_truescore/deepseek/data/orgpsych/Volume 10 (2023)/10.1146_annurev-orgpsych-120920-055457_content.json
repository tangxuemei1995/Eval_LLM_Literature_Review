{"grounding": "Individual and team creativity and innovation are essential for organizational effectiveness and success. The typology we developed in 2014 has stimulated much research in the past decade. We review this body of work and structure our article around the four quadrants described in our typology. We then revisit and update the eight research recommendations we proposed previously, identifying rich opportunities for developing theory and conceiving empirical studies. Finally, we highlight four desirable directions that help to chart the path for conducting frame-breaking research and accelerating theoretical breakthroughs.\n", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamic interplay between actors (individuals and teams) and their contexts in fostering creativity and innovation. By examining person-context and team-context interactions, alongside person-situation and team-situation dynamics, we aim to uncover how these relationships influence creative outcomes. Our review highlights progress in understanding these interactions and identifies desirable directions for future research, emphasizing the need for more nuanced models that account for the complexity of real-world creative processes. This work contributes to the broader discourse on creativity by offering insights into the mechanisms that facilitate innovative thinking and problem-solving.", "label": 1}
