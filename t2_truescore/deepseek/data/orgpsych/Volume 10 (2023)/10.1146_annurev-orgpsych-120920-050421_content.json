{"grounding": "Environmental sustainability has become an ethical and strategic imperative for organizations, and more and more employees are interested, encouraged, or instructed to act in environmentally sustainable ways. Consequently, organizational scholars have increasingly studied individual-level antecedents of employee pro-environmental or employee green behavior (EGB). We argue that, to advance this literature and to inform effective interventions, research should investigate how EGB, as a compound performance domain, is associated with antecedents and consequences at multiple levels (i.e., individual, team, work context, organization, society). Accordingly, we pursue three interrelated goals with this review. We first present a comprehensive review of research on EGB, including definitions, theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. Second, we develop an integrative conceptual model of EGB as the core of organizational environmental sustainability. Third, we conclude with recommendations for future theory development and methodological improvements, as well as practical implications for employees, leaders, and human resource management.", "generated_text": "In the quest for environmentally sustainable organizations, Employee Green Behavior (EGB) emerges as a pivotal element. This study delves into the intricate dynamics of EGB, exploring its underpinnings in ecological behavior and environmental psychology. By synthesizing a broad spectrum of scientific literature, we examine how individual pro-environmental actions contribute to the broader objective of environmental sustainability. The research highlights the significance of fostering a workplace culture that encourages and rewards green behaviors, thereby aligning individual actions with organizational environmental goals. Furthermore, it investigates the role of the natural environment as both a motivator and a beneficiary of EGB, offering insights into how organizations can leverage environmental psychology to enhance their sustainability efforts. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of EGB as the cornerstone of environmentally sustainable organizations, offering practical recommendations for integrating green behaviors into the fabric of organizational culture.", "label": 1}
