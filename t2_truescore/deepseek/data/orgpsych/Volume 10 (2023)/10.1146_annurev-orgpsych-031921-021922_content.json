{"grounding": "Meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for integrating findings from the research literature and building statistical models to explore trends and inconsistencies in the research base. Meta-analysis starts with a process for translating results from each study into an effect size that represents all findings in a common metric. Statistical models are then applied to estimate the mean, variance, and moderators of effect size. This article explores several key decision points in conducting a meta-analysis, including issues in obtaining a common metric, accounting for psychometric artifacts, and choosing an appropriate statistical model. It provides recommendations for choosing among alternate approaches and reporting results to ensure transparency.", "generated_text": "Meta-analysis has emerged as a pivotal methodological tool in organizational research, enabling the synthesis of findings across studies to draw more generalized conclusions. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the methodological options available for conducting meta-analyses, with a focus on enhancing the accuracy and reliability of research synthesis. Key considerations include the selection of appropriate effect size metrics, the correction for psychometric artifacts, and the application of validity generalization techniques to account for variability across studies. By addressing these methodological challenges, researchers can improve the validity of their meta-analytic findings, thereby contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field of organizational studies.", "label": 1}
