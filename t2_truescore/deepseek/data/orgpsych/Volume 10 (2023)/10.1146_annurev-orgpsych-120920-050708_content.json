{"grounding": "Some assert that noise (i.e., unwanted variance) is the most neglected yet most important source of error in judgment. We suggest that this problem was discovered nearly 100 years ago in the area of personnel selection and that a century of selection research has shown that noise can be demonstrably reduced by structuring the process (i.e., decomposing the component parts, agreeing on standards, and applying those standards consistently) and by aggregating judgments independently. Algorithms can aid significantly in this process but are often confused with methods that, in their current form, can substantially increase noise in judgment (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning).", "generated_text": "This study synthesizes a century of research on personnel selection to explore the impact of noise—unwanted variance in judgments—on workplace decision-making. By analyzing historical and contemporary data, we identify strategies to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of judgments in personnel selection and strategic decision-making. Our findings highlight the importance of structured decision-making processes, the use of forecasting models, and the minimization of cognitive biases. The paper concludes with actionable recommendations for organizations aiming to enhance their decision-making frameworks, thereby improving the quality of workplace judgments and the overall effectiveness of personnel selection and strategic planning.", "label": 0}
