{"grounding": "Emerging from distinct perspectives, decent work and meaningful work are fundamental aspects of contemporary work with profound implications for individuals, organizations, and society. Decent work reflects basic workplace conditions to which all employees are entitled, whereas meaningful work is aspirational, reflecting significance at work. Following a conceptual and empirical review of scholarship on decent work and meaningful work, we draw from psychology of working theory to connect the two constructs. We argue that need satisfaction serves as the primary connector, and societal context, organizational conditions, and individual practices (in order of effectiveness) promote access to each type of work. We suggest future research directions broadening the available scholarship and methods used, promoting a focus on the complex intersection of macrolevel and psychological factors as well as interdisciplinary approaches in determining the quality of work, and engaging in intervention research to improve the way in which people live and work together.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate relationship between decent work and meaningful work, exploring how these concepts intersect within the psychology of working and job design. Decent work, characterized by fair income, security, and equal opportunities, lays the foundation for meaningful work, which is imbued with personal significance and purpose. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research examines the psychological mechanisms that link work conditions to the experience of meaningfulness in one's job. It highlights the role of job design in fostering environments that not only meet the criteria for decent work but also enhance the meaningfulness of work for individuals. The findings suggest that integrating principles of decent work with strategies aimed at increasing meaningfulness can lead to improved job satisfaction, well-being, and productivity. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on work psychology by offering insights into how organizations can design jobs that are both decent and meaningful, thereby promoting a more fulfilling work experience for employees.", "label": 1}
