{"grounding": "The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) has grown substantially over the past 40 years within organizational research and beyond. There have been many different developments in SEM that make it increasingly useful for a variety of data types, research designs, research questions, and research contexts in the organizational sciences. To give researchers a better understanding of how and why SEM is used, our article (a) presents a review of SEM applications within organizational research; (b) discusses SEM best practices; and (c) explores advanced SEM applications, including instrumental variable methods, latent variable interactions and nonlinear measurement models, multilevel SEM, cross-lagged panel models and dynamic structural equation models, and meta-analytic SEM. We conclude by discussing concerns and debates that are both methodological (i.e., cross-validation and regularization) and theoretical (i.e., understanding causal evidence) as they relate to SEM and its application in organizational research and beyond.", "generated_text": "Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has become a cornerstone in organizational research, offering a robust framework for testing complex theoretical models involving latent variables and their interrelations. This paper reviews the current state of SEM in organizational studies, highlighting its strengths in addressing issues of model fit, latent interactions, and the integration of multiple data sources. Despite its widespread application, challenges remain, particularly in the areas of model specification, the treatment of measurement error, and the interpretation of latent variable interactions. We propose several directions for future research, including the development of more flexible modeling frameworks that can accommodate the dynamic and often non-linear nature of organizational phenomena. Additionally, we advocate for greater emphasis on the practical implications of SEM findings, ensuring that they contribute meaningfully to both theory and practice in organizational settings.", "label": 1}
