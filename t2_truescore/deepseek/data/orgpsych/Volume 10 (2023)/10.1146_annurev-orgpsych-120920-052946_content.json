{"grounding": "Technology has changed the way that organizational researchers obtain participants for their research studies. Although technology has facilitated the collection of large quantities of data through online platforms, it has also highlighted potential data quality issues for many of our samples. In this article, we review different sampling techniques, including convenience, purposive, probability-based, and snowball sampling. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each approach to help organizational researchers choose the most appropriate sampling techniques for their research questions. We identify best practices that researchers can use to improve the quality of their samples, including reviewing screening techniques to increase the quality of online sampling. Finally, as part of our review we examined the sampling procedures of all empirical research articles published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in the past 5 years, and we use observations from these results to make conclusions about the lack of methodological and sample diversity in organizational research, the overreliance on a few sampling techniques, the need to report key aspects of sampling, and concerns about participant quality.", "generated_text": "The evolution of sampling techniques in organizational research has been pivotal in enhancing the appropriateness and quality of samples, thereby improving the reliability and validity of research findings. This study delves into the latest innovations in sampling, with a particular focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by online samples. It critically examines the issues of insufficient effort responding and participant dishonesty, which have emerged as significant threats to data quality in the digital age. By reviewing contemporary literature and empirical studies, this research identifies effective strategies for mitigating these challenges, including the development of more sophisticated screening mechanisms and the implementation of advanced data validation techniques. Furthermore, it explores the potential of leveraging technology to refine sampling methods, ensuring that samples are more representative and that the data collected is of higher quality. The findings underscore the importance of adopting innovative sampling approaches to advance organizational research, offering valuable insights for researchers aiming to navigate the complexities of modern sampling landscapes.", "label": 0}
