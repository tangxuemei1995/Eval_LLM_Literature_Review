{"grounding": "It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the workplace impact of race from the organizational psychology and organizational behavior literature. Topical coverage is spotty and the findings are fragmented, with little existing theory to orient, integrate, and reconcile them. Consequently, it is unsurprising that public opinion is highly divergent about the influence of race at work, and practitioners are left largely unassisted in determining evidence-based approaches to leveraging this form of difference among their personnel. To fill this void, we review the relevant findings through the lens of organizational justice to help clarify the impact of race on organizational experiences. Our findings suggest that justice indeed varies as a function of race, the magnitude of differences depends on the type of justice, and there are several potentially fruitful areas for additional inquiry.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intersection of race and organizational justice, scrutinizing the premise that justice is colorblind within workplace settings. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we examine how racioethnic differences influence perceptions and experiences of fairness, equity, and inclusion in organizations. The study highlights the pervasive nature of discrimination and bias, which often undermine the principles of organizational justice for minority groups. By integrating theories of justice with critical race perspectives, this paper sheds light on the mechanisms through which racial disparities are perpetuated in the workplace. Our findings suggest that achieving true organizational justice requires a nuanced understanding of race and ethnicity, advocating for policies and practices that actively address and mitigate racial inequities. This review contributes to the ongoing discourse on diversity, equity, and inclusion, offering insights for both academic research and practical organizational strategies.", "label": 1}
