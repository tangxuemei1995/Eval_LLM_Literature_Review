{"grounding": "Burnout refers to a work-related state of exhaustion and a sense of cynicism. In contrast, work engagement is a positive motivational state of vigor, dedication, and absorption. In this article, we discuss the concepts of burnout and work engagement and review their antecedents and consequences. We look back at our inaugural Annual Reviews article (Bakker et al. 2014) and highlight new empirical findings and theoretical innovations in relationship to job demands–resources (JD-R) theory. We discuss four major innovations of the past decade, namely (a) the person × situation approach of JD-R, (b) multilevel JD-R theory, (c) new proactive approaches in JD-R theory, and (d) the work–home resources model. After discussing practical implications, we elaborate on more opportunities for future research, including JD-R interventions, team-level approaches, and demands and resources from other life domains.", "generated_text": "A decade has passed since the introduction of the Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) theory, a framework that has significantly influenced our understanding of workplace well-being and performance. This theory posits that job characteristics can be categorized into demands and resources, which respectively lead to strain and motivation, ultimately affecting employee health and organizational outcomes. Over the years, the JD-R theory has been expanded to incorporate proactive work behavior, emphasizing the role of employees in shaping their work environment. This review highlights the evolution of the JD-R theory, focusing on its application in job design, the interplay between job demands and resources, and their impact on burnout and work engagement. By synthesizing a decade of research, this paper aims to provide insights into the theory's contributions to organizational psychology and suggest directions for future research to further enhance workplace well-being and productivity.", "label": 1}
