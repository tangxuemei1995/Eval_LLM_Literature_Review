{"grounding": "We review the research on the psychology of entrepreneurship of the last decade. We focus on two key topics in entrepreneurship research: action and process. Combining action and process in a model of the psychology of entrepreneurship, we present the action theory process model of entrepreneurship and use it as a guiding framework for the review. We discuss theories of action, such as effectuation/causation, bricolage, theory of planned behavior, and action theory. Furthermore, we adopt a process perspective to discuss antecedents of actions in terms of cognition, motivation, and emotion and how they develop during the entrepreneurial process. The process perspective considers recursive relationships and dynamic changes in actions and their antecedents over time. We conclude that the action theory process model is a useful starting point to explain the psychological dynamics of entrepreneurship.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate psychology of entrepreneurship, focusing on the dynamic interplay between action and process. Grounded in action theory, it explores how entrepreneurs navigate uncertainty through bricolage and effectuation, leveraging available resources to forge new paths. The research highlights the critical roles of cognition and emotion in shaping entrepreneurial motivation and decision-making processes. By examining the psychological underpinnings of entrepreneurial actions, this paper sheds light on the cognitive frameworks and emotional resilience that drive individuals to pursue and persist in entrepreneurial ventures. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms that facilitate entrepreneurial success, offering valuable insights for both aspiring entrepreneurs and scholars in the field of entrepreneurship psychology.", "label": 1}
