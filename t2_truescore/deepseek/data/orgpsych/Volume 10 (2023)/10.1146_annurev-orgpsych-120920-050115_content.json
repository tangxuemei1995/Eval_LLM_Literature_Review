{"grounding": "The growth in virtual work is reshaping how leaders interface with their followers: Face-to-face interactions are increasingly being supplanted by virtual exchanges. To advance understanding of the implications of leading in this changing environment, we apply functional leadership theory to synthesize the findings of the virtual leadership research that has been conducted across different leadership perspectives and levels of analysis. We identify four traditional leadership functions that empirical research suggests have a stronger effect on follower need satisfaction in virtual settings and highlight a new function—facilitate the use of technology—as particularly germane to virtual leadership. Our review reveals several promising future research directions, including the need to examine the effects of leadership along the full spectrum of virtuality and to consider the unique challenges that leaders may encounter in hybrid work environments. We also outline important practical implications for organizations, leaders, and their followers.", "generated_text": "The shift towards virtual and hybrid work environments has necessitated a reevaluation of traditional leadership paradigms. This study explores the dynamics of leadership in virtual and hybrid settings, focusing on the unique challenges and opportunities these environments present. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, we examine the effectiveness of various leadership styles in fostering team cohesion, productivity, and satisfaction in remote and dyadic team structures. Our findings suggest that successful virtual leadership requires adaptability, enhanced communication skills, and the ability to leverage technology to maintain team engagement and trust. Furthermore, we identify key strategies for leaders to navigate the complexities of hybrid work models, ensuring equitable participation and collaboration among team members. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on virtual leadership, offering practical insights for leaders and organizations aiming to thrive in the evolving landscape of work.", "label": 1}
