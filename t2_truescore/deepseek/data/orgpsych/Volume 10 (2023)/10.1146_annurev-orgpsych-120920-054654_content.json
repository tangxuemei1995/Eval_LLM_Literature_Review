{"grounding": "Over the past decade, hundreds of studies have been published on employee voice and silence. In this review, I summarize that body of work, with an emphasis on the progress that has been made in our understanding of when and why employees choose to speak up or remain silent, as well as the individual and organizational implications of these choices. I identify underexplored issues, limitations in how voice has been conceptualized and studied, and promising avenues for future research. Although there has been notable progress in our knowledge of voice and silence, numerous key questions remain, and there are opportunities for the literature on voice to adopt a broader view of that construct. One of the objectives of this review is to motivate and guide research that will address those questions and explore that broader view.", "generated_text": "A decade has passed since the seminal work on employee voice and silence reshaped our understanding of upward communication in organizations. This paper takes stock of the advancements in the field, focusing on the dynamics of employee voice and silence as forms of proactive behavior and information sharing. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we explore the antecedents, processes, and outcomes associated with these constructs, highlighting the evolving role of organizational culture, leadership, and technology in facilitating or hindering upward communication. Our analysis reveals a nuanced landscape where employee voice and silence are not merely opposites but are influenced by a complex interplay of individual, relational, and contextual factors. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies and the integration of diverse theoretical perspectives to further our understanding of these critical organizational phenomena.", "label": 1}
