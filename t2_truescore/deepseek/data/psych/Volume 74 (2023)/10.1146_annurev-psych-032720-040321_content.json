{"grounding": "Pride is a self-conscious emotion, comprised of two distinct facets known as authentic and hubristic pride, and associated with a cross-culturally recognized nonverbal expression. Authentic pride involves feelings of accomplishment and confidence and promotes prosocial behaviors, whereas hubristic pride involves feelings of arrogance and conceit and promotes antisociality. Each facet of pride, we argue, contributes to a distinct means of attaining social rank: Authentic pride seems to promote prestige—a rank based on earned respect—whereas hubristic pride seems to promote dominance—a rank based on aggression and coercion. Both prestige and dominance are effective routes to power and influence in human groups, so both facets of pride are likely to be functional adaptations. Overall, the reviewed research suggests that pride is likely to be a human universal, critical for social relationships and rank attainment across human societies.", "generated_text": "This study explores the pivotal role of pride as a self-conscious emotion in the attainment and maintenance of social rank. Drawing on a comprehensive review of psychological and sociological literature, we examine how pride functions as both a motivator and a signal in the pursuit of status, distinguishing between the pathways of prestige and dominance. Through the lens of evolutionary psychology, we argue that pride has evolved as a mechanism to facilitate social navigation, enabling individuals to assess their position within social hierarchies and to strive for higher status. Our analysis highlights the dual nature of pride, encompassing both authentic and hubristic forms, and its differential impact on social rank attainment. By integrating findings from empirical studies, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the emotional underpinnings of social stratification and the complex interplay between emotion and social behavior.", "label": 1}
