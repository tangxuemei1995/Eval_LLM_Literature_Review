{"grounding": "Conspiracy theories are abundant in social and political discourse, with serious consequences for individuals, groups, and societies. However, psychological scientists have started paying close attention to them only in the past 20 years. We review the spectacular progress that has since been made and some of the limitations of research so far, and we consider the prospects for further progress. To this end, we take a step back to analyze the defining features that make conspiracy theories different in kind from other beliefs and different in degree from each other. We consider how these features determine the adoption, consequences, and transmission of belief in conspiracy theories, even though their role as causal or moderating variables has seldom been examined. We therefore advocate for a research agenda in the study of conspiracy theories that starts—as is routine in fields such as virology and toxicology—with a robust descriptive analysis of the ontology of the entity at its center.", "generated_text": "Conspiracy theories, defined as explanations for events or phenomena that invoke secret plots by powerful groups, have garnered significant attention in both academic and public discourse. This paper adopts a definitional approach to explore the multifaceted nature of conspiracy theories, focusing on their correlates, consequences, and modes of communication. Drawing on a comprehensive review of the literature, we identify key predictors of conspiracy beliefs, including psychological factors such as cognitive biases and personality traits, as well as socio-political factors like distrust in institutions and exposure to specific media environments. The consequences of endorsing conspiracy theories are examined, highlighting their potential to undermine social cohesion, erode trust in democratic processes, and influence individual and collective behavior. Furthermore, the paper delves into the mechanisms of conspiracy theory communication, analyzing the role of social media, echo chambers, and the spread of misinformation. By synthesizing existing research, this study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding conspiracy theories and their impact on society.", "label": 1}
