{"grounding": "Surveys administered online have several benefits, but they are particularly prone to careless responding, which occurs when respondents fail to read item content or give sufficient attention, resulting in raw data that may not accurately reflect respondentsâ€™ true levels of the constructs being measured. Careless responding can lead to various psychometric issues, potentially impacting any area of psychology that uses self-reported surveys and assessments. This review synthesizes the careless responding literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of careless responding and ways to prevent, identify, report, and clean careless responding from data sets. Further, we include recommendations for different levels of screening for careless responses. Finally, we highlight some of the most promising areas for future work on careless responding.", "generated_text": "Careless responding in survey data poses significant challenges to the validity and reliability of research findings. This study addresses the critical issue of insufficient effort responding (IER), a prevalent form of invalid responding that includes random responding and lazy respondents. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we explore effective strategies for the prevention and identification of careless responding. We highlight the importance of incorporating methodological safeguards during survey design and employing advanced statistical techniques for detecting IER. Furthermore, we propose a set of recommended best practices aimed at minimizing the impact of careless responding on data quality. Our findings underscore the necessity for researchers to adopt a proactive approach in dealing with IER, ensuring the integrity of survey-based research.", "label": 1}
