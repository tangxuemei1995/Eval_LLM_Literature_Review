{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires guidance not only by sensations that are available immediately but also by relevant mental contents carried forward through working memory. Therefore, selective-attention functions that modulate the contents of working memory to guide behavior (inside-out) are just as important as those operating on sensory signals to generate internal contents (outside-in). We review the burgeoning literature on selective attention in the inside-out direction and underscore its functional, flexible, and future-focused nature. We discuss in turn the purpose (why), targets (what), sources (when), and mechanisms (how) of selective attention inside working memory, using visual working memory as a model. We show how the study of internal selective attention brings new insights concerning the core cognitive processes of attention and working memory and how considering selective attention and working memory together paves the way for a rich and integrated understanding of how mind serves behavior.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between working memory and selective attention, emphasizing their pivotal roles in guiding behavior through anticipation and expectation. By integrating findings from vision and action research, we propose a novel framework that conceptualizes working memory as a dynamic system that not only retains information but also actively shapes attentional processes to optimize behavioral outcomes. Our analysis reveals that working memory facilitates the anticipation of future events and the formation of expectations, which in turn influence the allocation of attention to relevant stimuli. This inside-out perspective underscores the proactive nature of working memory in serving behavior, challenging traditional views that emphasize its passive storage function. Through a series of experimental paradigms, we demonstrate how this interplay between working memory and selective attention underpins adaptive behavior in complex environments, offering new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that drive human action.", "label": 1}
