We also identify areas in which research is lacking and call for scholarship that offers practical advice. All told, the existing research highlights negotiation as an exciting context for examining human behavior, characterized by features such as strong emotions, an intriguing blend of cooperation and competition, the presence of fundamental issues such as power and group identity, and outcomes that deeply affect the trajectory of people's personal and professional lives.", "generated_text": "This review delves into the intricate dynamics of negotiation, bargaining, and conflict resolution, emphasizing the complexity inherent in these processes.
