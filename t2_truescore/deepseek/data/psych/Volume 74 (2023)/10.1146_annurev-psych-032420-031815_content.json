{"grounding": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) research investigates changes in the evaluation of a stimulus after co-occurrence with an affective stimulus. To explain the motivation behind this research, this review begins with an overview of the history of EC research, followed by a summary of the state of the art with respect to three key questions. First, how should EC procedures be used to influence evaluation? We provide a guide based on evidence concerning the functional properties of EC effects. Second, how does the EC effect occur? We discuss the possible mediating cognitive processes and their automaticity. Third, are EC effects ubiquitous outside the lab? We discuss the evidence for the external validity of EC research. We conclude that the most important open questions pertain to the relevance of EC to everyday life and to the level of control that characterizes the processes that mediate the EC effect after people notice the stimulus co-occurrence.", "generated_text": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) represents a pivotal mechanism in attitude formation, where the valence of a neutral stimulus is altered through its association with a valent stimulus. This review delineates the evolution of EC research, from its foundational studies emphasizing the role of associations in shaping attitudes, to contemporary debates that integrate propositional processes. We explore the robustness of EC effects across diverse contexts, underscoring the importance of external validity in understanding its applicability to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends and future directions, including the integration of neuroscientific methods and the exploration of EC's role in digital environments. By synthesizing past findings and current perspectives, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of EC's contributions to our understanding of attitude formation and to chart a course for future research endeavors in this dynamic field.", "label": 1}
