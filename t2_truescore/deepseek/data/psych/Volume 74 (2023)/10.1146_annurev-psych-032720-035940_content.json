{"grounding": "The workplace elicits a wide range of emotions and, likewise, emotions change our experience of the workplace. This article reviews the scientific field of emotion in organizations, drawing from classic theories and cutting-edge advances to integrate a disparate body of research. The review is organized around the definition of emotion as an unfolding sequence of processes: We interpret the world around us for its subjective meaning, which results in emotional experience. Emotional experience, in turn, has consequences for behaviors, attitudes, and cognition. Emotional experience also elicits expressive cues that can be recognized by others. Each process in the emotion sequence can be regulated. Processes can also iterate until emotion is shared throughout workgroups and even entire organizations. A distinct body of organizationally relevant research exists for each process, and emotional intelligence refers to effectiveness across all. Differences across culture and gender, future research directions, and practical implications are discussed.", "generated_text": "This paper delves into the pivotal role of emotion within organizational contexts, synthesizing theory and empirical research to illuminate its multifaceted impact on workplace dynamics. Emotions, as a fundamental aspect of human experience, significantly influence individual behavior, decision-making processes, and interpersonal relationships in organizations. By exploring the social functions of emotion, this study highlights how emotional expressions can serve as critical signals that shape group cohesion, leadership effectiveness, and organizational culture. Furthermore, the concept of emotional intelligence is examined as a key determinant of professional success, emphasizing its importance in managing one's own emotions and understanding those of others. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research underscores the necessity of integrating emotional considerations into organizational theory and practice. It advocates for a more nuanced understanding of affect in the workplace, proposing that emotional awareness and regulation are essential for fostering a positive and productive organizational environment.", "label": 1}
