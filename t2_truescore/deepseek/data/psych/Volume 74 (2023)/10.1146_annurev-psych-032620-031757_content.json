{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the fields of psychosocial and integrative oncology, highlighting common psychological reactions to being diagnosed with and treated for cancer, including distress, anxiety, depression, fear of cancer recurrence and caregiver burden, as well as symptoms of fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance. Patterns of symptomatology across the disease continuum are also discussed. Interventions targeted at treating these symptoms are reviewed, including acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, mind-body therapies, and meaning-based approaches designed for people with advanced stages of disease, including psychedelic therapy. Common methodological issues and shortcomings of the evidence base are summarized with design recommendations, and a discussion of trends in future research including pragmatic research design, digital health interventions, and implementation science completes the article.", "generated_text": "This study explores the efficacy of psychosocial and integrative oncology interventions across the disease trajectory, focusing on their impact on anxiety, depression, and distress in cancer patients. By examining a range of therapeutic approaches, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, mindfulness, mind-body therapies, and psychedelic therapy, the research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current practices and their outcomes. The findings highlight the importance of tailored interventions that address the psychological and emotional needs of patients, offering insights into the potential benefits of integrating these therapies into standard oncology care. The study underscores the need for further research to optimize treatment strategies and improve the quality of life for individuals navigating the complexities of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.", "label": 1}
