{"grounding": "Cancer diagnosis and treatment constitute profoundly stressful experiences involving unique and common challenges that generate uncertainty, fear, and emotional distress. Individuals with cancer must cope with multiple stressors, from the point of diagnosis through surgical and adjuvant treatments and into survivorship, that require substantial psychological and physiological adaptation. This can take a toll on quality of life and well-being and may also promote cellular and molecular changes that can exacerbate physical symptoms and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis, thereby contributing to negative long-term health outcomes. Since modifying responses tostressors might improve psychological and physiological adaptation, quality of life, and clinical health outcomes, several randomized controlled trials have tested interventions that aim to facilitate stress management. We review evidence for the effects of stress management interventions on psychological and physiological adaptation and health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors and summarize emerging research in the field to address unanswered questions.", "generated_text": "Cancer diagnosis and treatment present significant stressors that can adversely affect patients' psychological and physiological well-being, potentially impacting health outcomes. This study explores the efficacy of stress management interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in facilitating psychological and physiological adaptation among cancer patients and survivors. By systematically reviewing current literature, we identify key cancer-related stressors and evaluate the role of targeted interventions in mitigating these stressors. Our findings suggest that stress management interventions, including CBT, significantly enhance psychological adaptation, evidenced by reduced anxiety and depression levels, and improve physiological adaptation, indicated by better immune function and reduced inflammation. These interventions are associated with improved cancer health outcomes, including enhanced quality of life and potentially longer survival rates. This research underscores the importance of integrating stress management strategies into cancer care protocols to support holistic patient well-being and optimize health outcomes.", "label": 1}
