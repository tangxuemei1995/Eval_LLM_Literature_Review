{"grounding": "Despite progress made toward increasing women's interest and involvement in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), women continue to be underrepresented and experience less equity and inclusion in some STEM fields. In this article, I review the psychological literature relevant to understanding and mitigating women's lower fit and inclusion in STEM. Person-level explanations concerning women's abilities, interests, and self-efficacy are insufficient for explaining these persistent gaps. Rather, women's relatively lower interest in male-dominated STEM careers such as computer science and engineering is likely to be constrained by gender stereotypes. These gender stereotypes erode women's ability to experience self-concept fit, goal fit, and/or social fit. Such effects occur independently of intentional interpersonal biases and discrimination, and yet they create systemic barriers to women's attraction to, integration in, and advancement in STEM. Dismantling these systemic barriers requires a multifaceted approach to changing organizational and educational cultures at the institutional, interpersonal, and individual level.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamics of gender inclusion and person-environment fit within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, addressing the persistent gender disparities and stereotypes that hinder diversity and inclusion. By analyzing existing literature and empirical data, we investigate how gender stereotypes influence the perception of fit between individuals and their STEM environments, and how these perceptions affect the participation and retention of women and gender minorities in STEM. Our findings suggest that enhancing gender inclusion requires not only addressing overt biases but also fostering environments that value diverse perspectives and competencies. We propose strategies for creating more inclusive STEM cultures, including mentorship programs, bias training, and policy reforms aimed at reducing systemic barriers. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on diversity and inclusion in STEM by highlighting the importance of person-environment fit in achieving gender equity and leveraging the full potential of a diverse workforce.", "label": 1}
