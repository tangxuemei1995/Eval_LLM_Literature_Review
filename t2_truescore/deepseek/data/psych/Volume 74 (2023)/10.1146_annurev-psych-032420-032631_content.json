{"grounding": "Culture and personality are two central topics in psychology. Individuals are culturally influenced influencers of culture, yet the research linking culture and personality has been limited and fragmentary. We integrate the literatures on culture and personality with recent advances in socioecology and genetics to formulate the Socioecological-Genetic Framework of Culture and Personality. Our framework not only delineates the mutual constitution of culture and personality but also sheds light on (a) the roots of culture and personality, (b) how socioecological changes partly explain temporal trends in culture and personality, and (c) how genes and culture/socioecology interact to influence personality (i.e., nature × nurture interactions). By spotlighting the roles of socioecology and genetics, our integrative framework advances the understanding of culture and personality.", "generated_text": "This paper introduces a socioecological-genetic framework to explore the intricate relationships between culture and personality, emphasizing their roots, evolutionary trends, and dynamic interplay. By integrating socioecological perspectives with genetic insights, we examine how environmental pressures and genetic predispositions jointly shape cultural norms and individual personality traits. The framework highlights the bidirectional influences between cultural change and personality development, offering a nuanced understanding of the nature–nurture debate. Through the lens of genes × environment interaction, we propose that cultural evolution and personality adaptation are deeply intertwined processes, driven by both societal shifts and genetic variability. This comprehensive approach aims to bridge the gap between macro-level cultural dynamics and micro-level personality psychology, providing a holistic view of human behavior in the context of changing socioecological landscapes.", "label": 1}
