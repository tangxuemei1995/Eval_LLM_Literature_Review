{"grounding": "Color is a pervasive feature of our psychological experience, having a role in many aspects of human mind and behavior such as basic vision, scene perception, object recognition, aesthetics, and communication. Understanding how humans encode, perceive, talk about, and use color has been a major interdisciplinary effort. Here, we present the current state of knowledge on how color perception and cognition develop. We cover the development of various aspects of the psychological experience of color, ranging from low-level color vision to perceptual mechanisms such as color constancy to phenomena such as color naming and color preference. We also identify neurodiversity in the development of color perception and cognition and implications for clinical and educational contexts. We discuss the theoretical implications of the research for understanding mature color perception and cognition, for identifying the principles of perceptual and cognitive development, and for fostering a broader debate in the psychological sciences.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate development of color perception and cognition from infancy through childhood, a critical period for sensory and cognitive maturation. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine how infants initially perceive color and how this perception evolves into more complex cognitive processes as children grow. The research highlights the role of environmental stimuli and genetic factors in shaping color perception, emphasizing the transition from basic color discrimination to the ability to categorize and name colors. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of color perception on cognitive development, including memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. By integrating findings from developmental psychology, neuroscience, and education, this paper provides a holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying color perception and cognition. The implications of these findings for educational practices and interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive development through color-based activities are also discussed.", "label": 1}
