{"grounding": "Self-continuity is the subjective sense of connection between one's past and present selves (past–present self-continuity), between one's present and future selves (present–future self-continuity), or among one's past, present, and future selves (global self-continuity). We consider the motivational character of the three forms of self-continuity, their regulatory properties, and the internal or external factors that consolidate them. We also review their consequences for attitudes and judgments or decisions, motivation, intentions and behavior, and psychological and physical health. We further detail the psychological and behavioral benefits of self-discontinuity (i.e., a sense of disconnect among temporal selves). We next turn to the brain regions that are activated synchronously with self-continuity. We consider developmental perspectives on self-continuity, discuss collective self-continuity (along with its consequences and regulatory properties), and elaborate on cultural differences in self-continuity. This inaugural Annual Reviews chapter demonstrates the breadth, excitement, and sense of synergy among self-continuity researchers and points to promising research directions.", "generated_text": "Self-continuity, a fundamental aspect of psychological health, refers to the perception of oneself as remaining the same over time despite changes in circumstances, roles, and physical appearance. This concept is deeply intertwined with attitudes and behavior, influencing how individuals navigate their social and personal environments. Research highlights the role of culture in shaping self-continuity, with variations observed between individualistic and collectivistic societies. In collectivistic cultures, the collective self—a sense of belonging and identification with a group—plays a significant role in fostering self-continuity. This study explores the mechanisms through which self-continuity impacts psychological health, emphasizing the mediating role of cultural context. By examining the interplay between self-continuity, attitudes, behavior, and the collective self across different cultural backgrounds, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how individuals maintain a coherent sense of self over time. The findings have implications for psychological interventions and cross-cultural psychology, offering insights into promoting mental well-being in diverse populations.", "label": 1}
