{"grounding": "This review focuses on conceptual and empirical research on determinants of social cognitive aging. We present an integrated model [the social cognitive resource (SCoRe) framework] to organize the literature and describe how social cognitive resilience is determined jointly by capacity and motivational resources. We discuss how neurobiological aging, driven by genetic and environmental influences, is associated with broader sensory, neural, and physiological changes that are direct determinants of capacity as well as indirect determinants of motivation via their influence on expectation of loss versus reward and cognitive effort valuation. Research is reviewed that shows how contextual factors, such as relationship status, familiarity, and practice, are fundamental to understanding the availability of both types of resource. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of social cognitive change in late adulthood for everyday social functioning and with recommendations for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the determinants of social cognitive aging, focusing on the interplay between social resources, context, motivation, and cognitive effort in predicting resilience and risk among older adults. Utilizing a comprehensive approach that integrates ecological validity, we explore how these factors influence cognitive performance and adaptability in real-world settings. Our findings highlight the critical role of enriched social environments and intrinsic motivation in fostering cognitive resilience, while also identifying contexts that may exacerbate cognitive risk. The research underscores the importance of considering individual differences and environmental factors in understanding cognitive aging. By elucidating the mechanisms through which social and motivational factors contribute to cognitive outcomes, this study offers valuable insights for developing targeted interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive health and well-being in the aging population.", "label": 0}
