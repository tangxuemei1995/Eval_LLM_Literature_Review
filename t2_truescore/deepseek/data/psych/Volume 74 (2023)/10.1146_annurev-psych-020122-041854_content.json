{"grounding": "Exposure to adversity (e.g., poverty, bereavement) is a robust predictor of disruptions in psychological functioning. However, people vary greatly in their responses to adversity; some experience severe long-term disruptions, others experience minimal disruptions or even improvements. We refer to the latter outcomes—faring better than expected given adversity—as psychological resilience. Understanding what processes explain resilience has critical theoretical and practical implications. Yet, psychology's understanding of resilience is incomplete, for two reasons: (a) We lack conceptual clarity, and (b) two major approaches to resilience—the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach—have limitations and are relatively isolated from one another. To address these two obstacles,we first discuss conceptual questions about resilience. Next, we offer an integrative affect-regulation framework that capitalizes on complementary strengths of both approaches. This framework advances our understanding of resilience by integrating existing findings, highlighting gaps in knowledge, and guiding future research.", "generated_text": "Psychological resilience, the capacity to maintain or regain mental health in the face of adversity, is a critical area of study within psychology. This research explores resilience through an affect-regulation framework, emphasizing the role of emotion and emotion regulation in navigating stress and coping mechanisms. By integrating findings from diverse scientific literature, we propose that effective affect regulation strategies are foundational to psychological resilience, enabling individuals to adaptively manage emotional responses to stressors. This framework suggests that resilience is not merely the absence of distress but involves active processes of emotional engagement and regulation that contribute to psychological health. The study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamic interplay between adversity, emotion regulation, and resilience, offering insights into interventions aimed at enhancing resilience by fostering adaptive affect regulation skills. This approach underscores the potential for targeted strategies to bolster psychological resilience in the face of life's challenges.", "label": 1}
