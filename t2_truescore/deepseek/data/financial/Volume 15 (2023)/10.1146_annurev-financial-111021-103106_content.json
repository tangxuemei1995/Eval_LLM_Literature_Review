{"grounding": "Financial frictions generate misallocation of resources across firms by restricting productive firmsâ€™ access to capital. This article reviews the literature that estimates the aggregate losses generated by such misallocation. The first approach relies on structural estimations: A model of firm dynamics with financial frictions is typically estimated and used to compare efficiency in the actual economy with a counterfactual with perfect financial markets. We argue that robustness is a central concern for this structural literature and discuss ways to analyze robustness in structural estimation (using well-identified moments and analyzing sensitivity to moments). The second approach relies on sufficient statistics, namely formulas that measure misallocation using simple empirical statistics and that are valid for a class of models. We discuss key contributions in that space, the generality of this approach, and the conditions under which it is valid. Sufficient statistic approaches are simpler and more robust, but they come at a cost: The range of counterfactual analyses that can be explored is more limited.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the pivotal role of microdata in enhancing the understanding and modeling of macro-financial dynamics. By leveraging detailed individual-level data, we address the critical challenges of identification and aggregation that are central to bridging microeconomic behaviors with macroeconomic outcomes. Our analysis underscores the importance of microdata in uncovering the heterogeneous responses of economic agents to financial shocks, thereby enriching the granularity of macro-financial models. We propose a methodological framework that systematically integrates microdata into macro-finance research, emphasizing the identification of causal relationships and the aggregation of micro-level insights into coherent macroeconomic narratives. Through a series of empirical applications, we demonstrate how microdata can illuminate the mechanisms driving financial cycles, inform the design of more effective monetary and fiscal policies, and enhance the predictive accuracy of macroeconomic models. This study contributes to the growing literature on the intersection of microeconomics and macro-finance, offering a roadmap for researchers to harness the power of microdata in addressing complex macroeconomic questions.", "label": 1}
