{"grounding": "We review macro-finance models featuring nonlinear dynamics that have recently been developed in the literature, including models with funding liquidity constraints, market liquidity frictions, and bank run frictions, and discuss the empirical evidence and challenges of this class of models. We also construct an illustrative model featuring financial frictions and nonlinear dynamics for readers who are unfamiliar with the literature. We solve the model using different solution techniques, including both global and perturbation solution methods, and comprehensively compare the accuracy of these solutions. Within this framework, we highlight that local linearization approximations omit important nonlinear dynamics and yield biased impulse responses.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of nonlinear dynamics into macro-finance models, focusing on Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) frameworks. By incorporating systemic risk, endogenous jump risk, financial constraints, and liquidity considerations, we aim to enhance the predictive accuracy and policy relevance of these models. Our analysis reveals that nonlinearities significantly affect the transmission of financial shocks to the real economy, highlighting the importance of accounting for complex interactions between financial markets and macroeconomic variables. The findings suggest that models with nonlinear dynamics can better capture the nuances of financial crises and the role of policy interventions, offering valuable insights for both academics and policymakers.", "label": 0}
