{"grounding": "Open-end mutual funds offer investors same-day liquidity while holding assets that in some cases take several days to sell. This liquidity transformation creates a potentially destabilizing first-mover advantage: When asset prices fall, investors who exit a fund earlier may pass the liquidation costs generated by their share redemptions to investors who remain in the fund. This incentive becomes particularly acute in periods of market stress, and it can amplify fire-sale spillover losses to other market participants. Swing pricing is a liquidity management tool that targets this first-mover advantage. It allows a fund to adjust or “swing” its net asset value in response to large flows out of or into a mutual fund. This article discusses the industry and regulatory context for swing pricing, and it reviews theory and empirical evidence on the design and effectiveness of swing pricing. The article concludes with directions for further research.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the concept of swing pricing within mutual funds, a mechanism designed to mitigate the adverse effects of liquidity transformation and potential fire sales. By adjusting the net asset value (NAV) of fund shares in response to significant purchase or redemption activities, swing pricing aims to protect existing shareholders from the costs associated with excessive trading. Through a comprehensive review of theoretical models and empirical evidence, we analyze the effectiveness of swing pricing in managing liquidity risks and its impact on investor behavior. Our findings suggest that swing pricing can serve as a valuable tool for liquidity management, reducing the likelihood of fire sales and promoting a more stable investment environment. However, the implementation of swing pricing also raises questions regarding its influence on market efficiency and the equitable treatment of investors.", "label": 1}
