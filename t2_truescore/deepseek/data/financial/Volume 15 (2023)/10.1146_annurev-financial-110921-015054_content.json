{"grounding": "The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the predominant family of global short-term rate benchmarks for the past 40 years, ceased to exist in June 2023. Given the low volumes of interbank loans on which LIBOR had been based, the revelations that LIBOR had been manipulated, and the risks that countless LIBOR-dependent financial instruments without fallback rates would be cast into limbo, regulators over the last decade pushed to replace LIBOR with risk-free overnight rate benchmarks. In the United States, the new benchmark, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), is an overnight rate based on US Treasury repo transactions: Use of term rates and derivatives on term rates is limited, and use of credit-sensitive term rates is discouraged. This article recounts the rise and fall of LIBOR; reviews the academic literature on the efficiency benefits of benchmarks, the LIBOR scandal, and the pros and cons of risk-free versus credit-sensitive rate benchmarks; and calls for further academic work on the current policy of entrenching a single-benchmark SOFR regime relative to the alternative of encouraging a two- or multi-benchmark regime of SOFR and one or more credit-sensitive term rates.", "generated_text": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative short-term rate benchmarks marks a pivotal shift in the financial landscape. This paper explores the post-LIBOR regime, focusing on the adoption and implications of new benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), American Interbank Offered Rate (Ameribor), Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), and the AXI. These benchmarks, categorized into risk-free rates and credit-sensitive rates, aim to address the shortcomings of LIBOR by providing more reliable and transparent reference rates for interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments. The study delves into the operational, regulatory, and market challenges associated with this transition, including the recalibration of financial contracts, the development of liquidity in new benchmark markets, and the impact on pricing and risk management practices. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of each alternative rate, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the future of rate benchmarks, offering insights into the evolving dynamics of global financial markets in the post-LIBOR era.", "label": 0}
