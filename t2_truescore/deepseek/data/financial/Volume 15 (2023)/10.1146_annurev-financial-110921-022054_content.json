{"grounding": "Unfunded public pension obligations represent the largest liability for state and local governments in the United States. As of fiscal year 2021, the total reported unfunded liabilities of these plans are $1.076 trillion. In contrast, the market value of the unfunded liability is approximately $6.501 trillion. As a result, the reported funding ratio of 82.5% falls to 43.8% under a market-based valuation. The market values reflect the fact that accrued pension promises are a form of government debt with strong statutory and contractual rights. The assumed discount rates are based on expected returns and remain elevated relative to risk-free rates, despite a decline since 2014. As a result, not only is the unfunded pension liability understated, but the yearly pension cost for newly accruing liabilities is also understated. In order to achieve high returns, pension funds have accumulated large exposure to risky assets, in particular alternative investments, which results in highly uncertain investment returns.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolving landscape of state and local pension funds, focusing on the challenges and trends that have emerged in recent years. With public pensions under increasing strain due to demographic shifts, economic fluctuations, and policy changes, this research delves into the implications for state and local governments. It explores the rising pension costs, the impact on government debt levels, and the strategies employed to manage these pressures. Through a comprehensive analysis of retirement policies and funding mechanisms, the paper highlights the critical need for sustainable solutions to ensure the long-term viability of public pension systems. The findings underscore the importance of innovative approaches to pension management, aiming to balance the needs of current and future retirees with the fiscal realities faced by state and local governments.", "label": 0}
