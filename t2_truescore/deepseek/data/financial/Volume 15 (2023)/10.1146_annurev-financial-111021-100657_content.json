{"grounding": "After two decades of low initial public offering (IPO) activity and a number of regulatory changes, the number of IPOs of both operating companies and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) boomed in the United States in 2021 before collapsing in 2022. In recent years, surging valuations have resulted in many private companies achieving “unicorn” status, a valuation of $1 billion or more, partly fueled by investments from mutual funds. Many of the unicorns that have gone public have done so with dual-class share structures. We compare three alternative mechanisms for going public, including traditional IPOs, mergers with SPACs, and direct listings. The most common exit for successful venture capital–backed companies, however, continues to be by merging with a larger company.", "generated_text": "The landscape of public offerings has witnessed significant evolution with the emergence of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) alongside traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). This study delves into recent developments within these mechanisms, focusing on their implications for unicorn companies and the broader market. We explore the strategic considerations behind choosing SPACs over IPOs, including the allure of confidential filings and the flexibility of direct listings. Additionally, the paper examines the contentious issue of dual-class shares, a feature increasingly prevalent in both IPOs and SPAC transactions, and its impact on corporate governance and shareholder rights. Through a comprehensive analysis of current trends and case studies, this research aims to provide insights into the shifting paradigms of public offerings and their future trajectory.", "label": 1}
