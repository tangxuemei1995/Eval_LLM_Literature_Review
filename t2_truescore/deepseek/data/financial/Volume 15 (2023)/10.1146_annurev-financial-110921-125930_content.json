{"grounding": "This article reviews the recent literature on algorithmic fairness, with a particular emphasis on credit scoring. We discuss human versus machine bias, bias measurement, group versus individual fairness, and a collection of fairness metrics. We then apply these metrics to the US mortgage market, analyzing Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data on mortgage applications between 2009 and 2015. We find evidence of group imbalance in the dataset for both gender and (especially) minority status, which can lead to poorer estimation/prediction for female/minority applicants. Loan applicants are handled mostly fairly across both groups and individuals, though we find that some local male (nonminority) neighbors of otherwise similar rejected female (minority) applicants were granted loans, something that warrants further study. Finally, modern machine learning techniques substantially outperform logistic regression (the industry standard), though at the cost of being substantially harder to explain to denied applicants, regulators, or the courts.", "generated_text": "In the era of data-driven decision-making, algorithmic fairness has emerged as a critical concern, particularly in applications like credit scoring where decisions can significantly impact individuals' lives. This study delves into the complexities of ensuring fairness in machine learning algorithms, which are increasingly employed to automate and scale decision-making processes. We explore the inherent biases that can be perpetuated or exacerbated by these algorithms, stemming from biased training data or flawed model assumptions. The research focuses on the development and application of fairness metrics designed to quantify and mitigate bias, ensuring that algorithms treat all individuals equitably, regardless of sensitive attributes such as race or gender. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies in credit scoring, we propose a framework for integrating fairness considerations into the algorithmic design process. Our findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving algorithmic fairness, combining insights from computer science, ethics, and social sciences to develop algorithms that are not only accurate but also just and equitable.", "label": 1}
