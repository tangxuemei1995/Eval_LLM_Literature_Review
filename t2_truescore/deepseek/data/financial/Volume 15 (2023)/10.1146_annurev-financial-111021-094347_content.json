{"grounding": "Is shareholder interest in corporate social responsibility driven by pecuniary motives (abnormal rates of return) or nonpecuniary ones (willingness to sacrifice returns to address various firm externalities)? To answer this question, we summarize the literature by focusing on seven tests: (a) costs of capital, (b) performance of portfolios, (c) ownership by types of institutions, (d) surveys and experiments, (e) managerial motives, (f) shareholder proposals, and (g) firm inclusion in responsibility indices. These tests predominantly indicate that shareholders are driven by nonpecuniary motives. To stimulate further research on welfare implications for global warming, we assess whether estimates of the foregone returns for shareholders willing to reduce carbon emissions (or “greeniums”), along with the wealth pledged to firms that become sustainable, are consistent with the growth of aggregate investments in the decarbonization sector.", "generated_text": "This study explores the evolving landscape of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) within the context of sustainable finance and corporate decarbonization efforts. Focusing on the role of responsible shareholder mandates, the research investigates how these mandates influence corporate behavior towards reducing negative externalities and promoting environmental sustainability. The concept of 'greeniums'—premiums associated with green investments—is examined as a financial incentive for corporations to adopt more sustainable practices. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and case studies, this paper highlights the mechanisms by which CSR initiatives can drive corporate decarbonization, contributing to a more sustainable economic system. The findings suggest that responsible shareholder mandates and the pursuit of greeniums not only enhance corporate reputation but also offer a competitive advantage in the transition towards a low-carbon economy.", "label": 0}
