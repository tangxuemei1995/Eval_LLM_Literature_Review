{"grounding": "We explain the mechanics of smart contracts. We then highlight the benefits of smart contracts, such as overcoming commitment problems. We also discuss limitations, such as the difficulty for smart contracts to access information external to the blockchain and the difficulty of integrating smart contract code with traditional legal enforcement. We further highlight how the absence of a trusted intermediary inflates implementation costs for blockchain applications. We conclude with a discussion of the most prominent smart contract applications in decentralized finance: token issuance (e.g., initial coin offerings, nonfungible tokens), decentralized exchanges, and protocols for loanable funds. Our survey covers both institutional details and relevant literature.", "generated_text": "The advent of blockchain technology has ushered in a new era of financial systems, notably through the development of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi). This paper explores the transformative potential of DeFi, focusing on its core components such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), protocols for loanable funds (PLFs), and the utilization of tokens on platforms like Ethereum. By eliminating intermediaries, DeFi offers a more inclusive, transparent, and efficient financial ecosystem. However, challenges such as scalability, security, and regulatory compliance remain. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of DeFi, its underlying technologies, and the implications for the future of finance.", "label": 1}
