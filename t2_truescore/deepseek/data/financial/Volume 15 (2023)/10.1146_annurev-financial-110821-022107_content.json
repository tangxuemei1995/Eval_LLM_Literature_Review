{"grounding": "The global financial system showed remarkable resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a sharp decline in economic activity and the initial financial market upheaval in March 2020. This article takes stock of the factors that contributed to this resilience, focusing on the role of monetary and financial policies. Drawing on the existing literature, it argues that the swift and decisive policy actions of major central banks in response to the pandemic-induced crisis played a key role in easing financial conditions and sustaining the flow of credit to the real economy. While the pandemic crisis has underscored the importance of policies in preventing calamitous financial outcomes, it has also brought to the fore some unintended consequences of policy actions—in particular, of providing prolonged monetary policy support and of applying regulation to specific segments of the financial system rather than taking a broader approach—that could undermine financial stability in the future.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an unprecedented global crisis, challenging the resilience of financial systems and the efficacy of monetary policies worldwide. This paper reflects on the macro-financial stability during the pandemic, with a particular focus on emerging markets. It examines the dual role of monetary policy in stabilizing economies and ensuring financial stability amidst the crisis. The analysis highlights the unique vulnerabilities of emerging markets, including capital flow reversals, currency depreciations, and heightened debt sustainability concerns. Furthermore, the paper discusses the policy responses adopted by central banks and governments to mitigate the economic fallout and safeguard financial systems. It underscores the importance of international cooperation and policy coordination in addressing the global nature of the crisis. The reflections presented aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on enhancing the resilience of financial systems and formulating effective policy measures in the face of future crises.", "label": 0}
