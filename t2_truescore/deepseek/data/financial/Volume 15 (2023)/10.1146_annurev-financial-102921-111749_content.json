{"grounding": "Most Western countries use a single discount rate to evaluate public investments and policies. This ignores the differential cost of risk, in a world where most risk markets exhibit surprisingly large prices of risk. The current discounting guidelines generate a misallocation of capital that entails a large welfare cost. We claim that the well-established asset pricing literature provides a strong normative justification in favor of risk-adjusting discount rates. More specifically, project-specific discount rates should be increasing in the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. This will favor projects whose net benefit materializes preferentially in low-income states, thereby recognizing their insurance benefit ex ante. The intuition is simple, the welfare benefit of the reform is large, and the methodology only requires evaluators to estimate an income elasticity on top of what is required in the current approach. It is time to fix our public discounting systems.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the current methodologies employed in public discounting systems, with a particular focus on their application in risk adjustment, carbon pricing, and cost-benefit analysis. The study identifies significant discrepancies and inefficiencies in the way future costs and benefits are discounted, which can lead to suboptimal policy decisions, especially in the context of environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation. By analyzing a range of case studies and theoretical models, the research proposes a revised framework for discounting that incorporates more accurate risk assessments and a more nuanced understanding of long-term environmental impacts. The findings suggest that adopting a more dynamic and context-sensitive approach to discounting can enhance the effectiveness of public policies aimed at addressing complex societal challenges. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on public finance and environmental economics by offering practical recommendations for policymakers to improve the fairness and efficiency of public discounting systems.", "label": 0}
