{"grounding": "The principles of financial economics provide equally important insights into the optimal choice of discount rates for both public and private sector decision-makers. However, most governments largely ignore those principles, taking their cost of capital for most purposes as their borrowing rate. This article reviews the arguments often made in support of status quo discounting practices, along with the counterarguments to them. Governments have a choice between several methodologies for risk adjustment, and the practical and conceptual reasons that favor a fair value approach are recapped. The limitations of a financial economics approach become apparent for decisions involving very long time horizons, such as for climate policies. For policies with long-term impacts, intergenerational concerns become paramount, projections of cash flows and discount rates become highly uncertain, and present value calculations are an intrinsically unreliable measure of value. No approach to discount rate selection can overcome those problems; alternative decision criteria need to be established. However, most government investments involve much shorter horizons, and the adoption of standard approaches to risk adjustment could significantly improve social welfare.", "generated_text": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a pivotal concept in financial economics, serving as a cornerstone for government valuation, fair value accounting, and budgetary accounting practices. This paper critically examines the capabilities and limitations of financial economics in elucidating the SDR, particularly in the context of government cost of capital. While financial economics offers robust frameworks for understanding risk, return, and the time value of money, its application to the SDR is fraught with complexities. These include the challenge of reconciling market-based approaches with ethical considerations, intergenerational equity, and the non-market valuation of public goods. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this study highlights the nuanced interplay between economic theory and practical policy-making. It argues for a multidisciplinary approach to the SDR, one that integrates insights from financial economics with those from environmental economics, ethics, and public policy. The paper concludes with reflections on the implications of these findings for future research and policy formulation, emphasizing the need for a more holistic understanding of the SDR in government decision-making processes.", "label": 0}
