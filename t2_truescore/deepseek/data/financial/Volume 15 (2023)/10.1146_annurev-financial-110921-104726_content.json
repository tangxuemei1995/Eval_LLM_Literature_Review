{"grounding": "The past half-century has seen major shifts in inflation expectations, how inflation comoves with the business cycle, and how stocks comove with Treasury bonds. Against this backdrop, we review the economic channels and empirical evidence on how inflation is priced in financial markets. Not all inflation episodes are created equal. Using a New Keynesian model, we show how “good” inflation can be linked to demand shocks and “bad” inflation to cost-push shocks driving the economy. We then discuss asset pricing implications of “good” and “bad” inflation. We conclude by providing an outlook for inflation risk premia in the world of newly rising inflation.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between inflation and asset returns, focusing on the dynamics of risk premia and bond return predictability across varying economic conditions, including periods of stagflation. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple decades, we analyze the impact of inflation on different asset classes, emphasizing the role of monetary policy in shaping investor expectations and market outcomes. Our findings reveal that inflation significantly influences risk premia, with distinct patterns emerging during stagflationary periods. Furthermore, we uncover evidence of bond return predictability linked to inflation expectations, offering insights for portfolio management and policy formulation. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on inflation's multifaceted effects on financial markets.", "label": 1}
