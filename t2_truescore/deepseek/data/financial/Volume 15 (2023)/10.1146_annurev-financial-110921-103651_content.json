{"grounding": "This review revisits the literature on fiscal capacity using modern tools from asset pricing. We find that properly accounting for aggregate risk substantially reduces fiscal capacity. In this environment, the gap between the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate is not a sufficient statistic for fiscal capacity. To borrow at the risk-free rate when aggregate growth is risky, governments need to ask taxpayers to insure bondholders against aggregate risk, but governments in advanced economies tend to insure taxpayers against aggregate risk. We use this asset pricing perspective to review alternative mechanisms to boost fiscal capacity that have been explored in the literature.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of fiscal policy and asset pricing, focusing on the concept of fiscal capacity from an asset pricing perspective. By analyzing the term structure of interest rates and the maturity of government debt, we investigate how fiscal capacity influences the convenience yield of government securities. Our findings suggest that fiscal capacity, as a measure of a government's ability to meet its financial obligations, plays a crucial role in determining the pricing of sovereign debt. This research contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms through which fiscal policy affects financial markets, offering insights into the pricing of risk and the valuation of government debt.", "label": 0}
