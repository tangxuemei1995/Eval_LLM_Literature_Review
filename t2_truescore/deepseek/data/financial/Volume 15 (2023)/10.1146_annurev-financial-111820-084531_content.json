{"grounding": "Governments allocate a large share of real and financial capital globally, and their choices of discount rates for project and policy evaluation have a first-order effect on social welfare. The importance of adopting a principles-based approach to selecting discount rates has new urgency in light of the very long horizons over which the benefits and costs of policies to address climate change are being evaluated. The four articles in this theme provide an interpretive overview of the literature on many of the theoretical, practical, legal, and philosophical considerations for discount rate selection by governments. This introduction summarizes the main points of each article and highlights some of the common threads that emerge. These include the importance of using risk-adjusted rates, the problems that arise when discount rates are chosen to be artificially low, and the large disconnect between common government practices and the principles of financial economics.", "generated_text": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) plays a pivotal role in the valuation of government projects and public investments, particularly in the context of long-term environmental policies such as the cost of carbon. This theme explores the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of the SDR, emphasizing its significance in making intergenerational trade-offs. By balancing present costs against future benefits, the SDR serves as a critical tool in ensuring that public investments are both economically viable and ethically justifiable across generations. The discussion delves into the challenges of determining an appropriate SDR, considering factors such as uncertainty, risk, and the moral considerations of valuing future welfare. Through a comprehensive analysis, this theme aims to provide insights into the complexities of applying the SDR in policy-making, highlighting its impact on sustainable development and the equitable distribution of resources over time.", "label": 0}
