{"grounding": "The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to a large number of studies in household finance, using new high-frequency data in close to real time. In this article, we survey household behavior during the pandemic, with a focus on consumption, government policies, credit, and investment. The pandemic induced a rapid decline in consumption, which was affected by but largely preceded stay-at-home orders and was followed by a rapid rebound. Government stimulus was less effective in 2020 relative to other recessions, which is consistent with both shutdowns and precautionary savings. Delinquency rates fell, unlike in other recessions, likely due to government debt relief policies. Household investment behavior was affected by pandemic-induced changes in beliefs. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household behavior, focusing on consumption patterns, credit utilization, and investment decisions. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning the pandemic period, we analyze how unprecedented economic stimuli and health crises influenced household financial strategies. Our findings reveal significant shifts in consumption towards essential goods and online services, alongside increased savings rates and cautious credit use. Investment behaviors showed a marked preference for safer assets, reflecting heightened risk aversion. The study contributes to the understanding of household finance under extreme conditions, offering insights into the resilience and adaptability of consumer behavior in the face of global crises. These results have implications for policymakers and financial institutions aiming to support economic recovery and stability.", "label": 1}
