{"grounding": "This survey discusses the state of the art in research in racetrack and lottery investment markets. Market efficiency and the pricing of various wagers are studied along with new developments since the Thaler & Ziemba (1988) review. The weak form inefficient market pricing approach using stochastic programming optimization models changed racetrack betting from handicapping to a financial market allowing professional syndicates to operate as hedge funds. Topics discussed include arbitrage and risk arbitrage, syndicates, betting exchange rebates, behavioral biases, and fundamental and mispricing information in racetrack and lottery markets. Similar models can be used to successfully trade stock market anomalies. \nSupplemental Materials\n are included online.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the dynamics of pari-mutuel betting markets, focusing on racetracks and lotteries, to explore the efficiency of these markets and the presence of the favorite-longshot bias. Utilizing stochastic programming optimization models, we analyze betting strategies and their outcomes, aiming to identify patterns that could lead to more informed decision-making by bettors. Our investigation sheds light on the operational mechanisms of these markets, offering insights into how they might be optimized for both bettors and operators. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on gambling economics, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors that influence betting behavior and market efficiency in the context of pari-mutuel systems.", "label": 1}
