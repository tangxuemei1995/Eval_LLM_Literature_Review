{"grounding": "Market interest rates reflect the preferences of market participants. When market participants are missing, the average discount rate in the population may therefore differ from the market rate. Missing current market participants, such as constrained borrowers, tends to imply an average discount rate that is above the market rate, whereas missing future market participants, such as future generations, tends to imply an average rate below the market rate. Nonetheless, a government with the ability to transfer wealth intratemporally across agents will generally wish to use the market interest rate as a guide to policy. One robust argument for the use of a lower social discount rate is intrapersonal: Future selves discount the past, whereas current selves discount the future. Legacy utility may also justify a low social discount rate.", "generated_text": "This study explores the implications of missing participants and incomplete markets on the determination of the social discount rate, focusing on the roles of borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. By integrating these factors into a unified framework, we analyze how the absence of certain market participants and the limitations in market completeness affect intertemporal decision-making and resource allocation across generations. Our findings suggest that altruism and the desire for legacy significantly influence the social discount rate, especially in contexts where borrowing constraints and incomplete markets limit the ability of individuals to transfer resources across time. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on the appropriate social discount rate for policy evaluation, highlighting the importance of considering non-market factors and intergenerational equity in economic models.", "label": 0}
