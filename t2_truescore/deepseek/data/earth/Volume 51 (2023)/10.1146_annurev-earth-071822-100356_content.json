{"grounding": "Landscapes receive water from precipitation and then transport, store, mix, and release it, both downward to streams and upward to vegetation. How they do this shapes floods, droughts, biogeochemical cycles, contaminant transport, and the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Because many of the key processes occur invisibly in the subsurface, our conceptualization of them has often relied heavily on physical intuition. In recent decades, however, much of this intuition has been overthrown by field observations and emerging measurement methods, particularly involving isotopic tracers. Here we summarize key surprises that have transformed our understanding of hydrological processes at the scale of hillslopes and drainage basins. These surprises have forced a shift in perspective from process conceptualizations that are relatively static, homogeneous, linear, and stationary to ones that are predominantly dynamic, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and nonstationary.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tSurprising observations and novel measurements are transforming our understanding of the hydrological functioning of landscapes.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tEven during storm peaks, streamflow is composed mostly of water that has been stored in the landscape for weeks, months, or years.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tStreamflow and tree water uptake often originate from different subsurface storages and from different seasons’ precipitation.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tStream networks dynamically extend and retract as the landscape wets and dries, and many stream reaches lose flow into underlying aquifers.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate hydrological functioning of landscapes, focusing on the role of instructive surprises that challenge conventional understanding. By integrating ecohydrology and isotope hydrology, we explore the dynamic interactions within catchments and hillslopes that govern runoff generation and water movement. Our research highlights unexpected patterns and processes, such as the disproportionate influence of small-scale features on catchment response and the complex role of vegetation in modulating water fluxes. Through a combination of field observations, isotopic analysis, and modeling, we uncover how these surprises can lead to a deeper comprehension of hydrological systems. The findings underscore the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in landscape hydrology, offering new insights into water resource management and ecosystem sustainability. This work contributes to the evolving field of ecohydrology by providing a nuanced perspective on the hydrological functioning of landscapes, emphasizing the need for adaptive approaches in the face of environmental change.", "label": 1}
