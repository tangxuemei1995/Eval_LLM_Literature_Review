{"grounding": "Terrestrial plants have transformed Earth's surface environments by altering water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. Studying vegetation-climate interaction in deep time has necessarily relied on modern-plant analogs to represent paleo-ecosystems—as methods for reconstructing paleo- and, in particular, extinct-plant function were lacking. This approach is potentially compromised given that plant physiology has evolved through time, and some paleo-plants have no clear modern analog. Advancements in the quantitative reconstruction of whole-plant function provide new opportunities to replace modern-plant analogs and capture age-specific vegetation-climate interactions. Here, we review recent investigations of paleo-plant performance through the integration of fossil and geologic data with process-based ecosystem- to Earth system–scale models to explore how early vascular plants responded to and influenced climate. First, we present an argument for characterizing extinct plants in terms of ecological and evolutionary theory to provide a framework for advancing reconstructed vegetation-climate interactions in deep time. We discuss the novel mechanistic understanding provided by applying these approaches to plants of the late Paleozoic ever-wet tropics and at higher latitudes. Finally, we discuss preliminary applications to paleo-plants in a state-of-the-art Earth system model to highlight the potential implications of different plant functional strategies on our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tFor hundreds of millions of years, plants have been a keystone in maintaining the status of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and climate.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tExtinct plants have functioned differently across time, limiting our understanding of how processes on Earth interact to produce climate.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tNew methods, reviewed here, allow quantitative reconstruction of extinct-plant function based on the fossil record.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tIntegrating extinct plants into ecosystem and climate models will expand our understanding of vegetation's role in past environmental change.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The late Paleozoic era marked a pivotal transformation in Earth's environmental history, largely driven by the evolution and proliferation of terrestrial plants. This study employs a systems approach to unravel the complex interactions between plant functional traits, ecosystem dynamics, and global climate during this critical period. By integrating plant functional strategies with advanced ecosystem and Earth system modeling, we aim to elucidate how early vascular plants influenced atmospheric composition, hydrology, and climate feedbacks. Our analysis focuses on key plant functional traits—such as stomatal density, leaf area index, and root architecture—that played significant roles in carbon sequestration, water cycling, and soil development. We explore how these traits, in combination with plant functional strategies like resource allocation and reproductive mechanisms, facilitated the colonization of diverse habitats and the establishment of complex ecosystems. Furthermore, we investigate the feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate, particularly the impact of plant-driven changes on atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperature. Through a series of model simulations, we assess the long-term consequences of plant-environment interactions on Earth's biogeochemical cycles and climate stability. Our findings highlight the profound influence of plant evolution on the late Paleozoic environment, providing new insights into the co-evolution of life and the Earth system. This research underscores the importance of a systems perspective in understanding the deep-time impacts of vegetation on global environmental change, offering valuable lessons for contemporary ecological and climate studies.", "label": 1}
