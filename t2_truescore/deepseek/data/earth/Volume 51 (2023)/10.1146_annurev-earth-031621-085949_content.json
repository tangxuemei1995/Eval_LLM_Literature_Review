{"grounding": "Carbonate minerals contain stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen with different masses whose abundances and bond arrangement are governed by thermodynamics. The clumped isotopic value Δi is a measure of the temperature-dependent preference of heavy C and O isotopes to clump, or bond with or near each other, rather than with light isotopes in the carbonate phase. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry uses Δi values measured by mass spectrometry (Δ47, Δ48) or laser spectroscopy (Δ638) to reconstruct mineral growth temperature in surface and subsurface environments independent of parent water isotopic composition. Two decades of analytical and theoretical development have produced a mature temperature proxy that can estimate carbonate formation temperatures from 0.5 to 1,100°C, with up to 1–2°C external precision (2 standard error of the mean). Alteration of primary environmental temperatures by fluid-mediated and solid-state reactions and/or Δi values that reflect nonequilibrium isotopic fractionations reveal diagenetic history and/or mineralization processes. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has contributed significantly to geological and biological sciences, and it is poised to advance understanding of Earth's climate system, crustal processes, and growth environments of carbonate minerals.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tClumped heavy isotopes in carbonate minerals record robust temperatures and fluid compositions of ancient Earth surface and subsurface environments.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tMature analytical methods enable carbonate clumped Δ47, Δ48, and Δ638 measurements to address diverse questions in geological and biological sciences.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThese methods are poised to advance marine and terrestrial paleoenvironment and paleoclimate, tectonics, deformation, hydrothermal, and mineralization studies.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has emerged as a transformative tool in geochemistry, offering a novel approach to reconstructing past temperatures and understanding the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and oxygen. This technique leverages the thermodynamic preference for isotopologues (molecules with the same chemical formula but different isotopic compositions) to clump together in carbonate minerals at equilibrium, a phenomenon that is temperature-dependent. The application of clumped isotope thermometry extends across a broad spectrum of geological and environmental sciences, from paleoclimate reconstruction to the study of diagenetic processes. Recent advancements in analytical methodologies, including the development of high-precision mass spectrometry, have significantly enhanced the accuracy and precision of clumped isotope measurements, enabling the detection of subtle variations in isotopic compositions. This paper reviews the frontiers of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry, highlighting the theoretical underpinnings, methodological innovations, and diverse applications of this technique. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with the interpretation of clumped isotope data, including the effects of kinetic fractionation and diagenetic alteration. Furthermore, we explore the potential of integrating clumped isotope thermometry with other geochemical proxies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's history and the processes shaping its surface environments. As the field continues to evolve, carbonate clumped isotope thermometry promises to remain at the forefront of geochemical research, offering new insights into the complex interplay between temperature, chemistry, and life on Earth.", "label": 1}
