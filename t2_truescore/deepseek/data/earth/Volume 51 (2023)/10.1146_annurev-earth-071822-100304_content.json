{"grounding": "Large seismogenic faults consist of approximately meter-thick fault cores surrounded by hundreds-of-meters-thick damage zones. Earthquakes are generated by rupture propagation and slip within fault cores and dissipate the stored elastic strain energy in fracture and frictional processes in the fault zone and in radiated seismic waves. Understanding this energy partitioning is fundamental in earthquake mechanics to explain fault dynamic weakening and causative rupture processes operating over different spatial and temporal scales. The energy dissipated in the earthquake rupture propagation along a fault is called fracture energy or breakdown work. Here we review fracture energy estimates from seismological, modeling, geological, and experimental studies and show that fracture energy scales with fault slip. We conclude that although material-dependent constant fracture energies are important at the microscale for fracturing grains of the fault zone, they are negligible with respect to the macroscale processes governing rupture propagation on natural faults.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tEarthquake ruptures propagate on geological faults and dissipate energy in fracture and frictional processes from micro- (less than a millimeter) to macroscale (centimeters to kilometers).\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe energy dissipated in earthquake rupture propagation is called fracture energy (G) or breakdown work (W\nb) and scales with coseismic slip.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tFor earthquake ruptures in natural faults, the estimates of G and W\nb are consistent with a macroscale description of causative processes.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe energy budget of an earthquake remains controversial, and contributions from different disciplines are required to unravel this issue.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Understanding the energy dissipation mechanisms during earthquakes is crucial for comprehending rupture dynamics and the overall earthquake energy budget. This study focuses on two key components: fracture energy and breakdown work, which play pivotal roles in the dynamic weakening of fault zones. Fracture energy, the energy required to create new fracture surfaces, and breakdown work, the energy dissipated in the process zone ahead of the rupture front, are both influenced by the fault zone structure and material properties. We employ a combination of theoretical models, laboratory experiments, and field observations to investigate how these energy components vary under different stress conditions and fault geometries. Our findings reveal that dynamic weakening mechanisms, such as thermal pressurization and flash heating, significantly reduce the effective fracture energy and breakdown work, facilitating rupture propagation. Additionally, the heterogeneity of fault zone materials and the presence of fluids further modulate these energy dissipation processes. By integrating these insights, we propose a refined framework for the earthquake energy budget that accounts for the complex interplay between fracture energy, breakdown work, and dynamic weakening. This framework enhances our ability to predict earthquake behavior and assess seismic hazard, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the physical processes governing earthquake ruptures.", "label": 1}
