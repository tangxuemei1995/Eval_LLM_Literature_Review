{"grounding": "For the first time, from early 2019 to the end of 2022, Mars’ shallow and deep interiors have been explored by seismology with the InSight mission. Thanks to the performances of its seismometers and the quality of their robotic installation on the ground, 1,319 seismic events have been detected, including about 90 marsquakes at teleseismic distances, with Mw from 2.5 to 4.7 and at least 6 impacts, the largest ones with craters larger than 130 m. A large fraction of these marsquakes occur in Cerberus Fossae, demonstrating active regional tectonics. Records of pressure-induced seismic noise and signals from the penetration of a heat flow probe have provided subsurface models below the lander. Deeper direct and secondary body wave phase travel time, receiver function, and surface wave analysis have provided the first interior models of Mars, including crustal thickness and crustal layering, mantle structure, thermal lithospheric thickness, and core radius and state.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tWith InSight's SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure of Mars) experiment and for the first time in planetary exploration, Mars’ internal structure and seismicity are constrained.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tMore than 1,300 seismic events and seismic noise records enable the first comparative seismology studies together with Earth and lunar seismic data.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tInversion of seismic travel times and waveforms provided the first interior model of another terrestrial planet, down to the core.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tSeveral impacts were also seismically recorded with their craters imaged from orbit, providing the first data on impact dynamic on Mars.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The exploration of Mars has entered a new era with the deployment of seismometers on its surface, enabling the study of Mars' interior through the analysis of marsquakes and impacts. This research focuses on the field of Mars seismology, which aims to unravel the planet's internal structure, composition, and dynamics. The detection of marsquakes, particularly those originating from the Cerberus Fossae region, provides critical insights into the tectonic activity and stress distribution within Mars. Additionally, the study of impact-generated seismic waves offers a unique opportunity to probe the planet's crustal and mantle properties. By analyzing the seismic data collected, researchers can infer the thickness of Mars' crust, the state of its mantle, and the size and composition of its core. This paper reviews the current understanding of Mars' interior structure based on seismic observations, discusses the implications of these findings for the planet's geological history and evolution, and outlines future directions for Mars seismology research. The integration of seismic data with other geophysical and geological observations is essential for constructing a comprehensive model of Mars' interior, which will enhance our understanding of terrestrial planet formation and evolution in the solar system.", "label": 1}
