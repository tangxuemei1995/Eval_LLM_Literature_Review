{"grounding": "The current rapid increase in atmospheric CO2, linked to the massive use of fossil fuels, will have major consequences for our climate and for living organisms. To understand what is happening today, it is informative to look at the past. The evolution of the carbon cycle, coupled with that of the past climate system and the other coupled elemental cycles, is explored in the field, in the laboratory, and with the help of numerical modeling. The objective of numerical modeling is to be able to provide a quantification of the processes at work on our planet. Of course, we must remain aware that a numerical model, however complex, will never include all the relevant processes, impacts, and consequences because nature is complex and not all the processes are known. This makes models uncertain. We are still at the beginning of the exploration of the deep-time Earth. In the present contribution, we review some crucial events in coupled Earth-climate-biosphere evolution over the past 540 million years, focusing on the models that have been developed and what their results suggest. For most of these events, the causes are complex and we are not able to conclusively pinpoint all causal relationships and feedbacks in the Earth system. This remains a largely open scientific field.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe era of the pioneers of geological carbon cycle modeling is coming to an end with the recent development of numerical models simulating the physics of the processes, including climate and the role of vegetation, while taking into account spatialization.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tNumerical models now allow us to address increasingly complex processes, which suggests the possibility of simulating the complete carbon balance of objects as complex as a mountain range.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tWhile most of the processes simulated by models are physical-chemical processes in which the role of living organisms is taken into account in a very simple way, via a limited number of parameters, models of the carbon cycle in deep time coupled with increasingly complex ecological models are emerging and are profoundly modifying our understanding of the evolution of our planet's surface.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The evolution of carbon sources and sinks over the Phanerozoic eon has been a subject of intense study, given its critical role in shaping Earth's climate and biosphere. This research leverages a comprehensive suite of models to explore the dynamics of the carbon cycle across deep time, focusing on the interplay between geological processes, such as weathering, and biological activity. By integrating data from paleoclimate proxies with advanced modeling techniques, we aim to reconstruct the fluxes of carbon between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere, and to understand how these fluxes have influenced global climate over millions of years. Our findings highlight the importance of silicate weathering as a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2, modulated by tectonic activity and the evolution of land plants. Additionally, the models reveal significant variations in volcanic outgassing and organic carbon burial rates, which have acted as major carbon sources and sinks, respectively. These variations are closely linked to major geological events, such as the formation and breakup of supercontinents, and biological innovations, including the colonization of land by plants and the evolution of calcifying organisms. The study also underscores the role of feedback mechanisms in stabilizing Earth's climate over geological timescales, despite the occurrence of extreme climatic events. By providing a quantitative framework for understanding the carbon cycle's evolution, this research contributes to our knowledge of Earth's past climate dynamics and offers insights into the potential impacts of current anthropogenic carbon emissions on future climate trajectories.", "label": 1}
