{"grounding": "Future sea-level rise poses an existential threat for many river deltas, yet quantifying the effect of sea-level changes on these coastal landforms remains a challenge. Sea-level changes have been slow compared to other coastal processes during the instrumental record, such that our knowledge comes primarily from models, experiments, and the geologic record. Here we review the current state of science on river delta response to sea-level change, including models and observations from the Holocene until 2300 CE. We report on improvements in the detection and modeling of past and future regional sea-level change, including a better understanding of the underlying processes and sources of uncertainty. We also see significant improvements in morphodynamic delta models. Still, substantial uncertainties remain, notably on present and future subsidence rates in and near deltas. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern sea-level rise also remain elusive, posing major challenges to model validation.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThere are large differences in the initiation time and subsequent delta progradation during the Holocene, likely from different sea-level and sediment supply histories.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tModern deltas are larger and will face faster sea-level rise than during their Holocene growth, making them susceptible to forced transgression.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tRegional sea-level projections have been much improved in the past decade and now also isolate dominant sources of uncertainty, such as the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tVertical land motion in deltas can be the dominant source of relative sea-level change and the dominant source of uncertainty; limited observations complicate projections.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tRiver deltas globally might lose 5% (∼35,000 km2) of their surface area by 2100 and 50% by 2300 due to relative sea-level rise under a high-emission scenario.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "River deltas, dynamic landforms at the interface of terrestrial and marine environments, are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) driven by climate change. This study synthesizes current understanding of the geomorphological responses of river deltas to SLR, integrating insights from sedimentary geology, coastal dynamics, and climate science. We explore the complex interplay between fluvial sediment supply, deltaic morphology, and rising sea levels, highlighting the critical role of sedimentary processes in delta resilience. Through a review of global case studies, we identify key factors influencing deltaic adaptation to SLR, including sediment flux, tidal range, and human interventions such as damming and land reclamation. Our analysis reveals that while some deltas may sustain their form and function through sediment accretion and progradation, others face increased risk of submergence, erosion, and habitat loss. The study underscores the importance of holistic management strategies that consider both natural processes and anthropogenic impacts to enhance delta resilience. By advancing our understanding of deltaic responses to SLR, this research contributes to the development of adaptive strategies for coastal protection, ecosystem conservation, and sustainable development in deltaic regions worldwide.", "label": 1}
