{"grounding": "The early to mid-Paleoproterozoic Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) is ostensibly the largest magnitude (approximately +5 to +30‰), longest duration (ca. 130–250 million years) positive carbon isotope excursion measured in carbonate rocks in Earth history. The LJE has been attributed to large nutrient fluxes, an increase in the size of the biosphere, a reorganization of the global carbon cycle, and oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, significant debate remains about its genesis, synchroneity, global-versus-local extent, and role in atmospheric oxygenation. Here we review existing models and mechanisms suggested for the LJE and analyze a compilation of ∼9,400 δ13Ccarb and associated contextual data. These data call into question the interpretation of the LJE as a globally synchronous carbon isotope excursion and suggest that any model for the LJE must account for both the absence of a clearly defined initiation and termination of the excursion and a facies-dependent expression of 13C-enrichment.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) continues to challenge current understandings of the carbon cycle.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tUnderstanding this excursion is critical for reconstructing biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric oxygenation through Earth history.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tSome evidence indicates local rather than global changes in δ13CDIC and raises the possibility of asynchronous, local excursions.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tResolving whether the LJE was globally synchronous or asynchronous is essential for discriminating between different models.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) represents one of the most significant carbon isotope excursions in Earth's history, occurring during the Paleoproterozoic era, approximately 2.22 to 2.06 billion years ago. This period is closely associated with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), a pivotal moment when atmospheric oxygen levels rose dramatically, fundamentally altering the planet's surface chemistry and biosphere. The LJE is characterized by anomalously high δ13C values in marine carbonates, suggesting a profound perturbation in the global carbon cycle. This study aims to deconstruct the LJE by examining the interplay between biological, geological, and chemical processes that may have driven this excursion. We explore various hypotheses, including enhanced organic carbon burial, changes in the oxidation state of the ocean, and the role of methanogenesis and methanotrophy. By integrating geochemical data, paleoenvironmental reconstructions, and biogeochemical modeling, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind the LJE and its implications for the co-evolution of life and Earth's surface environments during the Precambrian. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on the dynamics of the carbon cycle in response to major oxygenation events and offer insights into the resilience and adaptability of Earth's biosphere in the face of extreme environmental changes.", "label": 1}
