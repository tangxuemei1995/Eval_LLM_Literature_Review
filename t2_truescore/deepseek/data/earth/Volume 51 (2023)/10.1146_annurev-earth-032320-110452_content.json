{"grounding": "The continental crust in the overriding plate of the India-Asia collision zone in southern Tibet is characterized by an overthickened layer of felsic composition with an underlying granulite-eclogite layer. A large data set indicates that this crust experienced magmatism from 245 to 10 Ma, as recorded by the Gangdese Batholith. Magmatism was punctuated by flare-ups at 185−170, 90−75, and 55−45 Ma caused by a combination of external and internal factors. The growth of this crust starts with a period dominated by fractional crystallization and the formation of voluminous (ultra)mafic arc cumulates in the lower crust during subduction, followed by their melting during late-subduction and collision, due to changes in convergence rate. This combined accumulation-melting process resulted in the vertical stratification and density sorting of the Gangdese crust. Comparisons with other similarly thickened collision zones suggests that this is a general process that leads to the stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records the time-integrated development of the world's thickest crust, reaching greater than 50 km at 55–45 Ma and greater than 70 km after 32 Ma.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe Gangdese Batholith records three magmatic flare-ups in response to distinct drivers; the last one at 55−45 Ma marks the arrival of India.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tMagmatism was first dominated by fractional crystallization (accumulation) followed by crustal melting: the accumulation-melting process.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tAccumulation-melting in other collision zones provides a general process for vertical stratification and stabilization of continental crust.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Gangdese Batholith in southern Tibet represents a significant geological feature that provides insights into the processes of continental crustal growth within a magmatic arc setting. This study focuses on the mechanisms of crustal stratification and growth, particularly in the context of the collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Through detailed geochemical and geochronological analyses, we have identified distinct phases of magmatic activity that contributed to the vertical and lateral expansion of the crust. The findings reveal that the Gangdese Batholith underwent multiple episodes of magmatic underplating and intra-crustal differentiation, leading to the formation of a stratified crust with a mafic lower layer and a more felsic upper layer. These processes are indicative of the complex interplay between mantle-derived magmas and pre-existing crustal materials, highlighting the role of magmatic arcs in the accretion and differentiation of continental crust. The study also sheds light on the temporal and spatial variations in crustal growth rates, suggesting that the most significant phase of crustal thickening occurred during the Late Cretaceous to Early Cenozoic, coinciding with the initial stages of the India-Eurasia collision. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the dynamics of crustal growth in collision zones and the evolution of continental crust in magmatic arc environments.", "label": 1}
