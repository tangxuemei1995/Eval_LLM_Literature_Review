{"grounding": "An oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals. The early Earth had an anoxic atmosphere, and understanding the rise and maintenance of high O2 levels is critical for investigating what drove our own evolution and for assessing the likely habitability of exoplanets. A growing number of techniques aim to reproduce changes in O2 levels over the Phanerozoic Eon (the past 539 million years). We assess these methods and attempt to draw the reliable techniques together to form a consensus Phanerozoic O2 curve. We conclude that O2 probably made up around 5–10% of the atmosphere during the Cambrian and rose in pulses to ∼15–20% in the Devonian, reaching a further peak of greater than 25% in the Permo-Carboniferous before declining toward the present day. Evolutionary radiations in the Cambrian and Ordovician appear consistent with an oxygen driver, and the Devonian “Age of the Fishes” coincides with oxygen rising above 15% atm.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tAn oxygen-rich atmosphere is essential for complex animals such as humans.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tWe review the methods for reconstructing past variation in oxygen levels over the past 539 million years (the Phanerozoic Eon).\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tWe produce a consensus plot of the most likely evolution of atmospheric oxygen levels.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tEvolutionary radiations in the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Devonian periods may be linked to rises in oxygen concentration.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels through the Phanerozoic eon has been a subject of intense study due to its profound implications for the development of life on Earth, particularly the evolution of animals. This paper revisits the trajectory of atmospheric O2 concentrations over the past 541 million years, integrating the latest geochemical data and models of the carbon cycle. We synthesize evidence from various proxies, including carbon isotopes, sulfur isotopes, and the composition of sedimentary rocks, to reconstruct a more accurate and detailed history of atmospheric oxygen. Our analysis suggests that O2 levels have fluctuated significantly, with notable increases during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, which correlate with major evolutionary events such as the rise of large, complex animals. We also explore the feedback mechanisms between the biosphere and the geosphere that have regulated atmospheric O2, emphasizing the role of the carbon cycle in modulating oxygen levels. This revised understanding of atmospheric O2 evolution provides new insights into the co-evolution of life and the Earth's surface environment, highlighting the intricate interplay between biological innovation and geochemical processes.", "label": 1}
