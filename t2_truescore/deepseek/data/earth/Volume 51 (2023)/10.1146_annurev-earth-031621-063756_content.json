{"grounding": "The strength of lithospheric plates is a central component of plate tectonics, governed by brittle processes in the shallow portion of the plate and ductile behavior in the deeper portion. We review experimental constraints on ductile deformation of olivine, the main mineral in the upper mantle and thus the lithosphere. Olivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (GBS), and diffusion-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (diffusion creep). Deformation in most of the lithosphere is dominated by GBS, except in shear zones—in which diffusion creep dominates—and in the brittle-ductile transition—in which low-temperature plasticity may dominate. We find that observations from naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of the experimentally constrained olivine flow laws to geological conditions but that geophysical observations predict a weaker lithosphere. The causes of this discrepancy are unresolved but likely reside in the uncertainty surrounding processes in the brittle-ductile transition, at which the lithosphere is strongest.\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tDuctile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is constrained by experimental data for olivine.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tOlivine deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, and diffusion creep.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tObservations of naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of olivine flow laws from experimental conditions.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tExperiments predict stronger lithosphere than geophysical observations, likely due to gaps in constraints on deformation in the brittle-ductile transition.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle plays a pivotal role in the dynamics of Earth's interior, influencing plate tectonics, mantle convection, and the evolution of geological structures. This study focuses on the deformation mechanisms and ductile flow within the lithospheric mantle, with particular emphasis on the behavior of olivine, the predominant mineral in the upper mantle. Through a comprehensive review of experimental and theoretical studies, we explore the plasticity of olivine under various pressure, temperature, and strain rate conditions, which are critical for understanding the rheological properties of the mantle. The analysis reveals that dislocation creep and diffusion creep are the dominant deformation mechanisms, with their relative contributions varying with depth and thermal state. Additionally, the role of water content and grain size in modulating the ductile flow of the lithospheric mantle is examined, highlighting their impact on the viscosity and strength of mantle rocks. The findings underscore the complexity of mantle deformation processes and their implications for geodynamic modeling. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanical behavior of the lithospheric mantle, offering insights into the forces driving plate tectonics and the long-term evolution of Earth's lithosphere.", "label": 1}
