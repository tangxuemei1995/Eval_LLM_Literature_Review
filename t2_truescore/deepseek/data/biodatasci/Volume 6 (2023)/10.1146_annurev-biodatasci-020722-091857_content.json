{"grounding": "Since the first publication a decade ago describing the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the context of cancer, over 200 datasets and thousands of scRNA-seq studies have been published in cancer biology. scRNA-seq technologies have been applied across dozens of cancer types and a diverse array of study designs to improve our understanding of tumor biology, the tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic responses, and scRNA-seq is on the verge of being used to improve decision-making in the clinic. Computational methodologies and analytical pipelines are key in facilitating scRNA-seq research. Numerous computational methods utilizing the most advanced tools in data science have been developed to extract meaningful insights. Here, we review the advancements in cancer biology gained by scRNA-seq and discuss the computational challenges of the technology that are specific to cancer research.", "generated_text": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative technology in the study of human cancers, offering unprecedented resolution to dissect the complexity of tumor biology. This technique enables the detailed examination of gene expression profiles at the single-cell level, providing insights into the heterogeneity of cancer cells, the composition of the tumor microenvironment, and the dynamics of immune cell interactions. By leveraging advanced bioinformatics tools, researchers can identify novel biomarkers, understand mechanisms of drug resistance, and uncover potential targets for immunotherapy. The application of scRNA-seq in cancer research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of tumorigenesis and progression, paving the way for the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. This abstract highlights the pivotal role of scRNA-seq in advancing cancer biology and its implications for improving patient outcomes through precision medicine.", "label": 1}
