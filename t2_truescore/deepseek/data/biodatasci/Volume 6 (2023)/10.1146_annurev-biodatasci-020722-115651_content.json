{"grounding": "Following the widespread use of deep learning for genomics, deep generative modeling is also becoming a viable methodology for the broad field. Deep generative models (DGMs) can learn the complex structure of genomic data and allow researchers to generate novel genomic instances that retain the real characteristics of the original dataset. Aside from data generation, DGMs can also be used for dimensionality reduction by mapping the data space to a latent space, as well as for prediction tasks via exploitation of this learned mapping or supervised/semi-supervised DGM designs. In this review, we briefly introduce generative modeling and two currently prevailing architectures, we present conceptual applications along with notable examples in functional and evolutionary genomics, and we provide our perspective on potential challenges and future directions.", "generated_text": "Deep generative models (DGMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the analysis and interpretation of complex biological data, particularly in the fields of functional and evolutionary genomics. This overview explores the application of two prominent DGMs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in deciphering the intricate patterns of genomic data. VAEs, with their ability to learn latent representations, have been instrumental in identifying functional elements and understanding gene expression dynamics. GANs, on the other hand, have shown promise in simulating evolutionary processes and generating synthetic genomic sequences that mimic real biological data. By leveraging the strengths of these models, researchers can uncover novel insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation, evolutionary adaptations, and the genetic basis of complex traits. This paper highlights the potential of DGMs to revolutionize our approach to genomic research, offering a new lens through which to explore the vast complexity of life's blueprint.", "label": 1}
