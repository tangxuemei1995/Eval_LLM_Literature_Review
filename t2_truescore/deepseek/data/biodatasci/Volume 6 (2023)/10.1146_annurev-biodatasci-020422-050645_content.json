{"grounding": "Single-cell RNA sequencing methods have led to improved understanding of the heterogeneity and transcriptomic states present in complex biological systems. Recently, the development of novel single-cell technologies for assaying additional modalities, specifically genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial data, allows for unprecedented insight into cellular biology. While certain technologies collect multiple measurements from the same cells simultaneously, even when modalities are separately assayed in different cells, we can apply novel computational methods to integrate these data. The application of computational integration methods to multimodal paired and unpaired data results in rich information about the identities of the cells present and the interactions between different levels of biology, such as between genetic variation and transcription. In this review, we both discuss the single-cell technologies for measuring these modalities and describe and characterize a variety of computational integration methods for combining the resulting data to leverage multimodal information toward greater biological insight.", "generated_text": "Single-cell multiomics represents a transformative approach in biological research, enabling the simultaneous analysis of multiple molecular layers within individual cells. This methodology leverages next-generation sequencing technologies to dissect the complexity of cellular heterogeneity and function by integrating genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data. The computational integration of these multimodal datasets poses significant challenges but also offers unprecedented opportunities to uncover novel insights into cellular mechanisms and disease states. Recent advancements in computational algorithms and analytical frameworks have facilitated the efficient processing and interpretation of single-cell multiomics data, enhancing our understanding of cellular diversity and dynamics. This abstract highlights the critical role of single-cell multiomics in advancing precision medicine, developmental biology, and systems biology, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between computational scientists, biologists, and clinicians to harness the full potential of this cutting-edge technology.", "label": 1}
