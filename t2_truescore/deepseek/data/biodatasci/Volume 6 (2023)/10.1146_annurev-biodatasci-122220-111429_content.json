{"grounding": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that can regulate all steps of gene expression (induction, transcription, and translation). Several virus families, primarily double-stranded DNA viruses, encode small RNAs (sRNAs), including miRNAs. These virus-derived miRNAs (v-miRNAs) help the virus evade the host's innate and adaptive immune system and maintain an environment of chronic latent infection. In this review, the functions of the sRNA-mediated virus–host interactions are highlighted, delineating their implication in chronic stress, inflammation, immunopathology, and disease. We provide insights into the latest viral RNA–based research—in silico approaches for functional characterization of v-miRNAs and other RNA types. The latest research can assist toward the identification of therapeutic targets to combat viral infections.", "generated_text": "The discovery of virus-derived small RNAs (vsRNAs) and virally encoded microRNAs (v-miRNAs) has opened new avenues in understanding the complex interactions between viruses and their hosts. This study focuses on the role of these molecules in health and disease, with a particular emphasis on the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), a well-known human pathogen associated with various malignancies. Utilizing advanced bioinformatics tools and viral RNA bioinformatics resources, we explore the biogenesis, function, and regulatory mechanisms of vsRNAs and v-miRNAs. Our findings highlight the potential of these viral molecules as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis, as well as targets for therapeutic intervention. This research underscores the importance of integrating bioinformatics approaches in virology to unravel the intricate roles of viral small RNAs in host-pathogen interactions.", "label": 1}
