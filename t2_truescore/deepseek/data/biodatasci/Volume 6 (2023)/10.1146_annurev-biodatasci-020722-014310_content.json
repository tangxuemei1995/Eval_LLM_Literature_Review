{"grounding": "Admixed populations constitute a large portion of global human genetic diversity, yet they are often left out of genomics analyses. This exclusion is problematic, as it leads to disparities in the understanding of the genetic structure and history of diverse cohorts and the performance of genomic medicine across populations. Admixed populations have particular statistical challenges, as they inherit genomic segments from multiple source populationsâ€”the primary reason they have historically been excluded from genetic studies. In recent years, however, an increasing number of statistical methods and software tools have been developed to account for and leverage admixture in the context of genomics analyses. Here, we provide a survey of such computational strategies for the informed consideration of admixture to allow for the well-calibrated inclusion of mixed ancestry populations in large-scale genomics studies, and we detail persisting gaps in existing tools.", "generated_text": "The genomic analysis of admixed populations presents unique challenges and opportunities in the field of statistical genetics, particularly in the study of complex traits. Admixed populations, characterized by the blending of genetic material from previously isolated groups, offer a rich source of variation for understanding the genetic architecture of diseases and traits. However, the complexity of their genetic structure requires sophisticated methods to accurately infer ancestry and identify genetic associations. This review highlights key strategies for the genomic analysis of admixed populations, focusing on the development and application of statistical methods tailored to address the intricacies of admixture. We discuss the importance of ancestry inference, the challenges of linkage disequilibrium, and the potential of admixture mapping in uncovering genetic variants associated with complex traits. By leveraging the unique genetic diversity of admixed populations, researchers can gain deeper insights into the genetic underpinnings of human health and disease.", "label": 1}
