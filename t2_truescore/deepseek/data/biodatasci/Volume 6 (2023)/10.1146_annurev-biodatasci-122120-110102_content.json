{"grounding": "Understanding the noncoding part of the genome, which encodes gene regulation, is necessary to identify genetic mechanisms of disease and translate findings from genome-wide association studies into actionable results for treatments and personalized care. Here we provide an overview of the computational analysis of noncoding regions, starting from gene-regulatory mechanisms and their representation in data. Deep learning methods, when applied to these data, highlight important regulatory sequence elements and predict the functional effects of genetic variants. These and other algorithms are used to predict damaging sequence variants. Finally, we introduce rare-variant association tests that incorporate functional annotations and predictions in order to increase interpretability and statistical power.", "generated_text": "The identification of functional sequences and variants within noncoding DNA is pivotal for understanding gene regulation and its implications in disease. This study leverages advancements in whole genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies to explore the role of enhancers and transcription factors in gene expression. By integrating sequence analysis with machine learning and deep learning techniques, we aim to predict the effects of rare variants on gene regulation. Our approach not only enhances the accuracy of variant effect prediction but also provides insights into the complex mechanisms underlying noncoding DNA functionality. This research contributes to the broader goal of deciphering the regulatory code of the genome, offering potential pathways for therapeutic intervention.", "label": 1}
