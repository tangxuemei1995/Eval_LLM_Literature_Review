{"grounding": "Organismal aging exhibits wide-ranging hallmarks in divergent cell types across tissues, organs, and systems. The advancement of single-cell technologies and generation of rich datasets have afforded the scientific community the opportunity to decode these hallmarks of aging at an unprecedented scope and resolution. In this review, we describe the technological advancements and bioinformatic methodologies enabling data interpretation at the cellular level. Then, we outline the application of such technologies for decoding aging hallmarks and potential intervention targets and summarize common themes and context-specific molecular features in representative organ systems across the body. Finally, we provide a brief summary of available databases relevant for aging research and present an outlook on the opportunities in this emerging field.", "generated_text": "Aging is a complex biological process characterized by the gradual decline of physiological functions, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of aging by enabling the detailed examination of cellular and molecular changes at an unprecedented resolution. This study focuses on decoding the hallmarks of aging at the single-cell level, leveraging cutting-edge analysis tools and comprehensive data resources. By identifying key intervention targets and elucidating underlying mechanisms, our research aims to pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related decline. The integration of single-cell analysis not only enhances our comprehension of aging but also offers a robust platform for the discovery of biomarkers and potential interventions to promote healthy aging.", "label": 1}
