{"grounding": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revolutionized our understanding of common genetic variation and its impact on common human disease and traits. Developed and adopted in the mid-2000s, GWAS led to searchable genotype–phenotype catalogs and genome-wide datasets available for further data mining and analysis for the eventual development of translational applications. The GWAS revolution was swift and specific, including almost exclusively populations of European descent, to the neglect of the majority of the world's genetic diversity. In this narrative review, we recount the GWAS landscape of the early years that established a genotype–phenotype catalog that is now universally understood to be inadequate for a complete understanding of complex human genetics. We then describe approaches taken to augment the genotype–phenotype catalog, including the study populations, collaborative consortia, and study design approaches aimed to generalize and then ultimately discover genome-wide associations in non-European descent populations. The collaborations and data resources established in the efforts to diversify genomic findings undoubtedly provide the foundations of the next chapters of genetic association studies with the advent of budget-friendly whole-genome sequencing.", "generated_text": "Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare to individual genetic profiles, yet its efficacy is contingent upon the diversity of the populations studied. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been pivotal in identifying genetic variants associated with diseases, but the majority of these studies have been conducted in cohorts of European ancestry, limiting the generalizability of findings across different ancestry groups. This paper underscores the critical importance of incorporating diversity in precision medicine research to ensure that genetic associations and polygenic risk scores (PRS) are applicable to all populations. By analyzing data from diverse cohorts and consortia, we highlight the disparities in the identification of disease susceptibility variants and the potential for biased healthcare outcomes. Our findings advocate for a concerted effort to include underrepresented ancestry groups in genetic research, thereby enhancing the robustness and inclusivity of precision medicine. This approach not only improves the identification of disease susceptibility variants across diverse populations but also paves the way for equitable healthcare advancements.", "label": 1}
