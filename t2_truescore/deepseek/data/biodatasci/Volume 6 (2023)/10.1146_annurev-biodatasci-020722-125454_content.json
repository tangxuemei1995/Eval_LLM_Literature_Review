{"grounding": "Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental delay that affects at least 1 in 44 children. Like many neurological disorder phenotypes, the diagnostic features are observable, can be tracked over time, and can be managed or even eliminated through proper therapy and treatments. However, there are major bottlenecks in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and longitudinal tracking pipelines for autism and related neurodevelopmental delays, creating an opportunity for novel data science solutions to augment and transform existing workflows and provide increased access to services for affected families. Several efforts previously conducted by a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress toward improved digital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review the literature on digital health methods for autism behavior quantification and beneficial therapies using data science. We describe both caseâ€“control studies and classification systems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and therapeutics that integrate machine learning models of autism-related behaviors, including the factors that must be addressed for translational use. Finally, we describe ongoing challenges and potential opportunities for the field of autism data science. Given the heterogeneous nature of autism and the complexities of the relevant behaviors, this review contains insights that are relevant to neurological behavior analysis and digital psychiatry more broadly.", "generated_text": "The integration of data science and machine learning (ML) into the study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of its neuropsychiatric phenotype. This review explores the current landscape of digital phenotyping and ML applications in autism research, highlighting the potential of these technologies to transform diagnostic processes, personalize interventions, and predict outcomes. By leveraging large-scale datasets, including those derived from crowdsourcing and digital health platforms, researchers can uncover complex patterns and biomarkers associated with ASD. Digital psychiatry, through the use of wearable devices, mobile applications, and online platforms, facilitates the continuous monitoring of behavioral and physiological data, providing a more nuanced view of the disorder. However, challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration remain. This paper proposes a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of developing robust, ethical ML models that can be integrated into clinical practice. By addressing these challenges, the field can move towards more accurate, accessible, and personalized approaches to understanding and treating autism, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families.", "label": 1}
