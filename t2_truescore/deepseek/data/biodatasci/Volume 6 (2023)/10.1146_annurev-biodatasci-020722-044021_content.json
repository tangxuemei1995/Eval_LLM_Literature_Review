{"grounding": "Alternative splicing is pivotal to the regulation of gene expression and protein diversity in eukaryotic cells. The detection of alternative splicing events requires specific omics technologies. Although short-read RNA sequencing has successfully supported a plethora of investigations on alternative splicing, the emerging technologies of long-read RNA sequencing and top-down mass spectrometry open new opportunities to identify alternative splicing and protein isoforms with less ambiguity. Here, we summarize improvements in short-read RNA sequencing for alternative splicing analysis, including percent splicing index estimation and differential analysis. We also review the computational methods used in top-down proteomics analysis regarding proteoform identification, including the construction of databases of protein isoforms and statistical analyses of search results. While many improvements in sequencing and computational methods will result from emerging technologies, there should be future endeavors to increase the effectiveness, integration, and proteome coverage of alternative splicing events.", "generated_text": "The complexity of the transcriptome and proteome is significantly enhanced by alternative splicing, leading to the generation of multiple splice variants and isoforms from a single gene. This study focuses on the identification and characterization of these variants using advanced transcriptomic and proteomic technologies. Short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides high-throughput data for detecting known and novel splice junctions, while long-read RNA-seq offers the advantage of sequencing full-length transcripts, enabling the precise identification of splice variants. On the proteomic front, top-down mass spectrometry (MS) emerges as a powerful tool for the direct analysis of intact protein isoforms, or proteoforms, providing insights into the functional diversity of proteins. By integrating these complementary approaches, we aim to unravel the intricate landscape of splice variants and isoforms, enhancing our understanding of gene expression regulation and its implications in health and disease.", "label": 1}
