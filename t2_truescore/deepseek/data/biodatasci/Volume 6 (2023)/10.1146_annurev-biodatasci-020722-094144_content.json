{"grounding": "Prenatal screening using sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA has transformed obstetric care over the past decade and significantly reduced the number of invasive diagnostic procedures like amniocentesis for genetic disorders. Nonetheless, emergency care remains the only option for complications like preeclampsia and preterm birth, two of the most prevalent obstetrical syndromes. Advances in noninvasive prenatal testing expand the scope of precision medicine in obstetric care. In this review, we discuss advances, challenges, and possibilities toward the goal of providing proactive, personalized prenatal care. The highlighted advances focus mainly on cell-free nucleic acids; however, we also review research that uses signals from metabolomics, proteomics, intact cells, and the microbiome. We discuss ethical challenges in providing care. Finally, we look to future possibilities, including redefining disease taxonomy and moving from biomarker correlation to biological causation.", "generated_text": "Noninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) has revolutionized prenatal care by enabling the detection of genetic abnormalities through the analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) in maternal blood. This liquid biopsy approach offers a safer alternative to traditional invasive diagnostic procedures, reducing the risk of miscarriage. Recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics have enhanced the accuracy and scope of NIPT, allowing for the early detection of chromosomal aneuploidies, microdeletions, and single-gene disorders. However, challenges such as the interpretation of complex genomic data, ethical considerations, and the need for improved sensitivity and specificity remain. This review explores the current state of NIPT, highlighting technological advancements, ongoing challenges, and future possibilities. The potential for expanding NIPT to include a broader range of genetic conditions and its integration into routine prenatal care are discussed, underscoring its transformative impact on maternal and fetal health.", "label": 1}
