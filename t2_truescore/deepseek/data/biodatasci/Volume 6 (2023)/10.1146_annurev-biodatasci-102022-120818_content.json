{"grounding": "Despite monumental advances in molecular technology to generate genome sequence data at scale, there is still a considerable proportion of heritability in most complex diseases that remains unexplained. Because many of the discoveries have been single-nucleotide variants with small to moderate effects on disease, the functional implication of many of the variants is still unknown and, thus, we have limited new drug targets and therapeutics. We, and many others, posit that one primary factor that has limited our ability to identify novel drug targets from genome-wide association studies may be due to gene interactions (epistasis), gene–environment interactions, network/pathway effects, or multiomic relationships. We propose that many of these complex models explain much of the underlying genetic architecture of complex disease. In this review, we discuss the evidence from multiple research avenues, ranging from pairs of alleles to multiomic integration studies and pharmacogenomics, that supports the need for further investigation of gene interactions (or epistasis) in genetic and genomic studies of human disease. Our goal is to catalog the mounting evidence for epistasis in genetic studies and the connections between genetic interactions and human health and disease that could enable precision medicine of the future.", "generated_text": "The intricate interplay of genetic factors in human diseases has long been a subject of intense research, with epistasis—gene-gene interactions—emerging as a critical component in understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Recent advancements in multiomics technologies have significantly enhanced our ability to dissect these interactions, offering unprecedented insights into the molecular underpinnings of disease. This study synthesizes current evidence on the role of epistasis in human diseases, highlighting how these interactions contribute to disease susceptibility, progression, and response to treatment. By integrating data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, we explore the complex networks of gene interactions that underlie disease phenotypes. Our findings underscore the importance of considering epistasis in the development of precision medicine strategies, as it can significantly impact the identification of therapeutic targets and the prediction of treatment outcomes. This review calls for a paradigm shift in genetic research, advocating for a more nuanced approach that accounts for the multifaceted nature of gene interactions in the quest to unravel the complexities of human diseases and pave the way for more effective, personalized treatments.", "label": 1}
