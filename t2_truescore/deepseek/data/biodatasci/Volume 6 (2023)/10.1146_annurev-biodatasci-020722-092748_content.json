{"grounding": "Breast cancer risk is highly variable within the population and current research is leading the shift toward personalized medicine. By accurately assessing an individual woman's risk, we can reduce the risk of over/undertreatment by preventing unnecessary procedures or by elevating screening procedures. Breast density measured from conventional mammography has been established as one of the most dominant risk factors for breast cancer; however, it is currently limited by its ability to characterize more complex breast parenchymal patterns that have been shown to provide additional information to strengthen cancer risk models. Molecular factors ranging from high penetrance, or high likelihood that a mutation will show signs and symptoms of the disease, to combinations of gene mutations with low penetrance have shown promise for augmenting risk assessment. Although imaging biomarkers and molecular biomarkers have both individually demonstrated improved performance in risk assessment, few studies have evaluated them together. This review aims to highlight the current state of the art in breast cancer risk assessment using imaging and genetic biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women worldwide, necessitating advanced strategies for risk assessment to improve early detection and personalized treatment. This study explores the integration of molecular and radiomic features to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer risk prediction models. We focus on the utilization of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to construct a polygenic risk score (PRS), alongside radiomic features extracted from medical imaging, to capture both genetic predispositions and phenotypic tumor characteristics. By combining these diverse data types, our approach aims to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment tool that accounts for the complex interplay between genetic factors and tumor biology. Preliminary results indicate that the integration of PRS with radiomic features significantly improves the predictive performance of risk models compared to using either data type alone. This novel methodology holds promise for advancing personalized medicine in breast cancer, offering a more nuanced understanding of individual risk profiles and informing targeted prevention and intervention strategies.", "label": 1}
