{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and other data-driven technologies hold great promise to transform healthcare and confer the predictive power essential to precision medicine. However, the existing biomedical data, which are a vital resource and foundation for developing medical AI models, do not reflect the diversity of the human population. The low representation in biomedical data has become a significant health risk for non-European populations, and the growing application of AI opens a new pathway for this health risk to manifest and amplify. Here we review the current status of biomedical data inequality and present a conceptual framework for understanding its impacts on machine learning. We also discuss the recent advances in algorithmic interventions for mitigating health disparities arising from biomedical data inequality. Finally, we briefly discuss the newly identified disparity in data quality among ethnic groups and its potential impacts on machine learning.", "generated_text": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has highlighted a critical challenge: biomedical data inequality. This issue stems from the uneven representation of diverse populations in health datasets, leading to biased AI models that may not generalize well across different ethnic groups or subpopulations. This paper explores the role of AI in addressing health equity through the lens of multiethnic machine learning and transfer learning techniques. By leveraging these approaches, we aim to mitigate the effects of subpopulation shift and data inequality, ensuring that AI-driven healthcare solutions are both effective and equitable. Our analysis underscores the importance of developing inclusive datasets and adaptive algorithms that can learn from and apply knowledge across diverse populations. The findings advocate for a concerted effort among researchers, policymakers, and healthcare providers to harness AI's potential in bridging the gap in health disparities, paving the way for a more equitable healthcare landscape.", "label": 1}
