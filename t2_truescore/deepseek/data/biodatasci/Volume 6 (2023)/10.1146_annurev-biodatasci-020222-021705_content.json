{"grounding": "SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is silent or benign in most infected individuals, but causes hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia in about 10% of cases. We review studies of the human genetics of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on both rare and common variants. Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified more than 20 common loci robustly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia with modest effect sizes, some implicating genes expressed in the lungs or leukocytes. The most robust association, on chromosome 3, concerns a haplotype inherited from Neanderthals. Sequencing studies focusing on rare variants with a strong effect have been particularly successful, identifying inborn errors of type I interferon (IFN) immunity in 1–5% of unvaccinated patients with critical pneumonia, and their autoimmune phenocopy, autoantibodies against type I IFN, in another 15–20% of cases. Our growing understanding of the impact of human genetic variation on immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is enabling health systems to improve protection for individuals and populations.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted significant variability in disease severity among infected individuals, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia and death. This study explores the genetic underpinnings of COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on the contributions of both rare and common genetic variants. Utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified several loci associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, including variants in genes related to inborn errors of immunity and the type I interferon pathway. Our findings suggest that rare variants in genes critical for immune defense against viral infections may predispose individuals to severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while common variants may modulate the risk of developing severe disease. This research underscores the importance of human genomics in understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention and risk stratification.", "label": 1}
