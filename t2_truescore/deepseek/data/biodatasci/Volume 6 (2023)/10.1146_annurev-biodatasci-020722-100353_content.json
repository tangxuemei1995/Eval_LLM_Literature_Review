{"grounding": "The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey of statistical challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, from neuroimaging techniques to large-scale neuroimaging studies and statistical learning methods. We briefly review eight popular neuroimaging techniques and their potential applications in neuroscience research and clinical translation. We delineate four themes of neuroimaging data and review major image processing analysis methods for processing neuroimaging data at the individual level. We briefly review four large-scale neuroimaging-related studies and a consortium on imaging genomics and discuss four themes of neuroimaging data analysis at the population level. We review nine major population-based statistical analysis methods and their associated statistical challenges and present recent progress in statistical methodology to address these challenges.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of statistical learning methods in the analysis of neuroimaging data, with a focus on uncovering causal pathways and addressing heterogeneity within datasets. Leveraging advanced neuroimaging techniques, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates image processing analysis with population-based statistical analysis to enhance the precision and reliability of findings. Our approach emphasizes the importance of study design in identifying robust associations and causal relationships in complex neuroimaging data. Through the application of these methods, we aim to contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. This research underscores the potential of statistical learning in advancing our understanding of brain function and pathology, offering new insights into the intricate mechanisms underlying neurological diseases.", "label": 0}
