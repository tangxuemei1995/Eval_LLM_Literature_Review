{"grounding": "Drug development is a wide scientific field that faces many challenges these days. Among them are extremely high development costs, long development times, and a small number of new drugs that are approved each year. New and innovative technologies are needed to solve these problems that make the drug discovery process of small molecules more time and cost efficient, and that allow previously undruggable receptor classes to be targeted, such as protein–protein interactions. Structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs) have become a leading contender in this context. In this review, we give an introduction to the foundations of SBVSs and survey their progress in the past few years with a focus on ultralarge virtual screenings (ULVSs). We outline key principles of SBVSs, recent success stories, new screening techniques, available deep learning–based docking methods, and promising future research directions. ULVSs have an enormous potential for the development of new small-molecule drugs and are already starting to transform early-stage drug discovery.", "generated_text": "The field of drug discovery has witnessed significant advancements with the integration of ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches. These methodologies leverage the power of molecular docking, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to efficiently sift through ultralarge chemical libraries, identifying potential drug candidates with high precision. The advent of GPU acceleration has further enhanced the computational efficiency, enabling the rapid processing of billions of compounds. Additionally, free energy simulations have become increasingly important in refining the predictions of molecular interactions, offering a more accurate assessment of binding affinities. This review highlights the recent developments in these technologies, emphasizing their impact on accelerating the drug discovery pipeline. By combining computational power with advanced algorithms, researchers are now able to explore chemical space more thoroughly than ever before, paving the way for the discovery of novel therapeutics with improved efficacy and reduced side effects.", "label": 1}
