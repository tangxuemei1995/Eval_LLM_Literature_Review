{"grounding": "Constraining rates of marine carbonate burial through geologic time is critical for interpreting reconstructed changes in ocean chemistry and understanding feedbacks and interactions between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. The Quaternary Period (the past 2.6 million years) is of particular interest due to dramatic variations in sea level that periodically exposed and flooded areas of carbonate accumulation on the continental shelf, likely impacting the global carbonate budget and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These important effects remain poorly quantified. Here, we summarize the importance of carbonate burial in the oceanâ€“climate system, review methods for quantifying carbonate burial across depositional environments, discuss advances in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial over the past three decades, and identify gaps and challenges in reconciling the existing records. Emerging paleoceanographic proxies such as the stable strontium and calcium isotope systems, as well as innovative modeling approaches, are highlighted as new opportunities to produce continuous records of global carbonate burial.", "generated_text": "The burial of marine carbonates during the Quaternary period plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, influencing atmospheric CO2 levels and climate dynamics. This study synthesizes proxy- and model-based reconstructions to explore the variations in carbonate burial across glacial and interglacial cycles. By integrating sedimentary records, isotopic data, and biogeochemical models, we assess the spatial and temporal patterns of carbonate deposition and dissolution in the ocean. Our findings highlight significant shifts in carbonate burial rates, driven by changes in sea level, ocean circulation, and biological productivity. Despite advances in understanding, persisting uncertainties remain regarding the quantification of carbonate fluxes and their feedback mechanisms with climate. This research underscores the need for improved proxy records and model simulations to better constrain the role of carbonate burial in the Earth's carbon cycle and its implications for future climate scenarios.", "label": 1}
