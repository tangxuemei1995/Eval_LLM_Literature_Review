{"grounding": "Nitrogen is a major limiting element for biological productivity, and thus understanding past variations in nitrogen cycling is central to understanding past and future ocean biogeochemical cycling, global climate cycles, and biodiversity. Organic nitrogen encapsulated in fossil biominerals is generally protected from alteration, making it an important archive of the marine nitrogen cycle on seasonal to million-year timescales. The isotopic composition of fossil-bound nitrogen reflects variations in the large-scale nitrogen inventory, local sources and processing, and ecological and physiological traits of organisms. The ability to measure trace amounts of fossil-bound nitrogen has expanded with recent method developments. In this article, we review the foundations and ground truthing for three important fossil-bound proxy types: diatoms, foraminifera, and corals. We highlight their utility with examples of high-resolution evidence for anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen to the oceans, glacial–interglacial-scale assessments of nitrogen inventory change, and evidence for enhanced CO2 drawdown in the high-latitude ocean. Future directions include expanded method development, characterization of ecological and physiological variation, and exploration of extended timescales to push reconstructions further back in Earth's history.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the paleo-environmental insights provided by nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) preserved within the biomineral structures of diatoms, foraminifera, and corals. By analyzing the δ15N signatures embedded in these marine organisms, we aim to reconstruct past oceanic nitrogen cycles and their responses to climatic and environmental changes. Diatoms, foraminifera, and corals serve as natural archives, each offering unique temporal and spatial perspectives on nitrogen dynamics. The research focuses on the methodological approaches for extracting and interpreting δ15N data from fossilized specimens, highlighting the challenges and advancements in biomineral analysis. Our findings underscore the significance of nitrogen isotopes as proxies for understanding historical nutrient utilization, productivity, and biogeochemical processes in marine ecosystems. The integration of δ15N records from these diverse organisms provides a comprehensive view of the interplay between nitrogen cycling and global environmental shifts over geological timescales. This study contributes to the broader field of paleoceanography by enhancing our ability to decode the complex history of Earth's nitrogen cycle through the lens of biomineralized fossils.", "label": 1}
