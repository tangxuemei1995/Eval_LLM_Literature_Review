{"grounding": "Fishing provides the world with an important component of its food supply, but it also negatively impacts the biodiversity of marine and freshwater ecosystems, especially when industrial fishing is involved. To mitigate these impacts, civil society needs access to fisheries data (i.e., catches and catch-derived indicators of these impacts). Such data, however, must be more comprehensive than the official fisheries statistics supplied to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) by its member countries, which shape public policy in spite of their deficiencies, notably underestimating small-scale fisheries. This article documents the creation, based on the geographically coarse FAO data, of a database and website (\nhttps://www.seaaroundus.org\n) that provides free reconstructed (i.e., corrected) catch data by ecosystem, country, species, gear type, commercial value, etc., to any interested person, along with catch-derived indicators from 1950 to the near present for the entire world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the profound human impacts on marine ecosystems through the lens of global fisheries science, emphasizing the role of 'The Sea Around Us' project in serving civil society in the twenty-first century. By integrating data science and open data principles, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of artisanal, subsistence, and large-scale fisheries, highlighting their contributions to and pressures on marine biodiversity. The findings underscore the importance of accessible, transparent data in fostering sustainable fisheries management and policy-making. Through global studies, this work sheds light on the intricate balance between human needs and ocean health, advocating for a more informed and engaged civil society in the stewardship of marine resources. The study concludes with recommendations for leveraging scientific insights to mitigate human impacts on oceans, ensuring their resilience and productivity for future generations.", "label": 0}
