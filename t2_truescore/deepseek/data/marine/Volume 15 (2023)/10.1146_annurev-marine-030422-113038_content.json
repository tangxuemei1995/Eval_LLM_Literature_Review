{"grounding": "The regular movements of waves and tides are obvious representations of the oceans’ rhythmicity. But the rhythms of marine life span across ecological niches and timescales, including short (in the range of hours) and long (in the range of days and months) periods. These rhythms regulate the physiology and behavior of individuals, as well as their interactions with each other and with the environment. This review highlights examples of rhythmicity in marine animals and algae that represent important groups of marine life across different habitats. The examples cover ecologically highly relevant species and a growing number of laboratory model systems that are used to disentangle key mechanistic principles. The review introduces fundamental concepts of chronobiology, such as the distinction between rhythmic and endogenous oscillator–driven processes. It also addresses the relevance of studying diverse rhythms and oscillators, as well as their interconnection, for making better predictions of how species will respond to environmental perturbations, including climate change. As the review aims to address scientists from the diverse fields of marine biology, ecology, and molecular chronobiology, all of which have their own scientific terms, we provide definitions of key terms throughout the article.", "generated_text": "Marine organisms exhibit a remarkable array of biological rhythms, synchronized with environmental cycles through endogenous oscillators. These rhythms, including circadian, circatidal, circalunar, and circannual, play crucial roles in the survival and reproductive success of species ranging from algae to complex animals. This study delves into the mechanisms underlying these biological clocks, exploring how they are entrained by environmental cues such as light, temperature, and tidal movements. Furthermore, we examine the impact of climate change on these rhythms, highlighting the potential disruptions to marine ecosystems. As global temperatures rise and oceanic conditions shift, the synchronization between endogenous oscillators and environmental cycles may be altered, affecting the timing of critical biological processes. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, this research underscores the importance of understanding biological rhythms in marine organisms for predicting their responses to environmental changes. By integrating findings from molecular biology, ecology, and climatology, we aim to provide insights into the resilience of marine life in the face of ongoing climate challenges, offering a foundation for future conservation strategies.", "label": 1}
