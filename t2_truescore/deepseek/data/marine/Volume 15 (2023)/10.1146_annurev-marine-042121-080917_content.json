{"grounding": "To thrive in nutrient-poor waters, coral reefs must retain and recycle materials efficiently. This review centers microbial processes in facilitating the persistence and stability of coral reefs, specifically the role of these processes in transforming and recycling the dissolved organic matter (DOM) that acts as an invisible currency in reef production, nutrient exchange, and organismal interactions. The defining characteristics of coral reefs, including high productivity, balanced metabolism, high biodiversity, nutrient retention, and structural complexity, are inextricably linked to microbial processing of DOM. The composition of microbes and DOM in reefs is summarized, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of biogeochemical processes carried out by microorganisms in diverse reef habitats are explored in a variety of key reef processes, including decomposition, accretion, trophictransfer, and macronutrient recycling. Finally, we examine how widespread habitat degradation of reefs is altering these important microbeâ€“DOM interactions, creating feedbacks that reduce reef resilience to global change.", "generated_text": "Coral reefs, among the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, are facing unprecedented threats from climate change, including deoxygenation and nutrient imbalances. This study delves into the pivotal role of microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sustaining coral reef ecosystem function and resilience. Through a comprehensive analysis of microbiomes and their metabolic pathways, we uncover the intricate processes of nutrient cycling that are essential for coral health and survival. Our findings highlight how microbes mediate the transformation of DOM, facilitating the recycling of nutrients and supporting the complex web of life within coral reefs. Furthermore, we explore the implications of deoxygenation on these microbial processes, revealing potential vulnerabilities and adaptive strategies. This research underscores the importance of microbial-DOM interactions in maintaining ecosystem balance and offers insights into strategies for enhancing coral reef resilience in the face of environmental stressors.", "label": 1}
