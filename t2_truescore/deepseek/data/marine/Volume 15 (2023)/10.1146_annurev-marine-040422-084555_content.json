{"grounding": "The modes of Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV), traditionally defined as statistical patterns of variance, reflect to first order the ocean's integration (i.e., reddening) of atmospheric forcing that arises from both a shift and a change in strength of the climatological (time-mean) atmospheric circulation. While these patterns concisely describe PDV, they do not distinguish among the key dynamical processes driving the evolution of PDV anomalies, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks with similar spatial structures that operate on different timescales. In this review, we synthesize past analysis using an empirical dynamical model constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies drawn from several reanalysis products, showing that the PDV modes of variance result from two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes: the North Pacific–central Pacific (NP-CP) and Kuroshio–Oyashio Extension (KOE) modes. Both eigenmodes highlight how two-way tropical–extratropical teleconnection dynamics are the primary mechanisms energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale footprint of PDV. While the NP-CP mode captures interannual- to decadal-scale variability, the KOE mode is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV on decadal to multidecadal timescales, including contributions from the South Pacific.", "generated_text": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV) represents a significant mode of climate variability with profound impacts on global weather patterns, ecosystems, and human activities. This study synthesizes current understanding of the modes and mechanisms driving PDV, focusing on the interplay between oceanic and atmospheric processes within the Pacific Ocean. We explore the role of ocean–atmosphere teleconnections in modulating PDV, emphasizing the influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a key driver of interannual to decadal climate fluctuations. Through a comprehensive review of observational data, climate model simulations, and theoretical frameworks, we identify the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) as dominant patterns of PDV, characterized by shifts in sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric pressure across the Pacific basin. The mechanisms underlying these patterns, including ocean heat content variability, wind-driven ocean circulation changes, and feedback loops between the ocean and atmosphere, are critically examined. Furthermore, this study highlights the implications of PDV for climate change projections, underscoring the need for improved understanding and predictive capabilities to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies in a warming world.", "label": 1}
