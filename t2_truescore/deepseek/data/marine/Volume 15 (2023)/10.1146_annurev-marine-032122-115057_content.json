{"grounding": "Exchange of material across the nearshore region, extending from the shoreline to a few kilometers offshore, determines the concentrations of pathogens and nutrients near the coast and the transport of larvae, whose cross-shore positions influence dispersal and recruitment. Here, we describe a framework for estimating the relative importance of cross-shore exchange mechanisms, including winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling. For each mechanism, we define an exchange velocity as a function of environmental conditions. The exchange velocity applies for organisms that keep a particular depth due to swimming or buoyancy. A related exchange diffusivity quantifies horizontal spreading of particles without enough vertical swimming speed or buoyancy to counteract turbulent velocities. This framework provides a way to determinewhich processes are important for cross-shore exchange for a particular study site, time period, and particle behavior.", "generated_text": "The nearshore region, a dynamic interface between land and sea, plays a critical role in the exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles, significantly impacting coastal ecosystems and water quality. This study investigates the mechanisms driving cross-shore exchange, focusing on the behavior of particles under the influence of turbulence, wind, surface waves, and internal waves. Utilizing a combination of field observations and numerical modeling, we explore how these physical forces facilitate the transport and mixing of materials across the nearshore zone. Our findings reveal that turbulence and wave-induced currents are primary drivers of particle dispersion, while wind and internal waves contribute to the vertical and horizontal redistribution of substances. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting the fate of pollutants and the distribution of plankton, offering insights into the management and conservation of coastal environments.", "label": 1}
