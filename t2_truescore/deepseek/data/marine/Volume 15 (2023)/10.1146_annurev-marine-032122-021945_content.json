{"grounding": "The world's eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) contribute disproportionately to global ocean productivity and provide critical ecosystem services to human society. The impact of climate change on EBUSs and the ecosystems they support is thus a subject of considerable interest. Here, we review hypotheses of climate-driven change in the physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology of EBUSs; describe observed changes over recent decades; and present projected changes over the twenty-first century. Similarities in historical and projected change among EBUSs include a trend toward upwelling intensification in poleward regions, mitigatedwarming in near-coastal regions where upwelling intensifies, and enhanced water-column stratification and a shoaling mixed layer. However, there remains significant uncertainty in how EBUSs will evolve with climate change, particularly in how the sometimes competing changes in upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification will affect productivity and ecosystem structure. We summarize the commonalities and differences in historical and projected change in EBUSs and conclude with an assessment of key remaining uncertainties and questions. Future studies will need to address these questions to better understand, project, and adapt to climate-driven changes in EBUSs.", "generated_text": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are among the most productive marine ecosystems, playing a crucial role in global carbon cycling and supporting significant fisheries. This study investigates the impacts of climate change on EBUS, focusing on the mechanisms through which global warming alters coastal upwelling dynamics. Utilizing a combination of historical data analysis, climate model projections, and ecological modeling, we assess changes in upwelling intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution under various climate scenarios. Our findings indicate a complex response of EBUS to climate change, with potential increases in upwelling intensity in some regions due to enhanced wind stress, while others may experience weakened upwelling as a result of altered atmospheric circulation patterns. These changes have profound implications for marine biodiversity, fisheries productivity, and carbon sequestration capacity. The study highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on EBUS and the communities that depend on them. By integrating multidisciplinary approaches, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the resilience of EBUS in the face of global environmental change.", "label": 1}
