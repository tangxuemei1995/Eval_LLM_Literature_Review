{"grounding": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) is rapidly attracting interest, as climate change is putting ecosystems at risk and endangering human communities globally. Due to the centrality of the ocean in the global carbon cycle, augmenting the carbon sequestration capacity of the ocean could be a powerful mechanism for the removal of legacy excess emissions. However, OCDR requires careful assessment due to the unique biophysical characteristics of the ocean and its centrality in the Earth system and many social systems. Using a sociotechnical system lens, this review identifies the sets of considerations that need to be included within robust assessments for OCDR decision-making. Specifically, it lays out the state of technical assessments of OCDR approaches along with key financial concerns, social issues (including public perceptions), and the underlying ethical debates and concerns that would need to be addressed if OCDR were to be deployed as a carbon dioxide removal strategy.", "generated_text": "Ocean Carbon Dioxide Removal (OCDR) has emerged as a pivotal strategy in mitigating climate change, leveraging the ocean's vast capacity to absorb CO2. This paper delves into the sociotechnical dimensions of OCDR, exploring the interplay between technological innovation, climate finance mechanisms, public perception, and environmental ethics. We examine the technological feasibility and scalability of OCDR methods, alongside the financial models that could support their deployment. Public perception is scrutinized to understand societal acceptance and the potential for public engagement in OCDR initiatives. Furthermore, the study addresses the ethical considerations surrounding OCDR, including its impact on marine ecosystems and the equitable distribution of its benefits and risks. By integrating these sociotechnical aspects, this research aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the responsible development and implementation of OCDR strategies, ensuring they contribute effectively to global climate goals while respecting ecological and societal values.", "label": 1}
