{"grounding": "Climatic extremes are becoming increasingly common against a background trend of global warming. In the oceans, marine heatwaves (MHWs)—discrete periods of anomalously warm water—have intensified and become more frequent over the past century, impacting the integrity of marine ecosystems globally. We review and synthesize current understanding of MHW impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. We then examine how these impacts affect broader ecosystem services and discuss the current state of research on biological impacts of MHWs. Finally, we explore current and emergent approaches to predicting the occurrence andimpacts of future events, along with adaptation and management approaches. With further increases in intensity and frequency projected for coming decades, MHWs are emerging as pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems globally. A deeper mechanistic understanding of their biological impacts is needed to better predict and adapt to increased MHW activity in the Anthropocene.", "generated_text": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are extreme climatic events characterized by prolonged periods of anomalously high sea temperatures, which have become more frequent and intense due to climate change. These events pose significant threats to marine ecosystems, altering biodiversity, disrupting ecosystem services, and causing shifts in species distributions. This study investigates the biological impacts of MHWs, focusing on their effects on marine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services. By synthesizing recent research, we highlight the cascading effects of MHWs on marine life, including coral bleaching, changes in species interactions, and the loss of habitat-forming species. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these changes for human societies that rely on marine resources. Our findings underscore the urgent need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of MHWs and safeguard marine ecosystems in the face of ongoing climate change.", "label": 1}
