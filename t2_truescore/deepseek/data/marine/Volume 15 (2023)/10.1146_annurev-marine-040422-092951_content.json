{"grounding": "Tidal marshes and mangroves are increasingly valued for nature-based mitigation of coastal storm impacts, such as flooding and shoreline erosion hazards, which are growing due to global change. As this review highlights, however, hazard mitigation by tidal wetlands is limited to certain conditions, and not all hazards are equally reduced. Tidal wetlands are effective in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves, but long-period storm surges, which elevate sea levels up to several meters for up to more than a day, are attenuated less effectively, or in some cases not at all, depending on storm conditions, wetland properties, and larger-scale coastal landscape geometry. Wetlands often limit erosion, but storm damage to vegetation (especially mangrove trees) can be substantial, and recovery may take several years. Longer-term wetland persistence can be compromised when combined with other stressors, such as climate change and human disturbances. Due to these uncertainties, nature-based coastal defense projects need to adopt adaptive management strategies.", "generated_text": "Tidal wetlands, including marshes and mangroves, play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of coastal storms such as cyclones and hurricanes. These natural ecosystems act as buffers, reducing wave energy, storm surge, and flood risks, thereby protecting inland areas and human settlements. This study explores the effectiveness of marshes and mangroves as nature-based solutions for coastal defense, comparing their performance with traditional coastal engineering approaches. Through a review of recent scientific literature and case studies, we assess the capacity of these ecosystems to attenuate storm impacts, their resilience to extreme weather events, and their contribution to biodiversity and carbon sequestration. The findings highlight the potential of integrating tidal wetlands into coastal management strategies, offering sustainable and cost-effective alternatives to hard infrastructure. This research underscores the importance of preserving and restoring these critical habitats to enhance coastal resilience in the face of increasing storm intensity and frequency due to climate change.", "label": 1}
