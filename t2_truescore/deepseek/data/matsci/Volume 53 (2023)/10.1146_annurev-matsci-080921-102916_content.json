{"grounding": "Soft robotics aims to close the performance gap between built and biological machines through materials design. Soft robots are constructed from soft, actuatable materials to be physically intelligent, or to have traits that living organisms possess such as passive adaptability and morphological computation through their compliant, deformable bodies. However, materials selection for physical intelligence often involves low-performance and/or energy-inefficient, stimuli-responsive materials for actuation. Additional challenges in soft robot sensorization and control further limit the practical utility of these machines. Recognizing that electrically controllable materials are crucial for the development of soft machines that are both physically and computationally intelligent, we review progress in the development of electroprogrammable materials for soft robotic actuation. We focus on thermomechanical, electrostatic, and electrochemical actuation strategies that are directly controlled by electric currents and fields. We conclude with an outlook on the design and fabrication of next-generation robotic materials that will facilitate true bioinspired autonomy.", "generated_text": "The advent of soft robotics has ushered in a new era of machines that mimic the adaptability and versatility of biological organisms. Central to this innovation are electrically controllable materials, which serve as the cornerstone for the development of soft, bioinspired machines. These materials, capable of undergoing significant deformation in response to electrical stimuli, enable the creation of actuators that are both highly efficient and multifunctional. This research delves into the latest advancements in robotic materials, focusing on their application in soft robotics. By drawing inspiration from nature, we explore the synthesis and characterization of materials that can replicate the complex movements and functionalities of biological systems. The integration of these materials into soft robotic systems promises to revolutionize the field, offering unprecedented levels of control, adaptability, and efficiency. This study highlights the potential of electrically controllable materials in paving the way for the next generation of bioinspired machines, setting a new benchmark for innovation in robotics.", "label": 1}
