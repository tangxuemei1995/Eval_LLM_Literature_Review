{"grounding": "If variety is the spice of life, then abnormal grain growth (AGG) may be the materials processing equivalent of sriracha sauce. Abnormally growing grains can be prismatic, dendritic, or practically any shape in between. When they grow at least an order of magnitude larger than their neighbors in the matrix—a state we call extreme AGG—we can examine the abnormal/matrix interface for clues to the underlying mechanism. Simulating AGG for various formulations of the grain boundary (GB) equation of motion, we show that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy leave a characteristic fingerprint in the abnormal/matrix boundary. Except in the case of prismatic growth, the morphological signature of most reported instances of AGG is consistent with a certain degree of GB mobility variability. Open questions remain, however, concerning the mechanism by which the corresponding growth advantage is established and maintained as the GBs of abnormal grains advance through the matrix.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the phenomenon of extreme abnormal grain growth (AGG), a critical process in materials science that significantly influences the microstructural evolution of polycrystalline materials. By integrating theoretical models with experimental observations, we explore the intricate interplay between grain boundary energy, grain boundary mobility, and Zener pinning effects in driving AGG. Our analysis reveals that the mechanisms underlying AGG are not only governed by the thermodynamic driving forces but are also intricately linked to the kinetic pathways that dictate grain growth dynamics. We further investigate how these mechanisms culminate in the formation of grain growth–induced microstructures, highlighting the role of local heterogeneities and boundary conditions in shaping the final microstructural outcomes. This comprehensive understanding paves the way for the strategic manipulation of AGG processes, offering new avenues for the design and optimization of materials with tailored microstructural properties for advanced applications.", "label": 0}
