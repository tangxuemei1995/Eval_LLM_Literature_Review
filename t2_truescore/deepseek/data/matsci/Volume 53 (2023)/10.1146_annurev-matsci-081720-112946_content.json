{"grounding": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have found a role in crystal morphology engineering and control by specific binding to crystal surfaces through stereo-chemical recognition. The utility of TMAs, however, has been largely limited to crystal growth from solutions. In this review, we illustrate examples where TMAs have been used to influence the growth of crystals during cooling of their melts. In solution, the crystal growth driving force is governed by solute supersaturation, which corresponds to the deviation from equilibrium. In growth from melts, however, undercooling is the important thermodynamic parameter responsible for crystallization outcomes, a key difference that can influence the manner in which TMAs affect growth kinetics, crystal morphology, nucleation, enantioselective surface recognition, and the determination of the absolute sense of polar axes. When the crystallization driving force in a melt is small and diffusion is comparatively high, TMAs can exert their influence on well-faceted single crystals with the stereochemical richness observed in solution growth. Under high supercooling, where the driving force is large, ensembles of crystals can grow radially, masking stereochemical information and requiring new optical tools for understanding the influence of TMAs on emerging crystals.", "generated_text": "The incorporation of tailor-made additives into melt crystallization processes has emerged as a sophisticated strategy to control the morphology, chirality, and polarity of molecular crystals. This study delves into the rationale behind the use of such additives, exploring their impact on the formation of spherulites and twisted crystals, which are pivotal in determining the physical properties of the final crystalline product. By systematically analyzing the interactions between additives and host molecules during the melt crystallization process, we uncover the mechanisms through which these additives influence crystal growth and morphology. The investigation highlights the potential of tailor-made additives to induce chirality and polarity in otherwise achiral or non-polar crystals, offering a pathway to engineer materials with desired optical and electronic properties. However, the study also addresses the challenges and limitations associated with the use of these additives, including the complexity of predicting their effects and the potential for unintended consequences on crystal quality. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements and case studies, this research provides insights into the strategic use of tailor-made additives in melt crystallization, offering a balanced perspective on their benefits and drawbacks.", "label": 1}
