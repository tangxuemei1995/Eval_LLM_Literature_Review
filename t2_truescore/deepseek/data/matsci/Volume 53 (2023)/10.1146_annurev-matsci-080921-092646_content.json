{"grounding": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is one of the most powerful characterization tools in materials science research. Due to instrumentation developments such as highly coherent electron sources, aberration correctors, and direct electron detectors, STEM experiments can examine the structure and properties of materials at length scales of functional devices and materials down to single atoms. STEM encompasses a wide array of flexible operating modes, including imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and 3D tomography experiments. This review outlines many common STEM experimental methods with a focus on quantitative data analysis and simulation methods, especially those enabled by open source software. The hope is to introduce both classic and new experimental methods to materials scientists and summarize recent progress in STEM characterization. The review also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the various STEM methodologies and briefly considers promising future directions for quantitative STEM research.", "generated_text": "Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has emerged as a pivotal tool in materials science, offering unparalleled insights into the atomic structure and composition of materials. This study delves into the quantitative aspects of STEM, encompassing imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and tomography, to provide a comprehensive understanding of material properties at the nanoscale. By integrating advanced simulation techniques with experimental data, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of quantitative analysis, facilitating the exploration of complex material behaviors. Our approach not only advances the capabilities of STEM in characterizing materials but also bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. This research underscores the significance of STEM in driving innovations in materials science, offering a robust framework for the development of new materials with tailored properties for a wide range of applications.", "label": 1}
