{"grounding": "Owing to its unique structure, morphology, and crystal quality, low-dimensional (L-D) ice has attracted increasing attention in recent years. With a size (at least in one dimension) between that of a single water molecule and a snowflake, L-D ice does not only appear as an intermediate state during the dimensional change but can also manifest extraordinary characteristics, from its molecular structures to its physical properties, which offer exciting opportunities for a better understanding and utilization of ice. In this article, we start with a brief introduction to the crystal growth, structure, and typical characterization techniques of ice and then review recent progress in the study of crystal growth, molecular structures, phase morphologies, and physical properties of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional (0-, 1-, and 2D) ice. Extraordinary behaviors of ice in low dimensions and extreme conditions are highlighted. Finally, the future outlook for the physical study and technological applications of L-D ice is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intriguing realm of low-dimensional and confined ice, exploring its unique structural, optical, and mechanical properties. By leveraging advanced crystal growth techniques and comprehensive characterization methods, we investigate the morphology and interface dynamics of ice under confinement. Our findings reveal that the low-dimensional structure of ice significantly influences its physical properties, leading to deviations from bulk ice behavior. The optical properties of confined ice exhibit notable changes, attributed to the altered electronic and vibrational states in reduced dimensions. Furthermore, mechanical property assessments indicate enhanced strength and flexibility, suggesting potential applications in nanotechnology and materials science. This research not only advances our understanding of ice in confined geometries but also opens new avenues for the development of ice-based materials with tailored properties for specific technological applications.", "label": 0}
