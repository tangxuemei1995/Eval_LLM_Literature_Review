{"grounding": "High-throughput data generation methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms have given rise to a new era of computational materials science by learning the relations between composition, structure, and properties and by exploiting such relations for design. However, to build these connections, materials data must be translated into a numerical form, called a representation, that can be processed by an ML model. Data sets in materials science vary in format (ranging from images to spectra), size, and fidelity. Predictive models vary in scope and properties of interest. Here, we review context-dependent strategies for constructing representations that enable the use of materials as inputs or outputs for ML models. Furthermore, we discuss how modern ML techniques can learn representations from data and transfer chemical and physical information between tasks. Finally, we outline high-impact questions that have not been fully resolved and thus require further investigation.", "generated_text": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into materials science has revolutionized the way we predict, discover, and design new materials. Central to this advancement is the development of effective representations of materials that capture their essential features for ML models. This abstract explores the critical role of representation and feature engineering in enhancing the performance of ML applications in materials science, with a particular focus on crystal structures. We delve into various strategies for encoding materials' properties, including compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors, and discuss their impact on predictive modeling and generative design. Furthermore, we highlight recent progress in generative models that leverage sophisticated representations to propose novel materials with desired properties. By bridging the gap between materials science and ML, this work underscores the importance of innovative representation techniques in accelerating materials discovery and optimization.", "label": 1}
