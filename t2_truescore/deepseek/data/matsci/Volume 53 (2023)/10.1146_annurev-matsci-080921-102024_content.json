{"grounding": "Most heterogeneous catalytic processes occur between combinations of gases, liquids, and solids at elevated temperatures. They play a critical role for society in energy production, health care, a cleaner environment, industrial products, food, fuel cells, battery technologies, and photocatalysis. Dynamic gasâ€“solid catalyst reactions take place at the atomic level, with active catalyst structures forming, and often also progressively and competitively deactivating, under reaction conditions. There is increasing evidence that single atoms and small clusters of atoms can act as primary active sites in catalytic reactions. Understanding and directing the reactions at the atomic level under controlled operating conditions are crucial for the development of improved materials and processes. We review advances in dynamic in situ microscopy for directly probing heterogeneous catalysis at the atomic level in live action and real time. Benefits include new knowledge and improved management of process fundamentals for greater efficiency and sustainability.", "generated_text": "This study explores the transformative potential of dynamic in situ electron microscopy in the realm of single-atom catalysis, a cutting-edge area of chemical research. By leveraging the unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution of in situ microscopy, we delve into the live-action dynamics of catalytic processes at the atomic level. Our research focuses on the real-time observation of single-atom catalysts (SACs) during chemical reactions, providing unprecedented insights into their structural evolution, stability, and activity. Through the integration of advanced imaging techniques and computational modeling, we aim to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying catalytic efficiency and selectivity. This work not only advances our fundamental understanding of single-atom catalysis but also paves the way for the design of more effective and sustainable catalytic materials. Our findings underscore the critical role of dynamic in situ microscopy in pushing the boundaries of chemical research, offering a new paradigm for the study of catalytic processes at the atomic scale.", "label": 0}
