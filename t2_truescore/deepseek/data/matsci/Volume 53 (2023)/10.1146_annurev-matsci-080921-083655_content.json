{"grounding": "The increasing consumption of nonrenewable materials urgently calls for the design and fabrication of sustainable alternatives. New generations of materials should be derived from renewable sources, processed using environmentally friendly methods, and designed considering their full life cycle, especially their end-of-life fate. Here, we review recent advances in developing sustainable polymers from biological matter (biomatter), including progress in the extraction and utilization of bioderived monomers and polymers, as well as the emergence of polymers produced directly from unprocessed biomatter (entire cells or tissues). We also discuss applications of sustainable polymers in bioplastics, biocomposites, and cementitious biomaterials, with emphasis on relating their performance to underlying fundamental mechanisms. Finally, we provide a future outlook for sustainable material development, highlighting the need for more accurate and accessible tools for assessing life-cycle impacts and socioeconomic challenges as this field advances.", "generated_text": "The quest for sustainable materials has led to significant advancements in the development of polymers derived from biological matter. This research explores the synthesis and application of biopolymers and biocomposites, emphasizing their role in reducing environmental impact and reliance on non-renewable resources. By harnessing renewable resources, these materials offer a promising alternative to conventional polymers, particularly in industries such as construction, where cementitious materials are prevalent. The study highlights the latest progress in the field, including innovative processing techniques and the integration of biopolymers into existing manufacturing frameworks. Furthermore, it examines the challenges and opportunities associated with the adoption of these sustainable materials, from scalability and cost-effectiveness to performance and durability. The findings underscore the potential of biopolymers and biocomposites to contribute to a more sustainable future, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change and promote environmental stewardship.", "label": 1}
