{"grounding": "Grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials migrate to reduce the total excess energy. It has recently been found that the factors governing migration rates of boundaries in bicrystals are insufficient to explain boundary migration in polycrystals. We first review our current understanding of the atomistic mechanisms of grain boundary migration based on simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. We then review our current understanding at the continuum scale based on simulations and observations using high-energy diffraction microscopy. We conclude that detailed comparisons of experimental observations with atomistic simulations of migration in polycrystals (rather than bicrystals) are required to better understand the mechanisms of grain boundary migration, that the driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals must include factors other than curvature, and that current simulations of grain growth are insufficient for reproducing experimental observations, possibly because of an inadequate representation of the driving force.", "generated_text": "Grain boundary migration plays a pivotal role in determining the microstructure and properties of polycrystalline materials. This study delves into the mechanisms and kinetics of grain boundary migration, focusing on its impact on grain growth and the evolution of microstructural characteristics. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we explore the factors influencing grain boundary mobility, including temperature, grain boundary energy, and the presence of impurities. The analysis highlights the interplay between grain boundary migration and the overall grain growth process, shedding light on the dynamic nature of microstructural development in polycrystals. Furthermore, the study discusses the implications of grain boundary migration for material properties, such as mechanical strength and electrical conductivity. By integrating theoretical models with empirical observations, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of grain boundary dynamics and its significance in materials science and engineering.", "label": 1}
