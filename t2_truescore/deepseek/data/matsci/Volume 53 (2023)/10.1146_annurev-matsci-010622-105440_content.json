{"grounding": "Natural wood has been used for construction, fuel, and furniture for thousands of years because of its versatility, renewability, and aesthetic appeal. However, new opportunities for wood are arising as researchers have developed ways to tune the material's optical, thermal, mechanical, and ionic transport properties by chemically and physically modifying wood's naturally porous structure and chemical composition. Such modifications can be used to produce sustainable, functional materials for various emerging applications such as automobiles, construction, energy storage, and environmental remediation. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in engineered wood for sustainable technologies, including thermal and light management, environmental remediation, nanofluidics, batteries, and structural materials with high strength-to-weight ratios. Additionally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future of wood research are discussed, providing a guideline for the further development of next-generation, sustainable wood-based materials.", "generated_text": "Engineered wood represents a pivotal advancement in sustainable materials, integrating innovative technologies to enhance its properties and applications. This study explores the integration of nanocellulose and the development of transparent wood, highlighting their roles in promoting sustainability and improving thermal management. Nanocellulose, derived from wood fibers, offers exceptional strength and lightweight characteristics, making it an ideal reinforcement in engineered wood products. Transparent wood, achieved through the removal of lignin and infusion with polymers, emerges as a promising material for energy-efficient building applications, offering superior insulation and light transmittance. The research underscores the potential of engineered wood in reducing the environmental footprint of construction materials, while providing solutions for thermal regulation in buildings. Through a comprehensive analysis of current technologies and applications, this paper advocates for the broader adoption of engineered wood in sustainable development initiatives, emphasizing its benefits in energy conservation and environmental preservation.", "label": 1}
