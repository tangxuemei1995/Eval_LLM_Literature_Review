{"grounding": "The energy-efficient manipulation of the properties of functional materials is of great interest from both a scientific and an applied perspective. The application of electric fields is one of the most widely used methods to induce significant changes in the properties of materials, such as their structural, transport, magnetic, and optical properties. This article presents an overview of recent research on the manipulation of the electronic and magnetic properties of various material systems via electrolyte-based ionic gating. Oxides, magnetic thin-film heterostructures, and van der Waals 2D layers are discussed as exemplary systems. The detailed mechanisms through which ionic gating can induce significant changes in material properties, including their crystal and electronic structure and their electrical, optical, and magnetic properties, are summarized. Current and potential future functional devices enabled by such ionic control mechanisms are also briefly summarized, especially with respect to the emerging field of neuromorphic computing. Finally, a brief outlook and some key challenges are presented.", "generated_text": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for dynamically tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of materials, offering unprecedented control over their functional characteristics. This approach leverages the application of an electric field to modulate the carrier density at the interface between an ionic liquid and a material, enabling the exploration of novel physical phenomena. Transition metal oxides, magnetic thin films, and van der Waals 2D materials have been particularly responsive to ionic gating, exhibiting significant changes in conductivity, magnetism, and even superconductivity. The ability to precisely control these properties opens new avenues for the development of advanced electronic devices, including neuromorphic computing systems that mimic the neural architecture of the human brain. This review highlights recent advancements in ionic gating, focusing on its application to various material systems and its potential to revolutionize the field of condensed matter physics and device engineering.", "label": 1}
