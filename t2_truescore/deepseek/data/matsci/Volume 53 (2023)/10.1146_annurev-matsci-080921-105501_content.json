{"grounding": "We review the class of materials known as polar metals, in which polarity and metallicity coexist in the same phase. While the notion of polar metals was first invoked more than 50 years ago, their practical realization has proved challenging since the itinerant carriers required for metallicity tend to screen any polarization. Huge progress has been made in the last decade, with many mechanisms for combining polarity and metallicity proposed and the first examples, LiOsO3 and WTe2, identified experimentally. The availability of polar metallic samples has opened a new paradigm in polar metal research, with implications in the fields of topology, ferroelectricity, magnetoelectricity, spintronics, and superconductivity. Here, we review the principles and techniques that have been developed to design and engineer polar metals and describe some of their interesting properties, with a focus on the most promising directions for future work.", "generated_text": "Polar metals, a unique class of materials that combine metallic conductivity with polar structural distortions, challenge the conventional dichotomy between insulating ferroelectrics and non-polar metals. This review delves into the fundamental principles underlying the coexistence of polarity and metallicity, focusing on the role of crystal symmetry, electron-phonon coupling, and the mechanisms that allow polar distortions to persist in the presence of free charge carriers. We explore the diverse family of polar metals, with particular emphasis on perovskite oxides, which exhibit a rich variety of polar and metallic behaviors due to their structural flexibility and strong electronic correlations. The concept of improper ferroelectricity, where polar distortions are driven by non-polar order parameters, is highlighted as a key mechanism for stabilizing polar metals. Finally, we discuss the prospects for polar metals in next-generation electronic devices, including non-volatile memory, sensors, and energy-efficient computing, underscoring the potential for these materials to bridge the gap between ferroelectric and metallic functionalities.", "label": 1}
