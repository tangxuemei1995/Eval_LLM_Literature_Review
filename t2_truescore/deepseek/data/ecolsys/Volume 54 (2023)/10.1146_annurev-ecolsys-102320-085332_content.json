{"grounding": "Over 70% of soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored at a depth greater than 20 cm belowground. A portion of this deep SOC actively cycles on annual to decadal timescales and is sensitive to global change. However, deep SOC responses to global change likely differ from surface SOC responses because biotic controls on SOC cycling become weaker as mineral controls predominate with depth. Here, we synthesize the current information on deep SOC responses to the global change drivers of warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. Most deep SOC responses can only be hypothesized because few global change studies measure deep soils, and even fewer global change experiments manipulate deep soils. We call on scientists to incorporate deep soils into their manipulations, measurements, and models so that the response of deep SOC can be accounted for in projections of nature-based climate solutions and terrestrial feedbacks to climate change.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the response of deep soil organic carbon (SOC) to global change factors, including climate change, elevated CO2 levels, and land use and land cover change (LULCC). Deep SOC, a critical component of the global carbon cycle, has been understudied despite its significant role in carbon sequestration and climate regulation. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of long-term soil carbon data, we assess how changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and land management practices influence deep SOC stocks. Our findings reveal that while elevated CO2 can enhance carbon inputs to deep soils through increased plant productivity, climate change and LULCC may lead to substantial carbon losses due to enhanced decomposition rates and soil disturbance. This research underscores the importance of incorporating deep SOC dynamics into global carbon models to improve predictions of carbon-climate feedbacks and inform sustainable land management strategies.", "label": 1}
