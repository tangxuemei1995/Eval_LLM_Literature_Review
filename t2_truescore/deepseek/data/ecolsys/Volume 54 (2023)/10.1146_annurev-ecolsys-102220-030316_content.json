{"grounding": "The way in which terrestrial organisms use the acoustic realm is fundamentally important and shapes behavior, populations, and communities, but how background acoustics, or noise, influence the patterns and processes in ecology is still relatively understudied. In this review, we summarize how background acoustics have traditionally been studied from the signaling perspective, discuss what is known from a receiver's perspective, and explore what is known about population- and community-level responses to noise. We suggest that there are major gaps linking animal physiology and behavior in noise to fitness; that there is a limited understanding of variation in hearing within and across species, especially in the context of real-world acoustic conditions; and that many puzzling responses to noise could be clarified with a community-level lens that considers indirect effects. Failing to consider variation in acoustic conditions, and the many ways organisms use and interact via this environmental dimension, risks a limited understanding of natural systems.", "generated_text": "This study explores the role of background acoustics in terrestrial ecosystems, focusing on its impact on animal behavior and community ecology. By analyzing the direct and indirect effects of soundscapes on species interactions, we investigate how acoustic environments influence communication, predator-prey dynamics, and habitat selection. Special attention is given to the phenomenon of auditory masking, where background noise interferes with the detection of biologically significant sounds, potentially altering species' survival strategies. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we aim to elucidate the complex interplay between acoustic conditions and ecological processes. Our findings highlight the importance of considering soundscapes in conservation planning and ecosystem management, suggesting that changes in acoustic environments can have profound implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This research underscores the need for further studies to understand the ecological consequences of anthropogenic noise and to develop strategies for mitigating its impact on terrestrial wildlife.", "label": 1}
