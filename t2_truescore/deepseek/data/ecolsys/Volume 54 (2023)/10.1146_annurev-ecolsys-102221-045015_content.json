{"grounding": "Plants and herbivores are remarkably variable in space and time, and variability has been considered a defining feature of their interactions. Empirical research, however, has traditionally focused on understanding differences in means and overlooked the theoretically significant ecological and evolutionary roles of variability itself. We review the literature with the goal of showing how variability-explicit research expands our perspective on plant–herbivore ecology and evolution. We first clarify terminology for describing variation and then review patterns, causes, and consequences of variation in herbivory across scales of space, time, and biological organization. We consider how incorporating variability improves existing hypotheses and leads to new ones. We conclude by suggesting future work that reports full distributions, integrates effects of variation across scales, describes nonlinearities, and considers how stochastic and deterministic variation combine to determine herbivory distributions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of plant–herbivore interactions, emphasizing the ecological variability that influences these relationships. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the mechanisms by which plants develop defensive strategies against herbivory and how herbivores adapt to overcome these defenses. The variability in these interactions is influenced by factors such as species-specific traits, environmental conditions, and evolutionary pressures. Our findings highlight the complexity of species interactions within ecosystems, revealing that the outcomes of plant–herbivore encounters are not only determined by the direct effects of herbivory but also by indirect effects mediated through changes in plant physiology and community structure. This research underscores the importance of considering ecological variability in understanding the evolutionary arms race between plants and herbivores, offering insights into the resilience and adaptability of ecosystems in the face of changing environmental conditions.", "label": 1}
