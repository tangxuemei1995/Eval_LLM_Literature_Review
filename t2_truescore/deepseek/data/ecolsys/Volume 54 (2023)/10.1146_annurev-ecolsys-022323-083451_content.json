{"grounding": "Pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon of one gene or one mutation affecting multiple phenotypic traits. While the concept of pleiotropy is as old as Mendelian genetics, functional genomics has finally allowed the first glimpses of the extent of pleiotropy for a large fraction of genes in a genome. After describing conceptual and operational difficulties in quantifying pleiotropy and the pros and cons of various methods for measuring pleiotropy, I review empirical data on pleiotropy, which generally show an L-shaped distribution of the degree of pleiotropy (i.e., the number of traits affected), with most genes having low pleiotropy. I then review the current understanding of the molecular basis of pleiotropy. In the rest of the review, I discuss evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on advances in topics including the cost of complexity, regulatory versus coding evolution, environmental pleiotropy and adaptation, evolution of ageing and other seemingly harmful traits, and evolutionary resolution of pleiotropy.", "generated_text": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits, plays a pivotal role in shaping evolutionary trajectories and the genetic architecture of organisms. This study explores the patterns of pleiotropy and its evolutionary consequences, focusing on how it affects adaptation, the emergence of complex traits, and the prevalence of diseases. We delve into the concept of antagonistic pleiotropy, where a gene's effect on one trait is beneficial while being detrimental to another, and its implications for aging and disease susceptibility. Additionally, we examine the 'cost of complexity' hypothesis, which suggests that the evolution of complex organisms is constrained by the pleiotropic effects of mutations. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and theoretical models, we aim to elucidate the intricate balance between the beneficial and detrimental effects of pleiotropy on evolutionary fitness and health. Our findings underscore the importance of pleiotropy in understanding the genetic basis of adaptation and disease, offering insights into the evolutionary trade-offs that shape life.", "label": 1}
