{"grounding": "Parenting is considered a key evolutionary innovation that contributed to the diversification and expansion of vertebrates. However, we know little about how such diversity evolved. Amphibians are an ideal group in which to identify the ecological factors that have facilitated or constrained the evolution of different forms of parental care. Among, but also within, the three amphibian orders—Anura, Caudata, and Gymnophiona—there is a high level of variation in habitat use, fertilization mode, mating systems, and parental sex roles. Recent work using broad phylogenetic, experimental, and physiological approaches has helped to uncover the factors that have selected for the evolution of care and transitions between different forms of parenting. Here, we highlight the exceptional diversity of amphibian parental care, emphasize the unique opportunities this group offers for addressing key questions about the evolution of parenting, and give insights into promising novel directions of research.", "generated_text": "Amphibians exhibit a remarkable diversity in parental care strategies, offering unique insights into the evolution of caregiving behaviors across species. This study explores how fertilization mode, terrestriality, and the necessity for protection, transport, and nutrition influence the development of parental care in amphibians. By examining the interplay between these factors, we uncover the evolutionary pressures that shape parental sex roles and care strategies. Our findings suggest that the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments has significantly impacted the evolution of parental care, with terrestriality favoring the development of more complex care behaviors. Furthermore, the mode of fertilization—external or internal—plays a critical role in determining which parent assumes caregiving responsibilities. This research highlights the importance of amphibians as a model for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of parental care, shedding light on the adaptive significance of these behaviors in ensuring offspring survival and reproductive success.", "label": 1}
