{"grounding": "Sky islands are unique geologic formations, home to populations of organisms that have weathered climate change since the Pleistocene. Long-term isolation and climatic differences between sky islands and adjacent mountain chains result in natural laboratories well suited for examining the direct effects of climate change. Here, we review the global sky island literature to examine how taxa have responded to climate change. Results show lineage formation, reduced genetic variation, and trait evolution across taxa driven by genetic drift and natural selection. These effects continue today due to ongoing habitat reduction and steep selective gradients on sky islands relative to mountain chains. Comparative studies and experimental manipulations are needed to build broad inference into how past climate change has shaped the structure and function of whole ecosystems. The next era of sky island research is poised to create a model for climate change responses and eco-evolutionary dynamics, with profound conservation implications.", "generated_text": "Sky islands, isolated mountain habitats surrounded by radically different lowland environments, serve as natural laboratories for studying the ecological and evolutionary impacts of climate change. These unique ecosystems, characterized by their high levels of endemism and genetic variation, offer critical insights into the processes of convergent evolution and the persistence of relict populations under changing climatic conditions. By examining the adaptive responses of species within sky islands, researchers can predict broader ecological and evolutionary trends in the face of global warming. This study synthesizes findings from sky islands worldwide to highlight their role as predictive tools for understanding biodiversity dynamics. The findings underscore the importance of conserving these habitats not only for their intrinsic ecological value but also for their utility in forecasting the future of biodiversity in a rapidly changing world.", "label": 1}
