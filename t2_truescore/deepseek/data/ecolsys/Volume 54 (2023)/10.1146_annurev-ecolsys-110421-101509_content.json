{"grounding": "The origin of life entails a continuum from simple prebiotic chemistry to cells with genes and molecular machines. Using life as a guide to this continuum, we consider how selection could promote increased complexity before the emergence of genes. Structured, far-from-equilibrium environments such as hydrothermal systems drive the reaction between CO2 and H2 to form organics that self-organize into protocells. CO2 fixation within protocells generates a reaction network with a topology that prefigures the universal core of metabolism. Positive feedback loops amplify flux through this network, giving a metabolic heredity that promotes growth. Patterns in the genetic code show that genes and proteins arose through direct biophysical interactions between amino acids and nucleotides in this protometabolic network. Random genetic sequences template nonrandom peptides, producing selectable function in growing protocells. This context-dependent emergence of information gives rise seamlessly to an autotrophic last universal common ancestor.", "generated_text": "The quest to understand the origin of life is one of the most profound challenges in science, intertwining chemistry, biology, and geology. This study explores the hypothesis that life's emergence was guided by its own biochemical processes, focusing on key elements such as CO2 fixation, the formation of protocells, and the development of metabolism. Central to this investigation is the role of FeS clusters in catalyzing early metabolic reactions and the proton-motive force in energy transduction, which may have been pivotal in the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry. Additionally, the RNA world hypothesis and the emergence of the genetic code are examined as critical milestones in the evolution of life. By synthesizing recent findings, this research aims to shed light on how life's inherent properties could have directed its own origins, offering new insights into the fundamental principles that govern the transition from non-living to living matter.", "label": 1}
