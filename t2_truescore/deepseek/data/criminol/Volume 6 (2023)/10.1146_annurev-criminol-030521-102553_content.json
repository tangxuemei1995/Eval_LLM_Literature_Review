{"grounding": "As tens of thousands swarmed the US Capitol Grounds on January 6th, 2021, to oppose the election of Joe Biden as President, thousands among them assaulted officers and breached the building to stop the certification of the election results, leading to nine deaths and hundreds of injuries. Despite being an act of terrorism and evidence that far-right extremists planned to take over the government, some dismiss January 6th as legitimate political discourse. This divisive response starkly contrasts with the unifying response to the jihadi attacks on September 11th two decades earlier, raising the question as to why the country has not also united against far-right extremism. This review argues that the Bush administration misused deterrence in response to the September 11th attacks. While unifying the country, it also disproportionately punished innocent Muslims and legitimized anti-Muslim ideals, giving rise to anti-Muslim hate crimes and backlash by jihadi extremists and emboldening violence from far-right extremists. This review combines research on deterrence, counterterrorism, anti-Muslim ideals, and far-right organizations with data on terrorism and hate crimes within the United States to delineate this argument and assess its alignment with the empirical progression of violence between September 11th and January 6th.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolution of terrorism within the United States from the September 11th attacks to the January 6th Capitol riot, focusing on the dynamics of far-right and jihadi extremism. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of incidents, ideologies, and responses, the research highlights the shifting landscape of domestic terrorism. The September 11th attacks marked a pivotal moment in U.S. history, catalyzing a global war on terror primarily aimed at jihadi extremism. However, the subsequent years have witnessed a significant rise in far-right extremism, culminating in the January 6th insurrection. This paper explores the ideological underpinnings, recruitment strategies, and operational tactics of both far-right and jihadi groups, drawing parallels and distinctions in their approaches to violence and hate crimes. Furthermore, it assesses the effectiveness of counter-terrorism measures and the challenges posed by the evolving nature of these threats. The findings underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of domestic terrorism, emphasizing the importance of addressing both far-right and jihadi extremism to safeguard national security and uphold democratic values.", "label": 1}
