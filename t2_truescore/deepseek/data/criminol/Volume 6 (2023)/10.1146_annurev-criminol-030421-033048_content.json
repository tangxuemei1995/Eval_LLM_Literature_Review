{"grounding": "Ethnographic studies of immigration and crime were prominent in the early decades of the twentieth century, yet contemporary scholarship has been dominated by quantitative approaches. In this review, we heed the call of those who have lamented the “collective amnesia” and “newness fetish” that characterize much of contemporary criminology and revisit classic ethnographies of immigration and crime, with an emphasis on the unique methodological contributions of this early work. Next, we synthesize the small but growing body of contemporary ethnographic research on immigration and crime, which includes the policing of immigrant communities in the age of “crimmigration;” the lived experiences inside contemporary deportation/detention regimes; the integration experiences of Muslims, a highly marginalized but understudied population; and immigrants’ unique vulnerabilities to and experiences of victimization, to illustrate the value of qualitative approaches for capturing the nuances of immigrants’ experiences in the new age of immigration.", "generated_text": "This study seeks to revitalize ethnographic approaches to understanding the complex relationship between immigration and crime, drawing on the rich tradition of the Chicago School of sociology. By employing qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews and participant observation, the research focuses on the lived experiences of new immigrants in urban settings. The aim is to challenge prevailing stereotypes and simplistic narratives by providing nuanced insights into how immigrants navigate the challenges of integration, social exclusion, and legal systems. Through ethnographies of migration, this work highlights the diversity of immigrant experiences and the socio-economic factors that influence crime rates among immigrant communities. The findings underscore the importance of context and the need for policies that address the root causes of crime, rather than scapegoating immigrants. This research contributes to a more informed and empathetic understanding of the immigrant experience in contemporary society.", "label": 0}
