{"grounding": "Recent years have seen increasing interest in, and scholarly discussion of, historical criminology. Yet there remains at present no clear, settled view as to what historical criminology entails, how it is best pursued, and what its future might hold. This article explores the several conceptions of historical criminology found in the present literature, which associate it variously with archival research, practical inquiry, a concern with temporality, and a certain approach to interdisciplinary scholarship. Adopting the view that historical criminology entails a special regard for historical time, the review goes on to assess its significance to the wider field, examining its connection with some of the core impulses of criminology at large. Finally, it suggests some major opportunities for historical criminology to contribute to the future development of criminology, including through an inclusive global criminology, a criminology of events, and research on crime and justice futures.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the evolving field of historical criminology, emphasizing its scope, significance, and potential future directions. Historical criminology, by integrating insights from criminal justice history and historical time, offers a unique lens through which to understand the complexities of crime and justice across different periods. The interdisciplinary nature of this field, drawing from history, sociology, law, and criminology, enriches our comprehension of the socio-political and cultural contexts that shape criminal behavior and justice responses. This study highlights the importance of historical criminology in uncovering patterns and continuities in crime and punishment, thereby informing contemporary criminal justice policies and practices. Furthermore, it discusses the challenges and opportunities for future research, advocating for a more nuanced and inclusive approach that considers diverse historical narratives and perspectives. By renewing interest in historical criminology, this paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical dimensions of crime and justice, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration.", "label": 1}
