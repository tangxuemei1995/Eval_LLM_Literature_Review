{"grounding": "As with past pandemics of influenza, COVID-19 tore through US prisons and jails; however, the COVID-19 pandemic, uniquely, has led to more health research on carceral systems than has been seen to date. Herein, we review the data on its impact on incarcerated people, correctional officers, health systems, and surrounding communities. We searched medical, sociological, and criminology databases from March 2020 through February 2022 for studies examining the intersection of COVID-19, prisons and jails, and health outcomes, including COVID-19 incidence, prevalence, hospitalizations, and vaccination. Our scoping review identified 77 studiesâ€”the bulk of which focus on disease epidemiology in carceral systems, with a small minority that focuses on the efficacy or effectiveness of prevention and mitigation efforts, including testing, vaccination, and efforts to depopulate correctional facilities. We highlight areas for future research, including the experiences of incarcerated people and correctional staff, unanticipated health effects of prolonged quarantine, excess deaths due to delays in healthcare, and experimental studies on vaccine uptake and testing in correctional staff. These studies will enable a fuller understanding of COVID-19 and help stem future pandemics.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to carceral systems worldwide, including prisons and jails, which are characterized by overcrowding and limited healthcare resources. This review synthesizes current literature on the incidence, mitigation strategies, and vaccination efforts within these settings. Studies indicate that the incidence of COVID-19 in carceral facilities is significantly higher than in the general population, attributed to close living quarters and difficulties in implementing social distancing measures. Mitigation strategies, such as cohorting, testing, and the use of personal protective equipment, have been employed with varying degrees of success. However, the effectiveness of these measures is often hindered by logistical and infrastructural limitations. Vaccination campaigns have been initiated in many jurisdictions, yet vaccine uptake among incarcerated populations and staff remains a challenge due to vaccine hesitancy and access issues. This review highlights the critical need for targeted public health interventions to control COVID-19 transmission in carceral systems, emphasizing the importance of equitable vaccine distribution and the implementation of comprehensive mitigation strategies to protect this vulnerable population.", "label": 1}
