{"grounding": "The number of cross-national homicide studies is increasing rapidly. Many scholars, however, do not consider the details of how individual nations and the four main centralized homicide data sources—raw estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database, adjusted estimates from the WHO Global Health Observatory, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and World Bank World Development Indicators—generate national homicide rates and the impact this may have on results and the scientific record. We tested whether homicide trends, levels, and structural covariates are dependent on data source. We used 1990–2018 data in 5-year groupings and pooled them over time and nation. We utilized exploratory data analysis techniques to look for differences in homicide rates and trends. Then we employed seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to determine whether associations with homicide of typical structural covariates were dependent on homicide data source. Finally, we examined Wald Tests to determine whether differences in the sizes of the SUR coefficients from each data source were significantly different from zero. We found differences in homicide trends and rates by data source and that associations with homicide rates of structural covariates varied in significance, magnitude, and even direction depending on homicide data source. Cross-national homicideresearch has a promising future for understanding short- and long-term global and regional trends and population-level covariates and constructing theoretical explanations for geographical and temporal variation. However, researchers must better understand how national homicide data are generated by nations and these four data sources. All four systems possess limitations, but homicide data from the WHO Mortality Database present the most attractive option.", "generated_text": "This paper presents a comprehensive review and analysis of the impact of homicide measurement on cross-national research. Homicide rates are frequently used as a key indicator of societal violence and are central to comparative studies across countries. However, the methodologies for measuring homicide vary significantly between nations, leading to potential discrepancies in data quality and comparability. This study systematically examines the different approaches to homicide measurement, including police records, vital statistics, and surveys, and assesses their implications for cross-national research. Through a detailed literature review and analysis of existing datasets, we identify the main challenges in homicide measurement, such as underreporting, differences in legal definitions, and variations in data collection practices. The paper also explores the consequences of these measurement issues for the validity and reliability of cross-national studies, particularly in the context of criminological and sociological research. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions and best practices for improving the accuracy and consistency of homicide data across countries. The findings highlight the need for standardized measurement protocols and enhanced international cooperation to ensure more reliable and comparable homicide statistics. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on methodological challenges in cross-national research and provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners aiming to understand and address global patterns of violence.", "label": 0}
