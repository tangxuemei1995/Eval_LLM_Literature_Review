{"grounding": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a bioactive phytochemical abundant in cruciferous vegetables. One of its main in vivo metabolites is 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM), formed by the condensation of two molecules of I3C. Both I3C and DIM alter multiple signaling pathways and related molecules controlling diverse cellular events, including oxidation, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity. There is a growing body of evidence from both in vitro and in vivo models that these compounds possess strong potential to prevent several forms of chronic disease such as inflammation, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, neurodegenerative diseases, and osteoporosis. This article reviews current knowledge of the occurrence of I3C in nature and foods, along with the beneficial effects of I3C and DIM concerning prevention and treatment of human chronic diseases, focusing on preclinical studies and their mechanisms of action at cellular and molecular levels.", "generated_text": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a naturally occurring compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has garnered significant attention for its health-beneficial properties. This review explores the occurrence of I3C and its derivative, 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM), in dietary sources, highlighting their roles in promoting human health. The health benefits of I3C and DIM are vast, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, which are mediated through various cellular and molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms involve modulation of phase I and II detoxification enzymes, regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, and interference with signaling pathways such as NF-κB and PI3K/AKT. Furthermore, I3C and DIM have been shown to influence estrogen metabolism, offering protective effects against hormone-dependent cancers. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of I3C and DIM as therapeutic agents, emphasizing the need for further research to fully elucidate their mechanisms of action and to explore their clinical applications.", "label": 1}
