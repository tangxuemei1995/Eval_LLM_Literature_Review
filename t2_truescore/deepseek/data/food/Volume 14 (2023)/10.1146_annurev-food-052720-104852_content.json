{"grounding": "In contrast to traditional breeding, which relies on the identification of mutants, metabolic engineering provides a new platform to modify the oil composition in oil crops for improved nutrition. By altering endogenous genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways, it is possible to modify edible plant oils to increase the content of desired components or reduce the content of undesirable components. However, introduction of novel nutritional components such as omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids needs transgenic expression of novel genes in crops. Despite formidable challenges, significant progress in engineering nutritionally improved edible plant oils has recently been achieved, with some commercial products now on the market.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of metabolic engineering and gene editing techniques to enhance the nutritional profile of edible plant oils. By targeting specific pathways, we aim to increase the content of beneficial compounds such as high oleic acid, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E in seed oils. The research focuses on identifying key genes involved in the biosynthesis of these nutrients and employing advanced biotechnological tools to modify their expression. The outcomes of this study could lead to the development of nutritionally superior plant oils, offering significant health benefits and addressing dietary deficiencies in populations worldwide.", "label": 0}
