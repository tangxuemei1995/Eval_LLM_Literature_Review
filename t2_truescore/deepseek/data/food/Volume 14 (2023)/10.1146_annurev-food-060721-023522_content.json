{"grounding": "Food proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols are natural ingredients with different functional attributes. For instance, many proteins are good emulsifiers and gelling agents, many polysaccharides are good thickening and stabilizing agents, and many polyphenols are good antioxidants and antimicrobials. These three kinds of ingredients can be combined into protein, polysaccharide, and/or polyphenol conjugates or complexes using covalent or noncovalent interactions to create novel multifunctional colloidal ingredients with new or improved properties. In this review, the formation, functionality, and potential applications of protein conjugates and complexes are discussed. In particular, the utilization of these colloidal ingredients to stabilize emulsions, control lipid digestion, encapsulate bioactive ingredients, modify textures, and form films is highlighted. Finally, future research needs in this area are briefly proposed. The rational design of protein complexes and conjugates may lead to the development of new functional ingredients that can be used to create more nutritious, sustainable, and healthy foods.", "generated_text": "The exploration of novel colloidal food ingredients has led to significant advancements in the development of protein complexes and conjugates, which are pivotal in enhancing the nutritional and functional properties of food products. This research delves into the intricate interactions between proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols, focusing on the formation of complexes and conjugates that exhibit improved solubility, stability, and bioactivity. Through a comprehensive review of recent studies, we highlight the mechanisms underlying the formation of these colloidal structures, including covalent and non-covalent interactions. The potential applications of these novel ingredients in food systems are vast, ranging from texture modification and emulsification to the encapsulation of bioactive compounds. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of understanding the structure-function relationship of protein complexes and conjugates to optimize their performance in food applications. The findings presented herein contribute to the growing body of knowledge on colloidal food ingredients, paving the way for innovative solutions in food science and technology.", "label": 1}
