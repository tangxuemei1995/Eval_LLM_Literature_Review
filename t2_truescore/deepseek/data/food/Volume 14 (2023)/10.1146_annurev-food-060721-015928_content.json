{"grounding": "Bacteriophages (or phages) represent one of the most persistent threats to food fermentations, particularly large-scale commercial dairy fermentations. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are used as starter cultures in dairy fermentations are well studied, and in recent years there have been significant advances in defining the driving forces of LAB–phage coevolution. The means by which different starter bacterial species defend themselves against phage predation and the chromosomal or plasmid location of the genes encoding these defense mechanisms have dictated the technological approaches for the development of robust starter cultures. In this review, we highlight recent advances in defining phage–host interactions and how phage resistance occurs in different bacterial species. Furthermore, we discuss how these insights continue to transform the dairy fermentation industry and how they also are anticipated to guide food fermentations involving plant-based alternatives in the future.", "generated_text": "The dairy industry has long faced challenges with bacteriophage infections, which can disrupt food fermentations and lead to significant economic losses. This review explores the complex phage–host interactions that occur within dairy fermentation processes, highlighting the mechanisms by which bacteriophages infect bacterial starter cultures. We delve into the latest strategies for developing phage resistance in dairy cultures, including genetic modifications and the use of phage-resistant strains. Additionally, the role of conjugation in spreading resistance genes among bacterial populations is examined, offering insights into how this natural process can be harnessed to combat phage infections. By synthesizing current research, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing battle against bacteriophages in the dairy industry, suggesting that while significant progress has been made, the problem is far from solved. The potential for future innovations in phage control and resistance mechanisms is also discussed, pointing towards a more resilient dairy fermentation process.", "label": 1}
