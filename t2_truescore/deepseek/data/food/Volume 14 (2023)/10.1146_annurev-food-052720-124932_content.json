{"grounding": "Meats are rich in lipids and proteins, exposing them to rapid oxidative changes. Proteins are essential to the human diet, and changes in the structure and functional attributes can greatly influence the quality and nutritional value of meats. In this article, we review the molecular changes of proteins during processing, their impact on the nutritional value of fresh and processed meat, the digestibility and bioavailability of meat proteins, the risks associated with high meat intake, and the preventive strategies employed to mitigate these risks. This information provides new research directions to reduce or prevent oxidative processes that influence the quality and nutritional values of meat.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the molecular alterations in meat proteins during various processing techniques and their consequential effects on quality and nutritional values. Through comprehensive analysis, we explore how processing methods such as heating, curing, and fermentation induce structural changes in proteins, affecting their digestibility, bioavailability, and potential health risks. The research highlights the balance between enhancing meat's sensory attributes and preserving its nutritional integrity, emphasizing the importance of optimizing processing conditions to minimize adverse health impacts. Our findings aim to contribute to the development of healthier meat products by understanding the molecular basis of protein changes and their implications for human nutrition and health.", "label": 1}
