{"grounding": "Despite the almost universal acceptance of the phrase “you are what you eat,” investment in understanding diet-based nutrition to address human health has been dwarfed compared to that for medicine-based interventions. Moreover, traditional breeding has focused on yield to the detriment of nutritional quality, meaning that although caloric content has remained high, the incidence of nutritional deficiencies and accompanying diseases (so-called hidden hunger) has risen dramatically. We review how genome sequencing coupled with metabolomics can facilitate the screening of genebank collections in the search for superior alleles related to the nutritional quality of crops. We argue that the first examples are very promising, suggesting that this approach could benefit broader ranges of crops and compounds with known relevance for human health. We argue that this represents anapproach complementary to metabolic engineering by transgenesis or gene editing that could be used to reverse some of the losses incurred through a recent focus on breeding for yield, although we caution that ensuring such approaches are not (re)introducing antinutrients is also necessary.", "generated_text": "The exploration of metabolic signatures within Genebank collections presents a novel frontier in the intersection of plant metabolomics and human health. This study delves into the untapped potential of natural variance in phytonutrient profiles across diverse plant species, preserved in Genebanks, to uncover novel nutritional compounds beneficial for human health. By leveraging advanced metabolomic technologies, we aim to systematically analyze and catalog the metabolic diversity inherent in these collections, identifying key phytonutrients with potential health-promoting properties. The research underscores the importance of integrating plant metabolomics with nutritional science to harness the therapeutic and preventive capabilities of plant-based compounds. Through this approach, we propose a framework for utilizing Genebank collections as a resource for discovering bioactive compounds that could contribute to dietary interventions and the development of functional foods. This study highlights the critical role of natural variance in plant metabolomics as a foundation for advancing our understanding of the complex relationships between diet, nutrition, and human health.", "label": 1}
