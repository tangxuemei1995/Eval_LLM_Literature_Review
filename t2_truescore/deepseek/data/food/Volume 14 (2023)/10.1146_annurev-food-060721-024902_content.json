{"grounding": "Ferritins represent a class of iron storage proteins with detoxification functions. The importance of these proteins is reflected by their wide distribution throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. Ferritin has two forms: holo and apo. Holo ferritin can act as an efficient and safe factor for iron supplementation, whereas apo ferritin is able to serve as a promising delivery nanovehicle for nutrients and bioactive compounds. So far, the dual functions of ferritins from animal and plant sources have been extensively studied in several fields, such as food, nutrition, medicine, and materials. This review outlines the structure of animal and plant ferritin, the iron supplementation function of holo ferritin, and the delivery function of apo ferritin. Recent advances in iron supplementation and nutrient encapsulation and delivery are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future developments for multifunctional applications of ferritins are discussed.", "generated_text": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous iron-storage protein, exhibits a dual functionality contingent upon its form: holo ferritin for iron supplementation and apo ferritin as a delivery system. This study elucidates the mechanisms underlying these roles, highlighting the structural adaptability of ferritin that enables it to sequester and release iron in a controlled manner. Holo ferritin, loaded with iron, serves as an efficient vehicle for iron supplementation, addressing iron deficiency with minimal side effects. Conversely, apo ferritin, devoid of iron, emerges as a promising nanocarrier for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, owing to its biocompatibility, stability, and ability to encapsulate diverse molecules. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements, this research underscores the potential of ferritin in both nutritional and pharmaceutical applications, paving the way for innovative strategies in iron supplementation and drug delivery systems.", "label": 1}
