{"grounding": "Edible nanoparticles are being developed for the oral delivery of nutrients to improve human health and well-being. Because of the extremely demanding conditions foods experience within the gastrointestinal tract, fundamental knowledge about the biological fate of encapsulated nutrients must be constantly revised. In this review, we first provide an overview of the fundamental absorption pathways of ingested foods and then discuss the evaluation models available to test and predict the biological fate of nutrient-loaded nanoparticles. Then, owing to their importance for human health, the impacts of nanoparticles on the gut microbiota are evaluated. Lastly, the limitations of current evaluation methods are highlighted and future research directions on the study and application of edible nanoparticles for the oral delivery of bioactive food compounds are discussed.", "generated_text": "This comprehensive review delves into the utilization of nanoparticles for oral delivery within the food sector, focusing on their biological fate, the evaluation models employed to assess their efficacy and safety, and the influences they exert on gut microbiota. As food nanotechnology advances, understanding the journey of nanoparticles through the digestive system becomes paramount. This paper synthesizes current knowledge on how nanoparticles interact with biological systems, the methodologies used to evaluate these interactions, and the impact on the complex ecosystem of the gut microbiota. By examining the latest research, this review aims to provide insights into optimizing nanoparticle design for oral delivery in food, ensuring both functionality and safety, while also considering the broader implications for human health and the microbiome.", "label": 1}
