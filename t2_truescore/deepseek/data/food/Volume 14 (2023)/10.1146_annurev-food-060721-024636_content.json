{"grounding": "Microgreens are edible young plants that have recently attracted interest because of their color and flavor diversity, phytonutrient abundance, short growth cycle, and minimal space and nutrient requirements. They can be cultivated in a variety of systems from simple home gardens to sophisticated vertical farms with automated irrigation, fertilizer delivery, and lighting controls. Microgreens have also attracted attention from space agencies hoping that their sensory qualities can contribute to the diet of astronauts in microgravity and their cultivation might help maintain crew physical and psychological health on long-duration spaceflight missions. However, many technical challenges and data gaps for growing microgreensboth on and off Earth remain unaddressed. This review summarizes recent studies on multiple aspects of microgreens, including nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, cultivation systems, operative conditions, innovative treatments, autonomous facilities, and potential space applications. It also provides the authorsâ€™ perspectives on the challenges to stimulating more extensive interdisciplinary research.", "generated_text": "Microgreens, the young seedlings of vegetables and herbs, have garnered significant attention for their dense nutritional profile and potential contributions to food security. This comprehensive update delves into the most recent developments in microgreen production systems, highlighting innovative approaches for both home and commercial farming. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in microgreen cultivation is explored, showcasing how smart technologies can optimize growth conditions, enhance yield, and reduce resource consumption. Furthermore, the paper examines the burgeoning field of space farming, where microgreens are considered a viable option for providing fresh produce in extraterrestrial environments. By analyzing current research and technological advancements, this study aims to provide insights into the sustainable production of microgreens, addressing the challenges of modern agriculture and the potential for microgreens to play a pivotal role in future food systems on Earth and beyond.", "label": 1}
