{"grounding": "Lipids are a large group of essential nutrients in daily diets that provide energy and maintain various physiological functions. As the global population is rapidly expanding, there is an urgent need to enhance the production and quality of food lipids. The development of modern biotechnology allows the manipulation of oil production in plants and microorganisms and the improvement of the nutritional value of food lipids. Various metabolic engineering strategies have been exploited to increase oil production and produce value-added oils in traditional oil crops and other novel lipid sources (e.g., plant vegetative tissues, microalgae, and oleaginous microorganisms). Furthermore, natural lipid structures can be modified by lipases to prepare functional lipids, e.g., diacylglycerols, medium–long–medium-type structured triacylglycerols, human milk-fat substitutes, and structuralphospholipids, for specific nutritional demands. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in metabolic engineering of lipid production in plants and microorganisms, and the preparation of functional lipids via biocatalysis.", "generated_text": "The exploration of biotechnology in the realm of future food lipids presents a transformative avenue for enhancing nutritional profiles and sustainability in food production. This study delves into the innovative applications of microbial lipids, metabolic engineering, and enzymatic modification in the development of structural lipids and phospholipids. Microbial lipids, derived from oleaginous microorganisms, offer a renewable and scalable source of essential fatty acids, circumventing the environmental and ethical concerns associated with traditional lipid sources. Metabolic engineering emerges as a pivotal tool, enabling the precise manipulation of lipid biosynthetic pathways to optimize yield and functionality. Furthermore, enzymatic modification techniques are scrutinized for their potential to tailor lipid structures, enhancing their nutritional value and stability. Despite the promising opportunities, this research also addresses the challenges inherent in scaling up biotechnological processes, regulatory hurdles, and consumer acceptance. The findings underscore the critical role of biotechnology in shaping the future of food lipids, balancing innovation with sustainability and safety.", "label": 1}
