{"grounding": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides are of particular interest in recent years because of their unique prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. Among different types of strategies for the production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, enzymatic methods are preferred owing to the predictability and controllability of the structure and composition of the reaction products. Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have been proved to show excellent prebiotic effects as well as other benefits to intestinal health. They have exhibited great application potential as functional food ingredients for various food products with improved quality and physicochemical characteristics. This article reviews the research progress on the enzymatic production of several typical nondigestible functional oligosaccharides in the food industry, including galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, chito-oligosaccharides, and human milk oligosaccharides. Moreover, their physicochemical properties and prebiotic activities are discussed as well as their contributions to intestinal health and applications in foods.", "generated_text": "Functional oligosaccharides, recognized for their prebiotic effects, play a pivotal role in promoting intestinal health through the modulation of gut microbiota. This review focuses on the enzymatic production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, highlighting the advancements in biotechnological methods that enhance their yield and purity. The enzymatic approach offers a sustainable and efficient pathway for synthesizing these oligosaccharides, which are otherwise challenging to extract from natural sources. Furthermore, the paper explores the diverse food applications of these oligosaccharides, emphasizing their incorporation into dietary products to confer health benefits. The prebiotic effects of functional oligosaccharides, including the stimulation of beneficial gut bacteria and the inhibition of pathogenic species, are discussed in the context of improving intestinal health. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of enzymatic production in meeting the growing demand for functional oligosaccharides in the food industry, paving the way for innovative dietary solutions aimed at enhancing gut health.", "label": 1}
