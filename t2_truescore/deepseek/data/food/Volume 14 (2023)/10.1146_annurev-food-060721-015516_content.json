{"grounding": "Inadequate dietary fiber consumption has become common across industrialized nations, accompanied by changes in gut microbial composition and a dramatic increase in chronic metabolic diseases. The human gut microbiome harbors genes that are required for the digestion of fiber, resulting in the production of end products that mediate gastrointestinal and systemic benefits to the host. Thus, the use of fiber interventions has attracted increasing interest as a strategy to modulate the gut microbiome and improve human health. However, considerable interindividual differences in gut microbial composition have resulted in variable responses toward fiber interventions. This variability has led to observed nonresponder individuals and highlights the need for personalized approaches to effectively redirect the gut ecosystem. In this review, we summarize strategies used to address the responder and nonresponder phenomenon in dietary fiber interventions and propose a targeted approach to identify predictive features based on knowledge of fiber metabolism and machine learning approaches.", "generated_text": "The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in human health, with dietary fiber serving as a key modulator of its composition and function. This study explores the potential of predicting personalized responses to dietary fiber interventions, focusing on the opportunities for modulating the gut microbiome to enhance health outcomes. By leveraging the concept of precision nutrition, we investigate the interplay between dietary fibers, the gut microbiome, and host metabolism, with a particular emphasis on the role of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in fiber degradation. Our findings suggest that individual variations in the gut microbiome's capacity to ferment dietary fibers can significantly influence the efficacy of prebiotic interventions. This research underscores the importance of a personalized approach to dietary recommendations, aiming to optimize gut microbiome modulation for improved health and disease prevention. The insights gained pave the way for the development of targeted dietary strategies that harness the therapeutic potential of the gut microbiome.", "label": 1}
