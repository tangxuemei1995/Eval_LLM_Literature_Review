{"grounding": "With the rising problems of food shortages, energy costs, and raw materials, the food industry must reduce its environmental impact. We present an overview of more resource-efficient processes to produce food ingredients, describing their environmental impact and the functional properties obtained. Extensive wet processing yields high purities but also has the highest environmental impact, mainly due to heating for protein precipitation and dehydration. Milder wet alternatives exclude, for example, low pHâ€“driven separation and are based on salt precipitation or water only. Drying steps are omitted during dry fractionation using air classification or electrostatic separation. Benefits of milder methods are enhanced functional properties. Therefore, fractionation and formulation should be focused on the desired functionality instead of purity. Environmental impact is also strongly reduced by milder refining. Antinutritional factors and off-flavors remain challenges in more mildly produced ingredients. The benefits of less refining motivate the increasing trend toward mildly refined ingredients.", "generated_text": "The quest for sustainable food production has led to the exploration of mild fractionation techniques as a means to enhance the efficiency of resource use in the food industry. This study focuses on the application of dry fractionation and mild wet separation methods for the extraction and purification of plant proteins, aiming to preserve their native functionality while minimizing environmental impact. By comparing these gentle processing techniques with conventional methods, we highlight their potential to reduce energy consumption and water usage, thereby contributing to a more sustainable food system. The findings suggest that mild fractionation not only retains the nutritional and functional properties of plant proteins but also offers a pathway towards more resource-efficient food ingredient production. This research underscores the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies to meet the growing demand for sustainable food ingredients without compromising on quality or functionality.", "label": 1}
