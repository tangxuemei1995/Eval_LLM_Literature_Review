{"grounding": "It is important to have larger proportions of health-beneficial polyunsaturated lipids in foods, but these nutrients are particularly sensitive to oxidation, and dedicated strategies must be developed to prevent this deleterious reaction. In food oil-in-water emulsions, the oil–water interface is a crucial area when it comes to the initiation of lipid oxidation. Unfortunately, most available natural antioxidants, such as phenolic antioxidants, do not spontaneously position at this specific locus. Achieving such a strategic positioning has therefore been an active research area, and various routes have been proposed: lipophilizing phenolic acids to confer them with an amphiphilic character; functionalizing biopolymer emulsifiers through covalent or noncovalent interactions with phenolics; or loading Pickering particles with natural phenolic compounds to yield interfacial antioxidant reservoirs. We herein review the principles and efficiency of these approaches to counteract lipid oxidation in emulsions as well as their advantages and limitations.", "generated_text": "This study explores innovative strategies to enhance the efficacy of phenolic antioxidants in emulsions by targeting their interfacial location. Lipid oxidation, a major cause of food spoilage, is significantly influenced by the distribution of antioxidants within the emulsion matrix. Phenolic antioxidants, known for their potent radical scavenging activity, are more effective when positioned at the oil–water interface, where oxidation primarily occurs. The research delves into the design of phenolipids, amphiphilic derivatives of phenolic compounds, which spontaneously migrate to the interface, thereby optimizing their antioxidant potential. Furthermore, the concept of antioxidant reservoirs is introduced, proposing a controlled release mechanism to maintain antioxidant activity over time. The findings highlight the benefits of interfacial targeting, including improved oxidative stability of emulsions and extended shelf-life of food products. This approach offers a promising avenue for the development of more effective antioxidant delivery systems in the food industry.", "label": 1}
