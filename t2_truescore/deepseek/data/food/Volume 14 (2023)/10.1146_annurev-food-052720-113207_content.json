{"grounding": "Microbubbles are largely unused in the food industry yet have promising capabilities as environmentally friendly cleaning and supporting agents within products and production lines due to their unique physical behaviors. Their small diameters increase their dispersion throughout liquid materials, promote reactivity because of their high specific surface area, enhance dissolution of gases into the surrounding liquid phase, and promote the generation of reactive chemical species. This article reviews techniques to generate microbubbles, their modes of action to enhance cleaning and disinfection, their contributions to functional and mechanical properties of food materials, and their use in supporting the growth of living organisms in hydroponics or bioreactors. The utility and diverse applications of microbubbles, combined with their low intrinsic ingredient cost, strongly encourage their increased adoption within the food industry in coming years.", "generated_text": "Microbubbles, characterized by their minute size and high surface area to volume ratio, are emerging as a transformative technology in the food industry. This review explores the application of microbubbles in enhancing food safety, security, and sustainability, alongside their role in the development of novel foods. By leveraging the unique properties of microbubbles, such as their ability to improve mass transfer and microbial inactivation, this technology offers innovative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in food technology. The integration of microbubbles into food processing and preservation techniques not only promises to extend shelf life and reduce food waste but also contributes to the creation of healthier and more sustainable food products. This paper highlights the potential of microbubbles to revolutionize food technology, paving the way for a more secure and sustainable food future.", "label": 1}
