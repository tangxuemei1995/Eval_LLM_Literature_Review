{"grounding": "The in vitro digestion model developed by the INFOGEST international consortium is widely used to simulate the physicochemical processes occurring inside the human gastrointestinal tract (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) during the digestion of foods. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the INFOGEST method and the procedures used to measure the digestion of macronutrients (lipids, proteins, and starch), the bioaccessibility of bioactive agents (vitamins, minerals, and nutraceuticals), and the changes in the structure and physical properties of foods under gastrointestinal conditions (particle size, charge, and location). We then review the application of the INFOGEST method for monitoring the gastrointestinal fate of different kinds of foods and beverages, including dairy, egg, meat, seafood, fruit, vegetable, cereal, and emulsified products. We also discuss the application of this method for studying the digestibility of next-generation plant-based foods, such as meat, seafood, dairy, and egg analogs. Finally, the benefits and limitations of this standardized in vitro digestion model are assessed.", "generated_text": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has emerged as a pivotal tool in the study of food digestion, offering a standardized method to simulate the complex processes occurring in the human gastrointestinal tract. This review explores the applications of the INFOGEST model across various food types, emphasizing its role in assessing the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of nutrients and bioactive compounds. By mimicking the physiological conditions of digestion, the model provides valuable insights into the release and transformation of food components, facilitating the development of functional foods with enhanced nutritional profiles. The review highlights the model's contribution to understanding the impact of food matrix and processing on digestion outcomes, underscoring its importance in food science and nutrition research. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent studies, this paper underscores the INFOGEST model's utility in advancing our knowledge of food digestion and its implications for health and disease prevention.", "label": 1}
