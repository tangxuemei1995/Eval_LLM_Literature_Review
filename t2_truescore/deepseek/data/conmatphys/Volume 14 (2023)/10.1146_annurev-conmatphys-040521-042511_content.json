{"grounding": "Inversion and time reversal are essential symmetries for the structure of Cooper pairs in superconductors. The loss of one or both leads to modifications to this structure and can change the properties of the superconducting phases in profound ways. Superconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry, or noncentrosymmetric materials, has become an important topic. These materials show unusual magnetic and magnetoelectric properties and can host topological superconductivity. Recently, crystal structures with local, but not global, inversion-symmetry breaking have attracted attention. Here, superconductivity can exhibit phenomena not naively expected in centrosymmetric materials. In this review, we first introduce the concept of locally noncentrosymmetric crystals and different material realizations. We then discuss consequences of such local symmetry breaking on the normal state electronic structure and the classification of superconducting order parameters. Finally, we review the expected and, in parts, already observed phenomenology of unconventional superconductivity and possible topological superconducting phases.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between superconductivity and local inversion-symmetry breaking, with a focus on the emergence of topological and unconventional superconductivity. By examining the role of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and hidden spin polarization, we uncover novel mechanisms that drive the superconducting state in materials lacking global inversion symmetry. Our analysis reveals that local inversion-symmetry breaking can significantly enhance the superconducting transition temperature and induce exotic pairing symmetries, which are pivotal for the realization of topological superconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and hidden spin polarization leads to unique electronic properties, such as spin-momentum locking and protected surface states, which are essential for the development of spintronic devices. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles governing superconductivity in inversion-asymmetric systems, offering new insights for the design of advanced quantum materials.", "label": 0}
