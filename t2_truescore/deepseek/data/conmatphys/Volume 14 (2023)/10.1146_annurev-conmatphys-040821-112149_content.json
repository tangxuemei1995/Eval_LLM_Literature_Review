{"grounding": "We review the literature on swimming in complex fluids. A classification is proposed by comparing the length- and timescales of a swimmer with those of nearby obstacles, interpreted broadly, extending from rigid or soft confining boundaries to molecules that confer the bulk fluid with complex stresses. A third dimension in the classification is the concentration of swimmers, which incorporates fluids whose complexity arises purely by the collective motion of swimming organisms. For each of the eight system types that we identify, we provide a background and describe modern research findings. Although some types have seen a great deal of attention for decades, others remain uncharted waters still open and awaiting exploration.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamics of swimming in complex fluids, focusing on the interplay between locomotion and the unique properties of soft and active matter. By examining the behavior of microswimmers in biological fluids and active suspensions, we aim to uncover the fundamental principles governing movement in environments characterized by non-Newtonian fluid dynamics. Our research integrates theoretical models with experimental observations to analyze how the viscoelasticity and activity of the surrounding medium influence propulsion efficiency and swimming strategies. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of biological locomotion and have potential applications in the design of synthetic microswimmers for targeted drug delivery and other biomedical applications.", "label": 0}
