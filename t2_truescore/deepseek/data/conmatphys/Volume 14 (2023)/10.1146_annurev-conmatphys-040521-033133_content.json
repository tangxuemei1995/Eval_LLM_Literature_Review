{"grounding": "The past decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in topological materials, and a lot of mathematical concepts have been introduced in condensed matter physics. Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central topic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on boundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex. Besides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon called the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition. In this article, we review developments in non-Hermitian topological physics by focusing mainly on the boundary problem. As well as the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena, we discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself.", "generated_text": "Non-Hermitian topological phenomena have emerged as a vibrant field of research, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian physics and topological phase transitions. This review delves into the intricate interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and topological properties, highlighting the unique aspects that distinguish them from their Hermitian counterparts. We explore the fundamental principles underlying non-Hermitian topological phases, including the modification of bulk-boundary correspondence and the implications for spectral theory. The discussion encompasses recent advancements in understanding the robustness of topological states in the presence of non-Hermiticity, as well as the novel phenomena arising from exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects. By synthesizing key theoretical insights and experimental observations, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in non-Hermitian topological phenomena, paving the way for future explorations in this rapidly evolving domain.", "label": 1}
