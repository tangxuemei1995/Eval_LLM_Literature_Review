{"grounding": "Active colloids are self-propelled particles moving in viscous fluids by consuming fuel from their surroundings. Here, we review the numerical and theoretical modeling of active colloids propelled by self-generated near-surface flows. We start with the generic model of an active Brownian particle taking into account potential forces and effective pairwise interaction, which include hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. Also, the squirmer as a model microswimmer is introduced. We then discuss the explicit modeling of self-generated fluid flow and the full hydrodynamic-chemical coupling. Finally, we discuss recent advances in selected topics in which modeling of active colloids is used to study motion in crowded and complex environments, microrheology in active baths, active colloidal engines, adaptive responses of active colloids with the help of machine learning techniques, as well as effects of colloid and fluid inertia.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of active colloids, focusing on the transition from simple Active Brownian Particles (ABPs) to systems influenced by hydrodynamic and chemical fields. By employing advanced numerical modeling techniques, we explore the behavior of microswimmers in complex environments, emphasizing the role of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. Our research sheds light on the collective dynamics within active baths and the operational mechanisms of active engines, providing insights into the self-organization and propulsion strategies of these systems. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing active matter, offering potential applications in the design of synthetic microswimmers and the manipulation of active colloidal systems in various technological and biomedical contexts.", "label": 1}
