{"grounding": "The solar–to–chemical energy conversion of Earth-abundant resources like water or greenhouse gas pollutants like CO2 promises an alternate energy source that is clean, renewable, and environmentally friendly. The eventual large-scale application of such photo-based energy conversion devices can be realized through the discovery of novel photocatalytic materials that are efficient, selective, and robust. In the past decade, the Materials Genome Initiative has led to a major leap in the development of materials databases, both computational and experimental. Hundreds of photocatalysts have recently been discovered for various chemical reactions, such as water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, employing these databases and/or data informatics, machine learning, and high-throughput computational and experimental methods. In this article, we review these data-driven photocatalyst discoveries, emphasizing the methods and techniques developed in the last few years to determine the (photo)electrochemical stability of photocatalysts, leading to the discovery of photocatalysts that remain robust and durable under operational conditions.", "generated_text": "The quest for sustainable energy solutions has intensified the search for robust materials capable of efficient photocatalytic energy conversion. This study leverages a data-driven approach to identify and evaluate materials with optimal photocatalytic properties, focusing on their aqueous stability and efficiency in energy conversion processes. By integrating computational models with experimental data, we systematically screen a vast array of compounds to uncover those with the highest potential for renewable energy applications. Our methodology emphasizes the importance of material stability in aqueous environments, a critical factor for the longevity and effectiveness of photocatalytic systems. The findings highlight promising candidates that exhibit superior photocatalytic activity, stability, and scalability, paving the way for their application in solar energy conversion and storage. This research contributes to the accelerated discovery of materials for renewable energy technologies, offering a pathway towards more sustainable and efficient energy systems.", "label": 1}
