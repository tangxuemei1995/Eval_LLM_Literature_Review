{"grounding": "The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) refers to the generation of a spin current as a result of a temperature gradient in a magnetic material, which can be detected electrically via the inverse spin Hall effect in a metallic contact. Since the discovery of the SSE in 2008, intensive studies on the SSE have been conducted to elucidate its origin. SSEs appear in a wide range of magnetic materials including ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnets and also paramagnets with classical or quantum spin fluctuation. SSE voltage reflects fundamental properties of a magnet, such as elementary excitation, static magnetic order, spin correlation, and spin transport. In this article, we review recent progress on the SSE in various systems, with particular emphasis on its emerging role as a probe of these magnetic properties in solids. We also briefly discuss the recently discovered nuclear SSE.", "generated_text": "The Spin Seebeck Effect (SSE) has emerged as a powerful tool for probing the intricate dynamics of elementary excitations, spin correlations, transport phenomena, magnetic order, and domain structures in solid-state systems. This effect, which generates a spin current from a temperature gradient, bridges the gap between spin caloritronics and antiferromagnetic spintronics, offering insights into the interplay of heat and spin degrees of freedom. By leveraging the inverse spin Hall effect, SSE facilitates the detection of spin currents, enabling the study of magnon dynamics and their interactions with nuclear spins in various materials, including quantum spin liquids. This review highlights the sensitivity of SSE to the underlying magnetic and thermal properties of solids, underscoring its potential as a versatile probe for advancing our understanding of spin-related phenomena in condensed matter physics.", "label": 1}
