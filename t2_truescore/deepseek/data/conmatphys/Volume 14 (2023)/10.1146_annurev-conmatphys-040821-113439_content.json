{"grounding": "Learning is traditionally studied in biological or computational systems. The power of learning frameworks in solving hard inverse problems provides an appealing case for the development of physical learning in which physical systems adopt desirable properties on their own without computational design. It was recently realized that large classes of physical systems can physically learn through local learning rules, autonomously adapting their parameters in response to observed examples of use. We review recent work in the emerging field of physical learning, describing theoretical and experimental advances in areas ranging from molecular self-assembly to flow networks and mechanical materials. Physical learning machines provide multiple practical advantages over computer designed ones, in particular by not requiring an accurate model of the system, and their ability to autonomously adapt to changing needs over time. As theoretical constructs, physical learning machines afford a novel perspective on how physical constraints modify abstract learning theory.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the paradigm of learning without neurons in physical systems, a frontier that extends the principles of machine learning and learning theory into the realm of physical materials and processes. We investigate how physical systems, ranging from metamaterials to molecular computing architectures, can embody learning mechanisms through inverse design and self-assembly. By leveraging the inherent properties of these systems, such as their response to external stimuli and their ability to self-organize, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve complex computational tasks without the need for traditional neural networks. This approach not only broadens our understanding of learning in non-biological systems but also opens up new avenues for the development of energy-efficient and scalable computing technologies. Through a series of case studies, we highlight the potential of physical learning in advancing fields such as material science, computational physics, and beyond, offering a fresh perspective on the future of machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "label": 1}
