{"grounding": "The modern scope of fermiology encompasses not just the classical geometry of Fermi surfaces but also the geometry of quantum wave functions over the Fermi surface. This enlarged scope is motivated by the advent of topological metals—metals whose Fermi surfaces are characterized by a robustly nontrivial Berry phase. We review the extent to which topological metals can be diagnosed from magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations of transport and thermodynamic quantities. A holistic analysis of the oscillatory wave form is proposed, in which different characteristics of the wave form (e.g., phase offset, high-harmonic amplitudes, temperature-dependent frequency) encode different aspects of a topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. Which characteristic to focus on depends on (a) the orientation of the magnetic field relative to certain crystallographic axes, (b) the symmetry class of the topological metal, and (c) the separation of Fermi-surface pockets in quasimomentum \n\n space. Closely proximate pockets arise when (1) spin–split pockets are nearly overlapping due to a weak spin–orbit force or when (2) two pockets touch at an isolated \n\n point, which can be a topological band-touching point or a saddlepoint in the energy-momentum dispersion. The emergence of a pseudospin degree of freedom (in case 1) and the implications of magnetic breakdown (in case 2) are reviewed, with emphasis on new aspects originating from the (nonabelian) Berry connection of the Fermi surface. Future extensions of topofermiology are suggested in the directions of interaction-induced Fermi-liquid instabilities and two-dimensional electron liquids.", "generated_text": "The study of Fermiology in topological metals has emerged as a pivotal area in condensed matter physics, offering profound insights into the interplay between geometry, topology, and quantum phenomena. This research delves into the intricate Fermi surface topologies of Dirac–Weyl semimetals, where the unique electronic structures give rise to exotic quantum oscillations and Berry phase effects. By employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical models, we explore the conditions under which magnetic breakdown occurs, revealing the complex dynamics of electron trajectories in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The investigation highlights the role of the Berry phase in modulating the quantum oscillation patterns, providing a deeper understanding of the topological invariants that govern the electronic properties of these materials. Furthermore, the research underscores the significance of geometry and topology in shaping the Fermi surface, leading to novel quantum states and transport phenomena. Through a comprehensive analysis of experimental data and theoretical predictions, this study contributes to the broader understanding of topological metals, paving the way for future explorations in quantum materials and their potential applications in next-generation electronic devices.", "label": 1}
