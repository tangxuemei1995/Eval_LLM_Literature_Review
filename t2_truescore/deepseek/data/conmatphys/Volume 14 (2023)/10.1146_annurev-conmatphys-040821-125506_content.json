{"grounding": "Elasticity typically refers to a material's ability to store energy, whereas viscosity refers to a material's tendency to dissipate it. In this review, we discuss fluids and solids for which this is not the case. These materials display additional linear response coefficients known as odd viscosity and odd elasticity. We first introduce odd viscosity and odd elasticity from a continuum perspective, with an emphasis on their rich phenomenology, including transverse responses, modified dislocation dynamics, and topological waves. We then provide an overview of systems that display odd viscosity and odd elasticity. These systems range from quantum fluids and astrophysical gases to active and driven matter. Finally, we comment on microscopic mechanisms by which odd viscosity and odd elasticity arise.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intriguing phenomena of odd viscosity and odd elasticity within the framework of continuum and fluid mechanics, particularly in the context of nonequilibrium systems and active matter. By integrating principles from hydrodynamics and rheology, we explore the unique mechanical responses that arise in systems where time-reversal symmetry is broken, leading to non-dissipative, parity-odd transport coefficients. Our analysis sheds light on the implications of these odd properties for the behavior of complex fluids and soft materials, offering new insights into the design and control of active systems. Through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental observations, we aim to establish a comprehensive understanding of how odd viscosity and elasticity influence the dynamics and stability of nonequilibrium materials.", "label": 1}
