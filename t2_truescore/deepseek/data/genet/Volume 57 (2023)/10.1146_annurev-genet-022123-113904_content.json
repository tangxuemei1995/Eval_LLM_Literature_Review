{"grounding": "Antibiotic resistance genes predate the therapeutic uses of antibiotics. However, the current antimicrobial resistance crisis stems from our extensive use of antibiotics and the generation of environmental stressors that impose new selective pressure on microbes and drive the evolution of resistant pathogens that now threaten human health. Similar to climate change, this global threat results from human activities that change habitats and natural microbiomes, which in turn interact with human-associated ecosystems and lead to adverse impacts on human health. Human activities that alter our planet at global scales exacerbate the current resistance crisis and exemplify our central role in large-scale changes in which we are both protagonists and architects of our success but also casualties of unanticipated collateral outcomes. As cognizant participants in this ongoing planetary experiment, we are driven to understand and find strategies to curb the ongoing crises of resistance and climate change.", "generated_text": "The escalating crisis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is intricately linked to global environmental changes, presenting a complex challenge to public health and ecosystems worldwide. This study explores the multifaceted interplay between AMR and environmental factors, including the widespread contamination of natural habitats with antibiotics and resistant genes, driven by anthropogenic activities. Climate change further exacerbates this issue by altering microbial ecosystems and facilitating the spread of resistant pathogens. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we identify key mechanisms by which environmental changes influence AMR dynamics, such as increased bacterial mutation rates and horizontal gene transfer. Our findings underscore the urgent need for integrated approaches that address both the medical and environmental dimensions of AMR. Strategies to mitigate this crisis must include reducing antibiotic misuse, enhancing wastewater treatment, and implementing policies that consider the environmental impact of human activities. This research highlights the critical importance of a One Health approach in combating the intertwined challenges of AMR and global environmental change.", "label": 1}
