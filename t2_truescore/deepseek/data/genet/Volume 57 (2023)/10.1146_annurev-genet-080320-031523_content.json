{"grounding": "Transcription and replication both require large macromolecular complexes to act on a DNA template, yet these machineries cannot simultaneously act on the same DNA sequence. Conflicts between the replication and transcription machineries (transcription–replication conflicts, or TRCs) are widespread in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and have the capacity to both cause DNA damage and compromise complete, faithful replication of the genome. This review will highlight recent studies investigating the genomic locations of TRCs and the mechanisms by which they may be prevented, mitigated, or resolved. We address work from both model organisms and mammalian systems but predominantly focus on multicellular eukaryotes owing to the additional complexities inherent in the coordination of replication and transcription in the context of cell type–specific gene expression and higher-order chromatin organization.", "generated_text": "Transcription–replication conflicts (TRCs) represent a significant source of genomic instability, posing a fundamental challenge to cellular integrity and function. These conflicts arise when the processes of transcription and replication occur simultaneously on the same DNA template, leading to collisions between the replisome and RNA polymerase. Such encounters can result in replication fork stalling, DNA damage, and ultimately, genomic alterations. This review explores the mechanisms underlying TRCs, including the role of origin firing and replication stress in exacerbating these conflicts. Additionally, we delve into the cellular strategies employed to mitigate the impact of TRCs, focusing on DNA repair pathways and regulatory mechanisms that ensure the coordination of transcription and replication. Understanding the dynamics of TRCs is crucial for elucidating their contribution to genomic instability and for developing therapeutic strategies to combat diseases associated with DNA damage and repair deficiencies.", "label": 1}
