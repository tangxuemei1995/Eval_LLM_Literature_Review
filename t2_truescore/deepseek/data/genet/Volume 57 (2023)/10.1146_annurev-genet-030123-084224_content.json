{"grounding": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by excess activation of the innate immune system in an antigen-independent manner. Starting with the discovery of the causal gene for familial Mediterranean fever, more than 50Â monogenic SAIDs have been described. These discoveries, paired with advances in immunology and genomics, have allowed our understanding of these diseases to improve drastically in the last decade. The genetic causes of SAIDs are complex and include both germline and somatic pathogenic variants that affect various inflammatory signaling pathways. We provide an overview of the acquired SAIDs from a genetic perspective and summarize the clinical phenotypes and mechanism(s) of inflammation, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a complex group of disorders characterized by dysregulation of the innate immune system, leading to unprovoked inflammation. The genetic architecture of SAIDs is diverse, encompassing monogenic, digenic, polygenic, and epigenetic mechanisms, alongside emerging evidence of somatic mutations contributing to disease pathogenesis. This review delves into the genetic underpinnings of SAIDs, highlighting the pivotal role of genetic mutations in inflammasome components and other immune regulatory pathways. We explore the spectrum of genetic alterations, from single nucleotide variants to complex genetic interactions, and their impact on disease phenotype and severity. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations in the context of autoinflammatory diseases, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets and personalized medicine approaches. Understanding the genetic basis of SAIDs is crucial for advancing diagnostic strategies and developing targeted therapies.", "label": 1}
