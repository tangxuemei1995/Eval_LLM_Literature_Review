{"grounding": "Despite accumulating evidence implicating noncoding variants in human diseases, unraveling their functionality remains a significant challenge. Systematic annotations of the regulatory landscape and the growth of sequence variant data sets have fueled the development of tools and methods to identify causal noncoding variants and evaluate their regulatory effects. Here, we review the latest advances in the field and discuss potential future research avenues to gain a more in-depth understanding of noncoding regulatory variants.", "generated_text": "Noncoding regulatory variants, though elusive, play a pivotal role in gene expression and disease etiology. This study explores innovative strategies for identifying these variants, leveraging genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare-variant association tests, and machine learning algorithms. By integrating functional assays to validate enhancer activity, we aim to enhance the detection of noncoding variants with significant biological impact. Our approach offers a comprehensive framework for uncovering the hidden regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases.", "label": 0}
