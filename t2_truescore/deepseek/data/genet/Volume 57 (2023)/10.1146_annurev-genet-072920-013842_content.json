{"grounding": "Assigning functions to genes and learning how to control their expression are part of the foundation of cell biology and therapeutic development. An efficient and unbiased method to accomplish this is genetic screening, which historically required laborious clone generation and phenotyping and is still limited by scale today. The rapid technological progress on modulating gene function with CRISPR-Cas and measuring it in individual cells has now relaxed the major experimental constraints and enabled pooled screening with complex readouts from single cells. Here, we review the principles and practical considerations for pooled single-cell CRISPR screening. We discuss perturbation strategies, experimental model systems, matching the perturbation to the individual cells, reading out cell phenotypes, and data analysis. Our focus is on single-cell RNA sequencing and cell sortingâ€“based readouts, including image-enabled cell sorting. We expect this transformative approach to fuel biomedical research for the next several decades.", "generated_text": "Pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens have revolutionized functional genomics by enabling the systematic interrogation of gene function across the genome. However, traditional pooled screens often average signals across cell populations, masking the heterogeneity inherent in biological systems. Here, we present a novel approach that integrates pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell resolution, leveraging advancements in single-cell genomics and cell sorting technologies. This method allows for the precise dissection of gene function at the individual cell level, providing unprecedented insights into cellular diversity and the complex interplay of genetic networks. By combining CRISPR-mediated gene perturbation with single-cell RNA sequencing, we can simultaneously assess the impact of genetic alterations on gene expression profiles in thousands of individual cells. This approach not only enhances the resolution of functional genomics studies but also opens new avenues for understanding the molecular basis of cellular behavior, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic responses at a single-cell level.", "label": 0}
