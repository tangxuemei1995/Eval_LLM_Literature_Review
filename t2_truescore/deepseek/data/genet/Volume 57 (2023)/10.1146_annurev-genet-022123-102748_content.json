{"grounding": "Coral reefs are both exceptionally biodiverse and threatened by climate change and other human activities. Here, we review population genomic processes in coral reef taxa and their importance for understanding responses to global change. Many taxa on coral reefs are characterized by weak genetic drift, extensive gene flow, and strong selection from complex biotic and abiotic environments, which together present a fascinating test of microevolutionary theory. Selection, gene flow, and hybridization have played and will continue to play an important role in the adaptation or extinction of coral reef taxa in the face of rapid environmental change, but research remains exceptionally limited compared to the urgent needs. Critical areas for future investigation include understanding evolutionary potential and the mechanisms of local adaptation, developing historical baselines, and building greater research capacity in the countries where most reef diversity is concentrated.", "generated_text": "Coral reefs, among the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, are facing unprecedented threats from global change, including rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and habitat destruction. This study employs population genomics to explore the mechanisms of local adaptation and evolutionary rescue in coral reef fish populations, which are critical for their survival in rapidly changing environments. By analyzing genetic variation across populations, we aim to identify adaptive loci associated with thermal tolerance and other stress responses, and to assess the potential for dispersal to facilitate genetic rescue in isolated or declining populations. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of coral reef ecosystems under climate change, offering insights into conservation strategies that leverage natural genetic variation to enhance resilience and adaptability in the face of global environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
