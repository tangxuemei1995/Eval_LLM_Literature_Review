{"grounding": "The ease and throughput of single-cell genomics have steadily improved, and its current trajectory suggests that surveying single-cell populations will become routine. We discuss the merger of quantitative genetics with single-cell genomics and emphasize how this synergizes with advantages intrinsic to plants. Single-cell population genomics provides increased detection resolution when mapping variants that control molecular traits, including gene expression or chromatin accessibility. Additionally, single-cell population genomics reveals the cell types in which variants act and, when combined with organism-level phenotype measurements, unveils which cellular contexts impact higher-order traits. Emerging technologies, notably multiomics, can facilitate the measurement of both genetic changes and genomic traits in single cells, enabling single-cell genetic experiments. The implementation of single-cell genetics will advance the investigation of the genetic architecture of complex molecular traits and provide new experimental paradigms to study eukaryotic genetics.", "generated_text": "The advent of single-cell genomics has revolutionized our ability to dissect the genetic basis of complex traits by enabling the analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility at an unprecedented resolution. This study leverages single-cell populations to explore the intricate relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic diversity. By integrating quantitative genetics with single-cell technologies, we aim to identify key genetic loci and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits. Our approach involves the analysis of mutants and natural variants within a population genetics framework, providing insights into the genetic architecture of traits and the evolutionary forces shaping them. This research not only advances our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits but also opens new avenues for the development of targeted therapies and precision medicine.", "label": 0}
