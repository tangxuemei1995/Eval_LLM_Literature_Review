{"grounding": "Polygenic scores quantify inherited risk by integrating information from many common sites of DNA variation into a single number. Rapid increases in the scale of genetic association studies and new statistical algorithms have enabled development of polygenic scores that meaningfully measure—as early as birth—risk of coronary artery disease. These newer-generation polygenic scores identify up to 8% of the population with triple the normal risk based on genetic variation alone, and these individuals cannot be identified on the basis of family history or clinical risk factors alone. For those identified with increased genetic risk, evidence supports risk reduction with at least two interventions, adherence to a healthy lifestyle and cholesterol-lowering therapies, that can substantially reduce risk. Alongside considerable enthusiasm for the potential of polygenic risk estimation to enable a new era of preventive clinical medicine is recognition of a need for ongoing research into how best to ensure equitable performance across diverse ancestries, how and in whom to assess the scores in clinical practice, as well as randomized trials to confirm clinical utility.", "generated_text": "Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating advanced strategies for risk prediction and prevention. The advent of polygenic scores (PGS) has revolutionized the field of genomics by enabling the aggregation of genetic variants to estimate an individual's predisposition to complex diseases like CAD. This review highlights the latest advances in the development and application of PGS for CAD, emphasizing their role in enhancing risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors. We explore the integration of PGS with clinical and lifestyle factors to improve the accuracy of CAD risk assessment, facilitating personalized prevention strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the implementation of PGS in clinical practice, including issues related to genetic diversity, data interpretation, and ethical considerations. The potential of PGS to transform CAD prevention through early identification of at-risk individuals and targeted interventions is underscored, paving the way for a new era in cardiovascular genomics.", "label": 1}
