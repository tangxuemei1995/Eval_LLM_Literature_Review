{"grounding": "Increasing numbers of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth, from early puberty through late adolescence, are seeking medical services to bring their physical sex characteristics into alignment with their gender identity—their inner sense of self as male or female or elsewhere on the gender spectrum. Numerous studies, primarily of short- and medium-term duration (up to 6 years), demonstrate the clearly beneficial—even lifesaving—mental health impact of gender-affirming medical care in TGD youth. However, there are significant gaps in knowledge and challenges to such care. Long-term safety and efficacy studies are needed to optimize medical care for TGD youth.", "generated_text": "This review explores the current concepts in gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth, focusing on the use of pubertal blockers and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to delay puberty, and gender-affirming hormone treatment to align physical characteristics with gender identity. It highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, including psychological support, to address the unique needs of this population. The paper also discusses the ethical considerations, potential benefits, and risks associated with these interventions, emphasizing the need for individualized care plans to support the well-being and mental health of transgender and gender-diverse youth.", "label": 0}
