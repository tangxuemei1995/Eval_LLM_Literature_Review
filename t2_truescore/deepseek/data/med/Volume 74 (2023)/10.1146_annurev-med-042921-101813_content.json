{"grounding": "Hundreds of different genetic causes of chronic kidney disease are now recognized, and while individually rare, taken together they are significant contributors to both adult and pediatric diseases. Traditional genetics approaches relied heavily on the identification of large families with multiple affected members and have been fundamental to the identification of genetic kidney diseases. With the increased utilization of massively parallel sequencing and improvements to genotype imputation, we can analyze rare variants in large cohorts of unrelated individuals, leading to personalized care for patients and significant research advancements. This review evaluates the contribution of rare disorders to patient care and the study of genetic kidney diseases and highlights key advancements that utilize new techniques to improve our ability to identify new geneâ€“disease associations.", "generated_text": "The exploration of genetic kidney diseases has unveiled the significant impact of rare disorders on the broader spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Utilizing collapsing analysis and massively parallel sequencing, researchers have identified novel genetic variants that contribute to the pathogenesis of CKD, challenging traditional views on its genetic architecture. This study highlights the unexpected role of rare genetic disorders in CKD, emphasizing the importance of genomics in uncovering the complex genetic underpinnings of kidney disease. By integrating precision medicine approaches, this research paves the way for targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies, offering new hope for patients with genetic kidney diseases. The findings underscore the necessity of incorporating genetic screening into routine clinical practice to enhance diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making in CKD.", "label": 1}
