{"grounding": "In 2020, the nephrology community formally interrogated long-standing race-based clinical algorithms used in the field, including the kidney function estimation equations. A comprehensive understanding of the history of kidney function estimation and racial essentialism is necessary to understand underpinnings of the incorporation of a Black race coefficient into prior equations. We provide a review of this history, as well as the considerations used to develop race-free equations that are a guidepost for a more equity-oriented, scientifically rigorous future for kidney function estimation and other clinical algorithms and processes in which race may be embedded as a variable.", "generated_text": "The integration of race into clinical algorithms for kidney function estimation has sparked significant debate, highlighting the tension between historical medical practices and the pursuit of health equity. This paper examines the implications of race-based medicine on kidney function estimation, critiquing the scientific validity and ethical considerations of such practices. Through a review of current literature and case studies, we explore the lessons learned from the use of race in these algorithms and propose a path forward that prioritizes health justice. Our findings advocate for the development of race-neutral clinical algorithms that ensure equitable healthcare outcomes for all patients, irrespective of racial or ethnic background.", "label": 1}
