{"grounding": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) were originally developed as antidiabetic agents, with cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials demonstrating improved CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Secondary analyses of CV outcome trials and later dedicated kidney outcome trials consistently reported improved kidney-related outcomes independent of T2D status and across a range of kidney function and albuminuria. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trials and real-world analyses demonstrating a decrease in the risk of acute kidney injury. The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors generally extend across different members of the class, possibly on the basis of hemodynamic, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in diverse patient populations.", "generated_text": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a groundbreaking therapeutic class, offering significant benefits beyond glycemic control, particularly in kidney health. This review synthesizes current evidence on the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in improving kidney outcomes across a spectrum of conditions, including diabetic kidney disease (DKD), nondiabetic kidney disease (NDKD), and acute kidney injury (AKI). Clinical trials and real-world data consistently demonstrate that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of kidney disease progression, end-stage kidney disease, and cardiovascular events in patients with DKD. Emerging evidence also suggests potential renoprotective effects in NDKD and AKI, highlighting their role in broader nephrology practice. The mechanisms underlying these benefits include reductions in intraglomerular pressure, anti-inflammatory effects, and improved metabolic profiles. This review underscores the importance of SGLT2 inhibitors as a cornerstone in the management of kidney diseases, heralding a new era in nephrology.", "label": 0}
