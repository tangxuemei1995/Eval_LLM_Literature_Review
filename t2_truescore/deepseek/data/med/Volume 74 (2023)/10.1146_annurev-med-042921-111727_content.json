{"grounding": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is an important subtype of myocardial infarction (MI) that occurs in approximately 6â€“8% of patients with spontaneous MI who are referred for coronary angiography. MINOCA disproportionately affects women, but men are also affected. Pathogenesis is more variable than in MI with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD). Dominant mechanisms include atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and coronary artery spasm. Management of MINOCA varies based on the underlying mechanism of infarction. Therefore, systematic approaches to diagnosis are recommended. The combination of invasive coronary angiography, multivessel intracoronary imaging, provocative testing for coronary spasm, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides the greatest diagnostic yield. Current clinical practice guidelines for the secondary prevention of MI are based largely on data from patients with MI-CAD. Thus, optimal medications after MINOCA are uncertain. Clinical trials focused on the treatment of patients with MINOCA are urgently needed to define optimal care.", "generated_text": "Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) represents a unique and increasingly recognized clinical entity characterized by evidence of myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. This condition challenges traditional diagnostic paradigms and necessitates a comprehensive approach to identify underlying etiologies, including coronary spasm, takotsubo syndrome, and other forms of myocardial injury. The pathophysiology of MINOCA is multifactorial, involving mechanisms such as endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, and plaque disruption without significant luminal obstruction. Accurate diagnosis and management require a combination of advanced imaging techniques, biomarker assessment, and clinical acumen. Despite its nonobstructive nature, MINOCA is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, underscoring the importance of tailored therapeutic strategies. This review highlights the current understanding of MINOCA, emphasizing diagnostic criteria, etiological factors, and evidence-based management approaches to improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
