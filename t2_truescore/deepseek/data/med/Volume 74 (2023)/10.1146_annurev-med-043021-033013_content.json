{"grounding": "In vivo gene therapy is rapidly emerging as a new therapeutic paradigm for monogenic disorders. For almost three decades, hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) have served as model disorders for the development of gene therapy. This effort is soon to bear fruit with completed pivotal adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene addition trials reporting encouraging results and regulatory approval widely anticipated in the near future for the current generation of HA and HB AAV vectors. Here we review the clinical development of AAV gene therapy for HA and HB and examine outstanding questions that have recently emerged from AAV clinical trials for hemophilia and other monogenic disorders.", "generated_text": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy represents a groundbreaking approach in the treatment of hemophilia, a group of inherited bleeding disorders characterized by deficiencies in clotting factors. This review focuses on the application of AAV vectors for delivering functional copies of the factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) genes to patients with hemophilia A and B, respectively. By leveraging the natural tropism and low immunogenicity of AAV, this therapeutic strategy aims to achieve sustained expression of the missing clotting factors, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for frequent factor replacement therapies. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated promising results, highlighting the potential of AAV gene therapy to transform the management of hemophilia. However, challenges such as immune responses to AAV capsids and the durability of transgene expression remain to be addressed. This abstract underscores the advancements and ongoing research in AAV gene therapy for hemophilia, offering hope for a long-term curative treatment.", "label": 1}
