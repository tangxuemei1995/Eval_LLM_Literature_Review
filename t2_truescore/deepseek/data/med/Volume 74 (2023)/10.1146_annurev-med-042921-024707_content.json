{"grounding": "Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is the second most common primary liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma and accounts for 2% of cancer-related deaths. BTCs are classified according to their anatomical origin into intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar, or distal cholangiocarcinoma, as well as gall bladder carcinoma. While the mutational profiles in these anatomical BTC subtypes overlap to a large extent, iCCA is notable for the high frequency of IDH1/2 mutations (10–22%) and the nearly exclusive occurrence of FGFR2 fusions in 10–15% of patients. In recent years, FGFR2 fusions have become one of the most promising targets for precision oncology targeting BTC, with FGFR inhibitors already approved in Europe and the United States for patients with advanced, pretreated iCCA. While the therapeutic potential of nonfusion alterations is still under debate, it is expected that the field of FGFR2-directed therapies will be subject to rapid further evolution and optimization. The scope of this review is to provide an overview of oncogenic FGFR signaling in iCCA cells and highlight the pathophysiology, diagnostic testing strategies, and therapeutic promises and challenges associated with FGFR2-altered iCCA.", "generated_text": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents a group of heterogeneous malignancies with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Recent advancements in molecular profiling have identified Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) alterations, including mutations, fusions, amplifications, and in-frame deletions, as key drivers in a subset of CCA patients. These genetic alterations lead to the constitutive activation of FGFR2 signaling pathways, promoting tumor growth and survival. Consequently, FGFR2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in CCA. However, the clinical efficacy of FGFR2 inhibitors is often hampered by the development of resistance mechanisms, including the activation of alternative signaling pathways such as RAS, EGFR, and MEK. This review focuses on the role of FGFR2 alterations in CCA pathogenesis, the current landscape of FGFR2-targeted therapies, and the mechanisms underlying resistance to these agents. Understanding the molecular basis of resistance is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance and improve outcomes for patients with FGFR2-altered CCA.", "label": 1}
