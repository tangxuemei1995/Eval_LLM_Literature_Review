{"grounding": "Transgender people often face barriers in health care due to lack of access to care, lack of knowledgeable healthcare professionals, discrimination, and gaps in medical and mental health research. Existing research on transgender health has focused heavily on mental health, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases/infections, and substance abuse. Gender-affirming hormone therapy and/or surgery allows for some alignment of biology and gender identity. Gender-affirming care may offer quality-of-life benefits, which may outweigh modest concerns related to exogenous hormone therapy. The Endocrine Society treatment guidelines were revised in 2017, and this article reviews recent data that might inform a future guideline revision. Future longitudinal research is needed to close the gap in knowledge in the field of transgender medicine.", "generated_text": "The field of adult transgender medicine has seen significant advancements, particularly in the realm of gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT), as outlined in the Endocrine Society's 2017 treatment guidelines. This update focuses on the latest evidence-based practices for the care of transgender individuals, including transfeminine and transmasculine patients. It highlights the importance of personalized treatment plans, the monitoring of hormone therapy effects, and the management of potential risks associated with GAHT. The guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to care, incorporating endocrinological, psychological, and surgical perspectives to support the health and well-being of transgender adults. This abstract aims to provide a concise overview of current recommendations and considerations in adult transgender medicine, reflecting the evolving understanding and treatment of gender dysphoria.", "label": 1}
