{"grounding": "Shortly after the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019, clinicians rapidly recognized an apparent association between the disease and both arterial and venous thrombotic complications, which was confirmed in epidemiologic studies. Based on these data, hospitals empirically developed and implemented protocols with different strategies for anticoagulation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Subsequent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) clarified the role of anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and recently discharged from the hospital. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, observational comparative effectiveness analyses that provided hints of a benefit from anticoagulation, and finally the RCTs that established which patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation. These RCTs have demonstrated that hospitalized, noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation, but patients who are hospitalized and critically ill, discharged from the hospital, or not hospitalized do not benefit.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled a significant association between the disease and thrombotic complications, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality among affected individuals. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19-induced thrombosis, highlighting the role of endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and platelet activation. We delve into the current therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating these thrombotic events, including the use of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors. The efficacy and safety profiles of these interventions are critically evaluated, with a focus on optimizing patient outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges in therapeutic decision-making, such as balancing the risk of bleeding against the benefits of thrombosis prevention. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of personalized medicine in the management of COVID-19-related thrombotic complications, advocating for further research to refine therapeutic protocols and improve patient care in the context of this global health crisis.", "label": 1}
