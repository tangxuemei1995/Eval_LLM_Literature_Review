{"grounding": "This review discusses recent advancements in the field of valvular heart disease. Topics covered include recognition of the impact of atrial fibrillation on development and assessment of valvular disease, strategies for global prevention of rheumatic heart disease, understanding and management of secondary mitral regurgitation, the updated classification of bicuspid aortic valve disease, recognition of heightened cardiovascular risk associated with moderate aortic stenosis, and a growing armamentarium of transcatheter therapies.", "generated_text": "Valvular heart disease (VHD) encompasses a range of conditions affecting heart valves, including rheumatic heart disease, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and bicuspid aortic valve disease. Recent advancements have shed light on novel pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies. This review highlights emerging concepts in VHD pathophysiology and explores cutting-edge therapeutic approaches aimed at improving patient outcomes and quality of life.", "label": 1}
