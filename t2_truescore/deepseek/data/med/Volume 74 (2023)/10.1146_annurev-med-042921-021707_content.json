{"grounding": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the β-globin chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different approaches with lentiviral vector–mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation. Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality.", "generated_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to severe clinical complications. Recent advancements in gene therapy have opened new avenues for its treatment, offering hope for a potential cure. This review explores diverse approaches to gene therapy for SCD, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), gene addition using lentiviral vectors, and gene editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9. HSCT remains the only curative option but is limited by donor availability and graft-versus-host disease. Lentiviral vector-mediated gene therapy has shown promise in clinical trials by introducing functional hemoglobin genes into patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells. Meanwhile, CRISPR-Cas9 offers precise genome editing to correct the underlying genetic mutation. Each approach has unique advantages and challenges, and ongoing research aims to optimize safety, efficacy, and accessibility for patients worldwide.", "label": 1}
