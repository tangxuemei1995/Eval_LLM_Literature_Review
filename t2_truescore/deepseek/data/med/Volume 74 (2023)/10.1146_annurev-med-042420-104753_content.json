{"grounding": "COVID-19 can cause acute kidney injury and may cause or exacerbate chronic kidney diseases, including glomerular diseases. SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells has been reported, but it remains unclear if viral infection of kidney cells causes disease. The most important causes of kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 include impaired renal perfusion and immune dysregulation. Chronic kidney disease, especially kidney failure with kidney replacement therapy and kidney transplant, is associated with markedly increased COVID-19 mortality. Persons with severe kidney disease have been excluded from most clinical trials of COVID-19 therapies, so therapeutic approaches must be extrapolated from studies of patients without kidney disease. Some medications used to treat COVID-19 should be avoided or used at reduced dosages in patients with severe kidney disease and in kidney transplant recipients. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal strategies to prevent and treat COVID-19 in patients with kidney disease.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has significantly impacted individuals with kidney disease, particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and those undergoing kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT), including dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. This review synthesizes current evidence on the interplay between COVID-19 and kidney disease, highlighting the increased risk of severe outcomes in this vulnerable population. Patients with kidney disease exhibit a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are more likely to experience complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and progression to more severe stages of kidney disease. The management of COVID-19 in patients with kidney disease presents unique challenges, including the need for modified treatment protocols and the optimization of dialysis and transplant care during the pandemic. This abstract underscores the importance of targeted interventions and research to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with kidney disease.", "label": 1}
