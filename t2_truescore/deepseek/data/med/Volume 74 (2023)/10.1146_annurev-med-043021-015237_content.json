{"grounding": "Billions of individuals worldwide have benefited from the unprecedented large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Given the sheer number of people that have received these vaccines, it is not surprising that rare side effects are reported that were not previously detected in the phase III vaccine trials. This review addresses one rare complication called SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It occurs in approximately 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 recipients of the adenovirus vectorâ€“based COVID-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca-Oxford or Johnson & Johnson. Information on VITT syndrome was disseminated quickly via social media and publications after it was first discovered. Initial observations associating VITT with specific patient populations, thrombus locations, and outcomes associated with heparin therapy have since been refined with additional clinical experience. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of VITT.", "generated_text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been pivotal in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, rare cases of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have been reported, presenting a serious immunologic complication. This condition is characterized by the development of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following vaccination, particularly with adenoviral vector-based vaccines. The pathogenesis of VITT involves the production of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), leading to platelet activation and a prothrombotic state. This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying VITT, its clinical manifestations, and the challenges in diagnosis and management. Despite its rarity, the severity of VITT necessitates heightened awareness among healthcare providers to ensure prompt recognition and treatment. Understanding the immunologic basis of VITT is crucial for the development of safer vaccination strategies and for mitigating the risk of this adverse event in future vaccine campaigns.", "label": 1}
