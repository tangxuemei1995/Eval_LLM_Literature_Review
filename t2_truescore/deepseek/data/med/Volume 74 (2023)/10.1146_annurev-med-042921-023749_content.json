{"grounding": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described in 1906 as a dementing disease marked by the presence of two types of fibrillar aggregates in the brain: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. The process of aggregation and formation of the aggregates has been a major focus of investigation ever since the discoveries that the tau protein is the predominant protein in tangles and amyloid β is the predominant protein in plaques. The idea that smaller, oligomeric species of amyloid may also be bioactive has now been clearly established. This review examines the possibility that soluble, nonfibrillar, bioactive forms of tau—the “tau we cannot see”—comprise a dominant driver of neurodegeneration in AD.", "generated_text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite significant advancements in understanding the molecular underpinnings of AD, the role of tau pathology in disease progression remains elusive. This review focuses on the 'invisible' aspects of tau biology that are not readily detectable with current imaging and biochemical techniques but are crucial for the development of effective biomarkers and therapeutics. We explore the potential of novel tau isoforms, post-translational modifications, and tau interactions with other cellular components as targets for early diagnosis and intervention. The insights gained could pave the way for innovative strategies to combat tauopathies, including AD.", "label": 1}
