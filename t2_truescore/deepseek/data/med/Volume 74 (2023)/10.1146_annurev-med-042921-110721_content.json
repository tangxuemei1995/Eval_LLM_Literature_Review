{"grounding": "Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) have radically transformed the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed rare/ultrarare Mendelian diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), the technology integral for ES, GS, and most large (100+) gene panels, has enabled previously unimaginable diagnoses, changes in medical management, new treatments, and accurate reproductive risk assessments for patients, as well as new disease gene discoveries. Yet, challenges remain, as most individuals remain undiagnosed with current NGS. Improved NGS technology has resulted in long-read sequencing, which may resolve diagnoses in some patients who do not obtain a diagnosis with current short-read ES and GS, but its effectiveness is unclear, and it is expensive. Other challenges that persist include the resolution of variants of uncertain significance, the urgent need for patients with ultrarare disorders to have access to therapeutics, the need for equity in patient access to NGS-based testing, and the study of ethical concerns. However, the outlook for undiagnosed disease resolution is bright, due to continual advancements in the field.", "generated_text": "The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed syndromes, particularly those suspected to be of genetic origin. Exome and genome sequencing have emerged as powerful tools in the identification of pathogenic variants underlying rare and ultrarare diseases, including Mendelian disorders. This study explores the efficacy of exome and genome sequencing in elucidating the genetic basis of undiagnosed syndromes, highlighting their role in uncovering novel disease-causing mutations and expanding the phenotypic spectrum of known genetic conditions. By analyzing a cohort of patients with undiagnosed diseases, we demonstrate the diagnostic yield of these sequencing approaches and discuss the challenges in variant interpretation and the integration of genomic data into clinical practice. Our findings underscore the importance of exome and genome sequencing in the diagnostic odyssey of patients with undiagnosed syndromes, offering hope for personalized medicine and targeted therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
