{"grounding": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension but is frequently underrecognized and undertreated. Patients with PA are at a markedly increased risk for target organ damage to the heart and kidneys. While patients with unilateral PA can be treated surgically, many patients with PA are not eligible or willing to undergo surgery. Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are highly effective for treating PA and reducing the risk of target organ damage. However, steroidal MRAs are often underprescribed and can be poorly tolerated by some patients due to side effects. Nonsteroidal MRAs reduce adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetic kidney disease and are bettertolerated than steroidal MRAs. While their blood pressureâ€“lowering effects remain unclear, these agents may have a potential role in reducing target organ damage in patients with PA.", "generated_text": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a significant cause of secondary hypertension, characterized by excessive aldosterone production independent of the renin-angiotensin system. This condition not only contributes to the development of hypertension but also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have emerged as a cornerstone in the management of PA, offering protective effects on both the heart and kidneys. By blocking the deleterious actions of aldosterone, MRAs mitigate the progression of CVD and CKD, highlighting their therapeutic potential beyond blood pressure control. This review explores the pathophysiology of PA and the pivotal role of MRAs in attenuating its adverse effects on cardiovascular and renal health, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and targeted treatment to improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
