{"grounding": "Nearly half of Americans are projected to have obesity by 2030, underscoring the pressing need for effective treatments. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) represent the first agents in a rapidly evolving, highly promising landscape of nascent hormone-based obesity therapeutics. With the understanding of the neurobiology of obesity rapidly expanding, these emerging entero-endocrine and endo-pancreatic agents combined or coformulated with GLP-1 RAs herald a new era of targeted, mechanism-based treatment of obesity. This article reviews GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of obesity and previews the imminent future of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based anti-obesity therapeutics.", "generated_text": "The escalating global obesity epidemic necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies. This review explores the burgeoning field of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and nascent nutrient-stimulated hormone (NuSH)-based therapies as pivotal antiobesity medications. GLP-1 receptor agonists have demonstrated efficacy in weight management, prompting the development of dual and triple receptor agonists that target multiple pathways for enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Concurrently, NuSH-based therapies, leveraging the body's nutrient-sensing mechanisms, offer a novel approach to obesity treatment. This article synthesizes current research, highlighting the potential of these advanced therapies to redefine obesity management and improve patient outcomes in the face of this growing public health challenge.", "label": 1}
