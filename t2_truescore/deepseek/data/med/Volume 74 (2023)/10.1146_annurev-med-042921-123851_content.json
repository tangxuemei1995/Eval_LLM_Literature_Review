{"grounding": "Maternal mortality is unusually high in the United States compared to other wealthy nations and is characterized by major disparities in race/ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic factors. Similar to other developed nations, the United States has seen a shift in the underlying causes of pregnancy-related death, with a relative increase in mortality resulting from diseases of the cardiovascular system and preexisting medical conditions. Improved continuity of care aimed at identifying reproductive-age women with preexisting conditions that may heighten the risk of maternal death, preconception management of risk factors for major adverse pregnancy outcomes, and primary care visits within the first year after delivery may offer opportunities to address gaps in medical care contributing to the unacceptable rates of maternal mortality in the United States.", "generated_text": "Maternal mortality in the United States remains a significant public health challenge, with notable disparities across racial and socioeconomic groups. This study examines recent trends in maternal mortality rates, identifying key factors contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we highlight the critical role of preconception health and counseling in mitigating risks associated with pregnancy. Our findings suggest that targeted interventions aimed at improving preconception health can significantly reduce maternal mortality rates. Furthermore, we explore the potential of preconception counseling to address health disparities and improve outcomes for at-risk populations. This research underscores the importance of integrating preconception care into public health strategies to prevent maternal mortality and enhance the well-being of mothers and their children across the United States.", "label": 1}
