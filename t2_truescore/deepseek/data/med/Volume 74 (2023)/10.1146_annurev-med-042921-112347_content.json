{"grounding": "Aging is associated with increased mutational burden in every tissue studied. Occasionally, fitness-increasing mutations will arise, leading to stem cell clonal expansion. This process occurs in several tissues but has been best studied in blood. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, which result if additional cooperating mutations occur. Surprisingly, it is also associated with an increased risk of nonmalignant diseases, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This may be due to enhanced inflammation in mutated innate immune cells, which could be targeted clinically with anti-inflammatory drugs. Recent studies have uncovered other factors that predict poor outcomes in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, such as size of the mutant clone, mutated driver genes, and epigenetic aging. Though clonality is inevitable and largely a function of time, recent work has shown that inherited genetic variation can also influence this process. Clonal hematopoiesis provides a paradigm for understanding how age-related changes in tissue stem cell composition and function influence human health.", "generated_text": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) represents a prevalent biological phenomenon characterized by the expansion of hematopoietic stem cell clones due to acquired somatic mutations, predominantly in individuals over the age of 50. This condition, while often asymptomatic, has been increasingly recognized for its significant associations with aging, coronary artery disease (CAD), and malignancy. The underlying mechanisms linking CHIP to these adverse health outcomes are complex and multifaceted, involving inflammatory pathways, DNA methylation alterations, and clonal trajectories that may predispose to disease progression. Recent studies have highlighted the role of CHIP in accelerating atherosclerosis and increasing the risk of hematologic cancers, thereby underscoring the importance of understanding the molecular and cellular dynamics of clonal hematopoiesis. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on CHIP, focusing on its impact on human health, the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors, and the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate its associated risks.", "label": 1}
