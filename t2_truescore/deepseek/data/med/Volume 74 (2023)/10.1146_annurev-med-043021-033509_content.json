{"grounding": "The multifaceted interaction between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the endocrine system has been a major area of scientific research over the past two years. While common endocrine/metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes have been recognized among significant risk factors for COVID-19 severity, several endocrine organs were identified to be targeted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). New-onset endocrine disorders related to COVID-19 were reported while long-term effects, if any, are yet to be determined. Meanwhile, the “stay home” measures during the pandemic caused interruption in the care of patients with pre-existing endocrine disorders and may have impeded the diagnosis and treatment of new ones. This review aims to outline this complex interaction between COVID-19 and endocrine disorders by synthesizing the current scientific knowledge obtained from clinical and pathophysiological studies, and to emphasize considerations for future research.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has unveiled complex interactions between viral infections and the endocrine system. This review explores the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine disorders, focusing on obesity, thyroid, adrenal, pituitary, and reproductive health. Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect endocrine organs, leading to dysregulation of hormone production and exacerbation of pre-existing endocrine conditions. Obesity has been identified as a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, attributed to its pro-inflammatory state and metabolic disturbances. Thyroid dysfunction, including both thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, has been observed in COVID-19 patients, potentially linked to the virus's direct effects or immune-mediated responses. The adrenal and pituitary glands may also be affected, with reports of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis. Furthermore, COVID-19 has implications for reproductive health, affecting menstrual cycles and fertility. Understanding these endocrine manifestations is crucial for the comprehensive management of COVID-19 patients, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary approaches in their care.", "label": 1}
