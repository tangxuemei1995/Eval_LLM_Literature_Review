{"grounding": "Heterogeneity in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is increasingly being recognized as one of the principal barriers to finding efficacious targeted therapies. The advent of multiple high-throughput biological data (“omics”), coupled with the widespread access to increased computational power, has led to the emergence of phenotyping in critical care. Phenotyping aims to use a multitude of data to identify homogenous subgroups within an otherwise heterogenous population. Increasingly, phenotyping schemas are being applied to sepsis and ARDS to increase understanding of these clinical conditions and identify potential therapies. Here we present a selective review of the biological phenotyping schemas applied to sepsis and ARDS. Further, we outline some of the challenges involved in translating these conceptual findings to bedside clinical decision-making tools.", "generated_text": "Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) represent complex, heterogeneous conditions with significant morbidity and mortality in critical care settings. The identification of distinct biological phenotypes and subphenotypes within these syndromes has emerged as a pivotal strategy for advancing precision medicine. This approach leverages comprehensive biological data, including genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles, to delineate patient subgroups with unique pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical outcomes. Such stratification not only enhances our understanding of the underlying biology but also facilitates the development of targeted therapies tailored to individual patient characteristics. This review synthesizes current evidence on biological phenotyping in sepsis and ARDS, highlighting its potential to revolutionize critical care by enabling more precise diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in these challenging conditions.", "label": 1}
