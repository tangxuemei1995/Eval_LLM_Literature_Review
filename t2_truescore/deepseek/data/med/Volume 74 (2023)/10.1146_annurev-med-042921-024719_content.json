{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell therapy has transformed the management of relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. Despite high overall response rates, relapse post CAR T treatment remains a clinical challenge. Loss of target antigen, specifically CD19, is one well-defined mechanism of disease relapse. The mechanism of CD19 loss and which patients are at higher risk of CD19 loss remain poorly understood. To overcome CD19 loss, CARs targeting multiple antigens are being tested in clinical trials. CD19/20 and CD19/22 bispecific CARs demonstrate cytotoxicity against CD19-negative cells in preclinical studies. These CARs have also shown efficacy, safety, and a relatively low rate of CD19-negative relapse in phase I trials. These small studies suggest that multispecific CAR T cells can deprive lymphomas of escape via antigen loss. However, the selection of an ideal target, the right CAR construct, and whether these multispecific CARs can induce long-term remissions are still under investigation.", "generated_text": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary approach in the treatment of lymphomas, offering hope where traditional therapies have failed. However, the efficacy of CAR T cells is often compromised by tumor escape mechanisms, notably antigen loss, which allows cancer cells to evade immune detection. This study explores the potential of multispecific CAR T cells, including bispecific and trispecific CAR constructs, to counteract this challenge. By targeting multiple tumor-associated antigens simultaneously, these advanced CAR T cells aim to reduce the likelihood of antigen escape, thereby enhancing the durability of therapeutic responses. Through a comprehensive review of preclinical and clinical data, we assess the design, efficacy, and safety profiles of multispecific CAR T cells in lymphoma treatment. Our findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cells represent a promising strategy to overcome antigen loss, potentially leading to more effective and long-lasting remissions in patients with refractory or relapsed lymphomas.", "label": 1}
