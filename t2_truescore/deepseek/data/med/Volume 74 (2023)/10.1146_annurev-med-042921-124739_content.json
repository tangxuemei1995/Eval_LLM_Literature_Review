{"grounding": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral pathogen in the transplant population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CMV prevention is paramount; however, selecting the best preventive strategy depends on many factors including donorâ€“recipient CMV serostatus, transplant-specific risks, antiviral toxicities and cost. Novel CMV therapeutics such as letermovir (LTV) are desperately needed to optimize CMV management. Uniquely among CMV antiviral therapies, LTV inhibits the viral terminase complex in the CMV DNA synthesis pathway and disrupts viral genome packaging. Further, it lacks side effects frequently associated with other CMV antiviral therapies and evades common mechanisms of resistance. LTV is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CMV prevention in adult CMV-seropositive hematopoietic cell transplant recipients but is increasingly applied off-label for prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes important concepts of CMV management in transplantation, with a specific focus on LTV pharmacology and clinical experience to date alongside future prospects for its application.", "generated_text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients, including those undergoing solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The introduction of letermovir, a novel antiviral agent, has marked a pivotal advancement in the prophylaxis and treatment of CMV in this vulnerable population. Letermovir inhibits the viral terminase complex, a mechanism distinct from traditional antiviral therapies, offering a new avenue for managing CMV with potentially reduced toxicity and resistance. This review synthesizes current evidence on the efficacy and safety of letermovir in preventing and treating CMV infections among transplant recipients. Clinical trials and real-world data highlight its role in significantly reducing the incidence of CMV reactivation and disease, particularly in HCT recipients, while also demonstrating a favorable safety profile. The integration of letermovir into CMV management protocols represents a promising strategy to improve outcomes in transplant medicine, underscoring the need for ongoing research to optimize its use across different transplant settings.", "label": 1}
