{"grounding": "Plant hormones are a group of small signaling molecules produced by plants at very low concentrations that have the ability to move and function at distal sites. Hormone homeostasis is critical to balance plant growth and development and is regulated at multiple levels, including hormone biosynthesis, catabolism, perception, and transduction. In addition, plants move hormones over short and long distances to regulate various developmental processes and responses to environmental factors. Transporters coordinate these movements, resulting in hormone maxima, gradients, and cellular and subcellular sinks. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of most of the characterized plant hormone transporters with respect to biochemical, physiological, and developmental activities. We further discuss the subcellular localizations of transporters, their substrate specificities, and the need for multiple transporters for the same hormone in the context of plant growth and development.", "generated_text": "Plant hormones, or phytohormones, play pivotal roles in regulating growth, development, and stress responses in plants. The precise localization and transport of these signaling molecules are crucial for maintaining hormone homeostasis and ensuring proper physiological functions. This review focuses on the transport mechanisms of key phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). We explore the roles of specific transporters and the molecular pathways involved in the directional movement of these hormones within plant tissues. Understanding the dynamics of hormone transport not only sheds light on the complex signaling networks in plants but also opens avenues for manipulating plant growth and stress responses through targeted hormone regulation. This synthesis of current knowledge highlights the importance of transport mechanisms in the spatial and temporal control of phytohormone action.", "label": 1}
