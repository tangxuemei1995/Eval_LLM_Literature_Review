{"grounding": "Plant cells accumulate small RNA molecules that regulate plant development, genome stability, and environmental responses. These small RNAs fall into three major classes based on their function and mechanisms of biogenesis—microRNAs, heterochromatic small interfering RNAs, and secondary small interfering RNAs—plus several other less well-characterized categories. Biogenesis of each small RNA class requires a pathway of factors, some specific to each pathway and others involved in multiple pathways. Diverse sequenced plant genomes, along with rapid developments in sequencing, imaging, and genetic transformation techniques, have enabled significant progress in understanding the biogenesis, functions, and evolution of plant small RNAs, including those that had been poorly characterized because they were absent or had low representation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we review recent findings about plant small RNAs and discuss our current understanding of their biogenesis mechanisms, targets, modes of action, mobility, and functions in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including economically important crops.", "generated_text": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of gene expression and genome stability in plants. This review focuses on the biogenesis, regulatory roles, and functions of major classes of plant sRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs), and mobile siRNAs. miRNAs are key regulators of plant development and stress responses, guiding the cleavage or translational repression of target mRNAs. siRNAs, derived from double-stranded RNA precursors, are involved in the defense against viruses and transposons, as well as in the regulation of endogenous genes. phasiRNAs, a subclass of siRNAs, are produced in a phased manner from long non-coding RNAs and play roles in plant development and stress responses. Mobile siRNAs, capable of moving between cells, contribute to the systemic regulation of gene expression and plant development. Understanding the complex networks of sRNA-mediated regulation offers insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth, development, and adaptation to environmental stresses.", "label": 1}
