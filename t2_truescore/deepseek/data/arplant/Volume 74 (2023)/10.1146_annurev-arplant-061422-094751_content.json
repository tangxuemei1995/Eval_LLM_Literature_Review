{"grounding": "Living structures constantly interact with the biotic and abiotic environment by sensing and responding via specialized functional parts. In other words, biological bodies embody highly functional machines and actuators. What are the signatures of engineering mechanisms in biology? In this review, we connect the dots in the literature to seek engineering principles in plant structures. We identify three thematic motifs—bilayer actuator, slender-bodied functional surface, and self-similarity—and provide an overview of their structure–function relationships. Unlike human-engineered machines and actuators, biological counterparts may appear suboptimal in design, loosely complying with physical theories or engineering principles. We postulate what factors may influence the evolution of functional morphology and anatomy to dissect and comprehend better the why behind the biological forms.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate engineering themes inherent in plant forms and functions, exploring the biomechanical principles that underpin their biological design. By examining the structure–function relationship, we uncover how plants utilize bilayer systems, slender body architectures, and self-similarity to optimize their survival and efficiency in diverse environments. The research highlights the sophisticated mechanisms through which plants distribute mechanical stresses, maximize resource acquisition, and minimize energy expenditure. Through a multidisciplinary approach, integrating concepts from engineering and biology, this paper sheds light on the evolutionary adaptations that have enabled plants to master the art of structural optimization. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of biological design principles, offering insights that could inspire advancements in biomimetic engineering and sustainable design.", "label": 1}
