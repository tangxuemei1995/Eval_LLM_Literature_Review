{"grounding": "There is intense interest in using genome editing technologies to domesticate wild plants, or accelerate the improvement of weakly domesticated crops, in de novo domestication. Here, we discuss promising genetic strategies, with a focus on plant development. Importantly, genome editing releases us from dependence on random mutagenesis or intraspecific diversity, allowing us to draw solutions more broadly from diversity. However, sparse understanding of the complex genetics of diversity limits innovation. Beyond genetics, we urge the ethical use of indigenous knowledge, indigenous plants, and ethnobotany. De novo domestication still requires conventional breeding by phenotypic selection, especially in the development of crops for diverse environments and cultures. Indeed, uniting genome editing with selective breeding could facilitate faster and better outcomes than either technology alone. Domestication is complex and incompletely understood, involving changes to many aspects of plant biology and human culture. Success in de novo domestication requires careful attention to history and collaboration across traditional boundaries.", "generated_text": "The advent of genome editing technologies has revolutionized the field of plant developmental genetics, offering unprecedented opportunities for the de novo domestication of wild plant species. This approach holds significant promise for addressing the challenges posed by climate change, enabling the rapid development of crops with enhanced resilience, nutritional value, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions. However, the power of genome editing in plant domestication is not without its perils. Ethical considerations, potential impacts on biodiversity, and the socio-economic implications of altering plant genomes necessitate a cautious approach. Drawing on insights from ethnobotany, this study explores the potential of genome editing for de novo domestication, while critically examining the associated risks and ethical dilemmas. By integrating cutting-edge genetic techniques with traditional knowledge, we propose a framework for responsible innovation in plant domestication that balances the urgent need for climate-resilient crops with the imperative to preserve ecological and cultural heritage.", "label": 1}
