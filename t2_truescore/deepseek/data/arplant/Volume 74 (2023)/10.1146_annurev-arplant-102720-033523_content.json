{"grounding": "The plant hormone auxin is certainly the most studied developmental regulator in plants. The many functions of auxin during development, from the embryo to the root and shoot construction, are mediated by an ever-growing collection of molecular regulators, with an overwhelming degree of both ubiquity and complexity that we are still far from fully understanding and that biological experiments alone cannot grasp. In this review, we discuss how bioinformatics and computational modeling approaches have helped in recent years to explore this complexity and to push the frontiers of our understanding of auxin biology. We focus on how analysis of massive amounts of genomic data and construction of computational models to simulate auxin-regulated processes at different scales have complemented wet experiments to increase the understanding of how auxin acts in the nucleus to regulate transcription and how auxin movement between cells regulates development at the tissular scale.", "generated_text": "The intricate role of auxin in plant development and evolution has been a focal point of botanical research for decades. This study leverages the power of bioinformatics and computational modeling to decode the complex auxin matrix, shedding light on auxin signaling and polar auxin transport mechanisms. By integrating vast datasets from genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses, we construct a comprehensive computational model that simulates auxin dynamics within plant cells and tissues. Our approach not only elucidates the molecular underpinnings of auxin-mediated developmental processes but also explores the evolutionary conservation of auxin pathways across diverse plant species. Furthermore, we employ synthetic biology techniques to validate our computational predictions, offering novel insights into the engineering of auxin signaling for agricultural and biotechnological applications. This research bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental biology, providing a robust framework for understanding and manipulating auxin biology in the era of precision agriculture.", "label": 0}
