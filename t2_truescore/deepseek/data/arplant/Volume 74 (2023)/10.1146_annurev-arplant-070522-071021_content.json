{"grounding": "Plant invasions, a byproduct of globalization, are increasing worldwide. Because of their ecological and economic impacts, considerable efforts have been made to understand and predict the success of non-native plants. Numerous frameworks, hypotheses, and theories have been advanced to conceptualize the interactions of multiple drivers and context dependence of invasion success with the aim of achieving robust explanations with predictive power. We review these efforts from a community-level perspective rather than a biogeographical one, focusing on terrestrial systems, and explore the roles of intrinsic plant properties in determining species invasiveness, as well as the effects of biotic and abiotic conditions in mediating ecosystem invasibility (or resistance) and ecological and evolutionary processes. We also consider the fundamental influences of human-induced changes at scales ranging from local to global in triggering, promoting, and sustaining plant invasions and discuss how these changes could alter future invasion trajectories.", "generated_text": "Invasive plants, often referred to as alien or non-native species, have become a significant concern for ecosystems worldwide due to their ability to outcompete native flora and alter ecosystem functions. This study explores the underlying factors contributing to the success of invasive plants, focusing on biotic interactions, competition, ecosystem invasibility, and functional traits. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key characteristics that enhance invasiveness, such as rapid growth rates, high reproductive output, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, we examine how invasive plants exploit weaknesses in native ecosystems, including disturbances and the absence of natural predators, to establish and proliferate. Our findings suggest that a combination of intrinsic plant traits and extrinsic environmental factors drives the invasiveness of non-native plants. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity and ecosystem health.", "label": 1}
