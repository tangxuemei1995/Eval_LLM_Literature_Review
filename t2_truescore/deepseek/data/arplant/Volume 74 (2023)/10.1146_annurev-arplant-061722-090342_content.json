{"grounding": "Plant roots associate with diverse microbes (including bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists, and viruses) collectively called the root-associated microbiome. Among them, mycorrhizal fungi colonize host roots and improve their access to nutrients, usually phosphorus and nitrogen. In exchange, plants deliver photosynthetic carbon to the colonizing fungi. This nutrient exchange affects key soil processes, the carbon cycle, and plant health and therefore has a strong influence on the plant and microbe ecosystems. The framework of nutrient exchange and regulation between host plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has recently been established. The local and systemic regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by plant nutrient status and the autoregulation of mycorrhizae are strategies by which plants maintain a stabilizing free-market symbiosis. A better understanding of the synergistic effects between mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizosphere microorganisms is an essential precondition for their use as biofertilizers and bioprotectors for sustainable agriculture and forestry management.", "generated_text": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis represents a fundamental interaction between fungi and plant roots, playing a pivotal role in plant growth, nutrient exchange, and stress adaptation. This symbiotic relationship enhances the plant's ability to absorb water and essential nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, through an extensive common mycorrhizal network (CMN). Furthermore, mycorrhizae helper bacteria (MHB) significantly contribute to the establishment and efficiency of this symbiosis, promoting plant health and resilience against environmental stresses. The autoregulation of mycorrhizae ensures a balanced symbiotic interaction, optimizing plant growth and stress resistance. Recent advances in molecular biology have begun to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying these processes, offering insights into the complex interplay between mycorrhizal fungi and their plant hosts. This review synthesizes current knowledge on mycorrhizal symbiosis, from genetic interactions to ecosystem-level impacts, highlighting its critical role in sustainable agriculture and ecosystem functioning.", "label": 1}
