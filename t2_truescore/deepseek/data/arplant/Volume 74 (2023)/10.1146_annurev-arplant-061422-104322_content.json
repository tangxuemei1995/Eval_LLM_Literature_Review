{"grounding": "Despite the numerous advances made in our understanding of the physiology and molecular genetics of salinity tolerance, there have been relatively few applications of these to improve the salt tolerance of crops. The most significant advances have historically utilized intraspecific variation, introgression of traits from close crop wild relatives, or, less frequently, introgression from more distant relatives. Advanced lines often fail due to difficulties in the introgression or tracking of traits or due to yield penalties associated with the alleles in nonsaline environments. However, the greatest limitation is that salinity is not a primary trait for breeders. We must close the gap between research and delivery, especially for farmers who have precious few alternatives. These efforts should include a reassessment of old techniques such as grafting current crops with salt-tolerant hybrid rootstocks. Alternatively, future crops can be produced via domestication of salt-tolerant wild speciesâ€”an approach that is now feasible in our lifetime.", "generated_text": "Addressing the escalating challenge of soil salinity is imperative for ensuring global food security. This paper explores the potential of salt-tolerant crops as a sustainable solution to enhance crop yield in saline environments. By leveraging crop wild relatives (CWRs) and advanced breeding techniques, including neodomestication and genetic modification, we can develop crops that thrive under saline conditions. The integration of traditional and modern biotechnological approaches offers a promising pathway to unlock the genetic potential of CWRs, thereby facilitating the development of salt-tolerant varieties. This study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary research in accelerating the domestication of novel crops and the genetic enhancement of existing ones to withstand salinity stress. The findings advocate for a concerted effort to harness the untapped genetic diversity of CWRs, coupled with innovative breeding strategies, to deliver salt-tolerant crops that can significantly contribute to food security in the face of increasing soil salinity worldwide.", "label": 0}
