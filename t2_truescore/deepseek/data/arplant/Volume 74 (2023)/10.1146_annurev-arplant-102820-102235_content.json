{"grounding": "Temperature is a key environmental cue that influences the distribution and behavior of plants globally. Understanding how plants sense temperature and integrate this information into their development is important to determine how plants adapt to climate change and to apply this knowledge to the breeding of climate-resilient crops. The mechanisms of temperature perception in eukaryotes are only just beginning to be understood, with multiple molecular phenomena with inherent temperature dependencies, such as RNA melting, phytochrome dark reversion, and protein phase change, being exploited by nature to create thermosensory signaling networks. Here, we review recent progress in understanding how temperature sensing in four major pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana occurs: vernalization, cold stress, thermomorphogenesis, and heat stress. We discuss outstanding questions in the field and the importance of these mechanisms in the context of breeding climate-resilient crops.", "generated_text": "Temperature sensing in plants is a critical mechanism for survival and adaptation to environmental changes. This study focuses on the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana to explore the molecular basis of thermosensing and its role in plant responses to heat and cold stress. Through a comprehensive analysis of thermosensors, we elucidate the pathways that lead to thermomorphogenesis, a process that allows plants to adjust their growth and development in response to temperature variations. Our findings highlight the importance of specific proteins and signaling cascades in mediating temperature perception and the subsequent physiological adaptations. This research provides insights into the complex interplay between environmental temperature and plant biology, offering potential strategies for enhancing crop resilience to climate change-induced temperature fluctuations.", "label": 1}
