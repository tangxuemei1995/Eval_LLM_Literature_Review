{"grounding": "Since the discovery of the first ribonucleic acid (RNA) modifications in transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), scientists have been on a quest to decipher the identities and functions of RNA modifications in biological systems. The last decade has seen monumental growth in the number of studies that have characterized and assessed the functionalities of RNA modifications in the field of plant biology. Owing to these studies, we now categorize RNA modifications based on their chemical nature and the RNA on which they are found, as well as the array of proteins that are involved in the processes that add, read, and remove them from an RNA molecule. Beyond their identity, another key piece of the puzzle is the functional significance of the various types of RNA modifications. Here, we shed light on recent studies that help establish our current understanding of the diversity of RNA modifications found in plant transcriptomes and the functions they play at both the molecular (e.g., RNA stability, translation, and transport) and organismal (e.g., stress response and development) levels. Finally, we consider the key research questions related to plant gene expression and biology in general and highlight developments in various technologies that are driving our insights forward in this research area.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and have been extensively studied across various organisms. In plants, these modifications, including m6A, m5C, and others on mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA, contribute significantly to the functional diversity of RNA molecules. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diversity and functions of RNA modifications in plants, highlighting their roles in plant development, stress responses, and adaptation to environmental changes. We explore the mechanisms by which these modifications influence RNA stability, translation efficiency, and the regulation of gene expression, thereby affecting plant growth and stress tolerance. Despite recent advances, the functional implications of many RNA modifications in plants remain poorly understood. This review identifies key gaps in our understanding and suggests future research directions, including the exploration of novel RNA modifications, their regulatory mechanisms, and their potential applications in crop improvement. By integrating findings from molecular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on plant RNA modifications and to inspire further investigation into this fascinating area of plant biology.", "label": 1}
