{"grounding": "Parasitic plants use a special organ, the haustorium, to attach to and penetrate host tissues, forming phloem and/or xylem fusion with the host vascular systems. Across this haustoriumâ€“host interface, not only water and nutrients are extracted from the host by the parasitic plant, but also secondary metabolites, messenger RNAs, noncoding RNAs, proteins, and systemic signals are transported between the parasite and host and even among different hosts connected by a parasite. Furthermore, mycorrhizal fungi can form common mycelial networks (CMNs) that simultaneously interconnect multiple plants. Increasing lines of evidence suggest that CMNs can function as conduits, transferring stress-related systemic signals between plants. Between-plant signaling mediated by haustoria and CMNs likely has a profound impact on plant interactions with other organisms and adaptation to environmental factors. Here, we summarize the findings regarding between-plant transfer of biomolecules and systemic signals and the current understanding of the physiological and ecological implications of between-plant signaling.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate mechanisms of between-plant signaling facilitated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) through common mycelial networks (CMNs). Focusing on the role of these networks in interplant communication, we investigate how systemic signaling influences plant interactions, including those with parasitic plants. Utilizing a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we highlight the pivotal role of AMF in mediating resource allocation, defense responses, and stress signaling among connected plants. Our findings suggest that CMNs not only enhance plant resilience to environmental stressors but also play a crucial role in the ecological dynamics of plant communities, including the regulation of parasitic plant infestations. This research underscores the importance of understanding the complex interactions within plant-fungal networks for advancing our knowledge of plant ecology and developing sustainable agricultural practices.", "label": 1}
