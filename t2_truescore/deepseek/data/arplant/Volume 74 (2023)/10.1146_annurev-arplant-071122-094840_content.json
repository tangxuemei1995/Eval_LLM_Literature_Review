{"grounding": "Optogenetics is a technique employing natural or genetically engineered photoreceptors in transgene organisms to manipulate biological activities with light. Light can be turned on or off, and adjusting its intensity and duration allows optogenetic fine-tuning of cellular processes in a noninvasive and spatiotemporally resolved manner. Since the introduction of Channelrhodopsin-2 and phytochrome-based switches nearly 20 years ago, optogenetic tools have been applied in a variety of model organisms with enormous success, but rarely in plants. For a long time, the dependence of plant growth on light and the absence of retinal, the rhodopsin chromophore, prevented the establishment of plant optogenetics until recent progress overcame these difficulties. We summarize the recent results of work in the field to control plant growth and cellular motion via green lightâ€“gated ion channels and present successful applications to light-control gene expression with single or combined photoswitches in plants. Furthermore, we highlight the technical requirements and options for future plant optogenetic research.", "generated_text": "Optogenetics, a revolutionary technique that combines optics and genetics to control cellular processes with light, has recently expanded its application into plant biology. This approach leverages the natural light sensitivity of photoreceptors and engineered rhodopsins to manipulate plant physiological and developmental processes with unprecedented precision. By integrating optogenetic tools such as biosensors and optoswitches, researchers can now monitor and control gene expression, ion fluxes, and signaling pathways in real-time within plant cells. This review highlights the latest advancements in plant optogenetics, focusing on the development and application of light-sensitive proteins and their role in understanding complex plant behaviors. The potential of optogenetics to unravel the intricacies of plant responses to environmental stimuli and to engineer crops with enhanced traits is also discussed. As this field evolves, it promises to provide deeper insights into plant biology and to offer novel strategies for agricultural innovation.", "label": 1}
