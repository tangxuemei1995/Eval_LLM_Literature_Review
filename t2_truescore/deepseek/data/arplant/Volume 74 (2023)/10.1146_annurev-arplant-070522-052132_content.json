{"grounding": "Proteins are workhorses in the cell; they form stable and more often dynamic, transient protein–protein interactions, assemblies, and networks and have an intimate interplay with DNA and RNA. These network interactions underlie fundamental biological processes and play essential roles in cellular function. The proximity-dependent biotinylation labeling approach combined with mass spectrometry (PL-MS) has recently emerged as a powerful technique to dissect the complex cellular network at the molecular level. In PL-MS, by fusing a genetically encoded proximity-labeling (PL) enzyme to a protein or a localization signal peptide, the enzyme is targeted to a protein complex of interest or to an organelle, allowing labeling of proximity proteins within a zoom radius. These biotinylated proteins can then be captured by streptavidin beads and identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. Recently engineered PL enzymes such as TurboID have a much-improved enzymatic activity, enabling spatiotemporal mapping with a dramatically increased signal-to-noise ratio. PL-MS has revolutionized the way we perform proteomics by overcoming several hurdles imposed by traditional technology, such as biochemical fractionation and affinity purification mass spectrometry. In this review, we focus on biotin ligase–based PL-MS applications that have been, or are likely to be, adopted by the plant field. We discuss the experimental designs and review the different choices for engineered biotin ligases, enrichment, and quantification strategies. Lastly, we review the validation and discuss future perspectives.", "generated_text": "Proximity labeling has emerged as a powerful technique for mapping protein–protein and protein–nucleotide interactions within the complex cellular environments of plants. This method leverages the spatial proximity of molecules to label interacting partners in vivo, providing insights into the dynamic subcellular and cell type–specific proteomes. By employing enzymes such as biotin ligases or peroxidases, proximity labeling facilitates the covalent tagging of proteins and nucleotides in close vicinity, enabling their subsequent identification and quantification through mass spectrometry. This approach has been instrumental in uncovering novel interactions and elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying plant development, stress responses, and signaling pathways. Recent advancements in proximity labeling techniques have enhanced their specificity, efficiency, and applicability across diverse plant species and tissues. Furthermore, the integration of proximity labeling with quantitative proteomics has allowed for the precise measurement of interaction dynamics under various physiological conditions. This review highlights the principles, methodologies, and applications of proximity labeling in plant research, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize our understanding of plant biology at the molecular level. The challenges and future directions of this technology are also discussed, underscoring its promise for advancing plant science and biotechnology.", "label": 1}
