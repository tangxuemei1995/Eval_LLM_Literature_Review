{"grounding": "The establishment, maintenance, and removal of epigenetic modifications provide an additional layer of regulation, beyond genetically encoded factors, by which plants can control developmental processes and adapt to the environment. Epigenetic inheritance, while historically referring to information not encoded in the DNA sequence that is inherited between generations, can also refer to epigenetic modifications that are maintained within an individual but are reset between generations. Both types of epigenetic inheritance occur in plants, and the functions and mechanisms distinguishing the two are of great interest to the field. Here, we discuss examples of epigenetic dynamics and maintenance during selected stages of growth and development and their functional consequences. Epigenetic states are also dynamic in response to stress, with consequences for transposable element regulation. How epigenetic resetting between generations occurs during normal development and in response to stress is an emerging area of research.", "generated_text": "Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications and DNA methylation, play pivotal roles in regulating gene expression during plant development and in response to environmental stimuli. This study explores the intricate interplay between these epigenetic modifications and their impact on developmental processes, with a particular focus on the regulation of transposable elements. Furthermore, we investigate the capacity of plants to retain epigenetic memory, especially in the context of heat stress responses, which could provide a basis for enhanced stress resilience. By integrating findings from recent studies, we aim to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in epigenetic regulation and memory, offering insights into how plants adapt to changing environments. This research underscores the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in plant biology and their potential applications in agriculture for improving crop tolerance to abiotic stresses.", "label": 1}
