{"grounding": "\ncis-Regulatory elements encode the genomic blueprints that ensure the proper spatiotemporal patterning of gene expression necessary for appropriate development and responses to the environment. Accumulating evidence implicates changes to gene expression as a major source of phenotypic novelty in eukaryotes, including acute phenotypes such as disease and cancer in mammals. Moreover, genetic and epigenetic variation affecting cis-regulatory sequences over longer evolutionary timescales has become a recurring theme in studies of morphological divergence and local adaptation. Here, we discuss the functions of and methods used to identify various classes of cis-regulatory elements, as well as their role in plant development and response to the environment. We highlight opportunities to exploit cis-regulatory variants underlying plant development and environmental responses for crop improvement efforts. Although a comprehensive understanding of cis-regulatory mechanisms in plants has lagged behind that in animals, we showcase several breakthrough findings that have profoundly influenced plant biology and shaped the overall understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes.", "generated_text": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating gene expression, playing a crucial role in plant development, adaptation, and evolution. These non-coding DNA sequences, through their interaction with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, modulate the transcriptional activity of genes in response to internal and external stimuli. This review delves into the mechanisms by which CREs influence plant development, from embryogenesis to organogenesis, and their contribution to the plant's ability to adapt to environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, and temperature extremes. Furthermore, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of CREs, highlighting their role in the diversification of plant species and the emergence of novel traits. By integrating recent findings from genomics, epigenomics, and functional studies, this abstract underscores the significance of CREs in the transcriptional regulation underlying plant development, stress responses, and evolutionary innovation, offering insights into the molecular basis of plant resilience and adaptability.", "label": 1}
