{"grounding": "Recurring patterns are an integral part of life on Earth. Through evolution or breeding, plants have acquired systems that coordinate with the cyclic patterns driven by Earth's movement through space. The biosystem responses to these physical rhythms result in biological cycles of daily and seasonal activity that feed back into the physical cycles. Signaling networks to coordinate growth and molecular activities with these persistent cycles have been integrated into plant biochemistry. The plant circadian clock is the coordinator of this complex, multiscale, temporal schedule. However, we have detailed knowledge of the circadian clock components and functions in only a few species under controlled conditions. We are just beginning to understand how the clock functions in real-world conditions. This review examines what we know about the circadian clock in diverse plant species, the challenges with extrapolating data from controlled environments, and the need to anticipate how plants will respond to climate change.", "generated_text": "Circadian rhythms, the endogenous biological clocks that orchestrate physiological and behavioral processes in a roughly 24-hour cycle, are fundamental to the adaptation and survival of organisms. These rhythms are intricately linked with environmental cues, primarily light and temperature, which are undergoing significant alterations due to climate change. This review explores the intersection of circadian rhythms with changing environments, focusing on the impact of climate change on the synchronization of these biological clocks. We delve into the signaling networks that underlie circadian regulation and their role in environmental adaptation. The discussion highlights the potential consequences of disrupted circadian rhythms on ecosystems and biodiversity, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of these mechanisms to predict and mitigate the effects of climate change. By integrating findings from molecular biology, ecology, and climate science, this paper aims to shed light on the complex interplay between circadian rhythms and environmental changes, offering insights into the resilience and adaptability of life on Earth.", "label": 1}
