{"grounding": "Plants’ ability to chemically modify core structures of specialized metabolites is the main reason why the plant kingdom contains such a wide and rich array of diverse compounds. One of the most important types of chemical modifications of small molecules is the addition of an acyl moiety to produce esters and amides. Large-scale phylogenomics analyses have shown that the enzymes that perform acyl transfer reactions on the myriad small molecules synthesized by plants belong to only a few gene families. This review is focused on describing the biochemistry, evolutionary origins, and chemical ecology implications of one of these families—the BAHD acyltransferases. The growth of advanced metabolomic studies coupled with next-generation sequencing of diverse plant species has confirmed that the BAHD family plays critical roles in modifying nearly all known classes of specialized metabolites. The current and future outlook for research on BAHDs includes expanding their roles in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.", "generated_text": "The BAHD acyltransferase gene family plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of a wide array of secondary metabolites in plants, including hydroxycinnamoyl esters, amides, and acylsugars. These compounds are integral to plant defense mechanisms, structural integrity, and interaction with the environment. This study delves into the evolutionary trajectory of the BAHD family across land plants, highlighting the expansion and functional diversification of these enzymes. Through phylogenetic analysis and functional characterization, we uncover the critical roles of hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) and related enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of lignin and other phenolic compounds. Furthermore, we explore the biochemical versatility of BAHD acyltransferases in catalyzing the formation of esters and amides, contributing to the vast chemical diversity observed in plants. Our findings underscore the significance of the BAHD gene family in plant adaptation and evolution, offering insights into their potential applications in agriculture and biotechnology.", "label": 1}
