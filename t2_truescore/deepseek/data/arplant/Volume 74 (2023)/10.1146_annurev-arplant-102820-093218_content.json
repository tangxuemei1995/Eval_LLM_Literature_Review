{"grounding": "SWITCH deficient SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) class chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to facilitate access of proteins to the genomic DNA for transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Uniquely, SWI/SNF CRCs can both slide the histone octamer along the DNA or eject it from the DNA. Given their ability to change the chromatin status quo, SWI/SNF remodelers are critical for cell fate reprogramming with pioneer and other transcription factors, for responses to environmental challenges, and for disease prevention. Recent cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry approaches have uncovered different subtypes of SWI/SNF complexes with unique properties and functions. At the same time, tethering or rapid depletion and inactivation of SWI/SNF have provided novel insight into SWI/SNF requirements for enhancer activity and into balancing chromatin compaction and accessibility in concert with Polycomb complexes. Given their importance, SWI/SNF recruitment to genomic locations by transcription factors and their biochemical activity is tightly controlled. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of SWI/SNF CRCs in animals and plants and discusses the multiple nuclear and biological roles of SWI/SNF CRCs and how SWI/SNF activity is altered by complex subunit composition, posttranslational modifications, and the chromatin context to support proper development and response to extrinsic cues.", "generated_text": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by altering nucleosome positioning and chromatin structure, thereby facilitating access to DNA for transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins. These complexes are powered by ATPases that utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, enabling the sliding, ejection, or restructuring of nucleosomes. This review focuses on the diverse functions of SWI/SNF ATPases in various biological processes, including development and stimulus response, highlighting their importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. By integrating findings from recent studies, we discuss how SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers interact with transcription factors to modulate gene expression programs essential for cell differentiation, proliferation, and adaptation to stress. Furthermore, we explore the implications of SWI/SNF complex mutations in human diseases, underscoring the critical role of these chromatin remodelers in health and disease. This comprehensive overview aims to provide insights into the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF complexes regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with chromatin remodeling defects.", "label": 1}
