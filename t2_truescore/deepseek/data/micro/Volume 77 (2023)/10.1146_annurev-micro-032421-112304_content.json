{"grounding": "Genetic manipulation is necessary to interrogate the functions of microbes in their environments, such as the human gut microbiome. Yet, the vast majority of human gut microbiome species are not genetically tractable. Here, we review the hurdles to seizing genetic control of more species. We address the barriers preventing the application of genetic techniques to gut microbes and report on genetic systems currently under development. While methods aimed at genetically transforming many species simultaneously in situ show promise, they are unable to overcome many of the same challenges that exist for individual microbes. Unless a major conceptual breakthrough emerges, the genetic tractability of the microbiome will remain an arduous task. Increasing the list of genetically tractable organisms from the human gut remains one of the highest priorities for microbiome research and will provide the foundation for microbiome engineering.", "generated_text": "The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, yet the genetic manipulation of its constituent microbes remains a significant challenge. This study focuses on expanding the repertoire of genetically tractable members within the human gut microbiome, aiming to enhance our understanding and control over microbial communities for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. By leveraging advanced genetic engineering tools and techniques, we identify and characterize novel model organisms that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Our findings reveal a diverse set of microbes that can be engineered to express or repress specific genes, offering new avenues for microbiome engineering. This research not only broadens the scope of genetically tractable microbes but also paves the way for targeted interventions in microbiome-associated diseases, highlighting the potential of microbiome engineering in advancing human health and disease management.", "label": 0}
