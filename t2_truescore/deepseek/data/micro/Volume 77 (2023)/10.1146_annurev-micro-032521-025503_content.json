{"grounding": "Two of the most fascinating bacterial nanomachines—the broadly disseminated rotary flagellum at the heart of cellular motility and the eukaryotic cell–puncturing injectisome essential to specific pathogenic species—utilize at their core a conserved export machinery called the type III secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS not only secretes the components that self-assemble into their extracellular appendages but also, in the case of the injectisome, subsequently directly translocates modulating effector proteins from the bacterial cell into the infected host. The injectisome is thought to have evolved from the flagellum as a minimal secretory system lacking motility, with the subsequent acquisition of additional components tailored to its specialized role in manipulating eukaryotic hosts for pathogenic advantage. Both nanomachines have long been the focus of intense interest, but advances in structural and functional understanding have taken a significant step forward since 2015, facilitated by the revolutionary advances in cryo-electron microscopy technologies. With several seminal structures of each nanomachine now captured, we review here the molecular similarities and differences that underlie their diverse functions.", "generated_text": "Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) are sophisticated molecular machines employed by bacteria for the delivery of effector proteins into host cells, playing pivotal roles in bacterial pathogenesis and symbiosis. This study delves into the structural intricacies of T3SS within the bacterial flagellum and injectisome, utilizing cutting-edge cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques. Our findings reveal the conserved architecture and dynamic mechanisms underlying these systems, highlighting the remarkable adaptability of T3SS in facilitating bacterial motility and virulence. Through high-resolution imaging, we uncover novel structural features and conformational changes that occur during the secretion process, offering insights into the molecular basis of T3SS function. This research not only advances our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis but also opens new avenues for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections.", "label": 0}
