{"grounding": "The gut microbiome is a dense and metabolically active consortium of microorganisms and viruses located in the lower gastrointestinal tract of the human body. Bacteria and their viruses (phages) are the most abundant members of the gut microbiome. Investigating their biology and the interplay between the two is important if we are to understand their roles in human health and disease. In this review, we summarize recent advances in resolving the taxonomic structure and ecological functions of the complex community of phages in the human gutâ€”the gut phageome. We discuss how age, diet, and geography can all have a significant impact on phageome composition. We note that alterations to the gut phageome have been observed in several diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer, and we evaluate whether these phageome changes can directly or indirectly contribute to disease etiology and pathogenesis. We also highlight how lack of standardization in studying the gut phageome has contributed to variation in reported results.", "generated_text": "The human gut phageome, comprising the collective bacteriophage populations within the gut microbiome, plays a pivotal role in maintaining gut health and influencing disease states. This review explores the factors contributing to the variation of the gut phageome, including diet, age, geography, and antibiotic usage. Bacteriophages, as key regulators of bacterial populations, impact the gut microbiome's composition and function, thereby affecting host health. The interplay between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts can lead to dynamic shifts in the gut virome, with implications for both health and disease. Understanding the factors that drive these variations is crucial for developing targeted therapies and interventions aimed at modulating the gut phageome to promote health or treat disease. This synthesis of current research highlights the complexity of the gut phageome and underscores the need for further studies to unravel the intricate relationships between bacteriophages, the gut microbiome, and human health.", "label": 1}
