{"grounding": "Apicomplexan parasites constitute more than 6,000 species infecting a wide range of hosts. These include important pathogens such as those causing malaria and toxoplasmosis. Their evolutionary emergence coincided with the dawn of animals. Mitochondrial genomes of apicomplexan parasites have undergone dramatic reduction in their coding capacity, with genes for only three proteins and ribosomal RNA genes present in scrambled fragments originating from both strands. Different branches of the apicomplexans have undergone rearrangements of these genes, with Toxoplasma having massive variations in gene arrangements spread over multiple copies. The vast evolutionary distance between the parasite and the host mitochondria has been exploited for the development of antiparasitic drugs, especially those used to treat malaria, wherein inhibition of the parasite mitochondrial respiratory chain is selectively targeted with little toxicity to the host mitochondria. We describe additional unique characteristics of the parasite mitochondria that are being investigated and provide greater insights into these deep-branching eukaryotic pathogens.", "generated_text": "Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, exhibit unique mitochondrial properties that distinguish them from their host organisms. These Myzozoa possess a highly reduced mitochondrial genome and rely on a streamlined electron transport chain (ETC) for energy production. Notably, the ATP synthase complex in these parasites has evolved distinct structural and functional characteristics, which are crucial for their survival and proliferation. The ETC components, including cytochrome bc1 complex and alternative oxidase, present potential targets for antiparasitic drug development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these unique mitochondrial features not only sheds light on the evolutionary adaptations of Apicomplexa but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the peculiarities of Apicomplexan mitochondria, focusing on their ATP synthase and electron transport complexes, and discusses the implications for designing novel antiparasitic strategies.", "label": 1}
