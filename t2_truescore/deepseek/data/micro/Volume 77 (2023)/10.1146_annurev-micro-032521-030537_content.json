{"grounding": "\nRalstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) strains are devastating plant pathogens distributed worldwide. The primary cell density–dependent gene expression system in RSSC strains is phc quorum sensing (QS). It regulates the expression of about 30% of all genes, including those related to cellular activity, primary and secondary metabolism, pathogenicity, and more. The phc regulatory elements encoded by the phcBSRQ operon and phcA gene play vital roles. RSSC strains use methyl 3-hydroxymyristate (3-OH MAME) or methyl 3-hydroxypalmitate (3-OH PAME) as the QS signal. Each type of RSSC strain has specificity in generating and receiving its QS signal, but their signaling pathways might not differ significantly. In this review, I describe the genetic and biochemical factors involved in QS signal input and the regulatory network and summarize control of the phc QS system, new cell–cell communications, and QS-dependent interactions with soil fungi.", "generated_text": "The phc quorum-sensing system plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pathogenicity and virulence in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex, which includes Ralstonia solanacearum and Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum. This cell–cell communication mechanism enables these phytopathogenic bacteria to coordinate gene expression in response to population density, facilitating the colonization and infection of host plants. The phc system modulates the expression of various virulence factors, including extracellular polysaccharides, motility, and type III secretion system effectors, crucial for bacterial wilt disease development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the phc quorum-sensing system offers insights into the complex interplay between bacterial pathogens and their plant hosts, providing potential targets for novel disease management strategies. This review highlights recent advances in the study of the phc system, emphasizing its significance in the pathogenicity of the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex and its implications for controlling bacterial wilt diseases.", "label": 1}
