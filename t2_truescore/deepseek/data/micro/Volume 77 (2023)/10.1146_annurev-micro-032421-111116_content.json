{"grounding": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are present in all gram-negative bacteria and mediate energy-dependent uptake of molecules that are too scarce or large to be taken up efficiently by outer membrane (OM) diffusion channels. This process requires energy that is derived from the proton motive force and delivered to TBDTs by the TonB-ExbBD motor complex in the inner membrane. Together with the need to preserve the OM permeability barrier, this has led to an extremely complex and fascinating transport mechanism for which the fundamentals, despite decades of research, are still unclear. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the transport mechanism of TBDTs, their potential role in the delivery of novel antibiotics, and the important contributions made by TBDT-associated (lipo)proteins.", "generated_text": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are a critical component of the bacterial outer membrane, facilitating the active transport of essential nutrients and siderophores. These transporters are characterized by their Î²-barrel structure, which spans the outer membrane, and their reliance on the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex for energy transduction. This review explores the structural and functional mechanisms of TBDTs, highlighting their role in nutrient acquisition and their potential as targets for novel therapeutic strategies, including the development of 'Trojan horse' antibiotics. Additionally, we examine the unique adaptations of TBDTs in Bacteroidetes, a phylum known for its diverse and complex polysaccharide utilization systems. Understanding the intricacies of TonB-dependent transport not only sheds light on bacterial physiology but also opens avenues for combating antibiotic resistance through innovative drug design.", "label": 1}
