{"grounding": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is the physiological process that enables the reduction or oxidation of molecules and minerals beyond the surface of a microbial cell. The first bacteria characterized with this capability were Shewanella and Geobacter, both reported to couple their growth to the reduction of iron or manganese oxide minerals located extracellularly. A key difference between EET and nearly every other respiratory activity on Earth is the need to transfer electrons beyond the cell membrane. The past decade has resolved how well-conserved strategies conduct electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface. However, recent data suggest a much wider and less well understood collection of mechanisms enabling electron transfer to distant acceptors. This review reflects the current state of knowledge from Shewanella and Geobacter, specifically focusing on transfer across the outer membrane and beyondâ€”an activity that enables reduction of highly variable minerals, electrodes, and even other organisms.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate mechanisms of extracellular electron transfer (EET) in electroactive bacteria, specifically focusing on Shewanella and Geobacter species. These microorganisms are renowned for their ability to transfer electrons beyond their outer membrane to external acceptors, a process pivotal for bioelectrochemical systems and environmental bioremediation. Central to this process are multiheme cytochromes and electron shuttles, which facilitate electron transport across the cell envelope to insoluble substrates. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we explore the structural and functional aspects of these cytochromes, alongside the role of soluble electron shuttles in enhancing EET efficiency. Our findings highlight the evolutionary adaptations that enable these bacteria to thrive in diverse environments, from metal-rich sediments to bioelectrochemical reactors. This research underscores the potential of harnessing EET mechanisms for sustainable energy production and environmental cleanup, offering insights into the optimization of bioelectrochemical systems for future applications.", "label": 1}
