{"grounding": "Fungal-mediated disease progression and antifungal drug efficacy are significantly impacted by the dynamic infection microenvironment. At the site of infection, oxygen often becomes limiting and induces a hypoxia response in both the fungal pathogen and host cells. The fungal hypoxia response impacts several important aspects of fungal biology that contribute to pathogenesis, virulence, antifungal drug susceptibility, and ultimately infection outcomes. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the hypoxia response in the most common human fungal pathogens, discuss potential therapeutic opportunities, and highlight important areas for future research.", "generated_text": "Recent studies have significantly advanced our understanding of how human fungal pathogens respond to hypoxia, a condition of low oxygen availability, during disease progression. This response is crucial for fungal survival and virulence in host tissues, where oxygen levels are often limited. Research has highlighted the role of hypoxia in modulating fungal pathogenicity, including the regulation of genes involved in virulence and the adaptation to host immune responses. Furthermore, insights into the hypoxia response mechanisms have opened new avenues for the development of antifungal drugs, targeting the unique adaptations of fungi to low oxygen environments, thereby offering promising strategies to combat fungal infections.", "label": 1}
