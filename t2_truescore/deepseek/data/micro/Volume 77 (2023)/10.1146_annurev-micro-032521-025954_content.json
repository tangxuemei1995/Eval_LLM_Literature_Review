{"grounding": "Bacteria are single-celled organisms that carry a comparatively small set of genetic information, typically consisting of a few thousand genes that can be selectively activated or repressed in an energy-efficient manner and transcribed to encode various biological functions in accordance with environmental changes. Research over the last few decades has uncovered various ingenious molecular mechanisms that allow bacterial pathogens to sense and respond to different environmental cues or signals to activate or suppress the expression of specific genes in order to suppress host defenses and establish infections. In the setting of infection, pathogenic bacteria have evolved various intelligent mechanisms to reprogram their virulence to adapt to environmental changes and maintain a dominant advantage over host and microbial competitors in new niches. This review summarizes the bacterial virulence programming mechanisms that enable pathogens to switch from acute to chronic infection, from local to systemic infection, and from infection to colonization. It also discusses the implications of these findings for the development of new strategies to combat bacterial infections.", "generated_text": "Bacterial pathogens exhibit remarkable adaptability in modulating their virulence in response to environmental cues, a process known as virulence reprogramming. This study delves into the intricate mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, focusing on the roles of two-component systems (TCS), quorum sensing (QS), interkingdom cell–cell communication, and cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling. TCS serve as pivotal sensors and regulators, enabling bacteria to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings by altering gene expression. QS facilitates population density-dependent regulation of virulence factors, ensuring coordinated behavior among bacterial communities. Interkingdom cell–cell communication extends this regulatory network, allowing pathogens to perceive and react to signals from host organisms, thereby fine-tuning their virulence strategies. Furthermore, c-di-GMP emerges as a crucial second messenger, integrating various environmental signals to modulate biofilm formation, motility, and virulence gene expression. Through a comprehensive analysis of these mechanisms, this research sheds light on the sophisticated regulatory networks that govern bacterial virulence reprogramming, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for combating bacterial infections.", "label": 1}
