{"grounding": "Fungal species have dynamic genomes and often exhibit genomic plasticity in response to stress. This genome plasticity often comes with phenotypic consequences that affect fitness and resistance to stress. Fungal pathogens exhibit genome plasticity in both clinical and agricultural settings and often during adaptation to antifungal drugs, posing significant challenges to human health. Therefore, it is important to understand the rates, mechanisms, and impact of large genomic changes. This review addresses the prevalence of polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation across diverse fungal species, with special attention to prominent fungal pathogens and model species. We also explore the relationship between environmental stress and rates of genomic changes and highlight the mechanisms underlying genotypic and phenotypic changes. A comprehensive understanding of these dynamic fungal genomes is needed to identify novel solutions for the increase in antifungal drug resistance.", "generated_text": "The fungal genome exhibits remarkable plasticity, with polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation (CNV) playing pivotal roles in adaptation to environmental stress. This study delves into the dynamic nature of the fungal genome, exploring how these genetic alterations contribute to survival and proliferation under adverse conditions. Polyploidy, the presence of more than two sets of chromosomes, and aneuploidy, the gain or loss of individual chromosomes, are mechanisms that can confer immediate phenotypic advantages, such as increased resistance to stress. CNV, involving duplications or deletions of genomic segments, further enhances adaptability by modulating gene dosage. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we highlight the prevalence and functional significance of these genomic variations in fungi, shedding light on their evolutionary implications. Our findings underscore the importance of genome plasticity in fungal resilience, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying stress adaptation and potential applications in biotechnology and medicine.", "label": 0}
