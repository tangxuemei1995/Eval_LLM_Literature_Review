{"grounding": "\nPlasmodium falciparum, the human malaria parasite, infects two hosts and various cell types, inducing distinct morphological and physiological changes in the parasite in response to different environmental conditions. These variations required the parasite to adapt and develop elaborate molecular mechanisms to ensure its spread and transmission. Recent findings have significantly improved our understanding of the regulation of gene expression in P. falciparum. Here, we provide an up-to-date overview of technologies used to highlight the transcriptomic adjustments occurring in the parasite throughout its life cycle. We also emphasize the complementary and complex epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in malaria parasites. This review concludes with an outlook on the chromatin architecture, the remodeling systems, and how this 3D genome organization is critical in various biological processes.", "generated_text": "Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, remains a significant global health challenge. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have unveiled the complex epigenetic landscape and chromatin architecture that govern the parasite's life cycle and virulence. This study delves into the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in epigenetic regulation and chromatin remodeling within Plasmodium species. By integrating single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we identify key lncRNAs that modulate gene expression and chromatin state, influencing parasite development and host immune evasion. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between lncRNAs and chromatin architecture, offering novel insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying malaria pathogenesis. This research paves the way for the development of epigenetic-based therapeutic strategies targeting the unique regulatory networks of Plasmodium parasites.", "label": 0}
