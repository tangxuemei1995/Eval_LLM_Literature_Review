{"grounding": "Related groups of microbes are widely distributed across Earth's habitats, implying numerous dispersal and adaptation events over evolutionary time. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics and mechanisms of these habitat transitions, particularly for populations that reside in animal microbiomes. Here, we review the literature concerning habitat transitions among a variety of bacterial and archaeal lineages, considering the frequency of migration events, potential environmental barriers, and mechanisms of adaptation to new physicochemical conditions, including the modification of protein inventories and other genomic characteristics. Cells dependent on microbial hosts, particularly bacteria from the Candidate Phyla Radiation, have undergone repeated habitat transitions from environmental sources into animal microbiomes. We compare their trajectories to those of both free-living cells—including the Melainabacteria, Elusimicrobia, and methanogenic archaea—and cellular endosymbionts and bacteriophages, which have made similar transitions. We conclude by highlighting major related topics that may be worthy of future study.", "generated_text": "The study of habitat transition in the evolution of Bacteria and Archaea offers profound insights into microbial evolution, dispersal, and adaptation mechanisms. This research focuses on the dynamic processes that enable these microorganisms to colonize new environments, highlighting the role of genetic and phenotypic adaptations. Special attention is given to the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria, a group characterized by their small genomes and unique metabolic capabilities, which have undergone significant habitat transitions. Additionally, the evolution of the human microbiome is examined as a case study of microbial adaptation to host-associated environments. By integrating findings from environmental microbiology, this study aims to elucidate the evolutionary pathways that facilitate microbial survival and proliferation across diverse habitats. The implications of these transitions for microbial ecology, evolution, and their impact on global biogeochemical cycles are discussed, providing a comprehensive understanding of microbial life's adaptability and resilience.", "label": 0}
