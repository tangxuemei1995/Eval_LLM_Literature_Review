{"grounding": "Secretory antibodies are the only component of our adaptive immune system capable of attacking mucosal pathogens topologically outside of our bodies. All secretory antibody classes are (a) relatively resistant to harsh proteolytic environments and (b) polymeric. Recent elucidation of the structure of secretory IgA (SIgA) has begun to shed light on SIgA functions at the nanoscale. We can now begin to unravel the structure–function relationships of these molecules, for example, by understanding how the bent conformation of SIgA enables robust cross-linking between adjacent growing bacteria. Many mysteries remain, such as the structural basis of protease resistance and the role of noncanonical bacteria–IgA interactions. In this review, we explore the structure–function relationships of IgA from the nano- to the metascale, with a strong focus on how the seemingly banal “license to clump” can have potent effects on bacterial physiology and colonization.", "generated_text": "Secretory IgA (SIgA) plays a pivotal role in mucosal immunity, offering a first line of defense against enteropathogens such as Salmonella. This study delves into the structure–function relationships of SIgA across various scales, from molecular interactions to systemic immune responses. By examining the polymeric nature of IgA and its interaction with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), we uncover the mechanisms underlying SIgA's ability to clump pathogens, thereby neutralizing their infectivity. Our findings highlight the importance of SIgA's unique structure in facilitating its protective functions, including pathogen agglutination, immune exclusion, and modulation of the gut microbiota. Through a combination of biochemical assays, structural biology, and in vivo models, we provide insights into how SIgA's molecular architecture underpins its efficacy as a mucosal immune effector. This research advances our understanding of SIgA's role in combating enteric infections and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting mucosal immunity.", "label": 1}
