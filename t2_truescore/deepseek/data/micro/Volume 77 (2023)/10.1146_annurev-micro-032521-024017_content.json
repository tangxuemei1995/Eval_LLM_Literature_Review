{"grounding": "The immune system of multicellular organisms protects them from harmful microbes. To establish an infection in the face of host immune responses, pathogens must evolve specific strategies to target immune defense mechanisms. One such defense is the formation of intracellular protein complexes, termed inflammasomes, that are triggered by the detection of microbial components and the disruption of homeostatic processes that occur during bacterial infection. Formation of active inflammasomes initiates programmed cell death pathways via activation of inflammatory caspases and cleavage of target proteins. Inflammasome-activated cell death pathways such as pyroptosis lead to proinflammatory responses that protect the host. Bacterial infection has the capacity to influence inflammasomes in two distinct ways: activation and perturbation. In this review, we discuss how bacterial activities influence inflammasomes, and we discuss the consequences of inflammasome activation or evasion for both the host and pathogen.", "generated_text": "The inflammasome complex plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response by orchestrating the activation of inflammatory caspases, such as caspase-1 and caspase-8, leading to the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This process is crucial for host defense against microbial infections and is regulated by various NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Recent studies have highlighted the intricate interplay between bacterial pathogens and inflammasome signaling, where bacteria can either collaborate with or counteract the host's immune mechanisms. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms by which bacterial influencers modulate inflammasome activation, focusing on the roles of caspase-1, caspase-8, gasdermin proteins, and NLRs. Understanding these interactions provides insights into the dual role of bacteria in inflammasome signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases and bacterial infections.", "label": 0}
