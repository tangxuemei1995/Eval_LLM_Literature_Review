{"grounding": "Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with tumor progression in several clinical and experimental settings and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Its relation to cancer immunosurveillance is complex. Clonally heterogeneous tumors are associated with decreased immunosurveillance and are less responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition, but the mechanistic basis underlying these observations remains unclear. One possibility is that tumors that are under active immunosurveillance are relatively homogeneous because immunosurveillance prevents the outgrowth of immunogenic subclones. Alternatively, high ITH might directly impair immunosurveillance due to lower dosages of subclonal antigens, competition between antigens and immunodominance, the induction of detrimental T cell differentiation programs, or negative feedback loops. Here we review the evidence for these scenarios and outline hypotheses that could underlie the negative association between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance.", "generated_text": "Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) represents a significant challenge in cancer treatment, influencing the efficacy of cancer immunosurveillance and immunotherapy. This study explores the impact of clonal heterogeneity on the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells, with a particular focus on the role of immune checkpoint inhibition. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and analysis of clinical data, we investigate how diverse tumor clones evade immune detection and the implications for therapeutic strategies. Our findings suggest that ITH contributes to the complexity of tumor-immune interactions, necessitating personalized approaches to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. This research underscores the importance of understanding clonal heterogeneity in developing targeted treatments that can overcome immune evasion mechanisms, offering new avenues for improving patient outcomes in cancer therapy.", "label": 1}
