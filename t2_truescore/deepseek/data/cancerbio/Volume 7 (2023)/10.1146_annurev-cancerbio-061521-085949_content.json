{"grounding": "Myeloid cells represent a dominant cellular compartment of tumor lesions and play key roles in tumor inception, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), which include dendritic cells and macrophages, are unique among myeloid cells, as they not only shape both the broader composition and state of the tumor microenvironment but can also specifically instruct cancer-specific, T cellâ€“mediated tumor cell killing, making them especially attractive targets for cancer treatment. Although MNPs remain difficult to modulate therapeutically, our understanding of MNP biology in the antitumor immune response has expanded significantly, offering hope for new possibilities in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the recent advances in our study of the cellular identity, molecular diversity, and spatial organization of MNPs in tumors, and we discuss the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to incorporate these new insights into cancer treatment design.", "generated_text": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and response to therapy, with mononuclear phagocytes, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), being key components. These cells exhibit dual roles in cancer, either promoting tumor growth and immune evasion or enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Macrophages, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), often adopt a pro-tumorigenic phenotype, supporting angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. Conversely, DCs are crucial for initiating and regulating anti-tumor immune responses, though their function can be suppressed within the TME. This review explores the biology of macrophages and DCs in cancer, highlighting their interactions within the TME and their impact on tumor progression. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at reprogramming these cells to enhance their anti-tumor functions, including targeting specific signaling pathways, utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors, and employing cell-based therapies. Understanding and modulating the roles of macrophages and DCs offer promising avenues for improving cancer treatment outcomes.", "label": 1}
