{"grounding": "T cell reactivity to tumor-specific neoantigens can drive endogenous and therapeutically induced antitumor immunity. However, most tumor-specific neoantigens are unique to each patient (private) and targeting them requires personalized therapy. A smaller subset of neoantigens includes epitopes that span recurrent mutation hotspots, translocations, or gene fusions in oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors, as well as epitopes that arise from viral oncogenic proteins. Such antigens are likely to be shared across patients (public), uniformly expressed within a tumor, and required for cancer cell survival and fitness. Although a limited number of these public neoantigens are naturally immunogenic, recent studies affirm their clinical utility. In this review, we highlight efforts to target mutant KRAS, mutant p53, and epitopes derived from oncogenic viruses using T cells engineered with off-the-shelf T cell receptors. We also discuss the challenges and strategies to achieving more effective T cell therapies, particularly in the context of solid tumors.", "generated_text": "The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, with adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) emerging as a promising strategy. This approach leverages the immune system's specificity and potency, particularly through the use of T cell receptor (TCR)-based therapies targeting driver oncogenes and public neoantigens. Driver oncogenes, pivotal in tumorigenesis, and public neoantigens, shared among patients with similar genetic backgrounds or tumor types, present unique targets for TCR-engineered T cells. This review explores the development and application of TCR-based cellular therapies, focusing on the identification and targeting of these antigens. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in harnessing TCR-engineered T cells for cancer immunotherapy, including the optimization of TCR affinity, the management of off-target effects, and the enhancement of T cell persistence and function within the tumor microenvironment. The potential of combining TCR-based therapies with other immunotherapeutic strategies to overcome resistance and improve clinical outcomes is also examined, highlighting the future directions of this rapidly evolving field.", "label": 1}
