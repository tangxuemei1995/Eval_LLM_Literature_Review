{"grounding": "Histopathology plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and subtyping of solid tumors and has become a cornerstone of modern precision oncology. Histopathological evaluation is typically performed manually by expert pathologists due to the complexity of visual data. However, in the last ten years, new artificial intelligence (AI) methods have made it possible to train computers to perform visual tasks with high performance, reaching similar levels as experts in some applications. In cancer histopathology, these AI tools could help automate repetitive tasks, making more efficient use of pathologistsâ€™ time. In research studies, AI methods have been shown to have an astounding ability to predict genetic alterations and identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers directly from routine tissue slides. Here, we give an overview of these recent applications of AI in computational pathology, focusing on new tools for cancer research that could be pivotal in identifying clinical biomarkers for better treatment decisions.", "generated_text": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into computational pathology represents a transformative shift in the diagnosis and management of cancer. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms, this study explores the potential of AI to enhance diagnostic workflows and improve clinical outcomes in oncology. By analyzing histopathological images, AI models can identify tumor characteristics and biomarkers with unprecedented accuracy, offering a more objective and reproducible assessment than traditional methods. This research highlights the development of AI-driven tools that assist pathologists in detecting and classifying tumors, predicting patient prognosis, and tailoring personalized treatment strategies. Furthermore, the study addresses the challenges and ethical considerations of implementing AI in clinical settings, including data privacy, algorithm transparency, and the need for multidisciplinary collaboration. The findings underscore the promise of AI in revolutionizing cancer care, emphasizing its role in augmenting human expertise to achieve more precise and efficient diagnostic processes.", "label": 1}
