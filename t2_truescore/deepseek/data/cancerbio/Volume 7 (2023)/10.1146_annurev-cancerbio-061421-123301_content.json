{"grounding": "During tumor evolution, cancer cells can acquire the ability to proliferate, invade neighboring tissues, evade the immune system, and spread systemically. Tracking this process remains challenging, as many key events occur stochastically and over long times, which could be addressed by studying the phylogenetic relationships among cancer cells. Several lineage tracing approaches have been developed and employed in many tumor models and contexts, providing critical insights into tumor evolution. Recent advances in single-cell lineage tracing have greatly expanded the resolution, scale, and readout of lineage tracing toolkits. In this review, we provide an overview of static lineage tracing methods, and then focus on evolving lineage tracing technologies that enable reconstruction of tumor phylogenies at unprecedented resolution. We also discuss in vivo applications of these technologies to profile subclonal dynamics, quantify tumor plasticity, and track metastasis. Finally, we highlight outstanding questions and emerging technologies for building comprehensive cancer evolution roadmaps.", "generated_text": "Understanding the complex dynamics of tumor evolution and metastasis is crucial for advancing cancer biology. This study introduces innovative tools for lineage tracing in vivo, leveraging single-cell analysis and cell barcoding techniques to unravel the clonal architecture and evolutionary pathways of cancer cells. By employing these cutting-edge methodologies, we aim to provide a detailed map of cellular lineages within tumors, shedding light on the mechanisms driving cancer progression and metastasis. Our approach enables the precise tracking of individual cells over time, offering unprecedented insights into the heterogeneity and adaptability of cancer populations. The findings from this research have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of cancer biology, paving the way for the development of targeted therapies and personalized medicine strategies. This study represents a significant step forward in the quest to combat cancer by providing new tools to dissect the intricate processes of tumor evolution and metastasis.", "label": 1}
