{"grounding": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors induce significant and durable treatment responses in about 20% of all cancers, but many patients have natural resistance to current immunotherapies. The past decade of technological advances has resulted in large-scale profiling of many cancers and their tumor microenvironments, rapidly expanding our understanding of the mechanisms utilized by tumors to create immune-resistant microenvironments. In this review, we discuss key factors that create immune resistance and emerging concepts that are redefining how we view immune resistance, as well as highlight novel strategies that aim to convert immune-resistant into immune-sensitive tumors.", "generated_text": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet its efficacy is limited in 'cold' tumors characterized by a non-inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME). This review explores innovative strategies to transform cold tumors into 'hot' tumors, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies. We delve into the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive TME and discuss emerging approaches, including oncolytic viruses, cytokine therapies, and combination treatments, aimed at stimulating immune cell infiltration and activation. Clinical trials evaluating these strategies are highlighted, offering insights into their potential to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes in immunotherapy-refractory cancers.", "label": 1}
