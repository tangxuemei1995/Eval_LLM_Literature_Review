{"grounding": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are present in all malignancies. Arguably, in none are they as prevalent as they are in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where they often outnumber cancer cells. The origin and function of CAFs are still not completely understood, and attempts to target this cell population as a component of combination therapy have so far not succeeded. Our understanding of pancreatic CAFs is in rapid evolution. Heterogeneity of CAFs is the key concept to understand this cell population. We discuss heterogeneity of origin, with recent findings challenging the notion that CAFs uniformly derive from pancreatic stellate cells, and instead suggesting that multiple types of resident fibroblasts contribute to CAF expansion. Heterogeneity in gene expression divides CAFs in different subpopulations. Most importantly, heterogeneity in function underlies the complexity of CAFs. CAFs deposit components of the extracellular matrix, contributing to the high interstitial pressure in pancreatic cancer. CAFs serve as “feeder” cells for cancer cells by providing metabolites, thus mitigating the effect of the low-nutrient environment of PDAC. At the same time, CAFs regulate the function of the immune system, inhibiting antitumor immune responses. Understanding the functional role of different CAF populations and the drivers of each of their functional roles is key to devising new ways to target this cell population in PDAC.", "generated_text": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by a dense desmoplastic stroma. This stroma is predominantly composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which play a pivotal role in tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. This review delves into the multifaceted roles of CAFs within the pancreatic cancer TME, highlighting their contribution to desmoplasia, tumor heterogeneity, and the modulation of immune responses. By examining the dynamic interactions between CAFs, tumor cells, and other stromal components, we aim to shed light on the mechanisms by which CAFs influence tumor biology and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, we explore the potential of targeting CAFs as a therapeutic strategy, discussing recent advances in CAF-directed therapies and their implications for overcoming treatment resistance in pancreatic cancer. Through a comprehensive analysis of current literature, this review underscores the importance of understanding CAF biology in the context of pancreatic cancer, offering insights into novel therapeutic avenues that could improve patient prognosis.", "label": 1}
