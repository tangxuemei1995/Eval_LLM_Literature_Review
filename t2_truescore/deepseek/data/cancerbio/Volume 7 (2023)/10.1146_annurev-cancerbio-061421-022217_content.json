{"grounding": "Ultrahigh–dose rate FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a potentially paradigm-shifting treatment modality that holds the promise of expanding the therapeutic index for nearly any cancer. At the heart of this exciting technology comes the capability to ameliorate major normal tissue complications without compromising the efficacy of tumor killing. This combination of benefits has now been termed the FLASH effect and relies on an in vivo validation to rigorously demonstrate the absence of normal tissue toxicity. The FLASH effect occurs when the overall irradiation time is extremely short (<500 ms), and in this review we attempt to understand how FLASH-RT can kill tumors but spare normal tissues—likely the single most pressing question confronting the field today.", "generated_text": "FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) represents a groundbreaking advancement in the field of radiobiology, offering a paradigm shift from conventional radiotherapy (CRT) through the utilization of ultrahigh dose rates. This innovative approach has demonstrated remarkable potential in sparing normal tissues while maintaining isoefficient tumor killing, a feat that challenges the traditional understanding of radiation biology. By delivering radiation doses at rates significantly higher than those used in CRT, FLASH-RT minimizes the exposure time, thereby reducing the damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor. This abstract explores the mechanisms underlying the differential effects of FLASH-RT on normal and tumor tissues, reviews the current evidence supporting its efficacy, and discusses the implications of this technology for the future of cancer treatment. The reinvention of radiobiology in the light of FLASH radiotherapy opens new avenues for enhancing the therapeutic ratio, promising a new era in oncology where the balance between tumor control and normal tissue preservation is optimized.", "label": 1}
