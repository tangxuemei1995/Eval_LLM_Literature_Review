{"grounding": "The principle of independent drug action proposes that responses to drug combinations result from responses to one or the other of two combining agents, but not both. Explorations of biological pathway interactions in signal transduction and immunobiology as synergy have not been connected to mathematical demonstrations of above–independent action activity, which would define pharmacologic synergy. We review independent action as the explanation for cancer drug combinations and find no evidence for pharmacologic synergy. Rather, a measure of correlation of response (ρ) when positive can explain below–independent action results, and negative correlation can explain above–independent action results. Anticorrelated responses may be a mathematical demonstration of collateral sensitivity, which can achieve above–independent action activity. Inappropriate use of biological concepts of synergy may be contributing to high failure rates for immuno-oncology clinical trials, indicating a need for more rigorous applications of independent action to the development of cancer drug combination therapy.", "generated_text": "The integration of combination therapies in cancer treatment has emerged as a pivotal strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome drug resistance. This study explores the underlying rationales for combining therapies, focusing on independent action, response correlation, collateral sensitivity, and synergy. Independent action allows for the simultaneous targeting of different pathways, reducing the likelihood of resistance development. Response correlation leverages the predictive relationship between treatments to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Collateral sensitivity, a phenomenon where resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another, offers a novel approach to counteract resistance mechanisms. Synergy, the interaction of therapies resulting in a greater effect than the sum of their individual effects, is particularly promising in enhancing the efficacy of treatments such as PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. Through a comprehensive review of clinical trials and experimental studies, this research underscores the importance of understanding these mechanisms to design more effective combination therapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cancer treatment.", "label": 1}
