{"grounding": "Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that promotes tissue homeostasis by identifying damaged cells for immune-mediated clearance. Thus, the ability to evade senescence and the ensuing immune surveillance is a hallmark of cancer. Reactivation of senescence programs can result in profound immune-mediated tumor regressions or sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, although the aberrant persistence of senescent cells can promote tissue decline and contribute to the side effects of some cancer therapies. In this review, we first briefly describe the discovery of senescence as a tumor-suppressive program. Next, we highlight the dueling good and bad effects of the senescence-associated secretory program (SASP) in cancer, including SASP-dependent immune effects. We then summarize the beneficial and deleterious effects of senescence induction by cancer therapies and strategies in development to leverage senescence therapeutically. Finally, we highlight challenges and unmet needs in understanding senescence in cancer and developing senescence-modulating therapies.", "generated_text": "Cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, plays a dual role in cancer biology, acting both as a tumor suppressor mechanism and a promoter of tumor progression. This paradoxical effect is largely mediated by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can induce immune surveillance to eliminate senescent cells or, conversely, foster a tumor-supportive microenvironment. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) has emerged as a therapeutic strategy, leveraging the tumor-suppressive aspects of senescence. However, the persistence of senescent cells post-therapy poses a risk for cancer relapse and resistance. The development of senolytic agents, designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells, offers a promising avenue to mitigate these risks. The 'one-two punch' therapy, combining TIS with senolytics, represents a novel approach to enhance cancer treatment efficacy. This review explores the complex biology of cellular senescence in cancer, highlighting the therapeutic potential and challenges of targeting senescence in oncology.", "label": 1}
