{"grounding": "Fusion oncoproteins (FOs) resulting from in-frame chromosomal translocations are associated with many aggressive cancers with poor patient outcomes. Several FOs are now understood to perform their oncogenic functions within biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Two classes of phase-separating FOs have emerged, those that form nuclear condensates and alter chromatin biology, including gene expression, and those that form cytoplasmic condensates and promote aberrant signaling, including RAS/MAPK signaling. The amino acid sequences of the FOs within these classes display LLPS-prone intrinsically disordered regions and folded domains that synergistically interact with themselves and other biomolecules to promote condensate formation. This review summarizes the roles of LLPS in the oncogenic functions of these two FO classes, provides examples of FOs that inhibit physiological LLPS in normal cells, and discusses the sequence features commonly associated with LLPS and their enrichment in many FOs.", "generated_text": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a fundamental mechanism organizing cellular biochemistry, leading to the formation of biomolecular condensates. These condensates play pivotal roles in various cellular processes, including transcription and signaling. Fusion oncoproteins, resulting from chromosomal translocations, are implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. Recent studies suggest that the oncogenic potential of these fusion proteins may be significantly influenced by their ability to undergo LLPS, facilitated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and specific sequence features. This review explores the role of phase-separated condensates in the function of fusion oncoproteins, focusing on their impact on transcription and kinase signaling pathways. By integrating recent findings, we aim to elucidate how LLPS contributes to the oncogenic activity of fusion proteins and discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these condensates in cancer treatment.", "label": 1}
