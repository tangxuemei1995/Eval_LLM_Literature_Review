{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been a great success in CD19+ hematological diseases. Natural killer (NK) CAR cells offer an alternative to CAR T cells with an intrinsic potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. The choice of cell type and the choice of CAR are both relevant for the feasibility, effectivity, engraftment, persistence, side effects, and safety of the cell therapy. Until recently CAR NK cells have proven difficult to develop into therapeutic products. Here, we give an overview of the source of CAR NK cells, gene transfer methods, and the manufacture of CAR NK cells for clinical application. We discuss improvements, as well as future options and problems that need to be addressed.", "generated_text": "Natural Killer (NK) cells have emerged as a pivotal component in the realm of immunotherapy, particularly in the fight against cancer. The advent of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology has further revolutionized this field, enabling the engineering of CAR NK cells that can specifically target and eliminate cancer cells with enhanced precision and efficacy. Unlike CAR T cells, CAR NK cells offer the advantage of being an 'off-the-shelf' product, reducing the time and complexity associated with personalized cell therapies. This review delves into the latest advancements in CAR NK cell therapy, highlighting its potential as a transformative approach in cancer treatment. By harnessing the innate and adaptive immune responses, CAR NK cells represent a promising frontier in the development of effective and accessible immunotherapies.", "label": 1}
