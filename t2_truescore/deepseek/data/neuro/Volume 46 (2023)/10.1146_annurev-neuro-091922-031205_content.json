{"grounding": "Astrocyte endfeet enwrap the entire vascular tree within the central nervous system, where they perform important functions in regulating the blood-brain barrier (BBB), cerebral blood flow, nutrient uptake, and waste clearance. Accordingly, astrocyte endfeet contain specialized organelles and proteins, including local protein translation machinery and highly organized scaffold proteins, which anchor channels, transporters, receptors, and enzymes critical for astrocyte-vascular interactions. Many neurological diseases are characterized by the loss of polarization of specific endfoot proteins, vascular dysregulation, BBB disruption, altered waste clearance, or, in extreme cases, loss of endfoot coverage. A role for astrocyte endfeet has been demonstrated or postulated in many of these conditions. This review provides an overview of the development, composition, function, and pathological changes of astrocyte endfeet and highlights the gaps in our knowledge that future research should address.", "generated_text": "Astrocyte endfeet, specialized structures that ensheath cerebral blood vessels, play a pivotal role in maintaining brain homeostasis and orchestrating neurovascular coupling. These dynamic interfaces facilitate the bidirectional communication between neurons and the vasculature, ensuring the precise regulation of cerebral blood flow in response to neuronal activity. Despite their critical functions, numerous open questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying astrocyte endfoot-mediated signaling and their contributions to brain pathology. This review highlights the current understanding of astrocyte endfeet in the context of the blood-brain barrier integrity, cerebral blood flow regulation, and neurovascular coupling. We also discuss the emerging evidence implicating astrocyte endfeet dysfunction in various neurological disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy. By addressing these unresolved questions, we aim to shed light on the potential therapeutic targets within the astrocyte-vascular interface for the treatment of brain diseases.", "label": 1}
