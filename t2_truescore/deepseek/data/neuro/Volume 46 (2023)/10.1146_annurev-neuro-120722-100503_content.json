{"grounding": "Despite increasing evidence of its involvement in several key functions of the cerebral cortex, the vestibular sense rarely enters our consciousness. Indeed, the extent to which these internal signals are incorporated within cortical sensory representation and how they might be relied upon for sensory-driven decision-making, during, for example, spatial navigation, is yet to be understood. Recent novel experimental approaches in rodents have probed both the physiological and behavioral significance of vestibular signals and indicate that their widespread integration with vision improves both the cortical representation and perceptual accuracy of self-motion and orientation. Here, we summarize these recent findings with a focus on cortical circuits involved in visual perception and spatial navigation and highlight the major remaining knowledge gaps. We suggest that vestibulo-visual integration reflects a process of constant updating regarding the status of self-motion, and access to such information by the cortex is used for sensory perception and predictions that may be implemented for rapid, navigation-related decision-making.", "generated_text": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues is fundamental for spatial navigation, visual processing, and perception, enabling organisms to accurately interpret their environment and self-motion. This study explores the cortical mechanisms underlying the multisensory integration of vestibular and visual information, focusing on how these processes contribute to coherent spatial awareness and navigation. Through a comprehensive review of recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies, we identify key cortical areas involved in this integration, including the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) and the medial superior temporal area (MST). We discuss how these regions process and combine vestibular and visual inputs to facilitate stable perception during self-motion and how disruptions in this integration can lead to spatial disorientation. Furthermore, we examine the implications of these findings for understanding the neural basis of navigation and perception, highlighting potential applications in the development of virtual reality systems and therapeutic interventions for vestibular disorders. This research underscores the importance of multisensory integration in maintaining spatial coherence and adaptive behavior in complex environments.", "label": 1}
