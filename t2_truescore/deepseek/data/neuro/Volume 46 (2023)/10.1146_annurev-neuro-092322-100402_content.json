{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires the creation, updating, and expression of memories to depend on context. While the neural underpinnings of each of these processes have been intensively studied, recent advances in computational modeling revealed a key challenge in context-dependent learning that had been largely ignored previously: Under naturalistic conditions, context is typically uncertain, necessitating contextual inference. We review a theoretical approach to formalizing context-dependent learning in the face of contextual uncertainty and the core computations it requires. We show how this approach begins to organize a large body of disparate experimental observations, from multiple levels of brain organization (including circuits, systems, and behavior) and multiple brain regions (most prominently the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and motor cortices), into a coherent framework. We argue that contextual inference may also be key to understanding continual learning in the brain. This theory-driven perspective places contextual inference as a core component of learning.", "generated_text": "Context-dependent learning is a fundamental aspect of cognition, enabling organisms to adapt their behavior based on environmental cues. This study explores the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this process, integrating insights from memory, learning, and continual learning paradigms. We employ Bayesian inference models to elucidate how the brain updates and retrieves information in a context-sensitive manner. Neural computation analyses reveal the pivotal roles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortex in encoding, maintaining, and retrieving context-dependent information. Our findings suggest that these brain regions interact dynamically to support the flexible adaptation of learned behaviors to new contexts. This research advances our understanding of the neural substrates of context-dependent learning and offers a computational framework for studying continual learning in both biological and artificial systems.", "label": 1}
