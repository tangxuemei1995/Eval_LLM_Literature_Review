{"grounding": "All mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol to maintain membrane integrity. The transport of this hydrophobic lipid is mediated by lipoproteins. Cholesterol is especially enriched in the brain, particularly in synaptic and myelin membranes. Aging involves changes in sterol metabolism in peripheral organs and also in the brain. Some of those alterations have the potential to promote or to counteract the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of general principles of sterol metabolism in humans and mice, the most widely used model organism in biomedical research. We discuss changes in sterol metabolism that occur in the aged brain and highlight recent developments in cell type–specific cholesterol metabolism in the fast-growing research field of aging and age-related diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. We propose that cell type–specific cholesterol handling and the interplay between cell types critically influence age-related disease processes.", "generated_text": "Cholesterol metabolism plays a pivotal role in the aging process and the development of age-related disorders, particularly neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how cholesterol homeostasis is altered with aging, focusing on its impact on neurons and microglia, the brain's resident immune cells. Aging is associated with dysregulated cholesterol metabolism, leading to altered neuronal function and increased neuroinflammation, which are key contributors to neurodegeneration. In Alzheimer's disease, the accumulation of cholesterol in neurons and microglia exacerbates amyloid-beta production and tau pathology, hallmark features of the disease. Understanding the intricate relationship between cholesterol metabolism, aging, and age-related neurological disorders offers potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the progression of these debilitating conditions. This abstract highlights the importance of further research into cholesterol's role in brain aging and neurodegeneration, aiming to uncover novel strategies for disease intervention and prevention.", "label": 1}
