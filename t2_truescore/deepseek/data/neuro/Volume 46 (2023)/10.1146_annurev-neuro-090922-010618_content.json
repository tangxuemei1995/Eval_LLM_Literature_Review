{"grounding": "In mammals, the activity of neurons in the entorhinal-hippocampal network is modulated by the animal's position and its movement through space. At multiple stages of this distributed circuit, distinct populations of neurons can represent a rich repertoire of navigation-related variables like the animal's location, the speed and direction of its movements, or the presence of borders and objects. Working together, spatially tuned neurons give rise to an internal representation of space, a cognitive map that supports an animal's ability to navigate the world and to encode and consolidate memories from experience. The mechanisms by which, during development, the brain acquires the ability to create an internal representation of space are just beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we examine recent work that has begun to investigate the ontogeny of circuitry, firing patterns, and computations underpinning the representation of space in the mammalian brain.", "generated_text": "The construction of cognitive maps, essential for spatial navigation and memory, involves intricate neural circuits and computational processes within the brain. This research delves into the developmental trajectory of these maps, focusing on the pivotal roles of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Through a synthesis of recent findings, we explore how these brain regions collaborate to encode, store, and retrieve spatial information, facilitating effective navigation and memory formation. The study highlights the dynamic interplay between neural development and environmental interactions, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the maturation of spatial representation capabilities. By integrating insights from neuroscience and computational modeling, this work advances our understanding of the foundational processes that enable the brain to construct and utilize cognitive maps, offering new perspectives on the neural basis of spatial cognition and its implications for learning and memory.", "label": 1}
