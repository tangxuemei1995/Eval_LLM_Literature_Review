{"grounding": "The field of stereotactic neurosurgery developed more than 70 years ago to address a therapy gap for patients with severe psychiatric disorders. In the decades since, it has matured tremendously, benefiting from advances in clinical and basic sciences. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe, treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders is currently poised to transition from a stage of empiricism to one increasingly rooted in scientific discovery. Current drivers of this transition are advances in neuroimaging, but rapidly emerging ones are neurophysiologicalâ€”as we understand more about the neural basis of these disorders, we will more successfully be able to use interventions such as invasive stimulation to restore dysfunctional circuits to health. Paralleling this transition is a steady increase in the consistency and quality of outcome data. Here, we focus on obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, two topics that have received the most attention in terms of trial volume and scientific effort.", "generated_text": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising intervention for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, notably Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This review synthesizes current evidence on the efficacy, mechanisms, and safety of DBS in modulating neural circuits implicated in these conditions. By targeting specific brain regions such as the subthalamic nucleus, ventral capsule/ventral striatum, and anterior limb of the internal capsule, DBS has shown potential in alleviating symptoms where traditional therapies have failed. Despite its therapeutic promise, the application of DBS in psychiatric neurosurgery faces challenges, including variability in patient response, ethical considerations, and the need for precise targeting to minimize adverse effects. This abstract highlights the importance of ongoing research to refine DBS techniques, understand its long-term outcomes, and expand its accessibility to patients suffering from severe OCD and depression, thereby offering new hope for those with treatment-resistant conditions.", "label": 1}
