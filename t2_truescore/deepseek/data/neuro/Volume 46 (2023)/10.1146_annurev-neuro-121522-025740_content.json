{"grounding": "Striosomes form neurochemically specialized compartments of the striatum embedded in a large matrix made up of modules called matrisomes. Striosome-matrix architecture is multiplexed with the canonical direct-indirect organization of the striatum. Striosomal functions remain to be fully clarified, but key information is emerging. First, striosomes powerfully innervate nigral dopamine-containing neurons and can completely shut down their activity, with a following rebound excitation. Second, striosomes receive limbic and cognition-related corticostriatal afferents and are dynamically modulated in relation to value-based actions. Third, striosomes are spatially interspersed among matrisomes and interneurons and are influenced by local and global neuromodulatory and oscillatory activities. Fourth, striosomes tune engagement and the motivation to perform reinforcement learning, to manifest stereotypical behaviors, and to navigate valence conflicts and valence discriminations. We suggest that, at an algorithmic level, striosomes could serve as distributed scaffolds to provide formats of the striatal computations generated through development and refined through learning. We propose that striosomes affect subjective states. By transforming corticothalamic and other inputs to the functional formats of the striatum, they could implement state transitions in nigro-striato-nigral circuits to affect bodily and cognitive actions according to internal motives whose functions are compromised in neuropsychiatric conditions.", "generated_text": "The striatum, a critical component of the basal ganglia, plays a pivotal role in the integration of volition and action through its distinct compartments: the striosomes and the matrisomes. These compartments serve as scaffolds for the dynamic coupling of cognitive and motor functions, facilitating learning and decision-making processes. Striosomes, embedded within the matrisomal framework, are particularly responsive to dopamine signaling, which modulates their activity in response to reward and punishment cues. This study explores the intricate interplay between striosomes and matrisomes, highlighting their contribution to the plasticity of the basal ganglia circuits. By synthesizing recent findings from neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies, we propose a model wherein the striosomal-matrisomal network orchestrates the balance between exploratory and exploitative behaviors. This model underscores the importance of dopamine in mediating the adaptive responses of the striatum to environmental stimuli, thereby influencing learning outcomes. Our analysis suggests that disruptions in the striosomal-matrisomal dynamics may underlie various neuropsychiatric disorders, offering new insights into their pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets. This research underscores the necessity of further investigation into the striatal compartments to fully elucidate their roles in the complex processes of volition and action.", "label": 1}
