{"grounding": "This review explores the interface between circadian timekeeping and the regulation of brain function by astrocytes. Although astrocytes regulate neuronal activity across many time domains, their cell-autonomous circadian clocks exert a particular role in controlling longer-term oscillations of brain function: the maintenance of sleep states and the circadian ordering of sleep and wakefulness. This is most evident in the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where the molecular clock of astrocytes suffices to drive daily cycles of neuronal activity and behavior. In Alzheimer's disease, sleep impairments accompany cognitive decline. In mouse models of the disease, circadian disturbances accelerate astroglial activation and other brain pathologies, suggesting that daily functions in astrocytes protect neuronal homeostasis. In brain cancer, treatment in the morning has been associated with prolonged survival, and gliomas have daily rhythms in gene expression and drug sensitivity. Thus, circadian time is fast becoming critical to elucidating reciprocal astrocytic-neuronal interactions in health and disease.", "generated_text": "Circadian rhythms, the endogenous 24-hour cycles that regulate physiological processes, are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and health. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the brain, play a pivotal role in modulating these rhythms through calcium signaling and the release of gliotransmitters. This review explores the dual role of astrocytes in circadian regulation, highlighting their beneficial effects on sleep and cognitive functions, as well as their potential involvement in pathological conditions. We discuss how disruptions in astrocytic circadian functions can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and the progression of gliomas. By examining the intricate interplay between circadian rhythms and astrocyte activity, this paper aims to shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying brain health and disease, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for circadian-related disorders.", "label": 1}
