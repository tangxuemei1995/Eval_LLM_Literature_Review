{"grounding": "The spinal cord is home to the intrinsic networks for locomotion. An animal in which the spinal cord has been fully severed from the brain can still produce rhythmic, patterned locomotor movements as long as some excitatory drive is provided, such as physical, pharmacological, or electrical stimuli. Yet it remains a challenge to define the underlying circuitry that produces these movements because the spinal cord contains a wide variety of neuron classes whose patterns of interconnectivity are still poorly understood. Computational models of locomotion accordingly rely on untested assumptions about spinal neuron network element identity and connectivity. In this review, we consider the classes of spinal neurons, their interconnectivity, and the significance of their circuit connections along the long axis of the spinal cord. We suggest several lines of analysis to move toward a definitive understanding of the spinal network.", "generated_text": "The spinal cord plays a pivotal role in the execution of motor control, with spinal interneurons (INs) at the heart of this complex process. This review delves into the diversity and connectivity of spinal INs, particularly within the ventral horn, where they orchestrate the intricate circuitry essential for locomotion and other motor functions. By integrating findings from recent studies, we highlight the classification of INs based on their molecular markers, physiological properties, and synaptic connections. The emerging picture is one of a highly specialized network, where distinct IN populations contribute to the generation, modulation, and refinement of motor output. Understanding the precise roles and interactions of these INs not only sheds light on the fundamental principles of motor control but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions in motor disorders.", "label": 1}
