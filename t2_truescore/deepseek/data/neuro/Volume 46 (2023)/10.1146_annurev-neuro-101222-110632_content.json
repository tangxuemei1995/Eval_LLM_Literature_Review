{"grounding": "Examination of cognition has historically been approached from language and introspection. However, human languageâ€“dependent definitions ignore the evolutionary roots of brain mechanisms and constrain their study in experimental animals. We promote an alternative view, namely that cognition, including memory, can be explained by exaptation and expansion of the circuits and algorithms serving bodily functions. Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states. Exaptation of such circuits was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche. We illustrate that exploration gives rise to a cognitive map, and in turn, environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning). Such brain-body interactions not only occur during waking but also persist during sleep. These exaptation steps are illustrated by the dual, endocrine-homeostatic and memory, contributions of the hippocampal system, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate partnership between the body and brain in shaping cognition, with a particular focus on the exaptation of memory processes. Central to this investigation is the role of the hippocampus in memory formation and retrieval, alongside the phenomenon of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that are critical for memory consolidation. We delve into the mechanisms of homeostasis and allostasis, examining how these processes facilitate body control and glucose regulation, thereby influencing cognitive functions. The research posits that the body's physiological states, regulated through these mechanisms, are not merely background conditions but active participants in cognitive processes. By integrating findings from neuroscience and physiology, this paper aims to shed light on how the body-brain partnership underpins the exaptation of memory, offering new insights into the adaptive functions of memory in response to internal and external demands.", "label": 1}
