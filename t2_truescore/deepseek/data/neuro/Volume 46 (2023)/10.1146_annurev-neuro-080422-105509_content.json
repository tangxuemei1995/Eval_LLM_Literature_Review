{"grounding": "Migraine is a complex neurovascular pain disorder linked to the meninges, a border tissue innervated by neuropeptide-containing primary afferent fibers chiefly from the trigeminal nerve. Electrical or mechanical stimulation of this nerve surrounding large blood vessels evokes headache patterns as in migraine, and the brain, blood, and meninges are likely sources of headache triggers. Cerebrospinal fluid may play a significant role in migraine by transferring signals released from the brain to overlying pain-sensitive meningeal tissues, including dura mater. Interactions between trigeminal afferents, neuropeptides, and adjacent meningeal cells and tissues cause neurogenic inflammation, a critical target for current prophylactic and abortive migraine therapies. Here we review the importance of the cranial meninges to migraine headaches, explore the properties of trigeminal meningeal afferents, and briefly review emerging concepts, such as meningeal neuroimmune interactions, that may one day prove therapeutically relevant.", "generated_text": "Migraine, a debilitating neurological disorder, is intricately linked with the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This review explores the pivotal role of meningeal mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology, focusing on the interaction between meningeal afferents and the trigeminal system. Neurogenic inflammation and sensitization of meningeal nociceptors are identified as key processes that contribute to the headache phase of migraine. Additionally, cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, is discussed for its potential to activate meningeal nociceptors, thereby initiating migraine attacks. Understanding the complex interplay between meningeal afferents, neurogenic inflammation, and CSD offers new insights into migraine mechanisms and paves the way for innovative therapeutic strategies targeting meningeal pathways to alleviate migraine symptoms.", "label": 1}
