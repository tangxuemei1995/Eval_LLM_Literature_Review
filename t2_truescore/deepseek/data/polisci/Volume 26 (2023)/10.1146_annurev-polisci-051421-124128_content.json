{"grounding": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing scholarly interest in nonviolent resistanceâ€”a method of conflict in which unarmed people mobilize collective protests, strikes, and boycotts in a coordinated way. Mass movements that rely overwhelmingly on nonviolent resistance sometimes feature unarmed collective violence, fringe violence, or even organized armed action. What do we know about the effects of violent flanks on movement outcomes? This article reviews findings on the relationships between nonviolent and unarmed resistance, violence, and the outcomes of mass mobilization, as well as the directionality of these relationships. The balance of empirical evidence suggests that organized armed violence appears to reduce the chances for otherwise nonviolent movements to succeed, whereas unarmed collective violence has more ambiguous effects. The field will benefit from greater analytical precision in comparing the units of analysis, scope, intensity, and media framing of violent flank activity.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex dynamics between nonviolent resistance and the presence of violence within protest movements, focusing on the roles of violent flanks, unarmed collective violence, and riots. While nonviolent resistance is often championed for its moral and strategic advantages, the emergence of violent elements within these movements can significantly alter their trajectory and outcomes. Through an analysis of historical and contemporary case studies, this research investigates how the presence of violence, whether from within the movement or external forces, impacts the effectiveness, public perception, and longevity of nonviolent campaigns. The findings suggest that while violent flanks can sometimes escalate tensions and provoke harsher repression, they may also draw attention to the movement's cause and catalyze broader support. However, the study underscores the importance of strategic nonviolence in maintaining moral high ground and achieving sustainable political change, highlighting the delicate balance movements must navigate to harness the potential benefits of violent elements without undermining their core principles.", "label": 1}
