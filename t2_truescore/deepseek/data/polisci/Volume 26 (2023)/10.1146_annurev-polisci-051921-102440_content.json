{"grounding": "A recent wave of research in political science examines the past using statistical methods for causal inference and formal theoryâ€”a field widely known as historical political economy (HPE). We examine the development of this field. Our survey reveals three common uses of history in HPE: understanding the past for its own sake, using history as a way to understand the present, and using history as a setting to explore theoretical conjectures. We present important work in each area and discuss trade-offs of each approach. We further identify key practical and analytical challenges for scholars of HPE, including the accessibility of data that do exist and obstacles to inference when they do not. Looking to the future, we see improved training for scholars entering the field, a heightened focus on the accumulation of knowledge, and greater attention to underexplored topics such as race, gender, ethnicity, and climate change.", "generated_text": "Historical Political Economy (HPE) represents a burgeoning field that bridges the gap between history and political science, focusing on how historical events and institutions shape contemporary political and economic outcomes. This paper explores the evolution of HPE, emphasizing its methodological advancements in causal inference and the integration of formal theory to understand the persistence of legacies. By examining key studies, we highlight how HPE has illuminated the long-term effects of historical phenomena, such as colonialism, state formation, and institutional development, on modern governance and economic performance. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities facing HPE, including the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the application of innovative analytical techniques. Looking ahead, we argue that HPE is poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of the complex interplay between history, politics, and economics, offering insights into the mechanisms of persistence and the pathways of institutional change.", "label": 1}
