{"grounding": "This article reviews the state of the literature on the politics of global health governance and associated political dynamics of actors involved in this issue space. We identify seven eras in the field, beginning with the period of empire and colonialism and ending with the COVID-19 outbreak. The field of global health has long had a focus on infectious disease, often rooted within a state-centered approach to transnational global health problems with recurrent debates about whether and how restrictions on trade and travel should be imposed in the wake of disease outbreaks. This statist focus is in tension with more cosmopolitan visions of global health, which require broader health system strengthening. In the mid-2000s, a golden age emerged with the influx of new financing and political attention to addressing HIV/AIDS and malaria, as well as reducing the risk posed by infectious disease outbreaks to economies of the Global North. Despite increased awareness of noncommunicable diseases and the importance of health systems, events of recent years (including but not limited to the COVID-19 outbreak) reinforced the centrality of states to global health efforts and the primacy of infectious diseases.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the evolution of global health governance from the era of imperialism through the so-called 'Golden Age' of international health cooperation, culminating in the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, referred to as the 'Great Lockdown'. It critically examines the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health organizations in shaping the politics of global health, highlighting the interplay between national interests and global health priorities. The study argues that the trajectory of global health governance has been significantly influenced by geopolitical dynamics, economic interests, and the shifting landscape of international relations. By analyzing the response to COVID-19, the paper sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of the current global health governance framework, including issues of equity, sovereignty, and the effectiveness of multilateral cooperation. The findings suggest that while the 'Golden Age' represented a period of optimism and progress in global health, the 'Great Lockdown' has exposed critical vulnerabilities and the need for a more resilient and inclusive approach to global health governance in the face of future pandemics.", "label": 0}
