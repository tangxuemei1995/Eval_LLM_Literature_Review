{"grounding": "Bureaucracy is everywhere. Unelected bureaucrats are a key link between government and citizens, between policy and implementation. Bureaucratic politics constitutes a growing share of research in political science. But the way bureaucracy is studied varies widely, permitting theoretical and empirical blind spots as well as opportunities for innovation. Scholars of American politics tend to focus on bureaucratic policy making at the national level, while comparativists often home in on local implementation by street-level bureaucrats. Data availability and professional incentives have reinforced these subfield-specific blind spots over time. We highlight these divides in three prominent research areas: the selection and retention of bureaucratic personnel, oversight of bureaucratic activities, and opportunities for influence by actors external to the bureaucracy. Our survey reveals how scholars from the American and comparative politics traditions can learn from one another.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of bureaucratic politics, shedding light on its blind spots and untapped opportunities within the realm of political science. By examining the interplay between personnel appointments, bureaucratic performance, and oversight mechanisms, the research underscores the pivotal role of accountability in shaping bureaucratic behavior. Furthermore, it explores the nuanced ways in which influence and lobbying intersect with procurement processes, revealing the complex web of interactions that define bureaucratic decision-making. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and case studies, this paper aims to bridge gaps in understanding and propose avenues for future research. It advocates for a more nuanced approach to studying bureaucracy, one that considers the multifaceted influences on its operations and the potential for reform to enhance its efficacy and transparency in governance.", "label": 1}
