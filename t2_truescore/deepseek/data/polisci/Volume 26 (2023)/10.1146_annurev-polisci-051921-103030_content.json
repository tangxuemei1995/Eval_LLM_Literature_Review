{"grounding": "The article reviews the recent advances in comparative political economy. It reconnects knowledge on growth regimes and welfare regimes by analyzing how growth and welfare regimes covary over both time and space. It underlines the fact that governments pursue different growth strategies to adjust to new economic environments, focusing in particular on welfare state reforms. Synthesizing the literature, we propose a definition of growth and welfare regimes that integrates different engines of growth as a way to track general trends in the evolution of capitalism. We analyze the main trends of three eras of capitalism: Fordism, neoliberal financialization, and the digitalized knowledge-based economy. We trace the various paths of change by identifying the five growth strategies governments have pursued to adapt their growth and welfare regimes to the new capitalist era. The result is not a typology of fixed types of capitalist models but a dynamic process of adjustment.", "generated_text": "This study explores the evolution of growth and welfare regimes across different temporal and spatial contexts, focusing on the transition from Fordism to financialization and the emergence of the knowledge-based economy. Utilizing a comparative political economy framework, it examines how these shifts have influenced the development of welfare states and their capacity to adapt to changing economic paradigms. The analysis highlights the divergent paths taken by various countries in reconciling economic growth with social welfare objectives, underscoring the role of institutional configurations and policy choices in shaping these outcomes. By integrating historical and contemporary perspectives, the research sheds light on the complex interplay between economic transformations and welfare state resilience, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by the ongoing transition to a knowledge-based economy. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics driving growth and welfare regimes in the 21st century.", "label": 1}
