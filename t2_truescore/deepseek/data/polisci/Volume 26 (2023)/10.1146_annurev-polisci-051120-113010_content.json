{"grounding": "There is an unexamined paradox in the history of government in the West. The so-called absolutist monarchs of Europe overwhelmingly chartered republican corporations—e.g., towns, universities, and guilds whose members elected their leaders. Indeed, modern constitutional democracy is patterned after them. Yet, modern democracies themselves have overwhelmingly chartered authoritarian corporations—e.g., universities and business corporations whose subjects have no vote. After this Great Inversion, corporations, which once distributed power and wealth, now concentrate them, straining constitutional democracy. Against this backdrop, this article analyzes the major types of relation maintained between states and corporations: constitutive (states charter corporations), mimetic (states and corporations recurrently copy one another's organizational features), and instrumental (each leans on the other, and sometimes captures it, to better advance its own purposes). The article then examines the special challenges that corporate economies pose to constitutional democracy and considers whether a partial reversal of the Great Inversion could reduce them.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between democracy and the corporation from a historical and theoretical perspective, focusing on the interplay of republicanism, constitutionalism, and the foundational principles of enterprise. It argues that the evolution of corporate entities has significantly influenced democratic governance, often exacerbating inequalities within societies. By examining the long view of this relationship, the study highlights how corporations have both supported and undermined democratic ideals, from their role in fostering economic growth to their impact on political power dynamics. The analysis draws on a wide range of historical examples and theoretical frameworks to assess the implications of corporate power for democratic institutions and practices. Ultimately, the paper calls for a reevaluation of the constitutional and republican principles that govern the corporation, suggesting pathways towards a more equitable alignment between corporate practices and democratic values.", "label": 1}
