{"grounding": "Political scientist Hakeem Jefferson (Stanford University) facilitated a discussion about race, policing, and the state of American democracy with fellow political scientists Cathy J. Cohen (University of Chicago), Yanilda M. Gonz√°lez (Harvard Kennedy School), Rebecca U. Thorpe (University of Washington), and Vesla M. Weaver (Johns Hopkins University) on May 26, 2021. The conversation occurred a year after George Perry Floyd Jr., a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Moving beyond common notions of democracy that focus primarily on voting and electoral participation, the panelists discussed how American policing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, redefine citizenship, redistribute power, and shape marginalized people's understanding of their place in society. Closing remarks addressed the potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people and how political scientists can more usefully contribute to efforts that strengthen democracy for all. This is an edited transcript of the conversation and includes a bibliography of the sources mentioned. A video of the conversation is available online at \nhttps://www.annualreviews.org/r/BeyondtheBallotBox\n.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate relationship between democracy and policing in the United States, with a particular focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by the pursuit of a multiracial democracy. Against the backdrop of racial authoritarianism, the research explores how policing practices and the broader criminal justice system intersect with issues of identity, influencing the democratic experience of diverse communities. Through a critical analysis of historical and contemporary case studies, the paper examines the ways in which policing can both undermine and support democratic principles, especially in contexts marked by racial and ethnic diversity. The conversation extends beyond the ballot box to consider how law enforcement policies and practices shape the lived realities of citizens, affecting their sense of belonging, security, and rights within the democratic framework. By highlighting the tensions between democratic ideals and the realities of policing, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in achieving a truly inclusive and equitable democracy in the United States.", "label": 1}
