{"grounding": "The structure and governance of global supply chains not only shape social and environmental outcomes for both countries and firms, but also affect the quality of life at the local level, for those who live and work at each site of production. Existing literature on supply chain governance focuses on the transnational firm and has yielded a wide range of theoretical and empirical findings about firm- and nation-level outcomes. However, we know less about the drivers of variation in more localized social and environmental outcomes across production sites, which may result from local, national, and global actors and institutions that may interact. I provide a brief overview of the dominant literature on supply chain governance, highlighting the tendency to take an actor-centric approach. I then identify opportunities to study local social and environmental consequences of networked production using a more explicitly multi-actor and multi-level approach that can allow us to identify potential trade-offs, double wins, or spillovers between social and environmental outcomes.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of supply chain governance through a multi-level lens, emphasizing the interplay between structure and context. By integrating concepts from network theory, environmental studies, and labor economics, we propose a framework that addresses the complexity and polycentricity inherent in modern supply chains. Our analysis reveals that effective governance requires a nuanced understanding of the diverse actors, institutions, and environmental factors that shape supply chain operations. We argue that a multi-level approach, which considers both macro and micro contexts, is essential for fostering resilience, sustainability, and equity in global supply networks. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how contextual factors such as regulatory environments, labor conditions, and ecological constraints influence governance mechanisms. The findings underscore the importance of adaptive, context-sensitive strategies in navigating the challenges of supply chain governance, offering valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers aiming to enhance the robustness and fairness of supply chain systems.", "label": 0}
