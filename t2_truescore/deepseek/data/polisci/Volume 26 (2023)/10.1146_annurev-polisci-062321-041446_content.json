{"grounding": "The concept of racist dehumanization is essential for political scientists who seek to understand the nature, scope, and consequences of white racial prejudice in the United States today. Racist dehumanization consists of a variety of processes that construct, refashion, and maintain race by coding some people as white and therefore fully human and others as other than white and therefore less than fully human. In this review, we focus on the racist dehumanization of Indigenous people and Black people, arguing that processes of dehumanization have long been implicated in both the practice of race-making and concurrent efforts to exploit and dominate racialized groups. We posit that contemporary white racial prejudice can be understood, in part, as the residue of these processes, and we conclude by describing how accounting for racist dehumanization can transform the study of white racial prejudice.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of racist dehumanization in the United States, focusing on its political underpinnings and societal ramifications. By examining historical and contemporary instances of dehumanization against Black and Indigenous populations, alongside the perpetuation of white supremacy, the research highlights the mechanisms through which racial prejudice is sustained and normalized. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates sociology, political science, and psychology, the analysis reveals how dehumanizing rhetoric and policies are strategically employed to marginalize and oppress racial minorities, thereby reinforcing systemic inequalities. The paper also explores the role of racial attitudes in shaping public opinion and policy, arguing that a deeper understanding of these processes is crucial for dismantling racist structures. Through this exploration, the study aims to contribute to the broader discourse on race and racism, offering insights into the challenges and possibilities for achieving racial justice in the United States.", "label": 1}
