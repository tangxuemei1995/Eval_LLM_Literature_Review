{"grounding": "This article explores the effects of the state on the creation of social trust. It identifies four theories connecting these two variables. The first and probably most important one stresses the role of the state as a third-party punisher of free-riders, especially in large societies where people have continuous interactions with strangers. The second claims that citizens extrapolate state officers’ corruption levels to ordinary citizens’ trustworthiness. The third claims that the state promotes trust by increasing income equality, and the final one claims that the state fosters trust by providing information about types of people. Finally, the article discusses how the empirical models relating to the state and trust deal with endogeneity problems, how outcomes from experimental analyses question the results obtained from observational data, and how this work affects our ideas about what trust ultimately refers to.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between the state and trust, focusing on the impact of sanctions and corruption on public confidence in governmental institutions. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the research synthesizes findings from political science, sociology, and economics to analyze how state actions, particularly those involving sanctions and corruption, influence trust levels among citizens. The investigation reveals that while sanctions can erode trust by highlighting state vulnerabilities and inefficiencies, corruption significantly undermines it by fostering perceptions of injustice and inequality. Through a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, this paper argues that rebuilding trust requires transparent governance, accountability, and effective anti-corruption measures. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on state legitimacy and the mechanisms through which trust can be restored or maintained in the face of governance challenges.", "label": 1}
