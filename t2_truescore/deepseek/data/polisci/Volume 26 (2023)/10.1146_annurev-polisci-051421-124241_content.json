{"grounding": "Global climate change is opening up new questions and reinvigorating old lines of inquiry in the study of international energy politics. Many policymakers and stakeholders are pushing for a clean energy transition away from the fossil fuels that have long dominated the world's energy supply. On some issues, there is considerable consensus between political scientists and other analysts, such as the basic categories of the “winners” and “losers” from the clean energy transition. On other issues, however, political science tends to depart significantly from other disciplines. The politics of the desired clean energy transition are highly complicated and filled with obstacles beyond those typically highlighted by either economics or physical sciences. For these reasons, energy politics associated with oil and other fossil fuels are far from over and continue to develop, even as new political dynamics associated with the clean energy transition emerge.", "generated_text": "In the era of climate change, international energy politics has become a pivotal arena for global cooperation and conflict, shaping the trajectory of the clean energy transition. This paper explores the intricate dynamics of energy politics, focusing on the role of oil as both a driver of economic growth and a source of geopolitical tension. It examines how the imperative for a clean energy transition is reshaping distributive politics, influencing the allocation of resources and power among nations. The study highlights the challenges and opportunities presented by the shift towards renewable energy sources, analyzing the strategies employed by states to secure their energy futures while addressing the urgent need for climate action. Through a comprehensive review of recent developments, this paper contributes to the understanding of how international energy politics is evolving in response to the dual pressures of climate change and the global demand for sustainable energy solutions.", "label": 0}
