{"grounding": "We provide a unified language for studying power sharing in authoritarian regimes. Power-sharing deals entail not only sharing spoils between a ruler and challenger, but also establishing an enforcement mechanism. An arrangement does not truly share power without reallocating power to make it costly for the ruler to renege. Institutional concessions, such as delegating agenda control over policy decisions or empowering third-party enforcers, can reallocate power. However, weak institutions create a Catch-22 that inhibits credible commitment. When institutions are weak, self-enforcing power sharing is still possible if challengers have coercive means to defend their spoils. However, challengers can leverage their coercive capabilities to overthrow the ruler. This double-edged sword implies that a strategic dictator shares power only under specific conditions: challengers can credibly punish an autocratic ruler; if the ruler shares power, the challenger must willingly forgo taking harmful actions; and the ruler willingly acquiesces to diminished power and rents.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of authoritarian power sharing, exploring its foundational concepts, operational mechanisms, and strategic implementations within authoritarian regimes. By integrating insights from authoritarian politics, civil wars, commitment problems, coups, and institutional frameworks, the research elucidates how power-sharing arrangements are devised and sustained among elite factions to mitigate internal conflicts and stabilize regimes. The analysis highlights the pivotal role of institutions in facilitating credible commitments among power contenders, thereby reducing the likelihood of coups and civil wars. Furthermore, the study examines the strategic use of power-sharing mechanisms as tools for co-optation, repression, and negotiation, offering a comprehensive understanding of their impact on regime durability and political stability. Through a multidisciplinary approach, this research contributes to the broader discourse on authoritarian resilience and the complexities of governance in non-democratic contexts.", "label": 1}
