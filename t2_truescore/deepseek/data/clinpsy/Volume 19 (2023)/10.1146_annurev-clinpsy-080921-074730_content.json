{"grounding": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified racism as a serious threat to public health. Structural racism is a fundamental cause of inequity within interconnected institutions and the social environments in which we live and develop. This review illustrates how these ethnoracial inequities impact risk for the extended psychosis phenotype. Black and Latinx populations are more likely than White populations to report psychotic experiences in the United States due to social determining factors such as racial discrimination, food insecurity, and police violence. Unless we dismantle these discriminatory structures, the chronic stress and biological consequences of this race-based stress and trauma will impact the next generation's risk for psychosis directly, and indirectly through Black and Latina pregnant mothers. Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions show promise in improving prognosis, but coordinated care and other treatments still need to be more accessible and address the racism-specific adversities many Black and Latinx people face in their neighborhoods and social environments.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between racism, social determinants, and the onset of psychosis, with a particular focus on racial discrimination and its impact on psychotic experiences. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine how structural racism and neighborhood factors contribute to the development of early psychosis among marginalized racial groups. The analysis highlights the role of social determinants, such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and community safety, in exacerbating the risk of psychosis in environments marked by racial inequality. By synthesizing findings from epidemiological studies, psychological research, and sociological investigations, this paper aims to shed light on the pathways through which racism influences mental health outcomes. The findings underscore the urgent need for interventions that address the root causes of racial disparities in psychosis, advocating for policies that promote equity and social justice to mitigate the impact of racism on mental health.", "label": 1}
