{"grounding": "While boys and men have historically been underrepresented in eating disorder research, increasing interest and research during the twenty-first century have contributed important knowledge to the field. In this article, we review the epidemiology of eating disorders and muscle dysmorphia (the pathological pursuit of muscularity) in boys and men; specific groups of men at increased risk for eating disorders; sociocultural, psychological, and biological vulnerability factors; and male-specific assessment measures. We also provide an overview of current research on eating disorder and muscle dysmorphia prevention efforts, treatment outcomes, and mortality risk in samples of boys and men. Priorities for future research are including boys and men in epidemiological studies to track changes in incidence, identifying (neuro)biological factors contributing to risk, eliminating barriers to treatment access and utilization, and refining male-specific prevention and treatment efforts.", "generated_text": "Eating disorders, traditionally perceived as predominantly affecting females, are increasingly recognized in boys and men, necessitating a deeper understanding of their epidemiology, intervention strategies, and outcomes in this population. This study aims to explore the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical presentations of eating disorders among males, highlighting the unique challenges they face in diagnosis and treatment. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we identify gaps in current research and propose targeted interventions tailored to the needs of boys and men. The findings underscore the importance of gender-sensitive approaches in both clinical practice and public health initiatives to improve detection rates, treatment efficacy, and long-term recovery outcomes. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence advocating for a more inclusive understanding of eating disorders, emphasizing the need for further studies to address the disparities in care and support for affected males.", "label": 1}
