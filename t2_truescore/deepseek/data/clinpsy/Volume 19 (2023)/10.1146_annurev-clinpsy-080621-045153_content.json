{"grounding": "Research conducted over the past several decades has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the immune system in neural and psychological development and function across the life span. Our goal in this review is to introduce this dynamic area of research to a psychological audience and highlight its relevance for clinical psychology. We begin by introducing the basic physiology of immune-to-brain signaling and the neuroimmune network, focusing on inflammation. Drawing from preclinical and clinical research, we then examine effects of immune activation on key psychological domains, including positive and negative valence systems, social processes, cognition, and arousal (fatigue, sleep), as well as links with psychological disorders (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia). We also consider psychosocial stress as a critical modulator of neuroimmune activity and focus on early life adversity. Finally, we highlight psychosocial and mindâ€“body interventions that influence the immune system and may promote neuroimmune resilience.", "generated_text": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) explores the intricate interactions between psychological processes, the nervous system, and the immune system, offering insights into how immune-to-brain communication influences behavior and mental health. This field has illuminated the role of inflammation in mediating the effects of psychosocial stress on the development of psychiatric conditions, such as depression, through mechanisms like sickness behavior. Translational science approaches within PNI have been pivotal in bridging the gap between basic research and clinical applications, providing a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of mental health disorders. This introduction to PNI underscores the importance of immune-to-brain communication in clinical psychology, highlighting the potential for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the immune system to mitigate the impact of stress and inflammation on mental health.", "label": 1}
