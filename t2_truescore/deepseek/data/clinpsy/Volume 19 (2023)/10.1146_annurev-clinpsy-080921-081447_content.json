{"grounding": "Parental incarceration is a significant, inequitably distributed form of adversity that affects millions of US children and increases their risk for emotional and behavioral problems. An emerging body of research also indicates, however, that children exhibit resilience in the context of parental incarceration. In this article, we review evidence regarding the adverse implications of parental incarceration for children's adjustment and consider factors that account for these consequences with special attention to naturally occurring processes and interventions that may mitigate risk and contribute to positive youth development. We also offer a critical reframing of resilience research and argue that (a) scholars should adopt more contextualized approaches to the study of resilience that are sensitive to intersecting inequalities and (b) resilience research and practice should be conceptualized as important complements to, rather than substitutes for, social and institutional change. We conclude by offering social justiceâ€“informed recommendations for future research and practice.", "generated_text": "This review critically examines the literature on risk and resilience among children with incarcerated parents, employing an intersectional lens to explore the multifaceted challenges and protective factors that influence their development. While existing research predominantly highlights the adverse outcomes associated with parental incarceration, such as increased risk of behavioral problems, academic difficulties, and emotional distress, this paper argues for a more nuanced understanding that also considers the potential for resilience. By integrating perspectives from social justice, the review emphasizes the importance of addressing systemic inequalities and advocating for interventions that support the well-being of these children. The paper calls for a reframing of the discourse from a deficit-focused approach to one that recognizes the strengths and agency of children with incarcerated parents, suggesting that future research and policy should aim to empower these children and their families through culturally responsive and community-based support systems.", "label": 1}
