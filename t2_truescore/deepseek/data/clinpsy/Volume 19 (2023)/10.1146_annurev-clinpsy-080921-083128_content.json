{"grounding": "The use of repeated, momentary, real-world assessment methods known as the Experience Sampling Method and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has been broadly embraced over the last few decades. These methods have extended our assessment reach beyond lengthy retrospective self-reports as they can capture everyday experiences in their immediate context, including affect, behavior, symptoms, and cognitions. In this review we evaluate nine conceptual, methodological, and psychometric issues about EMA with the goal of stimulating conversation and guiding future research on these matters: the extent to which participants are actually reporting momentary experiences, respondentsâ€™ interpretation of momentary questions, the use of comparison standards in responding, efforts to increase the EMA reporting period beyond the moment to longer periods within a day, training of EMA study participants, concerns about selection bias of respondents, the impact of missing EMA assessments, the reliability of momentary data, and for which purposes EMA might be considered a gold standard for assessment. Resolution of these issues should have far-reaching implications for advancing the field.", "generated_text": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) have emerged as pivotal tools in capturing real-time data across various research domains. Despite their growing popularity, these methodologies are not without challenges. This study critically evaluates pressing issues inherent in EMA/ESM, focusing on content validity, the establishment of a gold standard, training requirements, missingness, reliability, selection bias, and the development of robust comparison standards. Content validity is scrutinized to ensure that the measures accurately reflect the constructs of interest. The quest for a gold standard in EMA/ESM is explored, highlighting the need for consensus on methodological best practices. Training emerges as a crucial factor in enhancing data quality and participant compliance. Missingness and reliability are examined to address data integrity concerns, while selection bias is analyzed to understand its impact on study generalizability. Finally, the importance of establishing comparison standards is emphasized to facilitate meaningful interpretation of EMA/ESM findings. This comprehensive review aims to guide researchers in navigating the complexities of EMA/ESM, thereby advancing the field's methodological rigor and the validity of its findings.", "label": 1}
