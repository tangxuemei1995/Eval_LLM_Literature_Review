{"grounding": "Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) children and adolescents are an increasingly visible yet highly stigmatized group. These youth experience more psychological distress than not only their cisgender, heterosexual peers but also their cisgender, sexual minority peers. In this review, we document these mental health disparities and discuss potential explanations for them using a minority stress framework. We also discuss factors that may increase and decrease TGD youth's vulnerability to psychological distress. Further, we review interventions, including gender-affirming medical care, that may improve mental health in TGD youth. We conclude by discussing limitations of current research and suggestions for the future.", "generated_text": "This study explores the mental health challenges faced by transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth, a population at heightened risk for psychological distress due to societal stigma, discrimination, and lack of support. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we identify key factors contributing to mental health disparities among TGD adolescents and children, including family rejection, bullying, and barriers to accessing gender-affirming care. The findings underscore the critical need for inclusive policies, supportive educational environments, and accessible mental health services tailored to the unique needs of TGD youth. This research aims to inform interventions that promote resilience and well-being among this vulnerable population, advocating for a more inclusive and understanding society.", "label": 1}
