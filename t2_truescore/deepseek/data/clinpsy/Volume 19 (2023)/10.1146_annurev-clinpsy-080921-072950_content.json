{"grounding": "This review updates and extends Gone & Trimble's (2012) prior review of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) mental health. First, it defines AI/AN populations in the USA, with an explanation of the importance of political citizenship in semisovereign Tribal Nations as primary for categorizing this population. Second, it presents an updated summary of what is known about AI/AN mental health, with careful notation of recurrent findings concerning community inequities in addiction, trauma, and suicide. Third, this article reviews key literature about AI/AN community mental health services appearing since 2010, including six randomized controlled trials of recognizable mental health treatments. Finally, it reimagines the AI/AN mental health enterprise in response to an “alter-Native psy-ence,” which recasts prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and harnesses postcolonial meaning-making through Indigenized therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, AI/AN Tribal Nations must determine for themselves how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services for wider community benefit.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of evidence-based practices (EBP) with alter-Native psy-ence in community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Recognizing the unique cultural, historical, and social contexts of AI/AN communities, the research emphasizes the necessity of incorporating Indigenized therapies that resonate with traditional healing practices and worldviews. The paper critically examines the challenges posed by postcolonial anomie, a condition characterized by the loss of cultural identity and social cohesion, and its impact on mental health outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the study identifies key strategies for reconciling EBP with alter-Native psy-ence, including community-based participatory research, culturally adapted interventions, and the empowerment of local healers. The findings underscore the importance of a hybrid approach that respects indigenous knowledge systems while leveraging the strengths of conventional mental health practices. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on culturally competent mental health care and offers practical recommendations for policymakers and practitioners working with AI/AN populations.", "label": 1}
