{"grounding": "Acculturation and psychopathology are linked in integrated, interactional, intersectional, and dynamic ways that span different types of intercultural contact, levels of analysis, timescales, and contexts. A developmental psychopathology approach can be useful to explain why, how, and what about psychological acculturation results in later adaptation or maladaptation for acculturating youth and adults. This review applies a conceptual model of acculturation and developmental psychopathology to a widely used framework of acculturation variables producing an Integrated Process Framework of Acculturation Variables (IP-FAV). This new comprehensive framework depicts major predisposing acculturation conditions (why) as well as acculturation orientations and processes (how) that result in adaptation and maladaptation across the life span (what). The IP-FAV is unique in that it integrates both proximal and remote acculturation variables and explicates key acculturation processes to inform research, practice, and policy.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between acculturation processes—both proximal and remote—and developmental psychopathology among immigrant and refugee populations in the context of globalization. Acculturation, the process of cultural and psychological change following intercultural contact, is examined through its proximal (direct cultural exchange) and remote (indirect cultural influence) dimensions, highlighting their distinct impacts on mental health outcomes. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, the research identifies resilience factors that mitigate the risk of psychopathology in these populations, emphasizing the role of social support, cultural identity, and adaptive coping strategies. The findings underscore the importance of culturally sensitive interventions and policies that address the unique challenges faced by immigrants and refugees, advocating for a holistic approach to mental health that considers the multifaceted nature of acculturation in a globalized world.", "label": 1}
