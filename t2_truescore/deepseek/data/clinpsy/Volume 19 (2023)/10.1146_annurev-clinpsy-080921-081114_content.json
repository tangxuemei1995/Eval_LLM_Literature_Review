{"grounding": "For many people worldwide, supernatural beliefs and attributions—those focused on God, the devil, demons, spirits, an afterlife, karma, or fate—are part of everyday life. Although not widely studied in clinical psychology, these beliefs and attributions are a key part of human diversity. This article provides a broad overview of research on supernatural beliefs and attributions with special attention to their psychological relevance: They can serve as coping resources, sources of distress, psychopathology signals, moral guides, and decision-making tools. Although supernatural attributions sometimes involve dramatic experiences seen to violate natural laws, people more commonly think of supernatural entities working indirectly through natural events. A whole host of factors can lead people to make supernatural attributions, including contextual factors, specific beliefs, psychopathology, cognitive styles and personality, and social and cultural influences. Our aim is to provide clinical psychologists with an entry point into this rich, fascinating, and often overlooked literature.", "generated_text": "This study explores the phenomenon of supernatural attributions, where individuals perceive events as being caused by entities such as God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma. Drawing on a comprehensive review of scientific literature, we examine the psychological and cultural factors that influence these attributions, particularly in the context of supernatural and paranormal beliefs. The research highlights the role of anomalous experiences and spiritual struggles in shaping individuals' interpretations of events, suggesting a complex interplay between cognitive processes, emotional states, and cultural narratives. Furthermore, the study investigates how religion and spiritual experiences contribute to the development and reinforcement of supernatural attributions, offering insights into the diverse ways people make sense of the world around them. By integrating findings from psychology, sociology, and religious studies, this research aims to deepen our understanding of the human tendency to attribute causality to supernatural forces.", "label": 1}
