{"grounding": "Racism constitutes a significant risk to the mental health of African American children, adolescents, and emerging adults. This review evaluates recent literature examining ethnic and racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity and spirituality, and family and parenting as racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors that shape the impact of racism on youth mental health. Representative studies, purported mechanisms, and critiques of prior research are presented for each factor. Recent studies of racism and resilience revisit foundational resilience factors from prior research while reflecting new and important advances (e.g., consideration of gender, cultural context, structural racism), providing important insights for the development of prevention and intervention efforts and policy that can alleviate mental health suffering and promote health and mental health equity for African American youth.", "generated_text": "This study explores the multifaceted resilience factors that contribute to the mental health of African American youth amidst the challenges posed by racism. Focusing on the roles of racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity, spirituality, family dynamics, and parenting practices, the research aims to uncover how these elements collectively foster resilience and psychological well-being. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical studies, the paper highlights the protective mechanisms that mitigate the adverse effects of racial discrimination and stress. The findings underscore the importance of culturally informed interventions and support systems that leverage these resilience factors to promote mental health and resilience among African American youth. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between racial, ethnic, and cultural factors in shaping mental health outcomes.", "label": 1}
