{"grounding": "Numerous studies associate childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) with adverse adjustment in the domains of mental health, social, and academic functioning. This review synthesizes this literature and highlights the critical role of child self-regulation in mediating children's adjustment outcomes. We discuss major methodological problems of the field, including failure to consider the effects of prenatal IPV exposure and the limitations of variable-oriented and cross-sectional approaches. Finally, we present a comprehensive theoretical model of the effects of IPV on children's development. This model includes three mechanistic pathwaysâ€”one that is unique to IPV (maternal representations) and two that are consistent with the effects of other stressors (maternal mental health and physiological functioning). In our model, the effects of these three pathways on child adjustment outcomes are mediated through parenting and child self-regulation. Future research directions and clinical implications are discussed in the context of the model.", "generated_text": "Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a pervasive issue with profound implications for child development, extending beyond the immediate physical harm to encompass long-term psychological and emotional consequences. This study explores the developmental trajectories of children exposed to IPV, focusing on the interplay between prenatal stress, disrupted attachment processes, and subsequent developmental outcomes. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key mechanisms through which IPV impacts children, including altered stress response systems, impaired cognitive and emotional regulation, and compromised social functioning. The findings underscore the critical role of early intervention and support systems in mitigating the adverse effects of IPV on child development. By elucidating the complex pathways linking IPV exposure to developmental outcomes, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by children in violent households and informs the development of targeted interventions aimed at fostering resilience and promoting healthy development.", "label": 1}
