{"grounding": "Gradient-based methods have been widely used for system design and optimization in diverse application domains. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in studying theoretical properties of these methods in the context of control and reinforcement learning. This article surveys some of the recent developments on policy optimization, a gradient-based iterative approach for feedback control synthesis that has been popularized by successes of reinforcement learning. We take an interdisciplinary perspective in our exposition that connects control theory, reinforcement learning, and large-scale optimization. We review a number of recently developed theoretical results on the optimization landscape, global convergence, and sample complexityof gradient-based methods for various continuous control problems, such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), \n\n control, risk-sensitive control, linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, and output feedback synthesis. In conjunction with these optimization results, we also discuss how direct policy optimization handles stability and robustness concerns in learning-based control, two main desiderata in control engineering. We conclude the survey by pointing out several challenges and opportunities at the intersection of learning and control.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of policy optimization in the context of learning control policies, with a focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and feedback control synthesis. We aim to bridge the gap between empirical successes in RL and the theoretical frameworks that can explain and guide these successes. By examining the convergence properties, stability, and robustness of policy optimization algorithms, we provide insights into their effectiveness for control tasks. Our analysis highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between policy optimization techniques and the dynamics of the controlled system. We propose a set of principles for designing policy optimization algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective, ensuring that they can be reliably applied to a wide range of control problems. This work contributes to the broader goal of developing a comprehensive theoretical foundation for policy optimization in learning control policies, paving the way for more efficient and robust control strategies in complex environments.", "label": 1}
