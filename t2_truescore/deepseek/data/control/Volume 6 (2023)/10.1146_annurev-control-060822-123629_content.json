{"grounding": "This review aims to present recent developments in modeling and control of multiagent systems. A particular focus is set on crowd dynamics characterized by complex interactions among agents, also called social interactions, and large-scale systems. Specifically, in a crowd each individual agent interacts with a field generated by the other agents and the environment. These systems can be modeled at the microscopic scale by ordinary differential equations, while an alternative description at the mesoscopic scale is given by a partial differential equation for the propagation of the probability density of the agents. Control actions can be applied at the individual level as well as at the level of the corresponding fields. This article presents and compares different control types, and the specific application to multilane, multiclass traffic is developed in some detail, showing the main tools at work in a hybrid setting with relevant impacts on autonomous driving.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of crowd behavior through the lens of multiagent systems, focusing on the modeling and control mechanisms that govern such complex interactions. By employing the concept of interacting agent systems, we explore the collective behavior of agents, ranging from pedestrians to autonomous vehicles, under various environmental and social influences. The research emphasizes the significance of the mean-field limit approach in simplifying the analysis of large-scale systems, enabling the derivation of macroscopic models from microscopic interactions. Furthermore, we investigate the role of feedback control strategies in enhancing the efficiency and safety of these systems, particularly in the context of autonomous vehicle navigation and coordination. The findings contribute to the development of robust frameworks for predicting and managing crowd dynamics, offering insights into the design of intelligent systems capable of adapting to the ever-changing demands of urban environments.", "label": 1}
