{"grounding": "Electric power systems are undergoing an unprecedented transition from fossil fuelâ€“based power plants to low-inertia systems that rely predominantly on power electronics and renewable energy resources. This article reviews the resulting control challenges and modeling fallacies, at both the device and system level, and focuses on novel aspects or classical concepts that need to be revised in light of the transition to low-inertia systems. To this end, we survey the literature on modeling of low-inertia systems, review research on the control of grid-connected power converters, and discuss the frequency dynamics of low-inertia systems. Moreover, we discuss system-level services from a control perspective. Overall, we conclude that the system-theoretic mindset is essential to bridge different research communities and understand the complex interactions of power electronics, electric machines, and their controls in large-scale low-inertia power systems.", "generated_text": "The transition towards renewable energy sources has significantly reduced the inertia in power systems, posing challenges to their stability and control. This paper explores advanced control strategies for low-inertia power systems, focusing on the integration of power electronics control and grid-forming techniques. We investigate the role of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs) in enhancing system flexibility and reliability by aggregating distributed energy resources (DERs) to mimic the behavior of traditional power plants. The study highlights the importance of adaptive control algorithms that can respond to rapid changes in system conditions, ensuring stable operation under low-inertia scenarios. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and simulation-based analysis, we propose a framework for the effective management of low-inertia systems, emphasizing the synergy between grid-forming control and DVPPs. Our findings contribute to the development of robust control solutions that support the sustainable integration of renewable energy into the grid.", "label": 1}
