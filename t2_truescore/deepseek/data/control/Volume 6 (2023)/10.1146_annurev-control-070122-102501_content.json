{"grounding": "Early research on physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) has necessarily focused on device design—the creation of compliant and sensorized hardware, such as exoskeletons, prostheses, and robot arms, that enables people to safely come in contact with robotic systems and to communicate about their collaborative intent. As hardware capabilities have become sufficient for many applications, and as computing has become more powerful, algorithms that support fluent and expressive use of pHRI systems have begun to play a prominent role in determining the systems’ usefulness. In this review, we describe a selection of representative algorithmic approaches that regulate and interpret pHRI, describing the progression from algorithms based on physical analogies, such as admittance control, to computational methods based on higher-level reasoning, which take advantage of multimodal communication channels. Existing algorithmic approaches largely enable task-specific pHRI, but they do not generalize to versatile human–robot collaboration. Throughout the review and in our discussion of next steps, we therefore argue that emergent embodied dialogue—bidirectional, multimodal communication that can be learned through continuous interaction—is one of the next frontiers of pHRI.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamics of embodied communication within the context of human–robot collaboration, focusing on how physical interaction facilitates mutual understanding and cooperation between humans and assistive robots. By analyzing existing literature and empirical data, we investigate the mechanisms through which robots interpret human gestures, postures, and touch, and how they respond in a manner that is comprehensible and effective for human partners. The research highlights the importance of designing robots with advanced sensory and motor capabilities to enhance their ability to engage in nuanced physical interactions. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of assistive robots in healthcare, rehabilitation, and domestic settings, where effective communication is crucial for successful collaboration. The study concludes with recommendations for future research directions, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate insights from robotics, cognitive science, and human–computer interaction to advance our understanding of embodied communication in human–robot systems.", "label": 0}
