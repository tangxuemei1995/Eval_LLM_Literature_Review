{"grounding": "This article provides an exposition of the field of adaptive control and its intersections with reinforcement learning. Adaptive control and reinforcement learning are two different methods that are both commonly employed for the control of uncertain systems. Historically, adaptive control has excelled at real-time control of systems with specific model structures through adaptive rules that learn the underlying parameters while providing strict guarantees on stability, asymptotic performance, and learning. Reinforcement learning methods are applicable to a broad class of systems and are able to produce near-optimal policies for highly complex control tasks. This is often enabled by significant offline training via simulation or the collection of large input-state datasets. This article attempts to compare adaptive control and reinforcement learning using a common framework. The problem statement in each field and highlights of their results are outlined. Two specific examples of dynamic systems are used to illustrate the details of the two methods, their advantages, and their deficiencies. The need for real-time control methods that leverage tools from both approaches is motivated through the lens of this common framework.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the convergence of adaptive control and reinforcement learning (RL), two paradigms that aim to optimize system performance through adaptation. Adaptive control focuses on adjusting controller parameters in real-time to maintain desired system behavior despite uncertainties and changes in system dynamics. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, seeks to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment, guided by reward signals. We investigate how principles from adaptive control, such as stability, robustness, and optimality, can inform and enhance RL algorithms. Specifically, we examine the integration of adaptive control techniques into RL frameworks to improve learning efficiency, ensure stability during the learning process, and enhance robustness to environmental uncertainties. The paper also discusses the potential of RL to address challenges in adaptive control, such as the need for model-free approaches and the handling of complex, high-dimensional systems. Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and practical applications, this study aims to bridge the gap between these two fields, offering a comprehensive perspective on their intersections and potential synergies.", "label": 1}
