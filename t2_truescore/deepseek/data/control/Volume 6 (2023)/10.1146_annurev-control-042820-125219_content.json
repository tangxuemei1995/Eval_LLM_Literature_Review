{"grounding": "Cost, efficiency, and emissions concerns have motivated the application of advanced control techniques to multiple carrier energy systems. Research in energy management and control over the last two decades has shown that significant energy and CO2 emissions reductions can be achieved. Within the last decade, this work has expanded to the domain of interconnected energy systems. The interconnection control of multiple energy carriers, conversion devices, and energy storage provides increased flexibility and energy/CO2 reduction potential. The focus of this article is on outlining the control methods required for these systems over a range of energy consumption and timescales. Dynamic interactions between multicarrier systems occur over timescales ranging from 15 minutes to seasons. The constrained nature of the resulting control problems favors optimization-based approaches.", "generated_text": "This study explores the control strategies for multicarrier energy systems, focusing on the transition from individual building energy control to broader network-level management. By integrating energy hubs with advanced control methodologies, including distributed, cooperative, and predictive control, the research aims to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of energy systems. The investigation highlights the importance of adaptive control mechanisms that can respond to dynamic energy demands and supply conditions across different scales. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and case studies, the paper proposes a framework for optimizing energy flows and interactions within multicarrier systems, paving the way for more resilient and intelligent energy networks. The findings underscore the potential of integrated control approaches in achieving a balanced and efficient energy ecosystem.", "label": 0}
