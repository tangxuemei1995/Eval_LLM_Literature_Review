{"grounding": "Embodiment is a crucial concept for the autonomy and adaptivity of systems working in the physical world with high degrees of uncertainty and complexity. The physical bodies of autonomous adaptive systems heavily influence the information flow from the environment to the central processing (and vice versa), requiring us to consider the full triad of brain, body, and environment to investigate intelligent behavior. This article provides a structured review of embodied intelligence with a special emphasis on the concept of timescales and their role in self-organization and the emergence of complex behavior. We classify embodied interactions into three types—cross-timescale matching, separation, and nontemporal sequences—and discuss how these interactions were studied in the past as well as how they can contribute to the systematic investigation of complex autonomous and adaptive systems in both biological and artificial entities.", "generated_text": "The exploration of embodied intelligence within autonomous adaptive systems (AAS) presents a pivotal frontier in understanding the dynamic interplay between physical form and cognitive function. This study delves into the critical role of embodiment in facilitating adaptive behaviors across varying timescales, drawing parallels from biological systems to inform the design of bioinspired robotics. By examining cross-timescale interactions, we uncover how the temporal dynamics of sensory-motor loops and environmental coupling contribute to the robustness and flexibility of AAS. Our analysis highlights the importance of integrating multi-timescale processes in the development of autonomous systems that can effectively navigate complex, unpredictable environments. Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and empirical evidence, this research advances our comprehension of embodied intelligence, offering novel perspectives for the engineering of adaptive robotic systems that mirror the efficiency and resilience of their biological counterparts.", "label": 1}
