{"grounding": "Space-mounted robotics is becoming increasingly mainstream for many space missions. The aim of this article is threefold: first, to give a broad and quick overview of the importance of spacecraft-mounted robotics for future in-orbit servicing missions; second, to review the basic current approaches for modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic systems; and third, to introduce some new developments in terms of modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators using the language of hypercomplex numbers (dual quaternions). Some outstanding research questions and potential future directions in the field are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of robotics and manipulators on spacecraft for in-orbit servicing, focusing on control strategies, trajectory tracking, and the application of dual quaternions in dynamics and kinematics. The research aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of robotic operations in the challenging environment of space. By leveraging dual quaternions, we propose a novel approach to simplify the complex dynamics and kinematics of spacecraft-mounted manipulators, facilitating more accurate control and trajectory tracking. The findings contribute to advancing the capabilities of in-orbit servicing missions, ensuring the sustainability and longevity of space assets.", "label": 1}
