{"grounding": "Networked control systems, where feedback loops are closed over communication networks, arise in several domains, including smart energy grids, autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and many industrial and robotic systems active in service, production, agriculture, and smart homes and cities. In these settings, the two main layers of the system, control and communication, strongly affect each other's performance, and they also reveal the interaction between a cyber-system component, represented by information-based computing and communication technologies, and a physical-system component, represented by the environment that needs to be controlled. The information access and distribution constraints required to achieve reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems have been intensively studied over the course of roughly two decades. This article reviews some of the cornerstone results in this area, draws a map for what we have learned over these years, and describes the new challenges that we will face in the future. Rather than simply listing different results, we present them in a coherent fashion using a uniform notation, and we also put them in context, highlighting both their theoreticalinsights and their practical significance. Particular attention is given to recent developments related to decentralized estimation in distributed sensing and communication systems and the information-theoretic value of event timing in the context of networked control.", "generated_text": "Networked control systems (NCS) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent a paradigm shift in the design and implementation of control strategies, where information exchange is pivotal for system performance and stability. This paper delves into the multifaceted role of information within these systems, particularly under communication constraints that challenge traditional control methodologies. We explore the implications of decentralized inference, where local decision-making must compensate for the lack of global information, and the criticality of timing information in ensuring the synchronization and efficiency of distributed control actions. Furthermore, we investigate the emerging paradigm of event-triggered control, which optimizes communication by transmitting data only when necessary, thereby reducing network load and enhancing system resilience. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements and theoretical developments, this study highlights the intricate balance between information availability, system complexity, and control performance. Our analysis underscores the necessity for innovative approaches that can navigate the trade-offs inherent in networked estimation and control, paving the way for more robust, efficient, and scalable solutions in the era of interconnected systems.", "label": 1}
