{"grounding": "Approximately 1.1. billion people worldwide live with some form of disability, and assistive technology has the potential to increase their overall quality of life. However, the end usersâ€™ perspective and needs are often not sufficiently considered during the development of this technology, leading to frustration and nonuse of existing devices. Since its first competition in 2016, CYBATHLON has aimed to drive innovation in the field of assistive technology by motivating teams to involve end users more actively in the development process and to tailor novel devices to their actual daily-life needs. Competition tasks therefore represent unsolved daily-life challenges for people with disabilities and serve the purpose of benchmarking the latest developments from research laboratories and companies from around the world. This review describes each of the competition disciplines, their contributions to assistive technology, and remaining challenges in the user-centered development of this technology.", "generated_text": "The CYBATHLON competition has emerged as a pivotal platform for advancing assistive technologies, fostering innovation through its unique blend of competition and collaboration. This event emphasizes user-centered design, directly involving people with disabilities in the development and testing of assistive devices. By simulating daily-life challenges, CYBATHLON not only showcases the latest technological advancements but also highlights the practical needs and preferences of end-users. This approach has significantly contributed to the creation of more effective, inclusive, and accessible technologies, enhancing the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Furthermore, the competition serves as a catalyst for interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together engineers, designers, healthcare professionals, and users to push the boundaries of what is possible in assistive technology. Through its global impact, CYBATHLON continues to inspire a future where technology empowers everyone, regardless of physical ability.", "label": 0}
