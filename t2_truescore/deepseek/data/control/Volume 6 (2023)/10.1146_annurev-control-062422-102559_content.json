{"grounding": "Surface tension effects are known to be dominant at the submillimeter scale. Within this context, the literature has extensively described the underlying physics (e.g., surface tension, wetting, surface texturation, and coatings), and capillary forces have been exploited in a variety of applications (e.g., capillary picking, self-alignment, capillary sealing, and capillary bearings). As several stimuli can be used to control liquid menisci, these forces have been used mainly in microrobotics in open loop (i.e., without real-time feedback). However, at least two major sources of uncertainty hinder these forces from working properly in open loop: the variability due to contact-angle hysteresis (the difference between wetting and unwetting) and the variability in the involved volume of liquid. To be able to reject these disturbances, successful sensor integration and associated advanced control schemes need to be embedded in capillary microrobotic microsystems. This article analyzes research contributions in this field from three different perspectives: the stimulus action of the surface tension effect (light, B-field, etc.), the application field (actuation, picking, sealing, etc.), and the sensing and control schemes. Technologically complex developments coexist with elegant and straightforward engineering solutions. Biological aspects of surface tension are not included in this review.", "generated_text": "The exploration of liquid surface tension and capillary forces has opened new avenues in the field of microrobotics, offering innovative solutions for micromanipulation tasks that were previously challenging to achieve. This study delves into the principles of surface tension and its exploitation in the design and operation of microrobots, enabling precise control and manipulation at the microscale. By leveraging the inherent properties of liquid interfaces, microrobots can perform complex tasks such as targeted drug delivery, microassembly, and environmental monitoring with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. The research highlights the development of microrobotic systems that utilize capillary forces for locomotion and manipulation, demonstrating their potential in various applications including biomedical engineering, microelectronics, and environmental science. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental validation, this work provides insights into the optimization of microrobotic designs for enhanced performance and reliability. The findings underscore the significance of surface tension as a fundamental force in microrobotics, paving the way for future advancements in the field and the realization of more sophisticated micromanipulation technologies.", "label": 0}
