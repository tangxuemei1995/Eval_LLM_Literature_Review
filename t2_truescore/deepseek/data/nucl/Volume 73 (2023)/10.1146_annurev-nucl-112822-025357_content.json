{"grounding": "Ultra-high-energy (UHE, >0.1 PeV) γ-ray astronomy is rapidly evolving into an expanding branch of γ-ray astronomy with the surprising discovery of 12 PeVatrons and the detection of a handful of photons above 1 PeV. Nearly all known celestial object types that have emissions in the TeV band are found also to emit UHE photons. UHE γ-rays have a well-defined horizon inside our Galaxy due to the absorption of infrared and cosmic microwave backgrounds in the Universe. In the last 30 years, traditional cosmic ray (CR) measurement techniques have enabled the detection of UHE γ-rays and opened the last observation window. For leptonic sources, UHE radiation is in the deep Klein–Nishina regime, which is largely suppressed. Therefore, UHE γ-ray detection will be helpful in locating and identifying hadronic radiation sources, tracing the historic pursuit for the origin of CRs around the knee of the spectrum. The Crab Nebula is the focus of attention with measured photon emissions up to 1 PeV. In the absence of hadronic processes, these emissions may indicate the existence of an extreme accelerator of e\n+\ne\n−. Use of CR extensive air shower detection techniques broadens the field of view of the source observations, enabling measurement of UHE radiation surrounding the sources. These observations can probe the particle propagation inside and outside the accelerators and the subsequent injection/escape into the interstellar medium.", "generated_text": "Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy represents a frontier in astrophysics, offering insights into the most energetic processes in the universe. This field leverages advanced observatories like the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) to detect gamma rays with energies exceeding the PeV (peta-electronvolt) scale, thereby identifying potential PeVatrons—cosmic accelerators capable of producing such high-energy particles. The study of these gamma rays, alongside cosmic rays, provides a unique window into the acceleration mechanisms and environments of extreme astrophysical objects, including the Crab Nebula, a well-known gamma-ray source. A key aspect of this research involves the analysis of extensive air showers (EAS) generated when these high-energy particles interact with the Earth's atmosphere. The muon content within these showers serves as a critical diagnostic tool, helping to distinguish between gamma-ray and cosmic ray origins. This distinction is vital for understanding the composition and propagation of cosmic rays, as well as for identifying the sources of ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Through the integration of observational data from LHAASO and theoretical models, this research aims to unravel the mysteries of PeVatrons, shedding light on the acceleration of particles to ultra-high energies and their implications for our understanding of the universe.", "label": 1}
