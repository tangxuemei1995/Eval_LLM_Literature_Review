{"grounding": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides an intense, high-quality source of neutrinos from pion decay at rest. This source was recently used for the first measurements of coherent elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering (CEvNS) by the COHERENT Collaboration, which resulted in new constraints of physics beyond the Standard Model. The SNS neutrino source will enable further CEvNS measurements, exploration of inelastic neutrino–nucleus interactions of particular relevance for understanding supernova neutrinos, and searches for accelerator-produced sub-GeV dark matter. Taking advantage of this unique facility, COHERENT's suite of detectors in Neutrino Alley at the SNS is accumulating more data to address a broad physics program at the intersection of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. This review describes COHERENT's first two CEvNS measurements, their interpretation, and the potential of a future physics program at the SNS.", "generated_text": "The COHERENT collaboration at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) has pioneered the observation of coherent elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering (CEνNS), a process predicted by the Standard Model but unobserved until recently. This groundbreaking work not only confirms a long-standing theoretical prediction but also opens new avenues for exploring neutrino properties, supernova neutrino detection, and the search for physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark matter interactions. Utilizing the unique capabilities of the SNS, COHERENT employs a suite of low-threshold detectors to measure the tiny nuclear recoils induced by neutrino interactions. This paper reviews the experimental setup, the detection of CEνNS, and the implications of these findings for neutrino physics and dark matter research. The results from COHERENT significantly enhance our understanding of neutrino interactions and provide a novel tool for probing the universe's most elusive particles.", "label": 1}
