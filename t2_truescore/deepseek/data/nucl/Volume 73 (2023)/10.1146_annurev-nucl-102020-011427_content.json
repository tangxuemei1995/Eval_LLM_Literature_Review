{"grounding": "In this article, I review scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model in which the top quark plays a special role. Models that aim at the stabilization of the weak scale are presented together with the specific phenomenology of partner states that are characteristic of this type of model. Further, I present models of flavor in which the top quark is singled out as a special flavor in the Standard Model. The flavor and collider phenomenology of these models is broadly presented. Finally, I discuss the possibility that dark matter interacts preferably with the top quark flavor and give an overview of the dark matter phenomenology of these scenarios, as well as collider and flavor signals.", "generated_text": "The top quark, being the heaviest known fundamental particle, offers a unique window into physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This paper explores the pivotal role of the top quark in addressing some of the most pressing questions in particle physics, including the hierarchy problem, flavor physics anomalies, and the nature of dark matter. Through a comprehensive review of current theoretical models and experimental searches, we highlight the top quark's interactions as a probe for New Physics. The study underscores the importance of precision measurements and direct searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future colliders in uncovering BSM phenomena associated with the top quark, thereby advancing our understanding of the fundamental constituents of the universe.", "label": 1}
