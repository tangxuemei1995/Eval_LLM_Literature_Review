{"grounding": "This article is a pedagogical review of searches for long-lived particles at the LHC. It is primarily aimed at experimentalists and theorists seeking to initiate and/or deepen their research in this field. We cover the general theoretical motivation and some example models, the main experimental techniques employed in searches for long-lived particles, and some of the important subtleties involved in estimating signal efficiencies and background rates.", "generated_text": "The search for long-lived particles (LLPs) represents a pivotal frontier in particle physics, offering insights into beyond the Standard Model (BSM) phenomena. This guide focuses on strategies for hunting LLPs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), emphasizing detection techniques, experimental challenges, and theoretical motivations. By leveraging the LHC's unparalleled energy and luminosity, researchers aim to uncover LLPs, which could provide answers to fundamental questions about dark matter, neutrino masses, and the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry.", "label": 1}
