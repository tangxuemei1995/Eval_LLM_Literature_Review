{"grounding": "Applying dimensional analysis to the Higgs mass leads one to predict new physics interactions that generate this mass at a scale of the order of 1 TeV. The question of what these interactions could be is known as the gauge hierarchy problem. Resolving this question has been a central aim of particle physics for the past few decades. Traditional solutions introduce new particles with masses below 1 TeV, but that prediction is now challenged by experiment. In this article, I review recent new approaches to the problem that do not require new particles at the TeV mass scale. I first discuss the relaxation approach, whereby the Higgs mass is made dynamical and is small at the absolute minimum of its potential. I then discuss the historical approach, whereby details about inflation and/or reheating after inflation cause the Higgs mass to be smaller than otherwise expected. Finally, I discuss solutions that use conditional probability, whereby conditioning on the fact that the cosmological constant is small automatically leads one to select vacua where the Higgs mass is also small.", "generated_text": "The gauge hierarchy problem, a central issue in particle physics, questions the vast disparity between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale, particularly in the context of the Higgs boson mass. This paper explores innovative solutions to this enduring problem, focusing on the principles of naturalness and relaxation mechanisms. We delve into the theoretical frameworks that extend beyond the Standard Model, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and composite Higgs models, which aim to stabilize the Higgs mass without fine-tuning. Additionally, we examine the relaxation approach, where dynamical processes during the early universe could naturally select the observed electroweak scale. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements and critical analysis of existing models, this study highlights the potential pathways towards resolving the hierarchy problem. Our findings suggest that a combination of theoretical innovation and experimental verification is essential for uncovering the underlying principles that govern the mass scales in the universe. This research contributes to the ongoing quest for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics and the quest for naturalness in the laws of nature.", "label": 1}
