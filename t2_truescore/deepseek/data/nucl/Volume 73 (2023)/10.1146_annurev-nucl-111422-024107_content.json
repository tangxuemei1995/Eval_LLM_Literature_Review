{"grounding": "Over the past decade, the disparity between the value of the cosmic expansion rate determined directly from measurements of distance and redshift and that determined instead from the standard Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model, calibrated by measurements from the early Universe, has grown to a level of significance requiring a solution. Proposed systematic errors are not supported by the breadth of available data (and unknown errors are untestable by lack of definition). Simple theoretical explanations for this Hubble tension that are consistent with the majority of the data have been surprisingly hard to come by, but in recent years, attention has focused increasingly on models that alter the early or pre-recombination physics of ΛCDM as the most feasible. Here, we describe the nature of this tension and emphasize recent developments on the observational side. We then explain why early-Universe solutions are currently favored and the constraints that any such model must satisfy. We discuss one workable example, early dark energy, and describe how it can be tested with future measurements. Given an assortment of more extended recent reviews on specific aspects of the problem, the discussion is intended to be fairly general and understandable to a broad audience.", "generated_text": "The Hubble tension, a discrepancy between the local and early Universe measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), poses a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model, ΛCDM. This tension has prompted a reevaluation of our understanding of the Universe's expansion rate and the underlying physics governing it. Among the proposed solutions, Early Dark Energy (EDE) has emerged as a compelling candidate. EDE posits the existence of a new form of energy that becomes significant prior to recombination, altering the sound horizon and thereby affecting the inferred value of H0 from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. This paper reviews the current state of research on the Hubble tension, with a focus on the role of EDE in reconciling the discrepancy. We examine the theoretical underpinnings of EDE, its implications for the early Universe, and the constraints imposed by current cosmological data. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and prospects for future observations and theoretical developments in resolving the Hubble tension. The exploration of EDE not only offers a potential pathway to understanding the Hubble tension but also enriches our comprehension of the Universe's evolution, highlighting the intricate interplay between cosmology and fundamental physics.", "label": 1}
