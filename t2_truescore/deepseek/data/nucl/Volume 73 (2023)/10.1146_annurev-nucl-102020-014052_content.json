{"grounding": "We present a method for ordering two-nucleon interactions based upon their scaling with the number of QCD colors, N\n\nc\n, in the limit that N\n\nc\n becomes large. Available data in the two-nucleon sector show general agreement with this ordering, indicating that the method may be useful in other contexts where data are less readily available. However, several caveats and potential pitfalls can make the large-N\n\nc\n ordering fragile and/or vulnerable to misinterpretation. We discuss the application of the large-N\n\nc\n analysis to two- and three-nucleon interactions, including those originating from weak and BSM (beyond the Standard Model) interactions, as well as two-nucleon external currents. Finally, we discuss some open questions in the field.", "generated_text": "This study explores the implications of large-Nc Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction, leveraging the framework of effective field theories (EFTs) to systematically analyze two-nucleon and few-nucleon interactions. By examining the behavior of QCD in the limit of a large number of colors (Nc), we derive insights into the underlying symmetries and dynamics governing nuclear forces. Our analysis reveals that large-Nc QCD provides a robust foundation for understanding the hierarchy of nuclear interactions, offering a novel perspective on the effective range expansion and the role of pion exchange. The findings underscore the utility of large-Nc QCD in refining EFTs for nuclear physics, paving the way for more accurate predictions of nuclear properties and reactions.", "label": 0}
