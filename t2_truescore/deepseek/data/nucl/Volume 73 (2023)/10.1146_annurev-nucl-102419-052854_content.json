{"grounding": "Since its start, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has helped advance both theory and experiment on the production and properties of the heaviest fundamental particle, the top quark. This review focuses on a selected set of measurements and associated searches for new physics, which have opened the door for unprecedented precision in this area of high-energy physics. Fundamental parameters of the theory such as mt\n, Î±S, Vtb\n, and yt\n are measured from top quark events with relative uncertainties that are smaller than 0.5%, 1.8%, 2%, and 10%, respectively, and that are expected to improve with more data, better experimental methods, and more accurate theory predictions. Several results, even if statistically limited, already significantly constrain the phase space of new physics: measurements of associated production with bosons, processes with four top quarks, and searches for rare decays, among others. It is expected that until the completion of the LHC program, top quark physics will keep providing unique insights regarding the consistency of the Standard Model and the energy scale of new physics.", "generated_text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has significantly advanced our understanding of the top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle, offering profound insights into the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics and probing the boundaries of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories. This paper provides a comprehensive appraisal of the physics of the top quark at the LHC, focusing on its production mechanisms, decay processes, and interactions within the framework of strong and electroweak forces. We review the precision measurements of the top quark's properties, including its mass, cross section, and couplings to the Higgs boson, which serve as critical tests of the SM and as sensitive probes for new physics. Furthermore, we discuss the role of the top quark in exploring BSM scenarios, highlighting its unique position in the search for new particles and interactions. The outlook for future research at the LHC and beyond is presented, emphasizing the potential for groundbreaking discoveries in the physics of the top quark and its implications for our understanding of the fundamental structure of matter.", "label": 1}
