{"grounding": "Vector boson scattering is a key production process to probe the electroweak symmetry breaking of the Standard Model and is one of the most important topics of the physics program for the HL-LHC since it involves both self-couplings of vector bosons and their coupling with the Higgs boson. If the Higgs mechanism is not the sole source of electroweak symmetry breaking, the scattering amplitude deviates from the Standard Model prediction at high scattering energy. Moreover, deviations may be detectable even if a New Physics scale is higher than the reach of direct searches. In this review, the most recent experimental measurements of the production cross sections of vector boson pairs in association with two jets in proton–proton collisions at  TeV at the LHC are reported, using data sets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors. Applications to searches for New Physics, as well as prospects for measuring the electroweak vector boson scattering processes with larger data samples, are also summarized.", "generated_text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has opened new frontiers in the study of boson–boson interactions, providing unprecedented insights into the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. This research focuses on the production and analysis of diboson events, including WW, WZ, ZZ, and Wγ, which are crucial for testing the predictions of the Standard Model and probing for new physics beyond it. Vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, in particular, offer a unique window into the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and the properties of the Higgs boson. By leveraging the high-energy proton–proton collisions at the LHC, we investigate the cross-sections and kinematic distributions of these diboson events, comparing them with theoretical predictions. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental interactions between bosons, shedding light on the nature of the electroweak force and the potential existence of new particles or interactions at the TeV scale.", "label": 1}
