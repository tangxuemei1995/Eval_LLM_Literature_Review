{"grounding": "We present a comprehensive review of purely leptonic and semileptonic decays of D\n0(+), \n\n, and charmed baryons (including \n\n, Ξ\nc\n, and Ω\nc\n). The precise studies of these decays help deepen our understanding and knowledge of quantum chromodynamics via measuring decay constants and form factors, and test the Standard Model through examining the unitarity of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix and lepton flavor universality. We give an overview of the theoretical and experimental tools before discussing the recent progress. The data sets collected by the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) near the production thresholds of \n\n, \n\n, and \n\n offer important opportunities for studies of charm physics.", "generated_text": "This review highlights recent advancements in the study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons, a pivotal area in charm physics. Leveraging the precision of lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), significant progress has been made in determining decay constants and form factors, crucial for testing the Standard Model and probing new physics. These decays offer a unique window into the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, enhancing our understanding of quark flavor transitions. Furthermore, investigations into lepton flavor universality violations in these decays provide stringent tests of the Standard Model's predictions. The synthesis of experimental data and theoretical calculations continues to refine our knowledge, paving the way for future discoveries in particle physics.", "label": 1}
