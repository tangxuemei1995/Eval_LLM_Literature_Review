{"grounding": "Detection of low-energy nuclear recoil events plays a central role in searches for particle dark matter interactions with atomic matter and studies of coherent neutrino scatters. Precise nuclear recoil calibration data allow the responses of these dark matter and neutrino detectors to be characterized and enable in situ evaluation of an experiment's sensitivity to anticipated signals. This article reviews the common methods for detection of nuclear recoil events and the wide variety of techniques that have been developed to calibrate detector response to nuclear recoils. We summarize the main experimental factors that are critical for accurate nuclear recoil calibrations, investigate mitigation strategies for different backgrounds and biases, and discuss how the presentation of calibration results can facilitate comparison between experiments. Lastly, we discuss the challenges for future nuclear recoil calibration efforts and the physics opportunities they may enable.", "generated_text": "The quest for understanding dark matter and neutrino interactions has led to the development of sophisticated detectors capable of identifying low-energy nuclear recoils. This study focuses on the detection and calibration techniques essential for observing coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEÎ½NS) and potential dark matter interactions. By employing neutron scatter as a calibration method, we achieve precise low-energy calibration necessary for distinguishing between dark matter signals and neutrino-induced nuclear recoils. Our research outlines the advancements in detector sensitivity and the methodologies for accurately calibrating the energy response of detectors to nuclear recoils at low energies. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts in particle physics to unravel the mysteries of dark matter and neutrino properties, providing a foundation for future experiments aiming to detect these elusive particles with unprecedented precision.", "label": 1}
