{"grounding": "Live (not decayed) radioisotopes on the Earth and Moon are messengers from recent nearby astrophysical explosions. Measurements of 60Fe in deep-sea samples, Antarctic snow, and lunar regolith reveal two pulses about 3 Myr and 7 Myr ago. Detection of 244Pu in a deep-sea crust indicates a recent r-process event. We review the ultrasensitive accelerator mass spectrometry techniques that enable these findings. We then explore the implications for astrophysics, including supernova nucleosynthesis, particularly the r-process, as well as supernova dust production and the formation of the Local Bubble that envelops the Solar System. The implications go beyond nuclear physics and astrophysics to include studies of heliophysics, astrobiology, geology, and evolutionary biology.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the presence of radioisotopes in deep-sea sediments and lunar samples, attributed to nearby astrophysical explosions such as supernovae. Utilizing accelerator mass spectrometry, we analyze the isotopic signatures of r-process elements, which are synthesized in such cataclysmic events. Our findings reveal a temporal correlation between the deposition of these isotopes and historical supernova events, providing insights into the nucleosynthesis processes and the distribution of cosmic material in the solar system. This research not only enhances our understanding of the chemical evolution of the galaxy but also offers a novel approach to dating astrophysical phenomena through the analysis of extraterrestrial and terrestrial samples.", "label": 1}
