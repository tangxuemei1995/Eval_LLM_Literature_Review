{"grounding": "Modern quantum chemistry algorithms are increasingly able to accurately predict molecular properties that are useful for chemists in research and education. Despite this progress, performing such calculations is currently unattainable to the wider chemistry community, as they often require domain expertise, computer programming skills, and powerful computer hardware. In this review, we outline methods to eliminate these barriers using cutting-edge technologies. We discuss the ingredients needed to create accessible platforms that can compute quantum chemistry properties in real time, including graphical processing units–accelerated quantum chemistry in the cloud, artificial intelligence–driven natural molecule input methods, and extended reality visualization. We end by highlighting a series of exciting applications that assemble these components to create uniquely interactive platforms for computing and visualizing spectra, 3D structures, molecular orbitals, and many other chemical properties.", "generated_text": "The integration of machine learning (ML), graphical processing units (GPUs), and cloud computing has revolutionized the field of interactive quantum chemistry, offering unprecedented computational power and accessibility. This study explores the development of natural user interfaces (NUIs) that leverage chemical structure recognition to facilitate intuitive interactions with complex quantum chemical simulations. By harnessing the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs and the scalable resources of cloud computing, researchers can now perform high-accuracy quantum chemical calculations in real-time. Furthermore, the incorporation of extended reality (XR) technologies enhances the visualization and manipulation of molecular structures, providing a more immersive and interactive experience. This paper highlights the synergistic potential of these technologies in advancing quantum chemistry research, making sophisticated computational tools more accessible to a broader scientific community and paving the way for innovative discoveries in molecular science.", "label": 1}
