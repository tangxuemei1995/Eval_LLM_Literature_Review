{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques are powerful tools to investigate polymer systems. In this review, we address how these techniques have been applied to hydrogel nano- and microparticles, so-called nano- or microgels. We outline which research questions on microgels could be addressed and what new insights could be achieved. Studies of the morphology, shape, and deformation of microgels; their internal compartmentalization; the cross-linker distribution and polarity inside them; and their dynamics and diffusion are summarized. In particular, the abilities to super-resolve structures in three dimensions have boosted the research field and have also allowed researchers to obtain impressive 3D images of deformed microgels. Accessing information beyond 3D localization, such as spectral and lifetime properties and correlative imaging or the combination of data with other methods, shines new light onto polymer systems and helps us understand their complexity in detail. Such future trends and developments are also addressed.", "generated_text": "This study presents a novel approach to 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging of microgels, leveraging advanced nanoscopy techniques to overcome the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy. Microgels, as adaptive materials with intricate polymer networks, play a pivotal role in various applications ranging from drug delivery to tissue engineering. However, their dynamic behavior and structural complexity at the nanoscale have remained elusive. By integrating fluorescence labeling with state-of-the-art super-resolution microscopy, we achieve unprecedented spatial resolution in three dimensions, enabling detailed visualization of the internal architecture and dynamics of microgels. Furthermore, the application of 3D tracking and correlative microscopy provides insights into the real-time interactions and environmental responsiveness of these materials. This work not only advances our understanding of microgel systems but also opens new avenues for the design and optimization of adaptive materials with tailored properties for specific applications.", "label": 0}
