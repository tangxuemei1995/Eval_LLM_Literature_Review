{"grounding": "Photochemical upconversion is a process whereby two lower-energy photons are converted into a higher-energy photon by sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation. While recent interest in this process has been motivated by improving the efficiencies of solar cells, many applications are being explored. In this review, we address the underlying physicochemical phenomena that are responsible for photochemical upconversion. We review their kinetics, and the requirements for annihilators and sensitizers to design efficient upconversion systems. We discuss the spin physics of the bi-excitonic interactions and how the spin character of the triplet pairs can fundamentally limit the upconversion efficiency and give rise to the magnetic field effect on delayed photoluminescence. Finally, we address light-matter coupling phenomena that could be employed to enhance photochemical upconversion.", "generated_text": "Photochemical upconversion (UC) represents a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency of solar energy conversion by converting low-energy photons into higher-energy, more usable light. This process primarily relies on triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) between sensitizer and chromophore molecules, overcoming the spin statistical limit to achieve efficient energy transfer. The kinetics of TTA, influenced by factors such as the magnetic field effect, plays a crucial role in determining the upconversion quantum yield. This study explores the optimization of sensitizer-chromophore pairs to maximize UC efficiency, focusing on the interplay between molecular design, photophysical properties, and external conditions. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying TTA and its impact on UC performance, this research aims to contribute to the development of advanced materials for solar energy harvesting and light-emitting applications.", "label": 1}
