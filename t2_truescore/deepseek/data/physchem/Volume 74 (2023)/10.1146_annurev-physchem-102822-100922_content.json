{"grounding": "We review our recent quantum stochastic model for spectroscopic lineshapes in the presence of a coevolving and nonstationary background population of excitations. Starting from a field theory description for interacting bosonic excitons, we derive a reduced model whereby optical excitons are coupled to an incoherent background via scattering as mediated by their screened Coulomb coupling. The Heisenberg equations of motion for the optical excitons are then driven by an auxiliary stochastic population variable, which we take to be the solution of an Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process. Here, we present an overview of the theoretical techniques we have developed as applied to predicting coherent nonlinear spectroscopic signals. We show how direct (Coulomb) and exchange coupling to the bath give rise to distinct spectral signatures and discuss mathematical limits on inverting spectral signatures to extract the background density of states.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate optical signatures arising from stochastic processes in many-body exciton scattering, a phenomenon pivotal to understanding quantum dynamics in condensed matter systems. By employing coherent nonlinear spectroscopy, we explore the nuanced interplay between excitation-induced dephasing and many-body effects, which significantly influence the quantum coherence and energy transfer mechanisms. The research leverages quantum stochastic calculus to model the unpredictable behavior of excitons, providing a robust framework to decipher the complex interactions and their optical manifestations. Our findings reveal distinctive patterns in the optical response, attributed to the stochastic nature of exciton scattering, offering new insights into the quantum mechanical underpinnings of many-body systems. This work not only advances our comprehension of quantum dynamics but also paves the way for innovative approaches in the design and analysis of quantum materials and devices.", "label": 0}
