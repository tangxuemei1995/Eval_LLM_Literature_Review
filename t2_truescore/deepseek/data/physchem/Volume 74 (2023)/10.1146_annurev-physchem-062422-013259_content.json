{"grounding": "Ground-state Kohn-Sham density functional theory provides, in principle, the exact ground-state energy and electronic spin densities of real interacting electrons in a static external potential. In practice, the exact density functional for the exchange-correlation (xc) energy must be approximated in a computationally efficient way. About 20 mathematical properties of the exact xc functional are known. In this work, we review and discuss these known constraints on the xc energy and hole. By analyzing a sequence of increasingly sophisticated density functional approximations (DFAs), we argue that (a) the satisfaction of more exact constraints and appropriate norms makes a functional more predictive over the immense space of many-electron systems and (b) fitting to bonded systems yields an interpolative DFA that may not extrapolate well to systems unlike those in the fitting set. We discuss both how the class of well-described systems has grown along with constraint satisfaction and the possibilities for future functional development.", "generated_text": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) stands as a cornerstone in the computational study of electronic structure, offering a balance between accuracy and computational feasibility. This research delves into the pivotal role of exact constraints and appropriate norms in enhancing the predictive power of DFT, particularly in the accurate determination of exchange-correlation energy. By systematically integrating exact constraints derived from physical principles and employing appropriate norms for the assessment of density functionals, we aim to refine the theoretical framework of DFT. Our investigation reveals that the judicious application of these constraints and norms significantly improves the accuracy of electronic structure predictions, thereby extending the applicability of DFT to a broader range of materials and chemical systems. This study underscores the importance of methodological rigor in the development of density functionals, paving the way for more reliable and precise computational tools in quantum chemistry and materials science.", "label": 1}
