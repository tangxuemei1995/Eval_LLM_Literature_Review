{"grounding": "Surfaces mediate the formation of stable glasses (SGs) upon physical vapor deposition (PVD) for a wide range of glass formers. The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of SGs and their anisotropic packing structures are controlled through the deposition parameters (deposition temperature and rate) as well as the chemical structure and composition of the glass former. The resulting PVD glass properties can therefore be related to the structure and dynamics of the glass surface, which can have oriented packing, enhanced surface diffusion, and a lower glass transition temperature, and can facilitate an enhanced aging rate of the interfacial region. We review our current understanding of the details of this surface-mediated SG formation process and discuss key gaps in our knowledge of glass surface dynamics and their effect on this process.", "generated_text": "The formation of stable glasses through physical vapor deposition has emerged as a pivotal area of research, offering insights into the glass transition and the role of surface-mediated equilibration. This study delves into the mechanisms by which enhanced surface mobility facilitates the creation of glasses with exceptional stability and structural anisotropy. By examining the interplay between surface dynamics and bulk properties, we uncover the conditions under which stable glasses can be synthesized, highlighting the significance of deposition parameters in tailoring glass properties. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the glass transition process, paving the way for the development of materials with optimized performance for technological applications. This research underscores the potential of surface-mediated approaches in advancing the field of glass science.", "label": 1}
