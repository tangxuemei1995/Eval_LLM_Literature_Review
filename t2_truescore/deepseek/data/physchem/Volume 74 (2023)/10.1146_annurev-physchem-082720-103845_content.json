{"grounding": "Gas-phase molecular spectroscopy is a natural playground for accurate quantum-chemical computations. However, the molecular bricks of life (e.g., DNA bases or amino acids) are challenging systems because of the unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with the molecular size (active electrons) and/or the presence of large-amplitude internal motions. From the theoretical point of view, both aspects prevent the brute-force use of very accurate but very expensive state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methodologies. From the experimental point of view, both features lead to congested gas-phase spectra, whose assignment and interpretation are not at all straightforward. Based on these premises, this review focuses on the current status and perspectives of the fully a priori prediction of the spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules (containing up to two dozen atoms) in the gas phase with special reference to rotational and vibrational spectroscopies of some representative molecular bricks of life.", "generated_text": "Gas-phase computational spectroscopy has emerged as a pivotal tool in deciphering the complex behaviors of the molecular bricks of life, offering unparalleled insights into their structural and dynamic properties. This study delves into the challenges and advancements in accurately predicting rotational and vibrational spectra of these fundamental molecules, which are crucial for understanding their roles in biological processes. The inherent flexibility and anharmonicity of these molecules pose significant hurdles in computational modeling, necessitating sophisticated approaches to capture their true nature. By leveraging state-of-the-art computational techniques, this research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, enhancing our comprehension of the molecular bricks of life. The findings underscore the importance of computational spectroscopy in unraveling the intricate dance of atoms and molecules that constitute the essence of life, paving the way for novel discoveries in biochemistry and molecular biology.", "label": 0}
