{"grounding": "The processes of genome expression, regulation, and repair require direct interactions between proteins and DNA at specific sites located at and near single-stranded–double-stranded DNA (ssDNA–dsDNA) junctions. Here, we review the application of recently developed spectroscopic methods and analyses that combine linear absorbance and circular dichroism spectroscopy with nonlinear 2D fluorescence spectroscopy to study the local conformations and conformational disorder of the sugar-phosphate backbones of ssDNA–dsDNA fork constructs that have been internally labeled with exciton-coupled cyanine (iCy3)2 dimer probes. With the application of these methods, the (iCy3)2 dimer can serve as a reliable probe of the mean local conformations and conformational distributions of the sugar-phosphate backbones of dsDNA at various critical positions. The results of our studies suggest a possible structural framework for understanding the roles of DNA breathing in driving the processes of protein–DNA complex assembly and function.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder through the innovative application of site-specific exciton-coupled dimer (ECD) probe spectroscopy. By integrating 2D spectroscopy techniques with site-specific fluorescence labeling, we provide unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying protein–DNA interactions and DNA replication processes. Our approach leverages the sensitivity of ECD probes to detect subtle changes in DNA breathing and backbone flexibility, offering a novel perspective on the conformational landscape of DNA. The findings highlight the potential of ECD spectroscopy as a powerful tool for dissecting the complex interplay between DNA structure and function, paving the way for future research in molecular biology and biophysics. This work not only advances our understanding of DNA dynamics but also opens new avenues for the study of nucleic acid interactions at the molecular level.", "label": 1}
