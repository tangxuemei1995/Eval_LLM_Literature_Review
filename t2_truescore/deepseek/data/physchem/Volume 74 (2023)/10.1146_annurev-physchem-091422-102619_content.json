{"grounding": "The photoacid dynamics of fluorescent proteins include both electronic excited- and ground-state mechanisms of proton transfer. The associated characteristic timescales of these reactions range over many orders of magnitude, and the tunneling, barrier crossing, and relevant thermodynamics have in certain cases been linked to coherent nuclear motion. We review the literature and summarize the experiments and theory that demonstrate proton tunneling in the electronic ground state of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). We also discuss the excited-state proton-transfer reaction of GFP that takes place on the picosecond timescale. Although this reaction has been investigated using several vibrational spectroscopic methods, the interpretation remains unsettled. We discuss recent advances as well as remaining questions, in particular those related to the vibrational mode couplings that involve low-frequency modulations of chromophore vibrations on the timescale of proton transfer.", "generated_text": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) has become a pivotal tool in biological imaging due to its unique fluorescence properties. This study delves into the intricate photoacid dynamics of GFP, employing ultrafast spectroscopy to unravel the mechanisms underlying its photophysical behavior. We focus on the role of proton tunneling and coherence in the excited state proton transfer (ESPT) process, which is crucial for the protein's fluorescence. Stimulated Raman spectroscopy is utilized to probe the vibrational modes associated with the chromophore and its immediate environment, providing insights into the structural dynamics that facilitate ESPT. Our findings shed light on the interplay between electronic and nuclear motions in GFP, offering a deeper understanding of its photoacidic properties and paving the way for the design of novel fluorescent markers with enhanced performance for biological applications.", "label": 0}
