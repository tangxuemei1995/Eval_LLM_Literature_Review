{"grounding": "Predicting the whole process of a chemical reaction while solving kinetic equations presents an opportunity to realize an on-the-fly kinetic simulation that directly discovers chemical reactions with their product yields. Such a simulation avoids the combinatorial explosion of reaction patterns to be examined by narrowing the search space based on the kinetic analysis of the reaction path network, and would open a new paradigm beyond the conventional two-step approach, which requires a reaction path network prior to performing a kinetic simulation. The authors addressed this issue and developed a practical method by combining the artificial force induced reaction method with the rate constant matrix contraction method. Two algorithms are available for this purpose: a forward mode with reactants as the input and a backward mode with products as the input. This article first numerically verifies these modes for known reactions and then demonstrates their application to the actual reaction discovery. Finally, the challenges of this method and the prospects for ab initio reaction discovery are discussed.", "generated_text": "The quest for efficient and accurate methods to discover chemical reactions has led to the development of the Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method, a promising approach for ab initio reaction discovery. This method leverages quantum chemical calculations to explore potential energy surfaces (PES) and construct reaction path networks, enabling the identification of novel reaction pathways without prior knowledge of the transition states. By applying artificial forces to molecular systems, AFIR facilitates the exploration of complex PES landscapes, uncovering both expected and unexpected reaction mechanisms. The integration of kinetic simulations further allows for the assessment of reaction feasibility and selectivity, providing valuable insights for organic synthesis. This study highlights the potential of AFIR in revolutionizing reaction discovery by offering a systematic and unbiased exploration of chemical space, thereby accelerating the development of new synthetic methodologies and the discovery of novel chemical entities.", "label": 1}
