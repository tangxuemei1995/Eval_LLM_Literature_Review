{"grounding": "Light-driven phenomena in organic molecular aggregates underpin several mechanisms relevant to optoelectronic applications. Modeling these processes is essential for aiding the design of new materials and optimizing optoelectronic devices. In this review, we cover the use of different atomistic models, excited-state dynamics, and transport approaches for understanding light-activated phenomena in molecular aggregates, including radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. We consider both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms and focus on the role of conical intersections as facilitators of internal conversion. We explore the use of the exciton models for Frenkel and charge transfer states and the electronic structure methods and algorithms commonly applied for excited-state dynamics. Throughout the review, we analyze the approximations employed for the simulation of internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and reverse intersystem crossing rates and analyze the molecular processes behind single fission, triplet-triplet annihilation, Dexter energy transfer, and FÃ¶rster energy transfer.", "generated_text": "The study of excited states in molecular organic aggregates is pivotal for advancing optoelectronic applications, including organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. This research delves into the complex excited-state dynamics, focusing on radiative and nonradiative decay processes, conical intersections, and exciton models that govern the behavior of these systems. By employing advanced computational techniques, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms of singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation, which are crucial for enhancing the efficiency of energy conversion and light emission in organic materials.
