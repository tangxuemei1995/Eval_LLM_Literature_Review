{"grounding": "Reactions at solid–water interfaces play a foundational role in water treatment systems, catalysis, and chemical separations, and in predicting chemical fate and transport in the environment. Over the last century, experimental measurements and computational models have made tremendous progress in capturing reactions at solid surfaces. The interfacial reactivity of a solid surface, however, can change dramatically and unexpectedly when it is confined to the nanoscale. Nanoconfinement can arise in different geometries such as pores/cages (3D confinement), channels (2D confinement), and slits (1D confinement). Therefore, measurements on unconfined surfaces, and molecular models parameterized based on these measurements, fail to capture chemical behaviors under nanoconfinement. This review evaluates recent experimental and theoretical advances, with a focus on adsorption at solid–water interfaces. We review how nanoconfinement alters the physico-chemical properties of water, and how the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water dictate energetics, pathways, and products of adsorption in nanopores. Finally, the implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.", "generated_text": "The study of adsorption at nanoconfined solid–water interfaces presents a unique challenge and opportunity in understanding the behavior of molecules and ions in environments where the effects of confinement significantly alter their interactions. This research focuses on the mechanisms of surface complexation and speciation within nanopores, where the reduced dimensionality and increased surface area to volume ratio lead to distinct adsorption behaviors compared to bulk interfaces. By employing advanced spectroscopic and computational techniques, we investigate how nanoconfinement influences the distribution and speciation of adsorbates, shedding light on the complex interplay between surface chemistry, pore geometry, and solution conditions. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing adsorption in nanoconfined systems, with implications for environmental remediation, water purification, and the design of novel nanomaterials. This work underscores the importance of considering nanoconfinement effects in the study of solid–water interfaces, offering new insights into the control and manipulation of adsorption processes at the nanoscale.", "label": 0}
