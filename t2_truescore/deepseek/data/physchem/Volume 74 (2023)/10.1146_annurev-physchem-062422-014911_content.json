{"grounding": "Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metallic nanostructures result in subwavelength optical confinement that enhances lightâ€“matter interactions, for example, aiding the sensitivity of surface spectroscopies. The dissipation of surface plasmons as electronic and vibrational excitations sets the limit for field confinement but also provides opportunities for photochemistry, photocatalysis, and photothermal heating. Optimization for either goal requires a deeper understanding of this photothermalization process. In this review, we focus on recent insights into the physics and dynamics governing photothermalization of LSPRs in metallic nanostructures, emphasizing comparisons between the steady-state behavior and ultrafast time-resolved studies. The differences between these regimes inform how to best optimize plasmonic systems for applications under relatively low-intensity, continuous illumination (e.g., sunlight).", "generated_text": "This study delves into the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, focusing on the transition from nonthermal carriers to a steady state. Utilizing metallic nanoparticles as a model system, we explore the generation and relaxation dynamics of hot electrons, pivotal for applications in photocatalysis and energy conversion. Raman thermometry is employed to precisely measure the temperature distribution and thermalization processes within these nanostructures, providing insights into the efficiency of energy transfer and dissipation. Our findings highlight the critical role of the steady state in optimizing the performance of plasmonic devices, offering a pathway for enhancing their functionality in light-driven chemical reactions and thermal management. This research contributes to the fundamental understanding of plasmonic interactions and their practical implications in nanotechnology.", "label": 0}
