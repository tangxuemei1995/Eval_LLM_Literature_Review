{"grounding": "Groundwater deterioration due to enrichment with contaminants of either geogenic or anthropogenic origin has adversely affected safe water supply for drinking and irrigation, with pervasive impacts on human health and ecosystem functions. However, the spatiotemporal evolution and public health effects of groundwater quality remain unclarified, posing a grand challenge for the safe and sustainable supply of global groundwater resources. This article provides a state-of-the-art review of the complexity and dynamics of groundwater quality, as well as the impacts of various groundwater substances on human health. In particular, knowledge is growing about the health impacts of key substances ranging from nutritional elements (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+) to pollutants (e.g., heavy metals/metalloids, persistent organic pollutants, and emerging contaminants) and, further, to pathogenic microorganisms to which the human body can be exposed through multiple patterns of groundwater use. Proliferating concerns at the same time call for enhancing science-based governance directives, economic policies, and management strategies coordinating groundwater quality. We propose that safeguarding groundwater-dependent public health needs concerted efforts in source control, cross-scale rehabilitation, and social hydrology-based groundwater governance.", "generated_text": "Groundwater serves as a critical source of drinking water worldwide, yet its quality is increasingly threatened by both geogenic and emerging contaminants. This study investigates the impact of key substances found in groundwater on human health, emphasizing the need for sustainable groundwater management practices. Geogenic contaminants, such as arsenic and fluoride, naturally occur in groundwater and pose significant health risks when consumed at high concentrations. Emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, further complicate the scenario by introducing new challenges to water safety. Through a comprehensive review of recent scientific literature, this research identifies the most critical substances affecting groundwater quality and evaluates their health implications. The findings underscore the importance of integrating advanced monitoring techniques, public health policies, and community engagement in managing groundwater resources. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, this study contributes to the development of strategies aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of groundwater supplies, thereby safeguarding public health against the backdrop of increasing environmental and anthropogenic pressures.", "label": 1}
