{"grounding": "The nuclear waste management and disposal program in the United States for highly radioactive waste (spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste) has thus far been unsuccessful despite an effort that spans 40 years and the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars. Yet, today, there is considerable interest in and promotion of advanced reactor technologies, such as small modular reactors that will expand spent fuel inventories that may very well remain at the site where they are generated, awaiting permanent, geologic disposal. We examine critical elements of the US legal and regulatory framework that have impeded the success of the US program. We make recommendations on steps that are required for a successful nuclear waste program, particularly considering the development of advanced nuclear reactors and their fuel cycles.", "generated_text": "This study examines the United States' legal and regulatory framework governing the management of nuclear waste from both current and future reactors, including advanced reactor designs and their associated fuel cycles. It focuses on the challenges and opportunities presented by the evolving nuclear energy landscape, particularly in terms of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) management, retrievability requirements, and the implications of the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste. The analysis highlights the need for a robust, flexible regulatory framework that can accommodate the unique characteristics of advanced reactors and their fuel cycles, ensuring safe, secure, and efficient nuclear waste management. The study also explores potential legal and policy reforms to address existing gaps and enhance the sustainability of nuclear energy as a low-carbon power source.", "label": 1}
