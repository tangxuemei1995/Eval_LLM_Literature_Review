{"grounding": "Global agreement on 30×30 means an unprecedented last push to define how much nature will be left on the planet. At the same time that space for nature is being defined, climate change will be moving nature around. Species are now on the move to track climate change both on land and in the oceans, a process that is accelerating under dramatic new extreme events. This is an opportune time to review conservation recommendations made early in the millennium, to see how many have been taken on board over the past 20 years, and how much is left to be done to adapt to climate change as conservation pushes toward 30×30. The history of Climate Change–Integrated Conservation Strategies begins with two papers published by a group of prominent climate change biologists in 2002. The importance of including adaptation to climate change in conservation was underscored by the first estimates of extinction risk due to climate change in 2004. Subsequent literature has developed concepts such as velocity of climate change and assisted migration. Regional modeling of biodiversity change, expanding protected areas to facilitate species range movements, and managing productive landscapes to facilitate species movements are all now considered “business as usual” for conservation planning for climate change. Regional coordination of conservation efforts to ensure that species on the move are managed for climate change consistently across their range, on the other hand, is under-represented in literature and practice. Improving both theory and practice of regional coordination for climate change is an important priority for conservation now and in the future. Conservation for climate change has focused mostly on warming scenarios, but failure to act on climate change emissions reduction means that meeting Paris Agreement targets will almost certainly have to include both warming past those targets and subsequent cooling back to the target. Managing this double transition is a second critical point of emphasis for climate change biology as the world moves to 30×30.", "generated_text": "The 30×30 initiative, aiming to conserve 30% of the planet's land and ocean areas by 2030, emerges as a pivotal strategy in the global response to climate change and biodiversity loss. This paper delves into the historical evolution and prospective future of climate change-integrated conservation strategies, with a particular focus on the 30×30 framework. By synthesizing findings from climate change biology, systematic conservation planning, and regional coordination efforts, we explore how the 30×30 initiative can address the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity decline. The movement of species in response to changing climates, a phenomenon increasingly observed across ecosystems, underscores the necessity for adaptive conservation strategies that transcend static protected areas. We argue that the success of the 30×30 initiative hinges on its ability to incorporate dynamic, climate-smart conservation planning that accounts for species on the move, ensuring the resilience of ecosystems and the services they provide. Furthermore, this paper highlights the importance of regional coordination in achieving the 30×30 targets, emphasizing the need for collaborative governance structures that can navigate the complexities of cross-border conservation efforts. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key challenges and opportunities in scaling up conservation efforts to meet the 30×30 goals, including the integration of traditional ecological knowledge, the mobilization of financial resources, and the development of innovative conservation technologies. Ultimately, this paper calls for a concerted global effort to realize the 30×30 vision, advocating for a paradigm shift in conservation planning that fully embraces the realities of a changing climate and the imperative of biodiversity conservation for future generations.", "label": 0}
