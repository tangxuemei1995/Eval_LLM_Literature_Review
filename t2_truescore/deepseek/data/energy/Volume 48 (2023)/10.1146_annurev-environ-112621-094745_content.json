{"grounding": "Brine contains cations such as K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Li+, B3+, Rb2+, and Cs2+, as well as anions such as SO4\n2−, Cl−, HCO3\n−, CO3\n2−, NO3\n−, Br−, and I−, which are valuable elements. Brines are widely distributed in salt lakes in the world's three enormous plateaus and beyond and are classified into three types: sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines. Sulfate-type brine forms in salt lakes, whereas carbonate-type brine results from magmatic and hydrothermal activity. Chloride-type brine forms in deep basins due to the reduction and transformation of buried brine. Li in brine plays a critical role in clean energy transitions, and K in brine is important for potash production. Recently, new techniques for extracting Li from brine have been developed, and the large-scale, comprehensive development pattern of brines has formed the basis for a recycling economic model, which contributes to the efficient use of brines for potash and Li2CO3 development and CO2 emission reduction. This article reviews the genesis of brines and highlights new utilization techniques, trends, and sustainable development.", "generated_text": "Brine, a highly concentrated saline solution, plays a pivotal role in the global economy and environmental sustainability due to its rich mineral content, including potash and lithium. This study delves into the genesis of brine, exploring its formation processes in salt lakes and other saline environments worldwide. We examine the geological and climatic factors that contribute to brine formation, highlighting the significance of these natural resources in the context of increasing demand for minerals essential to modern technologies. Furthermore, this research focuses on innovative processing techniques aimed at the efficient and sustainable recovery of valuable minerals from brine. We assess the environmental impacts of traditional extraction methods and propose advanced strategies for minimizing ecological footprints while maximizing resource recovery. The paper also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive utilization of brine, advocating for the development of integrated approaches that not only extract valuable minerals but also address water scarcity and environmental conservation. Through a global perspective, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable resource management, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by brine as a critical resource in the 21st century.", "label": 1}
