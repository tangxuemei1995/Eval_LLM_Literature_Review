{"grounding": "Buildings are key in supporting human activities and well-being by providing shelter and other important services to their users. Buildings are, however, also responsible for major energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during their life cycle. Improving the quality of services provided by buildings while reaching low energy demand (LED) levels is crucial for climate and sustainability targets. Building sector models have become essential tools for decision support on strategies to reduce energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet current models have significant limitations in their ability to assess the transformations required for LED. We review building sector models ranging from the subnational to the global scale to identify best practices and critical gaps in representing transformations toward LED futures. We focus on three key dimensions of intervention (socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological), three megatrends (digitalization, sharing economy, and circular economy), and decent living standards. This review recommends the model developments needed to better assess LED transformations in buildings and support decision-making toward sustainability targets.", "generated_text": "The transition towards low energy demand futures in buildings is pivotal for climate change mitigation, yet it remains underexplored in the context of both residential and commercial sectors. This paper reviews the current state of research on modeling such futures, emphasizing the integration of megatrends and the imperative of maintaining decent living standards. We identify a critical gap in the development of scenarios that comprehensively account for energy demand transformation, driven by technological, behavioral, and policy changes. Our analysis highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine quantitative modeling with qualitative insights to capture the complexity of energy use in buildings. Furthermore, we underscore the importance of aligning energy demand reduction strategies with broader societal goals, ensuring that the pursuit of low energy futures does not compromise the quality of life. This paper calls for enhanced research efforts to refine modeling frameworks, incorporate diverse megatrends, and explore the socio-economic implications of transitioning to low energy demand futures in buildings.", "label": 1}
