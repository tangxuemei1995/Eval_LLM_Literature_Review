{"grounding": "Modifications to land can serve to jointly reduce risks of floods and droughts to people and to ecosystems. Whether land modifications are implemented will depend on the willingness and ability of a diversity of actors. This article reviews the state of knowledge on land modification use in areas exposed to dual hydrologic risks and the land owners, managers, and users who directly make decisions about action on lands they control. The review presents a typology of land modifications and explains how land modifications interact with the hydrological cycle to reduce risks. It then addresses the roles and perspectives of the land owners, managers, and users undertaking land modifications, summarizing theories explaining motivations for, as well as barriers to and enablers of, land modification implementation. The analysis reveals geographical differences in narratives on land modifications as well as knowledge gaps regarding variation across actors and types of land modifications.", "generated_text": "This study explores the potential of land modifications as a strategy for mitigating concurrent flood and drought risks, emphasizing the perspectives and motivations of land users. As climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of these concurrent hydrological extremes, innovative adaptation strategies are urgently needed. Land modifications, including changes in land use, soil management, and water conservation practices, offer a promising avenue for reducing vulnerability to these risks. Through a comprehensive review of scientific literature and case studies, this research identifies key land modification techniques that have been effective in different contexts. Furthermore, it delves into the motivations and barriers faced by land users in adopting these practices, highlighting the importance of socio-economic factors, policy support, and community engagement. The findings underscore the need for integrated approaches that combine technical solutions with an understanding of land users' perspectives to enhance the resilience of landscapes to concurrent flood and drought risks.", "label": 1}
