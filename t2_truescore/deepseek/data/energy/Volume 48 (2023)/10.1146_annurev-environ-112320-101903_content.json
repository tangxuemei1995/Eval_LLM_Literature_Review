{"grounding": "Coastal systems are sensitive to direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Approximately 90% of all coastal areas will be affected by climate change to varying degrees. Nearly half of the world's major cities are located within 50 km of a coast, and coastal population densities are 2.6 times greater than those of inland areas, with a steep rise over the years. While coastal critical infrastructure is expanding, more social and physical systems are increasingly exposed to climate-induced hazards. The interconnectedness and interdependencies of critical infrastructure systems increase their systemic instability and fragility, resulting in greater dynamic risk and cascading impacts. Coastal critical infrastructure systems on several continents are at risk from the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events. Therefore, it is necessary to build and run climate-resilient infrastructure that is planned, designed, implemented, and operated to predict, be prepared for, and adapt to changing climatic circumstances. This review provides an up-to-date, objective, and critical assessment based on the literature to help determine what is known and what needs the future attention of researchers.", "generated_text": "Climate change poses significant risks to coastal critical infrastructure, threatening the resilience of systems essential for societal functioning and economic stability. This study examines the multifaceted vulnerabilities of coastal infrastructure to climate-induced hazards, including sea-level rise, increased storm intensity, and extreme weather events. By integrating interdisciplinary research, we assess the potential for cascading hazards that can amplify the impact on infrastructure networks, leading to widespread disruptions. The analysis highlights the importance of adaptive strategies and robust design principles in enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, the study explores the role of policy frameworks and community engagement in mitigating risks and fostering sustainable development. Through a comprehensive review of case studies and predictive modeling, we identify key areas of concern and propose actionable recommendations for stakeholders. The findings underscore the urgent need for proactive measures to safeguard coastal infrastructure against the escalating threats of climate change, ensuring long-term resilience and the protection of vulnerable communities.", "label": 1}
