{"grounding": "Fungi comprise approximately 20% of all eukaryotic species and are connected to virtually all life forms on Earth. Yet, their diversity remains contentious, their distribution elusive, and their conservation neglected. We aim to flip this situation by synthesizing current knowledge. We present a revised estimate of 2–3 million fungal species with a “best estimate” at 2.5 million. To name the unknown >90% of these by the end of this century, we propose recognition of species known only from DNA data and call for large-scale sampling campaigns. We present an updated global map of fungal richness, highlighting tropical and temperate ecoregions of high diversity. We call for further Red List assessments and enhanced management guidelines to aid fungal conservation. Given that fungi play an inseparable role in our lives and in all ecosystems, and considering the fascinating questions remaining to be answered, we argue that fungi constitute the next frontier of biodiversity research.", "generated_text": "Fungi, encompassing Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and early diverging fungi, represent a vast and largely unexplored kingdom of life, playing critical roles in ecosystems worldwide. This study aims to push the frontiers of biodiversity research by unveiling the global diversity, distribution, and conservation status of fungi. Utilizing advanced metabarcoding techniques, we assess the fungus:plant ratio across diverse habitats, shedding light on the intricate relationships between fungi and their plant counterparts. Our findings highlight the endemic nature of many fungal species, emphasizing the urgent need for their conservation. By integrating data from the IUCN Red List, we identify species at risk and propose targeted in situ and ex situ conservation strategies. This research not only advances our understanding of fungal biodiversity but also underscores the importance of fungi in maintaining ecological balance and the necessity of their preservation for future generations.", "label": 1}
