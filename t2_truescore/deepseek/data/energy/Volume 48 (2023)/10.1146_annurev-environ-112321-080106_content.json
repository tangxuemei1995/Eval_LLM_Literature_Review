{"grounding": "Qualitative research methods examine a wide range of topics in the study of environment and resource management. This first review on the topic highlights innovative and impactful research over the past few decades, drawing from social science disciplines that include sociology, geography, anthropology, political science, public policy, and psychology. We describe qualitative research methods that have addressed five scientific goals: (a) describing what the world is like, (b) predicting what the world can be like, (c) acknowl-edging researcher positionality and reflexivity and diversifying ways of knowing in theorizing and research designs, (d) integrating imaginaries into empirical research and building narratives to make sense of possible futures and to broaden our view of scientific inquiry, and (e) helping scholars grapple with the deep complexity of socioecological systems. As we explore these themes, we explain foundational qualitative approaches and highlight examples of environmental qualitative research that apply them.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the evolving landscape of qualitative methods in environmental research, emphasizing their critical role in understanding complex socioecological systems and addressing climate change challenges. By integrating participatory research approaches, this study highlights how qualitative methods facilitate deeper insights into human-environment interactions, community resilience, and adaptive strategies. The discussion underscores the importance of these methods in capturing the nuanced, context-specific dynamics that quantitative approaches may overlook. Through a review of recent advancements, the paper illustrates the application of qualitative techniques in diverse environmental contexts, from local community studies to global climate policy analysis. It argues for the complementary use of qualitative and quantitative methods to enrich environmental research, offering a more holistic understanding of ecological issues. The findings advocate for the continued innovation and integration of qualitative methodologies in environmental studies, ensuring that research remains responsive to the complexities of socioecological systems and the multifaceted nature of climate change.", "label": 1}
