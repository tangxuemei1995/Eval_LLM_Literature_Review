{"grounding": "Addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development are the grand challenges for this century. This review assesses how sustainability and green jobs are changing in response to these formidable challenges, with a focus on energy transitions and responsible production and consumption. The energy transition to renewable sources will generate a net increase in employment, although some regions of the world may see net losses. Jobs in responsible consumption and production, motivated by changing consumer demand and savings from circular economy strategies, will increase the number of green and sustainability jobs. Since sustainability and green jobs require higher levels of creative problem-solving, more nonroutine activities, formal education, and on-the-job training than traditional jobs, more training will be necessary to meet skills demands in green and sustainability positions. We review how competency and capacity approaches to learning, credentialing, and on-the-job training have been employed to meet growing demand for sustainability and green jobs.", "generated_text": "The transition towards a sustainable economy has catalyzed the emergence of sustainability careers, encompassing a broad spectrum of green jobs that contribute to environmental preservation, social equity, and economic viability. This study explores the evolving landscape of sustainability jobs, identifying key competencies required for professionals in this field. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of current training programs and curricula, we highlight the critical skills and knowledge areas that facilitate successful transitions into sustainability careers. Our findings suggest that interdisciplinary education, practical experience, and continuous learning are paramount for equipping individuals with the competencies needed to address complex sustainability challenges. Furthermore, we propose recommendations for enhancing educational programs to better prepare the workforce for the demands of green jobs. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainability education and workforce development, offering insights for educators, policymakers, and professionals aiming to foster a sustainable future.", "label": 1}
