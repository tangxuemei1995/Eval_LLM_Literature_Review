{"grounding": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) impact lakes, estuaries, and freshwater reservoirs worldwide. The duration, severity, and spread of CyanoHABs have markedly increased over the past decades and will likely continue to increase. This article addresses the universal phenomena of cyanobacterial blooms occurring in many freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Based on analysis of ecophysiological traits of bloom-forming cyanobacteria and their interactions with environmental processes, we summarize and decipher the driving forces leading to the initiation, outbreak, and persistence of the blooms. Due to the coupling effects of eutrophication, rising CO2 levels and global warming, a multidisciplinary joint research approach is critical for better understanding the CyanoHAB phenomenon and its prediction, remediation, and prevention. There is an urgent need to evaluate and guide proper use of bloom control techniques at large scales, using science-based and environmentally friendly approaches.", "generated_text": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) represent a significant ecological and public health challenge, exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication. These blooms are characterized by the proliferation of cyanobacteria, capable of producing cyanotoxins that pose risks to aquatic ecosystems, human health, and water quality. This study explores the biological traits and mechanisms underlying HCBs, including their adaptive strategies to environmental stressors. We assess the risks associated with cyanotoxins, focusing on their impact on freshwater resources and the potential for bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. Furthermore, we review current and emerging control strategies aimed at mitigating HCBs, emphasizing the importance of integrated management approaches that address both the symptoms and root causes of blooms. Our findings highlight the need for adaptive management strategies that consider the complex interplay between climate change, nutrient loading, and cyanobacterial dynamics to safeguard freshwater ecosystems and public health.", "label": 1}
