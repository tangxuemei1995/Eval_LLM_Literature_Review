{"grounding": "Urban overheating is the most documented phenomenon of climate change impacting humans. This article presents the most recent developments on the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating and the potential synergies with global climatic change. It analyses the latest qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of higher urban temperatures on buildingsâ€™ energy supply and demand, heat-related mortality, morbidity and wellbeing, human productivity, survivability of low-income populations, and environmental quality of cities. It describes the state of the art on the development of innovative mitigation materials, advanced urban greenery, heat dissipation, and evaporative techniques as the main mitigation and adaptation technologies to offset the impact of urban overheating. It also analyses the current knowledge on the impact of each mitigation technology on energy, health, environmental quality, urban economy, and survivability. Finally, this article presents the main future challenges related to urban overheating and proposes a specific research agenda to alleviate and counterbalance its impact on human life.", "generated_text": "Urban overheating, a phenomenon exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, poses significant challenges to cities worldwide. This study delves into the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating, exploring its multifaceted impacts on human health, energy consumption, and environmental sustainability. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key drivers of urban overheating, including urbanization, land use changes, and climate change. The research further examines a range of heat mitigation and adaptation strategies, from green infrastructure and cool materials to urban planning and policy interventions, assessing their effectiveness in reducing urban temperatures and enhancing resilience. Despite these efforts, the study highlights the persistent challenges in combating urban overheating, particularly in the context of rapid urbanization and global warming. The paper concludes with a call for integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to address urban overheating, emphasizing the need for future research to focus on innovative solutions, policy integration, and community engagement to ensure sustainable urban development in the face of escalating thermal stress.", "label": 1}
