{"grounding": "Renewable electricity generation will need to be rapidly scaled to address climate change and other environmental challenges. Doing so effectively will require an understanding of resource availability. We review estimates for renewable electricity of the global technical potential, defined as the amount of electricity that could be produced with current technologies when accounting for geographical and technical limitations as well as conversion efficiencies; economic potential, which also includes cost; and feasible potential, which accounts for societal and environmental constraints. We consider utility-scale and rooftop solar photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind, hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean (wave, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion, and salinity gradient energy) technologies. We find that the reported technical potential for each energy resource ranges over several orders of magnitude across and often within technologies. Therefore, we also discuss the main factors explaining why authors find such different results. According to this review and on the basis of the most robust studies, we find that technical potentials for utility-scale solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore wind, and offshore wind are above 100 PWh/year. Hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean thermal energy conversion have technical potentials above 10 PWh/year. Rooftop solar photovoltaic, wave, and tidal have technical potentials above 1 PWh/year. Salinity gradient has a technical potential above 0.1 PWh/year. The literature assessing the global economic potential of renewables, which considers the cost of each renewable resource, shows that the economic potential is higher than current and near-future electricity demand. Fewer studies have calculated the global feasible potential, which considers societal and environmental constraints. While these ranges are useful for assessing the magnitude of available energy sources, they may omit challenges for large-scale renewable portfolios.", "generated_text": "The transition towards a sustainable energy future necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the global potential of renewable electricity sources. This study meticulously evaluates the technical, economic, and feasible potential of key renewable energy technologies, including solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. By synthesizing data from a vast array of scientific literature and leveraging advanced modeling techniques, we quantify the maximum achievable energy generation under ideal conditions (technical potential), the subset of this potential that is economically viable at current market prices (economic potential), and the portion that can be realistically implemented considering social, environmental, and regulatory constraints (feasible potential). Our findings reveal that solar PV and wind energy dominate the global renewable electricity potential, with significant contributions also from hydropower and CSP. Geothermal and ocean energy, while offering substantial potential in specific regions, are limited by geographical and technological constraints. The analysis underscores the critical role of policy frameworks, technological innovation, and investment in unlocking the full potential of renewables. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of integrating these energy sources into the global grid to achieve a sustainable, low-carbon energy system. This study provides a foundational framework for policymakers, investors, and researchers to prioritize and strategize the deployment of renewable energy technologies, paving the way for a cleaner, more resilient energy future.", "label": 1}
