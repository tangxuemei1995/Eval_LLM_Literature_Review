{"grounding": "The few percent of soil organic carbon (SOC) among mineral components form the interface of climate, plant growth, soil biological processes, physical transport infrastructure, and chemical transformations. We explore maps, models, myths, motivation, means of implementation, and modalities for transformation. Theories of place relate geographic variation in SOC to climate, soil types, land cover, and profile depth. Process-level theories of biophysical change and socioeconomic theories of induced change explain SOC transitions that follow from land use change when a declining curve is bent and recovery toward SOC saturation starts. While the desirability of recovering from SOC deficits has been mainstreamed into climate policy, the effectiveness of proposed measures taken remains contested. Process-level requirements for transitions at plot and landscape scales remain uncertain. Expectations of policy-induced SOC transitions have to align with national cross-sectoral C accounting and be managed realistically with land users (farmers) and commodity supply chains (private sector, consumers).", "generated_text": "Soils play a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, acting as both carbon stores and sinks, which are critical for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study explores the expectations, patterns, processes, and prospects of transitions in soil carbon dynamics, utilizing advanced models such as the Century and Millennial models to simulate carbon sequestration and decomposition processes. We delve into the mechanisms of carbon storage in soils, including the contributions of litter and root turnover, and assess the impact of these processes on soil health and carbon sequestration potential. Furthermore, the research examines the implications of soil mapping for climate policy, highlighting the importance of accurate soil carbon data for effective climate change mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating soil carbon management into broader climate policy frameworks to enhance soil health and maximize the carbon sequestration potential of soils, thereby contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.", "label": 1}
