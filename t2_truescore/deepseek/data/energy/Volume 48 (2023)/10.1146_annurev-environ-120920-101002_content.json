{"grounding": "There are large disparities in access to green technologies between countries and among different demographic groups within countries. Unless carefully managed, the energy transition risks exacerbating some of these inequalities, for example, by burdening those who are excluded from efficient new technologies with the costs of maintaining legacy infrastructure. The energy transition will create new interdependencies between sectors—for example, between buildings, the power sector, and transportation—requiring integrated design of policies and infrastructure in different sectors. The equitable adoption of new technologies is contingent on broadening access to enabling technologies such as the Internet and payment systems. Decisionmakers must focus on new technologies that remove disparities in access to services but do not replicate current inefficiencies in providing those services (e.g., equitable access to mobility—not only to motorized personal vehicles). Data at higher resolutions and with broader coverage are needed to design equitable technology deployment strategies and evaluate their success.", "generated_text": "The integration of green technologies into urban and rural infrastructures presents a pivotal opportunity to address environmental justice concerns. This study explores the implications of such technologies, including electrification, modal shifts in transportation, and the development of sustainable buildings, on the principles of just transition and distributional justice. By analyzing case studies and reviewing existing literature, we assess how these innovations can either mitigate or exacerbate social inequalities. Our findings suggest that while green technologies hold the potential to reduce environmental degradation and promote equitable resource distribution, their implementation must be carefully managed to ensure that benefits are accessible to all communities, particularly those historically marginalized. The paper concludes with policy recommendations aimed at fostering an inclusive approach to environmental sustainability, ensuring that the transition towards green technologies contributes positively to the broader goals of environmental justice.", "label": 0}
