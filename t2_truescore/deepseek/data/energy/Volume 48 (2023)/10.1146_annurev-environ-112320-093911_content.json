{"grounding": "Food demand is projected to increase significantly over the coming decades. Sustainable intensification (SI) is essential to meet this demand. SI is particularly important in smallholder systems, yet to date it remains unclear what the most promising SI strategies are to increase food production and farmer incomes at scale. We review the literature on SI to identify the most promising strategies, as manifest in replicated findings of favorable causal impacts. Adoption of improved cultivars generated the largest, most consistent, positive yield and economic outcomes. Two agroecological practices, push-pull systems and the System of Rice Intensification, also repeatedly led to large positive impacts. These strategies have considerable potential to scale to reach more than 50% of smallholder farmers who plant staple crops. Significant barriers to adoption remain, however, and identifying ways to overcome barriers to scale these successful strategies will be critical to meeting Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 by 2030.", "generated_text": "This paper surveys the evidence on sustainable intensification strategies for smallholder agricultural systems, with a focus on the Global South. It examines the adoption and impact of innovative practices such as improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) on staple crops. These strategies aim to enhance food production while minimizing environmental degradation, thereby addressing the dual challenges of food security and sustainability. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, this study highlights the potential of these approaches to increase yields, improve resilience to climate change, and reduce the ecological footprint of agriculture. The findings suggest that while there is significant promise in these strategies, their success depends on context-specific adaptations and the integration of local knowledge. This survey underscores the importance of continued research and policy support to scale up sustainable intensification practices, ensuring they contribute effectively to the sustainable development goals in smallholder agricultural systems.", "label": 1}
