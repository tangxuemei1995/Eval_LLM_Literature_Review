{"grounding": "This article reviews recent advances in causal inference relevant to sociology. We focus on a selective subset of contributions aligning with four broad topics: causal effect identification and estimation in general, causal effect heterogeneity, causal effect mediation, and temporal and spatial interference. We describe how machine learning, as an estimation strategy, can be effectively combined with causal inference, which has been traditionally concerned with identification. The incorporation of machine learning in causal inference enables researchers to better address potential biases in estimating causal effects and uncover heterogeneous causal effects. Uncovering sources of effect heterogeneity is key for generalizing to populations beyond those under study. While sociology has long emphasized the importance of causal mechanisms, historical and life-cycle variation, and social contexts involving network interactions, recent conceptual and computational advances facilitate more principled estimation of causal effects under these settings. We encourage sociologists to incorporate these insights into their empirical research.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning have significantly enhanced our ability to understand and predict the effects of interventions across various domains. This paper reviews the latest methodologies that leverage machine learning techniques to address key challenges in causal inference, including the estimation of counterfactuals, treatment effect heterogeneity, and mediation effects. We explore how machine learning models, with their flexibility and capacity to handle high-dimensional data, are being adapted to improve the accuracy of causal effect estimation, particularly in the presence of complex, non-linear relationships. Furthermore, we discuss the critical issues of extrapolation and external validity, highlighting innovative approaches that aim to ensure the generalizability of causal findings beyond the study sample. By synthesizing recent developments, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in integrating machine learning with causal inference, offering insights into future research directions and practical applications.", "label": 1}
