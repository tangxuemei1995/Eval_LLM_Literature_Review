{"grounding": "The global dimensions of diasporic politics and state response have generated a large, interdisciplinary literature. Yet, scholars struggle to find the most productive conceptual tools, as one literature, at point of origin, studies emigration and the other, at point of destination, studies immigration. The transnational turn in the social sciences four decades ago propelled scholars to study cross-border political mobilization by viewing immigration and emigration as two sides of the same coin. This article provides a guide to this scholarship. We show how the political nature of cross-border movements creates and circumscribes conditions for diasporic political mobilization. We then identify the different types of cross-border political activities and the modalities of corresponding home state policies. We conclude by reflecting how the world today has changed since the geopolitical moment in which the transnational turn was born and what these changes mean for studying immigrant and emigrant cross-border politics.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of cross-border politics, focusing on the mobilization of diasporic communities and the corresponding responses of states. By examining the interplay between transnationalism, diaspora, and geopolitics, the research delves into how emigrant politics influence and are influenced by nationalism and homeland policies. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the paper analyzes case studies to understand the mechanisms through which diasporas engage in political activities across borders, and how states navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these transnational networks. The findings highlight the dual role of diasporas as both agents of change and subjects of state strategies, shedding light on the complex relationship between emigrant communities and their countries of origin. This research contributes to the broader discourse on global migration, nationalism, and the evolving nature of state sovereignty in an increasingly interconnected world.", "label": 1}
