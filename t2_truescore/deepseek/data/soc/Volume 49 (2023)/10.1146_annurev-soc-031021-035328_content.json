{"grounding": "Policing and punishment are unevenly distributed across geographic space. Research analyzing place-based variation in the criminal legal system is increasing, asking how community conditions contribute to variation in criminal justice outcomes and how multiple criminal justice exposures (e.g., policing and punishment) vary together in places. In this article, we identify spatial-contextual analyses of the criminal legal system and summarize their contributions by organizing them by their three major approaches: those emphasizing crime, urban ecology, or social control. We describe challenges the subfield faces, including an overemphasis on large cities and an overcommitment to analyzing criminal justice institutions like police or prisons discretely, when they are often experienced cumulatively and simultaneously. We call for research that transcends received institutional divisions, generates recommendations for stakeholders at multiple scales, makes greater use of formal spatial modeling, and analyzes places across the urban-rural continuum.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate relationships between space, place, policing, and punishment within the criminal legal system, employing spatial-contextual analyses to uncover the nuanced dynamics at play. By integrating geographical information systems (GIS) with socio-legal research methods, we explore how spatial configurations and place-based characteristics influence policing practices and punitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that the spatial distribution of law enforcement resources and the socio-economic attributes of places significantly affect the intensity of policing and the severity of punishments meted out. Furthermore, this research highlights the role of historical and cultural contexts in shaping the spatial patterns of the criminal legal system, suggesting that place is not merely a backdrop but a pivotal factor in the administration of justice. This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on the geography of crime and justice, offering insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to address spatial disparities in the criminal legal system.", "label": 0}
