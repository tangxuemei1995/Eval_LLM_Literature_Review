{"grounding": "The term “White privilege” has been used to denote specific privileges that White groups possess due to their Whiteness and White identity. In this article, firstly, I outline how, as a conceptual tool, White privilege can only be understood in relation to Critical Race Theory, specifically the notion that racism is central and endemic, through Whiteness as property and interest convergence. Secondly, I analyze the development of White privilege and provide ways forward for the use of the term, and thirdly, I use examples from higher education to outline how White privilege works in terms of the construction of knowledge, the prioritization of gender above race, and the fact that policy making is designed to protect White identities to uphold a hegemonic system of White supremacy.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of White privilege and Whiteness through the lens of Critical Race Theory (CRT), aiming to confront, challenge, and rethink the pervasive structures of racial inequality. By analyzing the historical and contemporary manifestations of White privilege, the research seeks to uncover the mechanisms through which Whiteness operates as a normative power, often invisibly shaping societal norms, policies, and individual identities. Employing CRT as a theoretical framework, the paper critically examines the intersections of race, power, and privilege, advocating for a transformative approach to dismantle systemic racism. Through a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on race and inequality, offering insights into strategies for fostering a more equitable and inclusive society.", "label": 1}
