{"grounding": "Age as an individual characteristic is ubiquitous in social science research because it has important associations with numerous outcomes of interest. Yet age is rarely treated as a phenomenon that requires explanation or theoretical attention. To advance research in sociology and beyond, we bring together previously siloed literatures on the conceptualization and measurement of age. Our framework presents age as a system of inequality that can be understood through concepts and processes that operate at multiple levels of analysis. At the individual level, we argue age is best conceptualized and operationalized as multidimensional. We review a range of measures, from birth cohort to physical appearance, that can be fruitfully combined in empirical research to account for this complexity. The multidimensionality of age also highlights how it is “done” in interactions, connecting the social construction of age to the intersectional production of inequality.", "generated_text": "This study explores the social construction of age, emphasizing its multifaceted nature and the implications for research methodology and demographic analysis. By integrating perspectives from the life course, intersectionality, and social stratification, we examine how age is conceptualized and measured across different societal contexts. The research highlights the dynamic interplay between biological aging and social factors, such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status, which collectively shape the aging experience. Through a critical review of existing methodologies, we identify gaps in the measurement of age and propose innovative approaches that capture its complexity. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting an intersectional lens in demographic studies to better understand the diverse pathways of aging and their implications for policy and practice. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on aging by offering a comprehensive framework for the social construction of age, advocating for more nuanced and inclusive research methodologies.", "label": 1}
