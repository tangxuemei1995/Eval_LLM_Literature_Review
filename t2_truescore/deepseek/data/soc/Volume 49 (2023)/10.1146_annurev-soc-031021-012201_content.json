{"grounding": "From the earliest studies examining the impacts of the coal-powered Industrial Revolution, the field of sociology has possessed an intimate, if often implicit, interest in the interconnectedness of fossil fuels and modernity. With the looming climate crisis, the world must rapidly wean itself from these resources in favor of others that emit little to no greenhouse gasses. And while this energy transition will likely have profound social implications, it has only recently begun to receive sustained attention from sociologists across subfields. Consequently, although debates have emphasized the technological and market dimensions of this shift, its relational dimensions and human aspects have remained relatively marginal. In this article, we review research on the social impacts of fossil fuel production and transitions to renewables. Such work is critical and urgent, since the main barriers to combating the climate crisis are neither technological nor economic; they are, instead, deeply social.", "generated_text": "The transition towards a decarbonized energy system is imperative for mitigating climate change, yet it carries profound social implications. This study explores the social impacts of supply-side decarbonization, focusing on the intersection of energy policy, climate change mitigation, and the concept of a just transition. By analyzing a comprehensive body of scientific literature, we identify key challenges and opportunities associated with shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Our findings highlight the importance of equitable policy frameworks that address the socio-economic disparities exacerbated by decarbonization efforts. We argue that a just transition requires not only technological innovation but also inclusive governance structures that ensure the benefits of decarbonization are shared across all segments of society. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable energy transitions by providing insights into how supply-side decarbonization can be aligned with social equity and justice principles.", "label": 1}
