{"grounding": "I got hooked on sociology as a 20-year-old. Engaging with the world as a sociologist, together with colleagues, comrades, and students, has been immensely rewarding for six decades. My work has centered primarily on what were once called developing countries and now comprise the Global South. This article recounts my sociological adventures, from efforts to understand the world as I found it in the early 1960s to my responses to current reactionary trends. I start with my earlier work—Dependent Development (1979) and Embedded Autonomy (1995)—and then move to more recent efforts to construct paradigms of progressive twenty-first-century possibilities. I discuss, first, how a 21st century developmental state might incorporate deliberation and state-society synergies to expand human capabilities, and second, how an amalgam of global and national labor movements together with transnational advocacy networks might pursue a counter-hegemonic globalization capable of confronting global neoliberal capitalism.", "generated_text": "This paper embarks on a 60-year journey through the evolving landscape of comparative political economy, tracing the transition from the concept of embedded autonomy to the emergence of counter-hegemonic globalization. It explores the intricate dynamics of dependent development and the pivotal role of state-society synergy in shaping the developmental state. Through an autobiographical lens, the study delves into the transformative power of transnational advocacy networks in challenging hegemonic structures and fostering a more inclusive global economic order. By weaving together theoretical insights with personal experiences, this research offers a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms driving economic and political change across different contexts. It highlights the importance of adaptive strategies in navigating the complexities of global capitalism and underscores the potential for collective action in reimagining the contours of global governance.", "label": 1}
