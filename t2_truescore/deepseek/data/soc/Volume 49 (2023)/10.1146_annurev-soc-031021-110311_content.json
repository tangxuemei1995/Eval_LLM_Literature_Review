{"grounding": "Robust literatures separately estimate school effects and neighborhood effects on children's educational, economic, health, and other outcomes that measure well-being. A growing body of research acknowledges that both contexts matter and considers neighborhoods and schools jointly. In this review, we synthesize the array of results that emerge from these studies and critique the tendency for researchers to evaluate which matters more, neighborhoods versus schools. We propose a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes. We argue that contextual effects research would be enriched by considering local neighborhood–school structures: the ways that families choose neighborhoods and schools and that neighborhoods and schools mutually and cyclically constitute one another. We conclude with recommendations for bringing neighborhood–school structures to bear on both outcomes-oriented studies of neighborhood and school effects as well as studies of contextual selection and segregation.", "generated_text": "This study introduces the concept of Neighborhood–School Structures (NSS) as a novel framework for examining the intertwined effects of neighborhoods and schools on individual outcomes. Recognizing the limitations of studying these social contexts in isolation, NSS emphasizes the dynamic interplay between neighborhood and school environments, particularly in the context of segregation and its implications for educational and social equity. By integrating theories and methodologies from urban sociology, education, and social epidemiology, this research proposes a multidimensional approach to understanding how the characteristics of neighborhoods and schools jointly influence developmental trajectories. The paper outlines key dimensions of NSS, including demographic composition, resource availability, and social networks, and discusses their potential impacts on academic achievement, social mobility, and health outcomes. Through this lens, the study aims to advance the joint study of social contexts, offering new insights into the mechanisms of neighborhood and school effects and informing policy interventions aimed at reducing disparities.", "label": 0}
