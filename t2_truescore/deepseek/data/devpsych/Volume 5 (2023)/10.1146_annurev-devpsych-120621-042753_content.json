{"grounding": "Research on early biomarkers and behavioral precursors of autism has led to interventions initiated during the infant period that could potentially change the course of infant brain and behavioral development in autism. This article integrates neuroscience and clinical perspectives to explore how knowledge of infant brain and behavioral development can inform the design of infant autism interventions. Focusing on infants ≤12 months, we review studies on behavioral precursors of autism and their neural correlates and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of infant autism interventions. We then consider how contemporary developmental social neuroscience theories of autism can shed light on the therapeutic strategies used in infant autism interventions and offer a new perspective that emphasizes improving child outcome and well-being by enhancing infant–environment fit. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research that incorporates brain-based measures to inform individualized approaches to intervention and discuss ethical issues raised by infant autism interventions.

Drawing on recent advances in neuroimaging and behavioral research, we examine how early brain development in infants can be influenced by targeted interventions aimed at enhancing social communication skills. The review highlights the critical periods of brain plasticity in infancy, during which neural circuits underlying social behavior are particularly malleable. We discuss various intervention strategies, including parent-mediated approaches and direct infant engagement techniques, that leverage this plasticity to promote more typical developmental trajectories. Furthermore, the paper addresses the challenges of identifying infants at risk for ASD and the importance of early detection for the effectiveness of interventions. By integrating findings from developmental neuroscience with clinical practice, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for designing and implementing early interventions that can alter the course of autism development, ultimately improving outcomes for affected individuals and their families.", "label": 1}
