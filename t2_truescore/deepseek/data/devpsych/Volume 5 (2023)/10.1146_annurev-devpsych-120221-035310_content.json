{"grounding": "Cognitive flexibility, or the ability to mentally switch between tasks according to changing environmental demands, supports optimal life outcomes, making it an important executive function to study across development. Here we review the literature examining the development of cognitive flexibility, with an emphasis on studies using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The neuroimaging literature suggests that key brain regions important for cognitive flexibility include the inferior frontal junction and regions within the midcingulo-insular network, including the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices. We further discuss challenges surrounding studying cognitive flexibility during neurodevelopment, including inconsistent terminology, the diversity of fMRI task paradigms, difficulties with isolating cognitive flexibility from other executive functions, and accounting for developmental changes in cognitive strategy. Future directions include assessing how developmental changes in brain network dynamics enable cognitive flexibility and examining potential modulators of cognitive flexibility including physical activity and bilingualism.", "generated_text": "Cognitive flexibility, a core component of executive function, is crucial for adapting to changing environments and is intricately linked to neurodevelopment. This review synthesizes recent advancements in developmental neuroimaging, particularly task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to elucidate the neural underpinnings of cognitive flexibility across different stages of development. We highlight key findings from studies that have employed diverse cognitive tasks to probe flexibility, revealing dynamic changes in brain activation patterns and connectivity associated with age-related improvements in cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the developmental trajectory of executive functions and the potential impact of individual differences and environmental factors. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies, the integration of multimodal neuroimaging techniques, and the exploration of interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive flexibility in developmental populations. This review underscores the importance of developmental neuroimaging in advancing our understanding of cognitive flexibility and its neural basis.", "label": 1}
