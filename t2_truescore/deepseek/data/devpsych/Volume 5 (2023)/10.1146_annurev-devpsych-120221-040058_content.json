{"grounding": "Cognitive control is defined as a set of processes required for the organization of goal-directed thoughts and actions. It is linked to success throughout life including health, wealth, and social capital. How to support the development of cognitive control is therefore an intensively discussed topic. Progress in understanding how this critical life skill can be optimally scaffolded in long-lasting ways has been disappointing. I argue that this effort has been hampered by the predominant perspective that cognitive control is a competence or ability, the development of which is driven by predetermined maturational sequences. I propose that this traditional view needs to be overhauled in light of a growing body of evidence suggesting that cognitive control allocation is a both highly dynamic and rational process subject to costâ€“benefit analyses from early in development. I discuss the ramifications of shifting our perspective on cognitive control mechanisms in relation to how we design interventions. I close by spelling out new avenues for scientific inquiry.", "generated_text": "This study presents a rational account of cognitive control development in childhood, integrating insights from developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. We propose that the maturation of cognitive control can be understood as an optimization process, where children gradually learn to allocate their cognitive resources in a manner that maximizes expected value. This framework posits that developmental changes in cognitive control are not merely a function of biological maturation but also reflect the increasing competence of children in evaluating the costs and benefits of different control strategies. By synthesizing empirical findings with theoretical models, we argue that a rational account offers a comprehensive explanation for the observed patterns of cognitive control development. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering both the computational demands of control tasks and the developmental trajectory of children's decision-making abilities. This perspective has significant implications for understanding individual differences in cognitive development and for designing interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive control in childhood.", "label": 1}
