{"grounding": "Poverty is associated with changes in brain development and elevates the risk for psychopathology in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Although the field is rapidly expanding, there are methodological challenges that raise questions about the validity of current findings. These challenges include the interrelated issues of reliability, effect size, interindividual heterogeneity, and replicability. To address these issues, we propose a multipronged approach that spans short-, medium-, and long-term solutions, including changes to data pipelines along with more comprehensive data acquisition of environment, brain, and mental health. Additional suggestions are to use open science approaches, more robust statistical analyses, and replication testing. Furthermore, we propose increased integration between advanced analytical approaches using large samples and neuroscience models in intervention research to enhance the interpretability of findings. Collectively, these approaches will expand the application of neuroimaging findings and provide a foundation for eventual policy changes designed to improve conditions for children in poverty.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes current research on the intersection of poverty, brain development, and mental health, highlighting the profound impact of socioeconomic adversity on neurobiological and psychological outcomes. Drawing on advances in neuroimaging and developmental psychopathology, we explore how poverty-related stressors can alter brain structure and function, predisposing individuals to mental health disorders. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in ensuring the replicability and reproducibility of findings across diverse populations and contexts. We discuss methodological innovations and interdisciplinary approaches that promise to enhance our understanding of these complex relationships. Finally, we outline paths forward for research, policy, and intervention, emphasizing the need for scalable, evidence-based strategies to mitigate the effects of poverty on brain development and mental health. This work underscores the critical importance of addressing socioeconomic disparities to promote neurodevelopmental and psychological well-being.", "label": 1}
