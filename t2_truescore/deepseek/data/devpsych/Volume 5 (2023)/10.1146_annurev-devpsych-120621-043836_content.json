{"grounding": "Intimate relationships are hotbeds of emotion. This article presents key findings and current directions in research on couples’ emotion regulation across adulthood as a critical context in which older adults not only maintain functioning but may also outshine younger adults. First, I introduce key concepts, defining qualities (i.e., dynamic, coregulatory, bidirectional, bivalent), and measures (i.e., self-report versus performance-based) of couples’ emotion regulation. Second, I highlight a socioemotional turn in our understanding of adult development with the advent of socioemotional selectivity theory. Third, I offer a life-span developmental perspective on emotion regulation in couples (i.e., across infancy, adolescence and young adulthood, midlife, and late life). Finally, I present the idea that emotion regulation may shift from “me to us” across adulthood and discuss how emotion regulation in couples may become more important, better, and increasingly consequential (e.g., for relationship outcomes, well-being, and health) with age. Ideas for future research are then discussed.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamics of emotion regulation within couples across different stages of adulthood, with a particular focus on the impact of aging. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, we investigate how couples navigate emotional challenges and maintain relational satisfaction over time. The research highlights the role of adaptive emotion regulation strategies in fostering resilience and well-being among aging couples. Findings suggest that as individuals age, there is a notable shift towards more effective emotion regulation techniques, which are crucial for sustaining healthy relationships. The study also examines the interplay between individual and dyadic emotion regulation processes, revealing how these mechanisms evolve with age. By shedding light on the complexities of emotion regulation in couples across adulthood, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the factors that promote enduring and fulfilling partnerships in later life.", "label": 1}
