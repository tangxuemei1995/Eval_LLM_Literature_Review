{"grounding": "Life-course epidemiologists have developed sophisticated models for how exposures throughout life—from gestation to old age—shape health, sometimes years after the exposure occurred. The field, however, has been slow to adopt robust causal inference methods, including quasi-experimental designs. This reflects, at least in part, a tension between (a) study designs that maximize our ability to make causal claims and (b) exposure operationalizations that correspond with life-course theories. In this narrative review, we attempt to mitigate that tension. We first discuss the unique challenges for causal inference in life-course epidemiology. We then outline how quasi-experimental methods have already contributed to testing life-course theories, as well as the limitations of the quasi-experimental methods therein. We close with solutions that bridge the gap between modern developments in causal inference and life-course epidemiology, including redefined estimands to maximize public health impact; marginal structural and structural nested models; longitudinal instrumental variables approaches; leveraging new data linkages, such as with detailed residential histories; and triangulation across methods, including adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference.", "generated_text": "The integration of life-course epidemiology with causal inference presents a unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of health trajectories and their determinants. This paper explores the tensions and synergies between these two fields, focusing on the challenges of applying causal inference methods to life-course research. We discuss the limitations of traditional epidemiological approaches in capturing the complexity of life-course processes and the potential of natural experiments and advanced quantitative methods to address these issues. By reviewing recent methodological advancements and case studies, we highlight how causal inference can be leveraged to disentangle the temporal and contextual factors influencing health outcomes across the life span. The paper concludes with recommendations for bridging the methodological divide, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of innovative research designs that can accommodate the dynamic nature of life-course epidemiology while adhering to the principles of causal inference.", "label": 1}
