{"grounding": "Adolescence is a period of life that encompasses biological maturation and profound change in social roles. It is also a period associated with the onset of mental health problems. The field of developmental cognitive neuroscience has advanced our understanding of the development of the brain within its immediate social and cultural context. In a time of rising rates of mental health problems among adolescents across the globe, it is important to understand how the wider societal, structural, and cultural contexts of young people are impacting their biological and social-cognitive maturation. In this article, we review the landscape of youth mental health and brain development during adolescence and consider the potential role of brain research in understanding the effects of current social determinants of adolescent mental health, including socioeconomic inequality, city living, and eco-anxiety about the climate crisis.", "generated_text": "Adolescence is a critical period of development, marked by significant biological, psychological, and social changes. This paper adopts a neuroecosocial perspective to explore the multifaceted influences on adolescent development, emphasizing the interplay between neural processes, ecological contexts, and social determinants. We investigate how youth-led methods can empower adolescents to navigate challenges related to mental health, social inequalities, urbanicity, and the climate crisis. By integrating insights from neuroscience, ecology, and social sciences, we propose a holistic framework that addresses the complex needs of adolescents in diverse environments. Our findings highlight the importance of fostering resilience and agency among adolescents, advocating for inclusive policies and practices that support their well-being and development in the face of global challenges. This research underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understand and enhance adolescent development in a rapidly changing world.", "label": 1}
