{"grounding": "Bed bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) are an important group of obligate hematophagous urban insect pests. The global resurgence of bed bugs, involving the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius L., and the tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus (F.), over the past two decades is believed to be primarily due to the development of insecticide resistance, along with global travel and poor pest management, which have contributed to their spread. This review examines and synthesizes the literature on bed bug origins and their global spread and the literature on historical and contemporary control options. This includes bed bug prevention, detection and monitoring, nonchemical and chemical control methodologies (and their limitations), and potential future control options. Future research needs are highlighted, especially the factors behind the modern resurgence, the necessity of identifying differences between the two bed bug species relevant to control, and the need to improve insecticide test protocols and management strategies.", "generated_text": "The global resurgence of bed bugs, primarily Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, has prompted a reevaluation of historical and contemporary control strategies. This review synthesizes the evolution of management practices, from traditional methods to modern integrated pest management (IPM) approaches. Chemical control, once the cornerstone of bed bug eradication, faces challenges due to resistance development, necessitating the exploration of alternative strategies. Nonchemical control methods, including heat treatment, vacuuming, and the use of mattress encasements, have gained prominence for their efficacy and reduced environmental impact. The integration of chemical and nonchemical tactics within an IPM framework offers a sustainable solution to bed bug infestations. This paper highlights the importance of understanding bed bug biology and behavior in developing effective control measures, emphasizing the need for ongoing research to address the challenges posed by these resilient pests in a global context.", "label": 1}
