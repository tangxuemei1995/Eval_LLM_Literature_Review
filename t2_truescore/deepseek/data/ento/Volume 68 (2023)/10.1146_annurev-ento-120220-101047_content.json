{"grounding": "Although it is generally more adaptive for insects to produce additional generations than to have longer life cycles, some insects produce one or fewer generations per year (univoltine or semivoltine life cycles, respectively). Some insects with the potential to produce multiple generations per year produce a univoltine life cycle in response to environmental conditions. Obligatory univoltine insects have a single long diapause or multiple diapauses in different seasons. Semivoltine insects have multiple diapauses in different years, a prolonged diapause for more than a year, or diapause controlled by a circannual rhythm. Diapause in these insects greatly varies among species both in the physiological mechanism and in the evolutionary background, and there is no general rule defining it. In this review, we survey the physiological control of univoltine and semivoltine insectsâ€™ diapause and discuss the adaptive significance of the long life cycles. Although constraints such as slow development are sometimes responsible for these life cycles, the benefits of these life cycles can be explained by bet-hedging in many cases. We also discuss the effect of climate warming on these life cycles as a future area of research.", "generated_text": "Diapause, a period of suspended development, is a critical adaptation in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, enabling organisms to survive adverse environmental conditions. This study explores the mechanisms and ecological significance of diapause, with a focus on bet-hedging strategies, circannual rhythms, and phenotypic plasticity. Bet-hedging allows populations to spread risk across multiple generations, ensuring survival in unpredictable climates. Circannual rhythms, internal biological clocks, synchronize diapause timing with seasonal changes, optimizing resource utilization and reproductive success. Phenotypic plasticity enables individuals to adjust diapause duration in response to environmental cues, enhancing resilience to climate warming. Prolonged diapause, observed in semivoltine species, extends survival over multiple years, providing a buffer against extreme climatic events. Seasonal adaptation through diapause is increasingly crucial as climate warming disrupts traditional environmental patterns. This research synthesizes findings from diverse taxa to elucidate the evolutionary and ecological implications of diapause in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles. Understanding these adaptive strategies is essential for predicting species responses to ongoing climate change and informing conservation efforts.", "label": 1}
