{"grounding": "Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is not only an economic insect but also a model organism for life science research. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) disease is a major infectious disease in the world's sericulture industry. The cocoon loss caused by this disease accounts for more than 60% of the total loss caused by all silkworm diseases. To date, there has been no effective solution for preventing and treating this disease. The most effective measure is to breed disease-resistant varieties. The quickest way to breed disease-resistant varieties is to apply genetic modification. However, this requires that we obtain disease resistance genes and know the mechanism of disease resistance. Since the discovery of disease-resistant resources in 1989, scholars in the sericulture industry around the world have been inspired to search for resistance genes. In the past two decades, with the help of multi-omics technologies, screening of resistance genes, gene localization, protein modification, virus–host interactions, etc., researchers have found some candidate genes that have been proposed to function at the cellular or individual level. Several disease-resistant varieties have been obtained and used in production through hybrid breeding, RNA interference, and genetic modification. This article summarizes and reviews the discovery of and research advances related to silkworm resistance to BmNPV. It is anticipated that the review will inspire scientific researchers to continue searching for disease resistance genes, clarify the molecular mechanism of silkworm disease resistance, and promote disease-resistant silkworm breeding.", "generated_text": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a crucial model organism in the study of insect immunity and host-pathogen interactions, particularly in its resistance to the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV). This review delves into the mechanisms underlying silkworm resistance to BmNPV, focusing on the identification and characterization of resistant genes, the intricate virus–host interactions, and the genetic analysis of resistance. Recent advancements have highlighted several genes associated with BmNPV resistance, offering insights into the molecular basis of antiviral defense mechanisms in silkworms. The exploration of virus–host interactions has revealed complex signaling pathways and immune responses that are activated upon viral infection, providing a deeper understanding of the silkworm's innate immunity. Furthermore, genetic analysis and gene location studies have mapped resistance loci, facilitating the development of antiviral breeding strategies. These strategies aim to enhance silkworm resistance to BmNPV through selective breeding and genetic engineering, thereby improving silk production and sustainability. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of integrating molecular biology, genetics, and breeding techniques to combat viral pathogens in silkworms, offering valuable implications for pest management and the broader field of insect immunity.", "label": 1}
