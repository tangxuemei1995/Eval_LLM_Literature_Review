{"grounding": "Genetically engineered corn and cotton that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used to manage insect pests in the United States and elsewhere. In some cases, this has led to regional suppression of pest populations and pest eradication within the United States, and these outcomes were associated with reductions in conventional insecticides and increased profits for farmers. In other instances, pests evolved resistance to multiple Bt traits, compromising the capacity of Bt crops to manage pests and leading to increased feeding injury to crops in the field. Several aspects of pest biology and pestâ€“crop interactions were associated with cases where pests remained susceptible versus instances where pests evolved resistance. The viability of future transgenic traits can be improved by learning from these past outcomes. In particular, efforts should be made to delay resistance by increasing the prevalence of refuges and using integrated pest management.", "generated_text": "The adoption of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops in the United States has revolutionized the management of insect pests, particularly targeting Coleoptera and Lepidoptera species in major crops such as corn and cotton. Bt crops express insecticidal proteins that are toxic to specific pests, reducing the reliance on chemical insecticides and contributing to environmental sustainability. However, the widespread use of Bt crops has raised concerns about the development of insect resistance, prompting the implementation of insect resistance management (IRM) strategies. Among these, the refuge strategy, which involves planting non-Bt crops alongside Bt crops, has been pivotal in delaying resistance by maintaining a population of susceptible insects. This review examines the effectiveness of Bt crops in pest management, the challenges posed by insect resistance, and the role of IRM strategies, particularly the refuge strategy, in sustaining the efficacy of Bt technology in the United States.", "label": 1}
