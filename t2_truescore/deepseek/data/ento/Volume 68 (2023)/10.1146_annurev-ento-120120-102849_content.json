{"grounding": "The use of the functional feeding group–damage type system for analyzing arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants has transformed our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages by providing data, analyses, and interpretation of the local, regional, and global patterns of a 420-Myr history. The early fossil record can be used to answer major questions about the oldest evidence for herbivory, the early emergence of herbivore associations on land plants, and later expansion on seed plants. The subsequent effects of the Permian–Triassic ecological crisis on herbivore diversity, the resulting formation of biologically diverse herbivore communities on gymnosperms, and major shifts in herbivory ensuing from initial angiosperm diversification are additional issues that need to be addressed. Studies ofherbivory resulting from more recent transient spikes and longer-term climate trends provide important data that are applied to current global change and include herbivore community responses to latitude, altitude, and habitat. Ongoing paleoecological themes remaining to be addressed include the antiquity of modern interactions, differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms, and origins of modern tropical forests. The expansion of databases that include a multitude of specimens; improvements in sampling strategies; development of new analytical methods; and, importantly, the ability to address conceptually stimulating ecological and evolutionary questions have provided new impetus in this rapidly advancing field.", "generated_text": "The study of arthropod and pathogen damage on fossil and modern plants offers a unique window into the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. This research explores the intricate relationships between plants and their herbivores through the lens of damage types and functional feeding groups, spanning significant geological periods including the Cretaceous–Paleogene ecologic crisis, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, and the Permian–Triassic ecologic crisis. By analyzing continental scale patterns of plant-arthropod interactions, we aim to uncover the evolutionary dynamics that have shaped terrestrial ecosystems over millions of years. Our findings highlight the resilience and adaptability of plant-herbivore interactions through periods of dramatic environmental change, providing insights into the mechanisms of ecological recovery and the evolutionary pressures that drive the diversification of herbivory strategies. This study not only contributes to our understanding of the historical context of plant-arthropod interactions but also offers a framework for predicting future ecological responses to ongoing global changes.", "label": 1}
