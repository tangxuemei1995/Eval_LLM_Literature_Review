{"grounding": "Wood-boring pests (WBPs) pose an enormous threat to global forest ecosystems because their early stage infestations show no visible symptoms and can result in rapid and widespread infestations at later stages, leading to large-scale tree death. Therefore, early-stage WBP detection is crucial for prompt management response. Early detection of WBPs requires advanced and effective methods like remote sensing. This review summarizes the applications of various remote sensing sensors, platforms, and detection methods for monitoring WBP infestations. The current capabilities, gaps in capabilities, and future potential for the accurate and rapid detection of WBPs are highlighted.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of remote sensing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imagery, for the early detection and monitoring of wood-boring pests in forest ecosystems. By leveraging high-resolution imagery and spectral analysis, we aim to identify infestation signs before they become visible to the naked eye, enabling timely and targeted pest management strategies. The research highlights the potential of integrating UAV and satellite data for comprehensive forest health surveillance, offering a scalable and efficient approach to mitigate the impact of wood-boring pests on forest biodiversity and productivity.", "label": 0}
