{"grounding": "The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), is a well-known agricultural pest in its native range, North and South America, and has become a major invasive pest around the globe in the past decade. In this review, we provide an overview to update what is known about S. frugiperda in its native geographic ranges. This is followed by discussion of studies from the invaded areas to gain insights into S. frugiperda's ecology, specifically its reproductive biology, host plant use, status of insecticide resistance alleles, and biocontrol methods in native and invasive regions. We show that reference to host strains is uninformative in the invasive populations because multidirectional introduction events likely underpinned its recent rapid spread. Given that recent genomic analyses show that FAW is much more diverse than was previously assumed, and natural selection forces likely differ geographically, region-specific approaches will be needed to control this global pest.", "generated_text": "Spodoptera frugiperda, commonly known as the fall armyworm, is a highly invasive pest species that poses significant threats to global agriculture. This study delves into the ecology and evolutionary biology of S. frugiperda, with a focus on its taxonomy, population genetics, host plant use, strain hybridization, mate attraction mechanisms, and insecticide resistance. By synthesizing recent research findings, we explore the genetic diversity and adaptability of S. frugiperda populations, highlighting the role of strain hybridization in its rapid spread and adaptation to new environments. The review also examines the pest's host plant preferences and the implications for crop damage and management strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms of mate attraction and their impact on population dynamics, as well as the emerging challenges of insecticide resistance. This comprehensive analysis aims to inform the development of effective management options to mitigate the impact of S. frugiperda on agriculture worldwide.", "label": 1}
