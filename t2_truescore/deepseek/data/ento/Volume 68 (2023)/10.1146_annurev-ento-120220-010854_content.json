{"grounding": "The economic and environmental threats posed by non-native forest insects are ever increasing with the continuing globalization of trade and travel; thus, the need for mitigation through effective biosecurity is greater than ever. However, despite decades of research and implementation of preborder, border, and postborder preventative measures, insect invasions continue to occur, with no evidence of saturation, and are even predicted to accelerate. In this article, we review biosecurity measures used to mitigate the arrival, establishment, spread, and impacts of non-native forest insects and possible impediments to the successful implementation of these measures. Biosecurity successes are likely under-recognized because they are difficult to detect and quantify, whereas failures are more evident in the continued establishment of additional non-native species. There are limitations in existing biosecurity systems at global and country scales (for example, inspecting all imports is impossible, no phytosanitary measures are perfect, knownunknowns cannot be regulated against, and noncompliance is an ongoing problem). Biosecurity should be a shared responsibility across countries, governments, stakeholders, and individuals.", "generated_text": "Forest insect biosecurity is a critical component of global ecosystem management, aimed at preventing the introduction and spread of non-native species that can cause significant ecological and economic damage. This research explores the multifaceted processes involved in forest insect biosecurity, including the identification of invasion pathways, the implementation of phytosanitary measures, and the development of surveillance strategies to detect and monitor potential threats. By analyzing patterns of biological invasions, the study highlights the importance of predictive modeling in assessing the risk of new invasions and the effectiveness of eradication efforts. However, the research also identifies several pitfalls in current biosecurity practices, such as gaps in surveillance coverage, challenges in early detection, and the limitations of eradication programs. Through a comprehensive review of scientific literature and case studies, this paper provides insights into improving forest insect biosecurity measures, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that combine scientific research, policy development, and community engagement to protect forest ecosystems from invasive species.", "label": 1}
