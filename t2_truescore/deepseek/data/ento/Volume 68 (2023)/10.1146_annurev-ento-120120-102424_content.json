{"grounding": "There is growing awareness of pollinator declines worldwide. Conservation efforts have mainly focused on finding the direct causes, while paying less attention to building a systemic understanding of the fragility of these communities of pollinators. To fill this gap, we need operational measures of network resilience that integrate two different approaches in theoretical ecology. First, we should consider the range of conditions compatible with the stable coexistence of all of the species in a community. Second, we should address the rate and shape of network collapse once this safe operational space is exited. In this review, we describe this integrative approach and consider several mechanisms that may enhance the resilience of pollinator communities, chiefly rewiring the network of interactions, increasing heterogeneity, allowing variance, and enhancing coevolution. The most pressing need is to develop ways to reduce the gap between these theoretical recommendations and practical applications. This perspective shifts the emphasis from traditional approaches focusing on the equilibrium states to strategies that allow pollination networks to cope with global environmental change.", "generated_text": "Plant–pollinator networks are critical components of terrestrial ecosystems, facilitating the reproduction of a vast majority of flowering plants and the sustenance of pollinator populations. This study investigates the resilience of these mutualistic networks in the face of global environmental change, focusing on their robustness to ecosystem shifts. By synthesizing recent empirical and theoretical research, we explore the structural and functional attributes that confer resilience to plant–pollinator networks, including network architecture, species redundancy, and interaction rewiring. Our analysis reveals that while these networks exhibit a remarkable capacity to withstand perturbations, their resilience is increasingly challenged by anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species. We highlight the importance of conserving diverse pollinator communities and their habitats to maintain the stability and functionality of these networks. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for ecosystem management and conservation strategies, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that address the multifaceted drivers of global environmental change to safeguard plant–pollinator interactions and the ecosystem services they underpin.", "label": 1}
