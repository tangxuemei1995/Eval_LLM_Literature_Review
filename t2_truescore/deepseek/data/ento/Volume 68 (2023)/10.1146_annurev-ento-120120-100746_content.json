{"grounding": "Insect eggs are exposed to a plethora of abiotic and biotic threats. Their survival depends on both an innate developmental program and genetically determined protective traits provided by the parents. In addition, there is increasing evidence that (a) parents adjust the egg phenotype to the actual needs, (b) eggs themselves respond to environmental challenges, and (c) egg-associated microbes actively shape the egg phenotype. This review focuses on the phenotypic plasticity of insect eggs and their capability to adjust themselves to their environment. We outline the ways in which the interaction between egg and environment is two-way, with the environment shaping the egg phenotype but also with insect eggs affecting their environment. Specifically, insect eggs affect plant defenses, host biology (in the case of parasitoid eggs), and insect oviposition behavior. We aim to emphasize that the insect egg, although it is a sessile life stage, actively responds to and interacts with its environment.", "generated_text": "This study explores the adaptive plasticity of insect eggs in response to environmental challenges, focusing on the interplay between phenotypic plasticity, development, and microbial interactions. Insect eggs exhibit remarkable adaptability to environmental stressors, including microbial threats and variations in plant quality, through phenotypic plasticity. This plasticity enables the modulation of developmental trajectories and defense mechanisms, ensuring survival and fitness in fluctuating environments. We review evidence of how microbial communities associated with plants influence the phenotypic outcomes of insect eggs, highlighting the role of microbes in shaping developmental plasticity and defense strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these adaptive responses for insect-plant-microbe interactions and their impact on ecosystem dynamics. Our findings underscore the importance of phenotypic plasticity in the evolutionary success of insects, offering insights into the complex mechanisms underlying their adaptation to environmental challenges.", "label": 1}
