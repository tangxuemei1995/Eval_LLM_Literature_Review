{"grounding": "Health behaviors are inextricably linked to health and well-being, yet issues such as physical inactivity and insufficient sleep remain significant global public health problems. Mobile technology—and the unprecedented scope and quantity of data it generates—has a promising but largely untapped potential to promote health behaviors at the individual and population levels. This perspective article provides multidisciplinary recommendations on the design and use of mobile technology, and the concomitant wealth of data, to promote behaviors that support overall health. Using physical activity as anexemplar health behavior, we review emerging strategies for health behavior change interventions. We describe progress on personalizing interventions to an individual and their social, cultural, and built environments, as well as on evaluating relationships between mobile technology data and health to establish evidence-based guidelines. In reviewing these strategies and highlighting directions for future research, we advance the use of theory-based, personalized, and human-centered approaches in promoting health behaviors.", "generated_text": "The integration of mobile technology into public health promotion represents a transformative approach to enhancing physical activity and facilitating health behavior change. This paper explores the multidisciplinary perspective of leveraging digital health tools, including wearable sensors and culturally relevant personalized medicine, to address the global challenge of sedentary lifestyles and their associated health risks. By synthesizing current research, we highlight the potential of mobile technology to deliver tailored interventions that are both accessible and engaging for diverse populations. The discussion underscores the importance of designing digital health solutions that are sensitive to cultural contexts and individual preferences, thereby maximizing adherence and effectiveness. Furthermore, we examine the role of wearable sensors in providing real-time feedback and fostering a deeper understanding of personal health metrics. This abstract calls for a collaborative effort among technologists, healthcare professionals, and public health experts to harness the power of mobile technology in creating sustainable health promotion strategies.", "label": 1}
