{"grounding": "Heat is a dangerous hazard that causes acute heat illness, chronic disease exacerbations, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a range of injuries. Risks are highest during extreme heat events (EHEs), which challenge the capacity of health systems and other critical infrastructure. EHEs are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is driving an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality, necessitating more investment in health protection. Climate-resilient health systems are better positioned for EHEs, and EHE preparedness is a form of disaster risk reduction. Preparedness activities commonly take the form of heat action plans (HAPs), with many examples at various administrative scales. HAP activities can be divided into primary prevention, most important in the pre-event phase; secondary prevention, key to risk reduction early in an EHE;and tertiary prevention, important later in the event phase. After-action reports and other postevent evaluation activities are central to adaptive management of this climate-sensitive hazard.", "generated_text": "Extreme heat events (EHEs) are becoming increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change, posing significant public health challenges. This study explores the critical components of public health preparedness for EHEs, emphasizing the development and implementation of comprehensive heat action plans (HAPs). By analyzing existing literature and case studies, we identify key strategies for disaster risk reduction, including early warning systems, community outreach, and healthcare system readiness. The findings highlight the importance of integrating climate change projections into HAPs to enhance their effectiveness and adaptability. Additionally, the study underscores the need for multi-sectoral collaboration and public engagement to build resilience against the adverse health impacts of EHEs. The insights provided aim to inform policymakers and public health practitioners in designing and implementing robust preparedness measures to safeguard vulnerable populations from the escalating threat of extreme heat.", "label": 1}
