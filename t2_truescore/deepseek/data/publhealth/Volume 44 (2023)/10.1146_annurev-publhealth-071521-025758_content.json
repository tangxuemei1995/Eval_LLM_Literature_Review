{"grounding": "Rapid randomized controlled trials have been surprisingly rare in health care quality improvement (QI) and systems interventions. Applying clinical trials methodology QI work brings two distinct fields together, applying the robustness of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to the practical, operational learnings of the well-established QI field. Rapid trials also add a third element—speed—that enables health care systems to rapidly test multiple variations of an intervention in much the same way that A/B testing is done in the technology sector. When performed well, these rapid trials free researchers and health care systems from the requirement to be correct the first time (because it is low cost and quick to try something else) while offering a standard of evidence often absent in QI. Here we outline the historical underpinnings of this approach, provide guidance about how best to implement it, and describe lessons learned from running more than 20 randomized projects in the NYU Langone Health system.", "generated_text": "The integration of rapid randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into health care systems presents a transformative approach to enhancing quality improvement and safety. This study explores the efficacy of rapid RCTs as a methodological innovation for swiftly identifying and implementing evidence-based interventions within complex health care environments. By leveraging the principles of randomization and control, rapid RCTs offer a robust framework for evaluating the impact of quality improvement initiatives in real-time, thereby facilitating immediate adjustments and optimizations. The research underscores the potential of rapid RCTs to bridge the gap between clinical research and practice, ensuring that health care systems can adapt to emerging challenges with agility and precision. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper highlights the critical role of rapid RCTs in fostering a culture of continuous improvement, ultimately contributing to the advancement of patient care and safety outcomes in health care systems worldwide.", "label": 0}
