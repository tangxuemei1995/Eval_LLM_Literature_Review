{"grounding": "Given its origins in high-income countries, the field of physical activity and public health research and promotion has broadly followed a choice-based model. However, a substantial amount of the physical activity occurring routinely in many settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is the result of economic necessity and is not due to true, free choices. We propose the “necessity- versus choice-based physical activity models” framework as a conceptual tool to ground physical activity and public health research and promotion efforts in LMICs, helping ensurethat these efforts are relevant, ethical, responsive, and respectful to local contexts. Identifying ways to ensure that LMIC populations can maintain high levels of active transport while increasing opportunities for active leisure must be prioritized. To promote equity, physical activity research, programs, and policies in LMICs must focus on improving the conditions under which necessity-driven physical activity occurs for a vast majority of the population.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dichotomy between necessity and choice in physical activity within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), focusing on active transport as a primary form of movement. In LMICs, where economic constraints and infrastructural limitations often dictate daily routines, physical activity is frequently a necessity rather than a choice. This research aims to understand how this distinction impacts health equity and social justice, particularly in the context of global health initiatives promoting physical activity. By analyzing existing literature and case studies, the study highlights the unique challenges faced by populations in LMICs, including limited access to recreational facilities and the reliance on non-motorized transport for daily commuting. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at increasing physical activity in these regions must consider the socio-economic and environmental contexts, advocating for policies that support active transport infrastructure and equitable access to physical activity opportunities. This approach not only addresses public health goals but also contributes to broader social justice objectives by recognizing and mitigating the disparities in physical activity engagement across different socio-economic groups.", "label": 1}
