{"grounding": "Between the 2009 Great Recession and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US state and local governmental public health workforce lost 40,000 jobs. Tens of thousands of workers also left during the pandemic and continue to leave. As governmental health departments are now receiving multimillion-dollar, temporary federal investments to replenish their workforce, this review synthesizes the evidence regarding major challenges that preceded the pandemic and remain now. These include the lack of the field's ability to readily enumerate and define the governmental public health workforce as well as challenges with the recruitment and retention of public health workers. This review finds that many workforce-related challenges identified more than 20 years ago persist in the field today. Thus, it is critical that we look back to be able to then move forward to successfully rebuild the workforce and assure adequate capacity to protect the public's health and respond to public health emergencies.", "generated_text": "The United States public health workforce is at a critical juncture, facing ongoing challenges in recruitment, retention, and development that threaten its capacity to protect and improve the nation's health. This paper examines the current state of the public health workforce, highlighting the persistent issues of underfunding, inadequate training opportunities, and the lack of a comprehensive enumeration system to accurately assess workforce needs and capabilities. Despite these challenges, there are promising directions for the future, including innovative workforce development programs, enhanced training initiatives, and the adoption of new technologies to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The paper argues for a concerted effort among public health leaders, policymakers, and educators to address these challenges through strategic investments in workforce development, the creation of more robust training and retention programs, and the establishment of a standardized enumeration system. Such efforts are essential to ensure that the public health workforce is equipped to meet the evolving health needs of the U.S. population.", "label": 1}
