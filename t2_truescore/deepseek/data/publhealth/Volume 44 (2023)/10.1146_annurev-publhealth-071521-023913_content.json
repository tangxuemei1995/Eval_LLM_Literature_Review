{"grounding": "Current digital health approaches have not engaged diverse end users or reduced health or health care inequities, despite their promise to deliver more tailored and personalized support to individuals at the right time and the right place. To achieve digital health equity, we must refocus our attention on the current state of digital health uptake and use across the policy, system, community, individual, and intervention levels. We focus here on (a) outlining a multilevel framework underlying digital health equity; (b) summarizingfive types of interventions/programs (with example studies) that hold promise for advancing digital health equity; and (c) recommending future steps for improving policy, practice, and research in this space.", "generated_text": "This literature synthesis explores the multilevel determinants of digital health equity, integrating findings from a comprehensive review of scientific literature. It identifies key factors at individual, community, and systemic levels that influence equitable access to and utilization of digital health technologies.
