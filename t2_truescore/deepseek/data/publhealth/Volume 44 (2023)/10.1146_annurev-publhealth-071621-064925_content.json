{"grounding": "Taking stock of environmental justice (EJ) is daunting. It is at once a scholarly field, an ongoing social movement, and an administrative imperative adopted by government agencies and incorporated into legislation. Moreover, within academia, it is multidisciplinary and multimethodological, comprising scholars who do not always speak to one another. Any review of EJ is thus necessarily restrictive.\nThis article explores several facets of EJ activism. One is its coalitional and “inside-outside” orientation. EJ activists are constantly forming alliances with other stakeholders, but these coalitions do not flout the importance of engaging with formal institutions. The review next turns to one set of such institutions—the courts and regulatory agencies—to see how well EJ claims have fared there. I then survey scientific findings that have been influenced by EJ. The review concludes with future directions for activists and scholars to consider: the changing nature of EJ coalitions, fragmentation within EJ and with other fields, the historical roots of environmental injustice, and opportunities for stronger infusion of the EJ lens.", "generated_text": "Environmental justice (EJ) has emerged as a critical framework for understanding and addressing the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities, particularly those of color. This paper explores the historical trajectory of the EJ movement, highlighting its roots in combating environmental racism and its evolution into a broader advocacy for equitable environmental policies and practices. By examining the intersection of structural racism and environmental health disparities, we underscore the persistent challenges in achieving environmental equity. Furthermore, this study delves into the role of health advocacy and activism in advancing EJ, emphasizing the importance of community-led initiatives and policy reforms. Looking ahead, we discuss potential directions for the EJ movement, including the integration of EJ principles into climate change mitigation strategies and the amplification of voices from the most affected communities. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on environmental justice by providing a comprehensive overview of its past achievements and future prospects.", "label": 1}
