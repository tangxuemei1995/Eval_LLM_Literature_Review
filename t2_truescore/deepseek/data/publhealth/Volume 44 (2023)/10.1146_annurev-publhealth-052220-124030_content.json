{"grounding": "The implementation of primary and secondary preventive strategies is based on the evidence generated by cancer epidemiology, where the identification of risk factors and the description of their prevalence are fundamental to derive estimates on the burden of cancer from different etiologies, typically expressed as the population attributable fraction, which corresponds to the proportion of a cancer that may be prevented by controlling a given risk factor. However, even when cancer finds its etiology in modifiable factors, its prevention through the control of those factors is not always feasible, or it remains suboptimal despite the possibility of reducing the burden. We reviewed selected associations between modifiable risk factors and cancer, including tobacco smoking, occupational exposures, infections, air pollution, alcohol, and diet and obesity, and illustrated examples of both successes and failures in cancer control, underlying how current understanding of the avoidable causes of cancer is incomplete.", "generated_text": "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with a significant proportion of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors. This study aims to delineate the spectrum of cancers linked to avoidable exposures and to quantify the attributable fractions (AFs) for these risk factors, thereby providing a comprehensive road map for cancer prevention. By systematically reviewing and synthesizing data from epidemiological studies, we identify key modifiable factors including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, poor diet, physical inactivity, and exposure to carcinogens. Our findings underscore the potential for substantial reductions in cancer incidence through targeted public health interventions aimed at these risk factors. The estimated AFs highlight the critical areas for cancer control strategies, emphasizing the importance of primary prevention. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the prioritization of modifiable risk factors in cancer prevention efforts, offering actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals to mitigate the global cancer burden.", "label": 1}
