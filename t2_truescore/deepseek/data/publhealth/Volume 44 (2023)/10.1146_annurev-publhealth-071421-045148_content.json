{"grounding": "The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events, are expected to increase and alter human migration and mobility. Climate-related mobility is not inherently a crisis; it can provide a pathway for adaptation to climate change. However, a growing body of research identifies health risks and some opportunities associated with climate-related mobility. This review examines recent research (published since 2018) on the climate change–mobility–health nexus; this research focuses largely on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. It considers the links between human mobility and anthropogenic climate change and documents the findings of empirical research that addresses the health consequences of displacement, planned relocation, migration, and migration into sites of climate risk. The findings highlight the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health care in a heating world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationships between climatic and environmental changes, migration patterns, and health outcomes. As global temperatures rise and environmental conditions deteriorate, populations are increasingly compelled to migrate, either temporarily or permanently, leading to significant health implications. The research delves into the mechanisms through which climate-induced migration—encompassing displacement, relocation, and mobility—affects physical and mental health. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset from various regions affected by climate change, the study identifies key factors that exacerbate health risks among migrant populations, including access to healthcare, exposure to new pathogens, and the psychological stress of displacement. Furthermore, it examines the role of policy interventions in mitigating these health risks and facilitating adaptive migration strategies. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated approaches that address the health impacts of climate-induced migration, advocating for policies that enhance resilience and support sustainable mobility in the face of environmental change.", "label": 1}
