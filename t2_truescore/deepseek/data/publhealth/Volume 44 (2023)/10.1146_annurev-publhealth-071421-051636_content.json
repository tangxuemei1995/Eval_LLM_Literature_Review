{"grounding": "Extreme weather events are expected to increase due to climate change, which could pose an additional burden of morbidity and mortality. In recent decades, drought severity has increased in several regions around the world, affecting health by increasing the risk of water-, food-, and vector-borne diseases, malnutrition, cardiovascular and respiratory illness, mental health disorders, and mortality. Drought frequency and severity are expected to worsen across large regions as a result of a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature and atmospheric evaporative demand, posing a pressing challenge for public health. Variation in impacts among countries and communities is due to multiple factors, such as aging, socioeconomic status, access to health care, and gender, affecting population resilience. Integrative proactive action plans focused on risk management are required, and resources should be transferred to developing countries to reduce their vulnerability and risk.", "generated_text": "This critical review examines the public health implications of drought within the context of climate change, focusing on the interplay between drought trends, human health, vulnerability, and drought risk management. As climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of droughts, understanding their impact on public health becomes increasingly crucial. This paper synthesizes current research to explore how droughts affect water quality and availability, food security, and the prevalence of diseases, thereby increasing human vulnerability. It also evaluates the effectiveness of existing drought risk management strategies in mitigating these health impacts. The review highlights the need for integrated approaches that combine climate adaptation and public health strategies to enhance resilience against drought-related health risks. By identifying gaps in current knowledge and practice, this study aims to inform future research and policy development to better protect vulnerable populations from the health consequences of drought in a changing climate.", "label": 1}
