{"grounding": "Public health surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data and is closely integrated with the timely dissemination of information that the public needs to know and upon which the public should act. Public health surveillance is central to modern public health practice by contributing data and information usually through a national notifiable disease reporting system (NNDRS). Although early identification and prediction of future disease trends may be technically feasible, more work is needed to improve accuracy so that policy makers can use these predictions to guide prevention and control efforts. In this article, we review the advantages and limitations of the current NNDRS in most countries, discuss some lessons learned about prevention and control from the first wave of COVID-19, and describe some technological innovations in public health surveillance, including geographic information systems (GIS), spatial modeling, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the digital twin method. We conclude that the technology-driven innovative public health surveillance systems are expected to further improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of case reporting during outbreaks and also enhance feedback and transparency, whereby all stakeholders should receive actionable information on control and be able to limit disease risk earlier than ever before.", "generated_text": "The advent of emerging infectious diseases, exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has underscored the critical need for innovative approaches in public health surveillance. This study explores the integration of advanced technologies, including spatial modeling and artificial intelligence (AI), into the national notifiable disease reporting system to enhance the detection, monitoring, and response to infectious diseases. Spatial modeling facilitates the visualization and analysis of disease spread patterns, enabling public health officials to identify hotspots and allocate resources more effectively. Meanwhile, AI algorithms offer the potential to predict outbreaks by analyzing vast datasets, including social media, electronic health records, and environmental factors, thereby providing early warning signals. The incorporation of these technologies into public health surveillance systems promises to revolutionize the way we track and manage infectious diseases, offering a more proactive and predictive approach to public health. This paper reviews current innovations, discusses their implications for public health policy, and outlines future directions for research and implementation, aiming to bolster the global response to emerging infections and safeguard public health in an increasingly interconnected world.", "label": 1}
