{"grounding": "The basal ganglia (BG) make up a prominent nexus between visual and motor-related brain regions. In contrast to the BG's well-established roles in movement control and value-based decision making, their contributions to the transformation of visual input into an action remain unclear, especially in the context of perceptual decisions based on uncertain visual evidence. This article reviews recent progress in our understanding of the BG's contributions to the formation, evaluation, and adjustment of such decisions. From theoretical and experimental perspectives, the review focuses on four key stations in the BG network, namely, the striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons, which can have different roles and together support the decision process.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the pivotal role of the basal ganglia, particularly the striatum and pallidum, in visual perceptual decision-making processes. Utilizing a combination of saccade tracking, choice behavior analysis, and reaction time measurements, we explore how these subcortical structures contribute to the integration of sensory information and the execution of decision-related actions. Sequential analysis techniques and signal detection theory are employed to dissect the neural mechanisms underlying the accuracy and speed of perceptual decisions. Our findings suggest that the basal ganglia not only facilitate the selection of appropriate motor responses but also play a crucial role in the temporal dynamics of decision-making, highlighting their importance in the complex interplay between perception and action.", "label": 0}
