{"grounding": "The visual system must reconstruct the dynamic, three-dimensional (3D) world from ambiguous two-dimensional (2D) retinal images. In this review, we synthesize current literature on how the visual system of nonhuman primates performs this transformation through multiple channels within the classically defined dorsal (where) and ventral (what) pathways. Each of these channels is specialized for processing different 3D features (e.g., the shape, orientation, or motion of objects, or the larger scene structure). Despite the common goal of 3D reconstruction, neurocomputational differences between the channels impose distinct information-limiting constraints on perception. Convergent evidence further points to the little-studied area V3A as a potential branchpoint from which multiple 3D-fugal processing channels diverge. We speculate that the expansion of V3A in humans may have supported the emergence of advanced 3D spatial reasoning skills. Lastly, we discuss future directions for exploring 3D information transmission across brain areas and experimental approaches that can further advance the understanding of 3D vision.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the neuronal mechanisms underlying three-dimensional (3D) vision in nonhuman primates, focusing on the integration of stereopsis, perspective, depth, orientation, and motion cues. Utilizing a combination of electrophysiological recordings and behavioral assays, we identified specific neural populations within the visual cortex that are preferentially activated by 3D stimuli. Our findings reveal that these neurons exhibit a remarkable capacity to encode depth information through binocular disparity and motion parallax, suggesting a sophisticated neural architecture dedicated to the perception of 3D space. Furthermore, we observed that the orientation and motion of objects in space modulate the activity of these neurons, indicating a dynamic interplay between different visual cues in the construction of a coherent 3D representation. This research provides critical insights into the neural basis of 3D vision, offering a foundation for understanding the complex processes that enable primates to navigate and interact with their environment effectively.", "label": 1}
