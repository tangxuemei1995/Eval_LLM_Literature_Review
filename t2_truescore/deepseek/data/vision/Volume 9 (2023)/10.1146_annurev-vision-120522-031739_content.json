{"grounding": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are machine learning algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision due to their remarkable successes in tasks like object classification and segmentation. The success of DNNs as computer vision algorithms has led to the suggestion that DNNs may also be good models of human visual perception. In this article, we review evidence regarding current DNNs as adequate behavioral models of human core object recognition. To this end, we argue that it is important to distinguish between statistical tools and computational models and to understand model quality as a multidimensional concept in which clarity about modeling goals is key. Reviewing a large number of psychophysical and computational explorations of core object recognition performance in humans and DNNs, we argue that DNNs are highly valuable scientific tools but that, as of today, DNNs should only be regarded as promising—but not yet adequate—computational models of human core object recognition behavior. On the way, we dispel several myths surrounding DNNs in vision science.", "generated_text": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as powerful computational models, achieving remarkable success in tasks such as object recognition, a core aspect of human visual perception. This study investigates the adequacy of DNNs as behavioral models of human visual perception, focusing on their performance in visual psychophysics tasks. By comparing the responses of DNNs to those of human observers across a range of stimuli and conditions, we aim to assess the extent to which these models can replicate human perceptual behavior. Our analysis leverages advancements in deep learning and computer vision, employing state-of-the-art neural network architectures to explore the alignment between artificial and biological vision systems. The findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the suitability of DNNs for modeling human visual perception, offering insights into their strengths and limitations as computational models in the field of visual psychophysics.", "label": 1}
