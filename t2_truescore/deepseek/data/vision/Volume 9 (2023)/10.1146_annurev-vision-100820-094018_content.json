{"grounding": "We live on a planet that is bathed in daily and seasonal sunlight cycles. In this context, terrestrial life forms have evolved mechanisms that directly harness light energy (plants) or decode light information for adaptive advantage. In animals, the main light sensors are a family of G proteinâ€“coupled receptors called opsins. Opsin function is best described for the visual sense. However, most animals also use opsins for extraocular light sensing for seasonal behavior and camouflage. While it has long been believed that mammals do not have an extraocular light sensing capacity, recent evidence suggests otherwise. Notably, encephalopsin (OPN3) and neuropsin (OPN5) are both known to mediate extraocular light sensing in mice. Examples of this mediation include photoentrainment of circadian clocks in skin (by OPN5) and acute light-dependent regulation of metabolic pathways (by OPN3 and OPN5). This review summarizes current findings in the expanding field of extraocular photoreception and their relevance for human physiology.", "generated_text": "Nonvisual opsins, a class of photosensitive proteins, have emerged as pivotal players in the realm of extraocular light sensing, extending their influence beyond traditional visual pathways to modulate physiological processes. This review delves into the expanding role of nonvisual opsins in detecting environmental light cues, thereby orchestrating a myriad of biological functions including the regulation of the circadian clock and metabolic homeostasis. Recent advancements have illuminated the presence of these opsins in various non-retinal tissues, suggesting a complex network of light-responsive mechanisms that contribute to systemic physiological adaptations. By integrating findings from molecular, cellular, and organismal studies, we highlight the significance of nonvisual opsins in mediating light's effects on behavior, physiology, and health. This synthesis underscores the necessity for further exploration into the mechanisms by which nonvisual opsins translate light signals into biological responses, offering novel insights into their therapeutic potential for circadian and metabolic disorders.", "label": 1}
