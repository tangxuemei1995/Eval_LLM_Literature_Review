{"grounding": "This review examines the concept of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in patients with macular diseases. Considering monocular and binocular viewing, we (a) explain how to identify the PRL and discuss the pitfalls associated with its measurement, (b) review the current hypotheses for PRL development, (c) assess whether the PRL is the new reference point of the ocular motor system, and discuss (d) the functional and (e) the clinical implications of the PRL. We conclude that the current definition of the PRL is probably incomplete and should incorporate the need to evaluate the PRL in the framework of binocular viewing. We emphasize the need for more research.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of the Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL), a critical adaptation mechanism in individuals experiencing central vision loss, particularly due to conditions like macular degeneration. The PRL refers to an area of the retina that patients subconsciously use to fixate on objects, compensating for the loss of central vision. Our research delves into the factors influencing the selection and stability of the PRL, including the role of binocular viewing in enhancing fixation stability. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of clinical data, we aim to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying PRL development and its implications for visual rehabilitation strategies.", "label": 1}
