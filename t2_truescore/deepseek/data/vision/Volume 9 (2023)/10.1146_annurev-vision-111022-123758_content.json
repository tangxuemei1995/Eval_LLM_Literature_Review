{"grounding": "Augmented reality (AR) systems aim to alter our view of the world and enable us to see things that are not actually there. The resulting discrepancy between perception and reality can create compelling entertainment and can support innovative approaches to education, guidance, and assistive tools. However, building an AR system that effectively integrates with our natural visual experience is hard. AR systems often suffer from visual limitations and artifacts, and addressing these flaws requires basic knowledge of perception. At the same time, AR system development can serve as a catalyst that drives innovative new research in perceptual science. This review describes recent perceptual research pertinent to and driven by modern AR systems, with the goal of highlighting thought-provoking areas of inquiry and open questions.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the perceptual science of augmented reality (AR), focusing on how display systems influence visual perception. By examining the interplay between AR technologies and human visual processing, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that underpin the effectiveness of AR in altering or enhancing perception. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we explore the factors that contribute to the seamless integration of virtual elements into the real world, including display resolution, field of view, and latency. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing these parameters to improve user experience and perceptual accuracy in AR applications. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AR, offering insights that could inform the design of future AR systems for various domains, including education, entertainment, and professional training.", "label": 1}
