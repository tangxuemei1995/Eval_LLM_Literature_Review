{"grounding": "Global health security threats and the public health impact resulting from emerging infectious diseases including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent Ebola virus disease outbreaks continuously emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to preparedness, management of disease outbreaks, and health sequelae associated with emergent pathogens. A spectrum of associated ophthalmic manifestations, along with the potential persistence of emerging viral pathogens in ocular tissues, highlight the importance of an ophthalmic approach to contributing to efforts in the response to public health emergencies from disease outbreaks. This article summarizes the ophthalmic and systemic findings, epidemiology, and therapeutics for emerging viral pathogens identified by the World Health Organization as high-priority pathogens with epidemic potential.", "generated_text": "Emerging viral infections pose significant challenges to global health, with the eye being a critical site for both viral entry and manifestation of disease. This review focuses on the ophthalmic manifestations of emerging viral infections, including COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease, highlighting the mechanisms of viral persistence and the spectrum of ocular involvement. Recent studies have identified uveitis as a notable complication, underscoring the need for heightened awareness and understanding of these pathogens' impact on ocular health. By synthesizing current literature, this paper aims to provide insights into the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management strategies for viral infections affecting the eye, contributing to the broader discourse on emerging infectious diseases.", "label": 1}
