{"grounding": "Perception and memory are traditionally thought of as separate cognitive functions, supported by distinct brain regions. The canonical perspective is that perceptual processing of visual information is supported by the ventral visual stream, whereas long-term declarative memory is supported by the medial temporal lobe. However, this modular framework cannot account for the increasingly large body of evidence that reveals a role for early visual areas in long-term recognition memory and a role for medial temporal lobe structures in high-level perceptual processing. In this article, we review relevant research conducted in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. We conclude that the evidence is largely inconsistent with theoretical proposals that draw sharp functional boundaries between perceptual and memory systems in the brain. Instead, the weight of the empirical findings is best captured by a representational-hierarchical model that emphasizes differences in content, rather than in cognitive processes within the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between perception and memory is a cornerstone of cognitive neuroscience, with the ventral visual stream (VVS) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) playing pivotal roles. This study delves into the mechanisms by which these brain regions interact to facilitate the encoding, storage, and retrieval of visual information. The VVS, known for its role in object recognition, processes visual stimuli in a hierarchical manner, culminating in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) of the MTL, which is crucial for the integration of perceptual and mnemonic information. We explore how the PRC acts as a nexus between perception and memory, enabling the discrimination of novel from familiar stimuli and supporting the formation of complex, multimodal memories. Through a synthesis of neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and lesion studies, this research highlights the dynamic interplay between the VVS and MTL, offering insights into the neural substrates of memory and perception and their implications for understanding cognitive disorders.", "label": 1}
