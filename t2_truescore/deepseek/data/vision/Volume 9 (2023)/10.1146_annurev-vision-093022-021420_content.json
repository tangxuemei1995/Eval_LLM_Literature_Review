{"grounding": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a complex disease involving development of the neural retina, ocular circulations, and other organ systems of the premature infant. The external stresses of the ex utero environment also influence the pathophysiology of ROP through interactions among retinal neural, vascular, and glial cells. There is variability among individual infants and presentations of the disease throughout the world, making ROP challenging to study. The methods used include representative animal models, cell culture, and clinical studies. This article describes the impact of maternal–fetal interactions; stresses that the preterm infant experiences; and biologic pathways of interest, including growth factor effects and cell–cell interactions, on the complex pathophysiology of ROP phenotypes in developed and emerging countries.", "generated_text": "Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a complex vascular disorder affecting preterm infants, characterized by abnormal retinal angiogenesis due to interrupted vascular development. This condition is primarily driven by oxygen-induced retinopathy, where fluctuating oxygen levels disrupt the delicate balance of growth factors and cell signaling pathways essential for normal vascularization. Key players include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), whose dysregulation leads to pathological neovascularization. Maternal–fetal interactions also play a crucial role, influencing the intrauterine environment and subsequent susceptibility to ROP. Understanding the pathophysiology of ROP involves dissecting these intricate mechanisms to identify potential therapeutic targets. This review highlights the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular underpinnings of ROP, emphasizing the importance of angiogenesis, growth factors, and cell signaling in its development and progression.", "label": 1}
