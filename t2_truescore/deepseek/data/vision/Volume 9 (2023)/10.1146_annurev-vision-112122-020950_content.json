{"grounding": "Because the central nervous system is largely nonrenewing, neurons and their synapses must be maintained over the lifetime of an individual to ensure circuit function. Age is a dominant risk factor for neural diseases, and declines in nervous system function are a common feature of aging even in the absence of disease. These alterations extend to the visual system and, in particular, to the retina. The retina is a site of clinically relevant age-related alterations but has also proven to be a uniquely approachable system for discovering principles that govern neural aging because it is well mapped, contains diverse neuron types, and is experimentally accessible. In this article, we review the structural and molecular impacts of aging on neurons within the inner and outer retina circuits. We further discuss the contribution of non-neuronal cell types and systems to retinal aging outcomes. Understanding how and why the retina ages is critical to efforts aimed at preventing age-related neural decline and restoring neural function.", "generated_text": "The aging retina undergoes significant structural and functional changes, impacting visual perception and quality of life. This study delves into the molecular landscapes that define the aging process within the retinal tissue, focusing on the alterations in synaptic integrity and neuronal health. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and analysis of recent findings, we explore the mechanisms underlying synaptic degeneration and neuronal loss, which are hallmark features of retinal aging. Our investigation highlights the role of oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation in driving these pathological changes. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving retinal function and mitigating the effects of aging. By elucidating the complex interplay between molecular pathways and cellular components in the aging retina, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of age-related retinal diseases and paves the way for innovative interventions to enhance visual health in the elderly population.", "label": 1}
