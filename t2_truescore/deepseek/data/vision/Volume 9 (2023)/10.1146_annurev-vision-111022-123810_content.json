{"grounding": "Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) is clinically diagnosed as a vascular disease, many studies find retinal neuronal and visual dysfunction before the onset of vascular DR. This suggests that DR should be viewed as a neurovascular disease. Prior to the onset of DR, human patients have compromised electroretinograms that indicate a disruption of normal function, particularly in the inner retina. They also exhibit reduced contrast sensitivity. These early changes, especially those due to dysfunction in the inner retina, are also seen in rodent models of diabetes in the early stages of the disease. Rodent models of diabetes exhibit several neuronal mechanisms, such as reduced evoked GABA release, increased excitatory glutamate signaling, and reduced dopamine signaling, that suggest specific neuronal deficits. This suggests that understanding neuronal deficits may lead to early diabetes treatments to ameliorate neuronal dysfunction.", "generated_text": "Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent metabolic disorder that significantly impacts visual health, leading to a spectrum of retinal complications. This study explores the underlying mechanisms of visual dysfunction in diabetes, focusing on the physiological alterations in retinal neurons across human and rodent models, including mice and rats. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and experimental data, we investigate the pathological changes in the retina induced by hyperglycemia, such as neuronal apoptosis, vascular abnormalities, and impaired synaptic signaling. The research highlights the similarities and differences in diabetic retinopathy progression between species, providing insights into the translational potential of rodent models for understanding human disease. Our findings underscore the critical role of neuronal physiology in the onset and progression of diabetic visual impairment, offering a foundation for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to preserve vision in diabetic patients.", "label": 1}
