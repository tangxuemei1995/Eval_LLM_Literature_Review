{"grounding": "The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical brain structure that is relevant for sensation, cognition, and action. In nonhuman primates, a rich history of studies has provided unprecedented detail about this structure's role in controlling orienting behaviors; as a result, the primate SC has become primarily regarded as a motor control structure. However, as in other species, the primate SC is also a highly visual structure: A fraction of its inputs is retinal and complemented by inputs from visual cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex. Motivated by this, recent investigations are revealing the rich visual pattern analysis capabilities of the primate SC, placing this structure in an ideal position to guide orienting movements. The anatomical proximity of the primate SC to both early visual inputs and final motor control apparatuses, as well as its ascending feedback projections to the cortex, affirms an important role for this structure in active perception.", "generated_text": "The primate superior colliculus (SC) plays a pivotal role in the integration of visual information and the generation of orienting behaviors, including eye movements. This subcortical structure is essential for the transformation of sensory inputs into motor outputs, facilitating the rapid localization of and response to visual stimuli in the environment. Recent studies have highlighted the SC's involvement in active vision, where it contributes to the dynamic interplay between sensory processing and motor action, enabling primates to navigate complex visual scenes effectively. The SC's layered organization allows for the segregation of visual, multisensory, and motor-related functions, with the superficial layers primarily processing visual information and the deeper layers involved in the initiation of orienting movements. This review synthesizes current understanding of the SC's visual functions, emphasizing its role in eye movement control, spatial attention, and the coordination of active vision, thereby underscoring its significance in the primate visual system.", "label": 1}
