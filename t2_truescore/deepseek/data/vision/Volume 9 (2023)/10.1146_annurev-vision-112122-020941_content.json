{"grounding": "Some visual properties are consistent across a wide range of environments, while other properties are more labile. The efficient coding hypothesis states that many of these regularities in the environment can be discarded from neural representations, thus allocating more of the brain's dynamic range to properties that are likely to vary. This paradigm is less clear about how the visual system prioritizes different pieces of information that vary across visual environments. One solution is to prioritize information that can be used to predict future events, particularly those that guide behavior. The relationship between the efficient coding and future prediction paradigms is an area of active investigation. In this review, we argue that these paradigms are complementary and often act on distinct components of the visual input. We also discuss how normative approaches to efficient coding and future prediction can be integrated.", "generated_text": "The human visual system is a marvel of biological engineering, adept at both efficiently encoding vast amounts of sensory information and predicting future states of the environment. This study delves into the dual aspects of neural coding: efficiency and prediction, within the context of visual processing. By employing the information bottleneck principle, we explore how the brain balances the trade-off between compressing sensory data and retaining predictive information. Our findings suggest that efficient coding strategies are inherently linked to predictive coding mechanisms, revealing that these two processes are not mutually exclusive but rather two sides of the same coin. Through computational modeling and analysis of neural data, we demonstrate that the visual system optimizes for both efficiency and prediction, ensuring robust and adaptive responses to dynamic environments. This research sheds light on the fundamental principles underlying neural computation and offers insights into the design of artificial systems inspired by biological vision.", "label": 1}
