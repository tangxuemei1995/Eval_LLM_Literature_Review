{"grounding": "Rotation with thermally induced buoyancy governs many astrophysical and geophysical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, sun, and Earth's liquid-metal outer core. Rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection (RRBC) is an experimental system that has features of rotation and buoyancy, where a container of height H and temperature difference Δ between its bottom and top is rotated about its vertical axis with angular velocity Ω. The strength of buoyancy is reflected in the Rayleigh number (∼H\n3Δ) and that of the Coriolis force in the Ekman and Rossby numbers (∼Ω−1). Rotation suppresses the convective onset, introduces instabilities, changes the velocity boundary layers, modifies the shape of thermal structures from plumes to vortical columns, affects the large-scale circulation, and can decrease or enhance global heat transport depending on buoyant and Coriolis forcing. RRBC is an extremely rich system, with features directly comparable to geophysical and astrophysical phenomena. Here we review RRBC studies, suggest a unifying heat transport scaling approach for the transition between rotation-dominated and buoyancy-dominated regimes in RRBC, and discuss non-Oberbeck–Boussinesq and centrifugal effects.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the complex dynamics of turbulent rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection, a fundamental process in geophysical and astrophysical flows, where buoyancy-driven turbulence is significantly influenced by rotation. By integrating theoretical analysis, precise measurements, and direct numerical simulations, we explore the intricate interplay between buoyancy and rotational forces on heat transport mechanisms. Our findings reveal that rotation introduces a Coriolis force that modifies the convective structures, leading to the formation of columnar vortices and altering the heat transfer efficiency. The research highlights the critical role of the Rossby and Rayleigh numbers in determining the transition between different flow regimes, from weakly rotating to strongly rotating turbulence. Furthermore, we present novel insights into the scaling laws governing heat transport in rotating convection, challenging existing theories and providing a refined understanding of the underlying physics. This work not only advances our theoretical knowledge of rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection but also has implications for improving models of planetary atmospheres, oceans, and stellar interiors.", "label": 1}
