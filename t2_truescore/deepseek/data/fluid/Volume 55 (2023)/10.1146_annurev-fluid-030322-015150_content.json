{"grounding": "Particles floating at interfaces are commonly observed in nature, as well as in industrial processes. When the particles are non-Brownian particles, large deformations of the interface are created that induce long-ranged capillary interactions and lead to the formation of particle rafts with unique characteristics. In this review we discuss recent efforts in investigating particle raft formation and the role of the raftsâ€™ own weight during dynamic clustering. Under specific conditions, these rafts can ultimately collapse and sink. When subjected to external or internal forces, the raft undergoes large deformations that test the mechanical characteristics of this interfacial composite material. It can behave as a continuous elastic sheet under compression, although its discrete nature can also trigger its fragmentation via interparticle interactions. Finally, armored droplets, drops covered by a protective shell of particles, can lose their integrity when submitted to dynamic deformations, resulting in the ejection of particles or the fracturing of the armor. Open questions to understand the properties of this material are highlighted and future research to understand the fundamental physics of particle rafts, the customization of the cluster formation, or the disassembly of this collective material is suggested.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the fascinating world of particle-laden interfaces, focusing on the formation and behavior of particle rafts and armored droplets. By exploring the principles of self-assembly, buoyancy, interfacial rheology, capillarity, and elasticity, we uncover the complex interactions that govern these systems. Particle rafts, which are monolayers of particles at fluid interfaces, and armored droplets, where particles coat the surface of liquid droplets, exhibit unique mechanical and dynamic properties due to the interplay between particle interactions and fluid mechanics. Our research highlights how the balance of forces such as buoyancy and capillarity, along with the elastic response of the particle-laden interface, dictates the stability and morphology of these structures. Through a combination of experimental observations and theoretical modeling, we provide insights into the self-assembly processes that lead to the formation of particle rafts and armored droplets, and how these can be manipulated for applications in materials science, microfluidics, and beyond. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles underlying particle-laden interfaces and opens new avenues for the design of functional materials with tailored properties.", "label": 1}
