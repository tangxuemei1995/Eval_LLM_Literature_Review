{"grounding": "Understanding inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid flows requires mathematical and computational tools that are tailored to such flows and distinct from methods used to understand the canonical problem of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. We review some recent developments in the theory of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, placing special emphasis on several kinds of quasi-linear approximations and their corresponding statistical formulations. Aspects of quasi-linear theory that have received insufficient attention in the literature are discussed, and open questions are framed.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews recent advancements in the theoretical understanding of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, a complex phenomenon prevalent in various natural and engineered systems. By integrating quasi-linear approaches and advanced statistical methods, researchers have made significant strides in modeling the intricate dynamics of turbulent flows. These developments offer deeper insights into the energy transfer mechanisms and structural characteristics of turbulence, paving the way for more accurate predictions and control strategies in applications ranging from atmospheric science to aerospace engineering.", "label": 0}
