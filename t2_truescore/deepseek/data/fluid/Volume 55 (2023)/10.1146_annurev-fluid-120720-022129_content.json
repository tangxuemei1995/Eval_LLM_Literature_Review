{"grounding": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) are versatile and efficient computational techniques to solve flow problems in complex geometric configurations that retain the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian structured meshes. Although these methods became known in the 1970s and gained credibility only in the new millennium, they had already been conceived and implemented at the beginning of the 1960s, even if the early computers of those times did not allow researchers to exploit their potential. Nowadays IBMs are established numerical schemes employed for the solution of many complex problems in which fluid mechanics may account for only part of the multiphysics dynamics. Despite the indisputable advantages, these methods also have drawbacks, and each problem should be carefully analyzed before deciding which particular IBM implementation is most suitable and whether additional modeling is necessary. Highâ€“Reynolds number flows constitute one of the main limitations of IBMs owing to the resolution of thin wall shear layers, which cannot benefit from anisotropic grid refinement at the boundaries. To alleviate this weakness, researchers have developed IBM-compliant wall models and local grid refinement strategies, although in these cases possible pitfalls must also be considered.", "generated_text": "Immersed Boundary Methods (IBMs) have emerged as a pivotal computational framework for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems, offering a versatile approach to modeling fluid-structure interactions without the need for body-conforming grids. This paper provides a comprehensive historical perspective on the evolution of IBMs, tracing their origins from the pioneering work of Peskin in the 1970s to the sophisticated, high-fidelity simulations enabled by modern computational resources. We explore the fundamental principles underlying IBMs, including the treatment of immersed boundaries, the incorporation of wall models, and the challenges associated with accurately capturing the physics of complex flows. Furthermore, we discuss recent advancements in IBM techniques, such as adaptive mesh refinement, parallel computing, and the integration with machine learning algorithms, which have significantly enhanced their efficiency and applicability. The paper concludes with a forward-looking discussion on the potential of IBMs to address emerging challenges in computational fluid dynamics, including the simulation of multiphase flows, turbulent flows, and bio-inspired systems. By highlighting both the historical milestones and future directions, this work aims to inspire further innovation and application of IBMs in tackling complex, real-world problems.", "label": 1}
