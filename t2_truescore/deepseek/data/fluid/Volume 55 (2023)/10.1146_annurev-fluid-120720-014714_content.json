{"grounding": "A common feature of many free surface flows—drop/bubble breakup or coalescence and film/sheet rupture—is the occurrence of hydrodynamic singularities. Accurately computing such flows with continuum mechanical, multidimensional free surface flow algorithms is a challenging task given these problems’ multiscale nature, which necessitates capturing dynamics occurring over disparate length scales across 5–6 orders of magnitude. In drop breakup, the thinning of fluid threads that form and eventually pinch-off must be simulated until the thread's radius is about 10 nm. When two drops approach one another, the thickness of the fluid film separating them must fall below 10 nm before coalescence is said to have occurred. If the initial drop radii are 1 mm, simulations must remain faithful to the physics as thread radius or film thickness falls from 10−3 m to below 10−8 m. Here we review significant findings in interfacial flows with hydrodynamic singularities spearheaded by sharp interface algorithms. These multidimensional algorithms can achieve resolution that to date has only been possible with the use of simple 1D evolution equations.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of free surface flows, particularly focusing on phenomena involving singularities such as breakup and coalescence, which are pivotal in applications ranging from ink jet printing to microfluidics and sprays. Utilizing sharp interface methods, we present a comprehensive framework for the simulation and analysis of drops, jets, and filaments undergoing these complex processes. Our approach leverages finite element techniques to accurately capture the evolution of interfaces, including the critical moments of pinch-off and merging. Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in handling the mathematical and computational challenges posed by singularities in free surface flows. The insights gained from this research not only advance our understanding of the fundamental physics underlying these phenomena but also offer practical implications for the design and optimization of devices and processes in various industrial and technological domains.", "label": 0}
