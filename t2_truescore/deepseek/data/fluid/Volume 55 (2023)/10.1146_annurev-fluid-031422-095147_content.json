{"grounding": "Oceanic motions with spatial scales of 200 mâ€“20 km, called submesoscales, are ubiquitous in the upper ocean and serve as a key intermediary between larger-scale balanced dynamics and unbalanced turbulence. Here, we introduce the fluid dynamics of submesoscales and contrast them with motions at larger and smaller scales. We summarize the various ways in which submesoscales develop due to instabilities that extract potential or kinetic energy from larger-scale balanced currents; some instabilities have counterparts at larger scales, while others are distinct to the submesoscale regime. Submesoscales modify the density stratification in the upper ocean and redistribute energy between scales. These energy transfers are complex, having both up-scale and down-scale components. Submesoscale eddies and fronts also contribute to a spatially heterogeneous distribution of shear and restratification that leave an imprint on upper ocean turbulence. The impact of submesoscales on the Earth's climate remains an exciting research frontier.", "generated_text": "The study of submesoscale dynamics in the upper ocean is crucial for understanding the complex interplay between turbulence, eddies, and fronts, and their collective impact on climate systems. This research delves into the intricate processes that govern submesoscale phenomena, which operate on spatial scales of a few kilometers and temporal scales of hours to days. By analyzing high-resolution satellite data and in-situ measurements, we explore the generation and evolution of submesoscale eddies and fronts, their role in vertical and horizontal mixing, and their contribution to the global energy budget. The findings highlight the significance of submesoscale dynamics in modulating the upper ocean's response to atmospheric forcing, influencing marine ecosystems, and shaping the ocean's role in climate variability and change. This study underscores the need for advanced observational and modeling approaches to better capture the nuanced behaviors of submesoscale processes and their implications for climate prediction.", "label": 1}
