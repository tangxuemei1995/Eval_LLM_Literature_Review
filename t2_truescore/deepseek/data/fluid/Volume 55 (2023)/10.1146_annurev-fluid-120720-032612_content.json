{"grounding": "A rotating detonation engine (RDE) is a realization of pressure-gain combustion, wherein a traveling detonation wave confined in a chamber provides shock-based compression along with chemical heat release. Due to the high wave speeds, such devices can process high mass flow rates in small volumes, leading to compact and unconventional designs. RDEs involve unsteady and multiscale physics, and their operational characteristics are determined by an equilibrium between large- and small-scale processes. While RDEs can provide a significant theoretical gain in efficiency, achieving this improvement requires an understanding of the multiscale coupling. Specifically, unavoidable nonidealities, such as unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and multiple competing waves associated with practical designs, need to be understood and managed. The secondary combustion processes arise from fuel/air injection and unsteady and incomplete mixing, and can create spurious losses. In addition, a combination of multiple detonation and secondary waves compete and define the dynamical behavior of mixing, heat release distribution, and the overall mode of operation of the device. This review discusses the current understanding of such nonidealities and describes the tools and techniques used to gain insight into the extreme unsteady environment in such combustors.", "generated_text": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) represent a promising advancement in pressure gain combustion technology, offering potential improvements in thermodynamic efficiency over conventional deflagration-based systems. However, the practical implementation of RDEs is hindered by several nonidealities that affect their performance and stability. This study investigates the complex dynamics within RDEs, focusing on the formation and interaction of detonation waves, unsteady mixing processes, and the occurrence of secondary combustion. Particular attention is given to the detrimental effects of deflagration losses, which can significantly reduce the pressure gain achieved by the engine. Additionally, the presence of multiple competing waves and secondary waves is analyzed, revealing their impact on the uniformity and sustainability of the detonation process. Through a combination of experimental observations and computational modeling, this research aims to identify strategies for mitigating these nonidealities, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency and reliability of RDEs. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of detonation-based propulsion systems and provide valuable insights for the development of next-generation combustion technologies.", "label": 1}
