{"grounding": "Although face masks have been used for over a century to provide protection against airborne pathogens and pollutants, close scrutiny of their effectiveness has peaked in the past two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The simplicity of face masks belies the complexity of the physical phenomena that determine their effectiveness as a defense against airborne infections. This complexity is rooted in the fact that the effectiveness of face masks depends on the combined effects of respiratory aerodynamics, filtration flow physics, droplet dynamics and their interactions with porous materials, structural dynamics, physiology, and even human behavior. At its core, however, the face mask is a flow-handling device, and in the current review, we take a flow physicsâ€“centric view of face masks and the key phenomena that underlie their function. We summarize the state of the art in experimental measurements, as well as the growing body of computational studies that have contributed to our understanding of the factors that determine the effectiveness of face masks. The review also lays out some of the important open questions and technical challenges associated with the effectiveness of face masks.", "generated_text": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of face masks in mitigating the spread of respiratory infections, particularly those caused by airborne pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. This study delves into the flow physics of face masks, examining their efficacy in filtering airborne particles and reducing the transmission of coronavirus. By analyzing the interaction between respiratory droplets and mask materials, we explore the mechanisms of particle capture, including inertial impaction, diffusion, and electrostatic attraction. Our findings highlight the importance of mask fit and material properties in enhancing filtration efficiency and minimizing leakage. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of mask usage on airflow dynamics, shedding light on how masks alter the trajectory and dispersion of exhaled aerosols. Through a combination of experimental measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulations, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the protective capabilities of face masks against airborne transmission. The insights gained from this study are instrumental in guiding public health recommendations and the design of more effective respiratory protection devices in the fight against COVID-19 and future respiratory pandemics.", "label": 0}
