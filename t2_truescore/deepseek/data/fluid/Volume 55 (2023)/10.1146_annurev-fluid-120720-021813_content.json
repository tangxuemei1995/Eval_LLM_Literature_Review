{"grounding": "Transitional–turbulent spots bridge the deterministic laminar state with the stochastic turbulent state and affect the transition zone length in engineering flows. Turbulent spot research over the past four decades has expanded from incompressible flat-plate boundary layer and pipe flow to hypersonic boundary layer flow, turbomachinery flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, and a range of more complex flows. Progress has been made on the origination, composition, demarcation, growth, mutual interaction, reproduction, sustainability, and self-organization of turbulent spots. The hypothesis that transitional–turbulent spots are a basic module of the fully turbulent boundary layer has been proven through the discovery of locally generated turbulent–turbulent spots dominating the wall layer. Splitting of transitional–turbulent spots in pipe flow has been linked to a life cycle localized in the spot frontal section. This review discusses these advances and outlines future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of turbulent spots, pivotal in the transition from laminar to turbulent flow across various fluid systems. By examining boundary layer, pipe flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, turbomachinery flow, and hypersonic flow, we uncover novel insights into the formation, growth, and interaction of these spots. Our analysis leverages advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques and experimental data to elucidate the mechanisms driving the transition process. The findings highlight the critical role of initial disturbances and flow conditions in the evolution of turbulent spots, offering a deeper understanding of turbulence onset. This research not only advances the fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics but also has significant implications for enhancing the design and efficiency of engineering systems subjected to turbulent flows.", "label": 0}
