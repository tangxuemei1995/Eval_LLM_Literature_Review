{"grounding": "This article addresses the underrepresentation of Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences by challenging the exclusive use of Western scientific paradigms in research and education. Because of the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples, Indigenous perspectives have rarely been represented through empirical study, leading us to believe this is a key reason for the underrepresentation of Native people in these fields. We conducted a literature review, searching for Indigenous contributions in animal sciences and finding a handful of articles in three areas: humanâ€“animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Given the interconnected paradigm of Indigenous worldviews, we suggest that the ongoing siloes of scientific disciplines and the hierarchy of methodology contribute to the dearth of Indigenous perspectives. We suggest increased support for proper tribal consultation, contextualization of the history of research in Native communities, and the creation of scholarly spaces to support these conversations.", "generated_text": "This review explores the integration of Indigenous perspectives within the field of animal biosciences, focusing on the contributions of American Indian and Native American communities. It highlights the significance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in understanding animal behavior, health, and ecosystems, and its potential to enrich contemporary scientific practices. The concept of One Health, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, serves as a framework for this discussion. By examining case studies and scholarly literature, this paper demonstrates how Indigenous knowledge systems offer unique insights into animal sciences, from wildlife management to veterinary medicine. The review also addresses the challenges and opportunities in fostering collaborations between Indigenous communities and the scientific community, emphasizing the importance of ethical engagement and respect for cultural heritage. Ultimately, this paper advocates for a more inclusive approach in animal biosciences that values and incorporates Indigenous perspectives for holistic and sustainable solutions.", "label": 0}
