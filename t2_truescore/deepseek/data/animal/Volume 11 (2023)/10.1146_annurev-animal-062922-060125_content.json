{"grounding": "Zoonoses are diseases and infections naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals. Over the years, zoonoses have become increasingly significant threats to global health. They form the dominant group of diseases among the emerging infectious diseases (EID) and currently account for 73% of EID. Approximately 25% of zoonoses originate in domestic animals. The etiological agents of zoonoses include different pathogens, with viruses accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly, by contact, via aerosols, through a vector, or vertically in utero. Zoonotic diseases are found in every continent except Antarctica. Numerous factors associated with the pathogen, human activities, and the environment play significant roles in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Effective response and control of zoonotic diseases call for multiple-sector involvement and collaboration according to the One Health concept.", "generated_text": "Domestic animals play a pivotal role in the transmission and maintenance of zoonotic viral diseases, acting as reservoir hosts for both emerging and endemic pathogens. This study explores the intricate dynamics between domestic animals and zoonotic viruses, emphasizing the significance of these animals in the epidemiology of diseases that pose a threat to human health. By analyzing current literature, we identify key factors contributing to the emergence of viral zoonoses, including close human-animal interactions, environmental changes, and global trade. The concept of One Health is highlighted as a critical framework for understanding and mitigating the risks associated with zoonotic diseases, advocating for a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses human, animal, and environmental health. Our findings underscore the importance of surveillance, early detection, and collaborative efforts in preventing potential pandemics originating from domestic animal reservoirs.", "label": 1}
