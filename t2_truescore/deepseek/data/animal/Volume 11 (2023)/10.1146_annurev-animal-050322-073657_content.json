{"grounding": "Addressing important questions in animal ecology, physiology, and environmental science often requires in situ information from wild animals. This difficulty is being overcome by biologging and biotelemetry, or the use of miniaturized animal-borne sensors. Although early studies recorded only simple parameters of animal movement, advanced devices and analytical methods can now provide rich information on individual and group behavior, internal states, and the surrounding environment of free-ranging animals, especially those in marine systems. We summarize the history of technologies used to track marine animals. We then identify seven major research categories of marine biologging and biotelemetry and explain significant achievements, as well as future opportunities. Big data approaches via international collaborations will be key to tackling global environmental issues (e.g., climate change impacts), and curiosity about the secret lives of marine animals will also remain a major driver of biologging and biotelemetry studies.", "generated_text": "Biologging and biotelemetry have revolutionized our understanding of marine animal behavior, physiology, and ecology by providing unprecedented insights into their lives and environments. These technologies enable the collection of detailed data on movement ecology, revealing patterns of migration, foraging, and habitat use that were previously obscured. Field physiology studies benefit from real-time monitoring of physiological parameters, offering a window into the stress responses and energetic demands of marine species. Furthermore, biologging devices facilitate the investigation of predatorâ€“prey interactions and social dynamics, shedding light on the complex relationships that govern marine ecosystems. Importantly, these tools also allow for the assessment of the impacts of anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and climate change, on marine life. By bridging the gap between laboratory and field studies, biologging and biotelemetry are indispensable for advancing marine conservation and management strategies.", "label": 0}
