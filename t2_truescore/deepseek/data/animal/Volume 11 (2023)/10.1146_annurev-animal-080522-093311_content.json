{"grounding": "Deleterious mutations decrease reproductive fitness and are ubiquitous in genomes. Given that many organisms face ongoing threats of extinction, there is interest in elucidating the impact of deleterious variation on extinction risk and optimizing management strategies accounting for such mutations. Quantifying deleterious variation and understanding the effects of population history on deleterious variation are complex endeavors because we do not know the strength of selection acting on each mutation. Further, the effect of demographic history on deleterious mutations depends on the strength of selection against the mutation and the degree of dominance. Here we clarify how deleterious variation can be quantified and studied in natural populations. We then discuss how different demographic factors, such as small population size, nonequilibrium population size changes, inbreeding, and gene flow, affect deleterious variation. Lastly, we provide guidance on studying deleterious variation in nonmodel populations of conservation concern.", "generated_text": "Understanding the impact of deleterious variation in natural populations is crucial for conservation genetics, as it influences genetic load and inbreeding depression, which can threaten population viability. This study explores the prevalence and consequences of deleterious mutations in wild populations, employing simulations to model their effects under various demographic scenarios. We investigate how genetic load accumulates in small, isolated populations and the role of purging in mitigating inbreeding depression. Our findings highlight the importance of considering deleterious variation in conservation strategies, particularly for endangered species with limited genetic diversity. The results underscore the need for genetic management practices that reduce the risk of inbreeding and preserve adaptive potential. This research contributes to the broader field of conservation biology by providing insights into the genetic factors that influence population resilience and offering recommendations for the conservation of biodiversity in the face of genetic threats.", "label": 1}
