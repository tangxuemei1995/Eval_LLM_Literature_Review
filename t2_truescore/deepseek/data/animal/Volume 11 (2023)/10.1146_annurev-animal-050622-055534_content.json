{"grounding": "Advances in DNA sequencing and other technologies have greatly facilitated the identification of genetic risk factors for inherited diseases in dogs. We review recent technological developments based on selected examples from canine disease genetics. The identification of disease-causing variants in dogs with monogenic diseases may become a widely employed diagnostic approach in clinical veterinary medicine in the not-too-distant future. Diseases with complex modes of inheritance continue to pose challenges to researchers but have also become much more tangible than in the past. In addition to strategies for identifying genetic risk factors, we provide some thoughts on the interpretation of sequence variants that are largely inspired by developments in human clinical genetics.", "generated_text": "This study explores the genetic underpinnings of monogenic and complex diseases in Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dogs), leveraging the unique position of dogs as models for both veterinary and human medicine under the One Health approach. By integrating advanced genomic technologies and bioinformatics tools, we aim to identify specific genetic risk factors associated with a range of canine diseases. Our research not only contributes to the advancement of precision medicine in veterinary practice but also offers insights into human disease mechanisms, highlighting the translational potential of canine models. This work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in unraveling the genetic complexities of diseases, paving the way for targeted therapies and improved health outcomes across species.", "label": 0}
