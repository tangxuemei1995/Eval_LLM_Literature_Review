{"grounding": "For nearly a century, evolutionary biologists have observed chromosomes that cause lethality when made homozygous persisting at surprisingly high frequencies (>25%) in natural populations of many species. The evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of such detrimental mutations have been heavily debated—are some lethal mutations under balancing selection? We suggest that mutation–selection balance alone cannot explain lethal variation in nature and the possibility that other forces play a role. We review the potential that linked selection in particular may drive maintenance of lethal alleles through associative overdominance or linkage to beneficial mutations or by reducing effective population size. Over the past five decades, investigation into this mystery has tapered. During this time, key scientific advances have provided the ability to collect more accurate data and analyze them in new ways, making the underlying genetic bases and evolutionary forces of lethal alleles timely for study once more.", "generated_text": "The persistence of recessive lethal alleles in natural populations challenges our understanding of evolutionary dynamics. This study investigates the roles of mutation–selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in maintaining such variation. Mutation–selection balance posits that new lethal mutations are introduced at a rate equal to their removal by selection, yet this equilibrium may be disrupted by other evolutionary forces. Heterozygote advantage, where carriers of a lethal allele exhibit superior fitness, could also contribute to the allele's persistence. Additionally, linked selection, including associative overdominance and the influence of supergenes, may shield lethal alleles from purging by selection. Through a synthesis of theoretical models and empirical data, we explore how these mechanisms interact to sustain lethal variation. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of recessive lethal alleles is a complex interplay of mutation, selection, and genetic linkage, highlighting the nuanced nature of evolutionary processes in natural populations.", "label": 1}
