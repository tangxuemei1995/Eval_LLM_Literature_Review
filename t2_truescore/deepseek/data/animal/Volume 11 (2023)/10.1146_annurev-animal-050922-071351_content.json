{"grounding": "Homeostatic control and reproductive functions of humans are regulated at the molecular levels largely by peptide hormones secreted from endocrine and/or neuroendocrine cells in the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Homologs of those hormones and their receptors function similarly in many vertebrate species distantly related to humans, but the evolutionary history of the endocrine system involving those factors has been obscured by the scarcity of genome DNA sequence information of some taxa that potentially contain their orthologs. Focusing on non-osteichthyan vertebrates, namely jawless and cartilaginous fishes, this article illustrates how investigating genome sequence information assists our understanding of the diversification of vertebrate gene repertoires in four broad themes: (a) the presence or absence of genes, (b) multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, (c) differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and (d) the evolutionary timing of gene origins.", "generated_text": "The study of vertebrate hormones and their receptors has been significantly advanced by the exploration of non-osteichthyan genomes, including those of cartilaginous fishes and cyclostomes. This research provides critical insights into the evolutionary origins and functional diversification of key hormones such as leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin. By analyzing these ancient genomes, we uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the conservation and divergence of hormone-receptor interactions across vertebrate lineages. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of gene duplication and subsequent neofunctionalization in the evolution of hormonal systems, offering a deeper understanding of their physiological roles and evolutionary trajectories. This study not only sheds light on the ancestral state of vertebrate endocrine systems but also paves the way for future research into the molecular basis of hormone action and its implications for vertebrate biology and medicine.", "label": 0}
