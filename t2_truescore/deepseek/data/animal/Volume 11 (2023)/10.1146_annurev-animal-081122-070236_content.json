{"grounding": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid of the plant Cannabis sativa L. CBD is increasingly being explored as an alternative to conventional therapies to treat health disorders in dogs and cats. Mechanisms of action of CBD have been investigated mostly in rodents and in vitro and include modulation of CB1, CB2, 5-HT, GPR, and opioid receptors. In companion animals, CBD appears to have good bioavailability and safety profile with few side effects at physiological doses. Some dog studies have found CBD to improve clinical signs associated with osteoarthritis, pruritus, and epilepsy. However, further studies are needed to conclude a therapeutic action of CBD for each of these conditions, as well as for decreasing anxiety and aggression in dogs and cats. Herein, we summarize the available scientific evidence associated with the mechanisms of action of CBD, including pharmacokinetics, safety, regulation, and efficacy in ameliorating various health conditions in dogs and cats.", "generated_text": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound derived from the Cannabis plant, has garnered significant attention for its potential therapeutic applications in veterinary medicine, particularly for the management of diseases in dogs and cats. This review synthesizes current scientific evidence on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of CBD in treating a range of conditions, including anxiety, inflammation, and epilepsy, in companion animals. Emerging research suggests that CBD exhibits anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory properties, offering a promising alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, its anticonvulsant effects have been observed in models of epilepsy, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic agent. However, the regulatory landscape surrounding CBD use in veterinary medicine remains complex, necessitating further research to establish standardized dosing guidelines and to fully understand its long-term safety profile. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of scientific validation for CBD in the management of dog and cat diseases, emphasizing the need for continued investigation to optimize its therapeutic potential.", "label": 1}
