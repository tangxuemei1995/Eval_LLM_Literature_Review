{"grounding": "Talpid moles and spotted hyenas have become the paradigms of anatomical and behavioral female masculinization. Females of many mole species develop ovotestes that produce testosterone, show external genitalia that resemble that of males, and close their vaginal orifice after every estrus, and female spotted hyenas lack an external vaginal orifice and develop a pseudoscrotum and a large pseudopenis through which they urinate, mate, and give birth. We review current knowledge about several significant aspects of the biology and evolution of these females, including (a) their specific study methods; (b) their unique anatomical features, and how these peculiarities influence certain physiological functions; and (c) the role that steroid hormones as well as genetic and environmental factors may have in urogenital system development, aggressive behavior, and social dominance. Nevertheless, both mole and hyena females are exceptionally efficient mothers, so their peculiar genitalia should not call into question their femininity.", "generated_text": "This study delves into the fascinating biology and evolutionary significance of fierce females within two distinct mammalian species: the talpid mole and the spotted hyena. Both species exhibit remarkable instances of female masculinization, a phenomenon that challenges traditional gender roles in the animal kingdom. In talpid moles, females possess ovotestes, a unique reproductive organ that combines ovarian and testicular tissues, while spotted hyena females are known for their pseudopenis, an elongated clitoris that mimics male genitalia. These anatomical adaptations are accompanied by aggressive behaviors typically associated with males, suggesting a complex interplay between genetics, hormones, and social structures in shaping these traits. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research aims to shed light on the evolutionary pressures that have led to such extraordinary adaptations, offering insights into the mechanisms of sexual differentiation and the role of aggressive behavior in female survival and reproductive success.", "label": 1}
