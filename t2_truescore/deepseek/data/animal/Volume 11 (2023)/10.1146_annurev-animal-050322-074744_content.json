{"grounding": "Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are the longest-lived rodents with a maximum life span exceeding 37 years. They exhibit a delayed aging phenotype and resistance to age-related functional decline/diseases. Specifically, they do not display increased mortality with age, maintain several physiological functions until nearly the end of their lifetime, and rarely develop cancer and Alzheimer's disease. NMRs live in a hypoxic environment in underground colonies in East Africa and are highly tolerant of hypoxia. These unique characteristics of NMRs have attracted considerable interest from zoological and biomedical researchers. This review summarizes previous studies of the ecology, hypoxia tolerance, longevity/delayed aging, and cancer resistance of NMRs and discusses possible mechanisms contributing to their healthy aging. In addition, we discuss current issues and future perspectives to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying delayed aging and resistance to age-related diseases in NMRs.", "generated_text": "The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has emerged as a fascinating model organism for studying healthy aging due to its exceptional longevity, resistance to cancer, and unique social structure. This subterranean mammal exhibits a lifespan exceeding 30 years, significantly longer than other rodents of similar size, and shows negligible senescence, maintaining robust health and reproductive capability well into old age. Its resistance to cancer is attributed to an early contact inhibition mechanism, mediated by high-molecular-mass hyaluronan, which prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation. Furthermore, the naked mole-rat's sociality, characterized by a eusocial colony structure similar to that of bees and ants, provides insights into the social determinants of aging and longevity. Additionally, its remarkable tolerance to hypoxia offers a window into understanding the molecular adaptations that protect against oxidative stress, a key factor in aging. This review highlights the naked mole-rat's potential as a model for uncovering the biological mechanisms underlying healthy aging and longevity.", "label": 1}
