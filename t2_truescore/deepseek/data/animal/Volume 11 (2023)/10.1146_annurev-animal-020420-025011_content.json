{"grounding": "Over the past three decades, coronavirus (CoV) diseases have impacted humans more than any other emerging infectious disease. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), has resulted in huge economic disruptions and loss of human lives. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was found to mutate more rapidly due to sustained transmission in humans and potentially animals, resulting in variants of concern (VOCs) that threaten global human health. However, the primary difficulties are filling in the current knowledge gaps in terms of the origin and modalities of emergence for these viruses. Because many CoVs threatening human health are suspected to have a zoonotic origin, identifying the animal hosts implicated in the spillover or spillback events would be beneficial for current pandemic management and to prevent future outbreaks. In this review, wesummarize the animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission of the emerging human CoVs. Finally, we comment on potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOCs and the new SARS-CoV-2 recombinants currently under investigation.", "generated_text": "Emerging human-infecting coronaviruses (CoVs) pose significant public health threats, as evidenced by recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the mechanisms of zoonotic transmission, the role of animal reservoirs, and the potential for cross-species spread is crucial for predicting and preventing future pandemics. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the animal models used to study these viruses, the zoonotic reservoirs that harbor them, and the genetic factors facilitating cross-species transmission, including recombination events that may enhance viral adaptability. We highlight the importance of surveillance in wildlife and domestic animals to identify potential sources of zoonotic CoVs and discuss strategies for mitigating the risk of spillover events. By integrating insights from virology, ecology, and epidemiology, this work aims to inform public health interventions and guide future research efforts to better understand and control the emergence of novel coronaviruses.", "label": 1}
