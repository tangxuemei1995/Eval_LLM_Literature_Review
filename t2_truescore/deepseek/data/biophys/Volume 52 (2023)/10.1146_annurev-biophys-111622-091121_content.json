{"grounding": "An ideal biosensor material at room temperature, with an extremely large surface area per unit mass combined with the possibility of harnessing quantum mechanical attributes, would be comprised of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials. The sensing of a variety of sizes and types of biomolecules involves modulation of the electrical charge density of (current through) the 2D material and manifests through specific components of the capacitance (resistance). While sensitive detection at the single-molecule level, i.e., at zeptomolar concentrations, may be achieved, specificity in a complex mixture is more demanding. Attention should be paid to the influence of inevitably present defects in the 2D materials on the sensing, as well as calibration of obtained results with acceptable standards. The consequent establishment of a roadmap for the widespread deployment of 2D materialâ€“based biosensors in point-of-care platforms has the potential to revolutionize health care.", "generated_text": "The integration of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials into biomolecule sensing platforms has revolutionized the field due to their exceptional properties, such as high specific surface area (SSA) and tunable density of states (DOS). These materials, when incorporated into field-effect transistor (FET) configurations, offer unparalleled sensitivity and selectivity for detecting a wide range of biomolecules. The presence of defects in 2D materials, often considered a limitation, has been ingeniously exploited to enhance sensing capabilities. Furthermore, the development of sophisticated impedance models has provided deeper insights into the interaction mechanisms between biomolecules and 2D material surfaces. However, the lack of standardization in fabrication and characterization techniques poses significant challenges to the reproducibility and reliability of these sensors. This review highlights recent advancements, challenges, and future directions in leveraging graphene and 2D materials for biomolecule sensing, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols to harness their full potential.", "label": 0}
