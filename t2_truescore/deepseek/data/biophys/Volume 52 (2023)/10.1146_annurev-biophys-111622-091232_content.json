{"grounding": "ABC transporters are essential for cellular physiology. Humans have 48 ABC genes organized into seven distinct families. Of these genes, 44 (in five distinct families) encode for membrane transporters, of which several are involved in drug resistance and disease pathways resulting from transporter dysfunction. Over the last decade, advances in structural biology have vastly expanded our mechanistic understanding of human ABC transporter function, revealing details of their molecular arrangement, regulation, and interactions, facilitated in large part by advances in cryo-EM that have rendered hitherto inaccessible targets amenable to high-resolution structural analysis. As a result, experimentally determined structures of multiple members of each of the five families of ABC transporters in humans are now available. Here we review this recent progress, highlighting the physiological relevance of human ABC transporters and mechanistic insights gleaned from their direct structure determination. We also discuss the impact and limitations of model systems and structure prediction methods in understanding human ABC transporters and discuss current challenges and future research directions.", "generated_text": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the translocation of a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes, utilizing the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. These transporters are involved in numerous physiological processes, including lipid homeostasis, drug extrusion, and are implicated in various human diseases. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have significantly enhanced our understanding of the structure and mechanism of human ABC transporters at near-atomic resolution. This review focuses on the structural insights gained from cryo-EM studies, highlighting the conformational changes associated with substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these structural findings for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting ABC transporters in the context of drug resistance and lipid-related disorders. The integration of structural biology with functional studies provides a comprehensive framework for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the diverse functions of ABC transporters in human health and disease.", "label": 1}
