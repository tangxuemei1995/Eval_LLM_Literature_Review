{"grounding": "Faithful translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein is essential to maintain protein homeostasis in the cell. Spontaneous translation errors are very rare due to stringent selection of cognate aminoacyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the tight control of the mRNA reading frame by the ribosome. Recoding events, such as stop codon readthrough, frameshifting, and translational bypassing, reprogram the ribosome to make intentional mistakes and produce alternative proteins from the same mRNA. The hallmark of recoding is the change of ribosome dynamics. The signals for recoding are built into the mRNA, but their reading depends on the genetic makeup of the cell, resulting in cell-specific changes in expression programs. In this review, I discuss the mechanisms of canonical decoding and tRNAâ€“mRNA translocation; describe alternative pathways leading to recoding; and identify the links among mRNA signals, ribosome dynamics, and recoding.", "generated_text": "The ribosome, a complex molecular machine, plays a pivotal role in the translation of mRNA sequences into proteins, a process fundamental to all living organisms. This study delves into the intricate mechanisms of mRNA decoding and recoding by the ribosome, focusing on the roles of tRNA, elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G, and the phenomena of frameshifting and stop codon readthrough. Through a detailed kinetic analysis, we explore how the ribosome ensures the fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis, while also accommodating the flexibility required for recoding events. Our findings shed light on the dynamic interplay between the ribosome and its co-factors, offering insights into the molecular basis of translation accuracy and the regulatory mechanisms that allow for genetic code expansion. This research contributes to our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting translation.", "label": 1}
