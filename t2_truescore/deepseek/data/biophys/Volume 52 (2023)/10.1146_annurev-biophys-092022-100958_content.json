{"grounding": "The recent proliferation of cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques has led to the cryo-ET resolution revolution. Meanwhile, significant efforts have been made to improve the identification of targets in the cellular context and the throughput of cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Together, these developments led to a surge of in situ discoveries on how enveloped viruses are assembled and how viruses interact with cells in infected hosts. In this article, we review the recent advances in cryo-ET, high-resolution insights into virus assembly, and the findings from inside infected eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.", "generated_text": "Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a pivotal technique in structural biology, enabling the visualization of macromolecular complexes in their native cellular context at near-atomic resolution. This 'resolution revolution' has been significantly propelled by advancements in cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling, facilitating the preparation of thin, vitrified specimens suitable for high-resolution imaging. In virology, cryo-ET has unveiled unprecedented insights into the architecture and life cycle of viruses within host cells, offering a surge of in situ discoveries that are reshaping our understanding of viral infection mechanisms and the host-pathogen interface.", "label": 1}
