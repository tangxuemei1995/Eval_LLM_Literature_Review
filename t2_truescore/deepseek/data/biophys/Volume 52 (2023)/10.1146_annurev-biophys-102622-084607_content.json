{"grounding": "Advances in a scientific discipline are often measured by small, incremental steps. In this review, we report on two intertwined disciplines in the protein structure prediction field, modeling of single chains and modeling of complexes, that have over decades emulated this pattern, as monitored by the community-wide blind prediction experiments CASP and CAPRI. However, over the past few years, dramatic advances were observed for the accurate prediction of single protein chains, driven by a surge of deep learning methodologies entering the prediction field. We review the mainscientific developments that enabled these recent breakthroughs and feature the important role of blind prediction experiments in building up and nurturing the structure prediction field. We discuss how the new wave of artificial intelligenceâ€“based methods is impacting the fields of computational and experimental structural biology and highlight areas in which deep learning methods are likely to lead to future developments, provided that major challenges are overcome.", "generated_text": "The accurate prediction of protein three-dimensional (3D) structures and protein complexes is a cornerstone in understanding biological functions and designing novel therapeutics. This study critically assesses the methodologies employed in predicting protein structures and interactions, with a focus on the advancements and challenges highlighted by the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and the Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) competitions. We explore the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including deep learning and machine learning algorithms, which have significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of predictions. Despite these advancements, the field faces ongoing challenges in predicting the structures of complex proteins and their interactions with high accuracy. This review synthesizes the current state of the art, identifies key areas for improvement, and discusses the potential of emerging technologies to overcome existing limitations. Our findings underscore the importance of continued innovation and collaboration in advancing the field of protein structure prediction.", "label": 1}
