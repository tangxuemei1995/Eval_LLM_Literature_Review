{"grounding": "Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have marked only the beginning of the potential of this technique. To bring structure into cell biology, the modality of cryo-electron tomography has fast developed into a bona fide in situ structural biology technique where structures are determined in their native environment, the cell. Nearly every step of the cryo-focused ion beam-assisted electron tomography (cryo-FIB-ET) workflow has been improved upon in the past decade, since the first windows were carved into cells, unveiling macromolecular networks in near-native conditions. By bridging structural and cell biology, cryo-FIB-ET is advancing our understanding of structureâ€“function relationships in their native environment and becoming a tool for discovering new biology.", "generated_text": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a pivotal technique in structural biology, enabling the visualization of molecular architectures within their native cellular environments. This review highlights the transformative impact of cryo-ET on in situ structural biology, offering unprecedented insights into the spatial organization and interactions of biomolecules. By integrating quantitative cell biology and biophysical modeling, cryo-ET facilitates a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes at the molecular level. The convergence of these approaches not only advances our knowledge of cellular function but also paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies by elucidating the structural basis of disease mechanisms. Cryo-ET stands as a cornerstone in the quest to bring structure to cell biology, bridging the gap between molecular detail and cellular context.", "label": 1}
