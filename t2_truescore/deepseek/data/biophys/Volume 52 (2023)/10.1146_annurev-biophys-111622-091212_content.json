{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy allows the investigation of cellular structures at nanoscale resolution using light. Current developments in super-resolution microscopy have focused on reliable quantification of the underlying biological data. In this review, we first describe the basic principles of super-resolution microscopy techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), and then give a broad overview of methodological developments to quantify super-resolution data, particularly those geared toward SMLM data. We cover commonly used techniques such as spatial point pattern analysis, colocalization, and protein copy number quantification but also describe more advanced techniques such as structural modeling, single-particle tracking, and biosensing. Finally, we provide an outlook on exciting new research directions to which quantitative super-resolution microscopy might be applied.", "generated_text": "Quantitative Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (qSMLM) represents a transformative approach in super-resolution nanoscopy, enabling the precise localization and quantification of individual molecules within biological specimens. This technique leverages the stochastic blinking of fluorophores to achieve nanometer-scale resolution, surpassing the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy. By integrating advanced algorithms for quantitative analysis, qSMLM facilitates the detailed examination of molecular distributions, interactions, and dynamics in live and fixed cells. This review highlights the principles underlying qSMLM, its application in quantitative cell biology, and the challenges associated with achieving accurate and reproducible measurements. The potential of qSMLM to unravel complex biological processes at the molecular level underscores its significance in advancing our understanding of cellular mechanisms and disease pathology.", "label": 1}
