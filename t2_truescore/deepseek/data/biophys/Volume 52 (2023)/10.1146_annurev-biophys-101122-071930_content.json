{"grounding": "Many proteins contain large structurally disordered regions or are entirely disordered under physiological conditions. The functions of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often involve interactions with other biomolecules. An important emerging effort has thus been to identify the molecular mechanisms of IDP interactions and how they differ from the textbook notions of biomolecular binding for folded proteins. In this review, we summarize how the versatile tool kit of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy can aid the investigation of these conformationally heterogeneous and highly dynamic molecular systems. We discuss the experimental observables that can be employed and how they enable IDP complexes to be probed on timescales from nanoseconds to hours. Key insights include the diverse structural and dynamic properties of bound IDPs and the kinetic mechanisms facilitated by disorder, such as fly-casting; disorder-mediated encounter complexes; and competitive substitution via ternary complexes, which enables rapid dissociation even for high-affinity complexes. We also discuss emerging links to aggregation, liquid–liquid phase separation, and cellular processes, as well as current technical advances to further expand the scope of single-molecule spectroscopy.", "generated_text": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play crucial roles in cellular processes, yet their dynamic interactions and binding mechanisms remain poorly understood due to their lack of stable structure. This study employs single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) spectroscopy combined with molecular simulations to elucidate the interaction dynamics of IDPs. By focusing on disordered complexes, we reveal the kinetic pathways and conformational landscapes that govern protein binding. Our findings demonstrate that IDPs exhibit a wide range of binding modes, from transient encounters to stable complexes, influenced by their inherent flexibility. The integration of smFRET data with molecular dynamics simulations provides unprecedented insights into the temporal and spatial resolution of these interactions, highlighting the role of disorder in facilitating diverse binding scenarios. This research advances our understanding of IDP function and interaction, offering a comprehensive framework for studying the dynamics of disordered proteins in biological systems.", "label": 1}
