{"grounding": "Mitochondria are involved in multiple cellular tasks, such as ATP synthesis, metabolism, metabolite and ion transport, regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, signaling, and inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. The majority of the correct functioning of mitochondria is based on the large electrochemical proton gradient, whose component, the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, is strictly controlled by ion transport through mitochondrial membranes. Consequently, mitochondrial function is critically dependent on ion homeostasis, the disturbance of which leads to abnormal cell functions. Therefore, the discovery of mitochondrial ion channels influencing ion permeability through the membrane has defined a new dimension of the function of ion channels in different cell types, mainly linked to the important tasks that mitochondrial ion channels perform in cell life and death. This review summarizes studies on animal mitochondrial ion channels with special focus on their biophysical properties, molecular identity, and regulation. Additionally, the potential of mitochondrial ion channels as therapeutic targets for several diseases is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial ion channels play a pivotal role in cellular physiology, regulating ion homeostasis, energy production, and apoptosis. This review focuses on the diverse array of ion channels within the mitochondrial membranes, including calcium channels, potassium channels, chloride channels, the mitochondrial megachannel, and porin (VDAC). Calcium channels are crucial for modulating mitochondrial calcium levels, influencing cellular signaling and energy metabolism. Potassium channels, such as the ATP-sensitive and calcium-activated potassium channels, contribute to the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential and volume. Chloride channels are involved in maintaining ionic balance and osmotic regulation. The mitochondrial megachannel, also known as the permeability transition pore, is central to the regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability and cell death pathways. Porin, or the voltage-dependent anion channel, facilitates the exchange of metabolites and ions across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and physiological roles of these channels is essential for elucidating their contributions to health and disease.", "label": 1}
