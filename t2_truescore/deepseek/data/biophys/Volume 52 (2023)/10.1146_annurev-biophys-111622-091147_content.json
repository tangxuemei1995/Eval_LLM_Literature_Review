{"grounding": "Large biomolecular systems are at the heart of many essential cellular processes. The dynamics and energetics of an increasing number of these systems are being studied by computer simulations. Pushing the limits of length- and timescales that can be accessed by current hard- and software has expanded the ability to describe biomolecules at different levels of detail. We focus in this review on the ribosome, which exemplifies the close interplay between experiment and various simulation approaches, as a particularly challenging and prototypic nanomachine that is pivotal to cellular biology due to its central role in translation. We sketch widely used simulation methods and demonstrate how the combination of simulations and experiments advances our understanding of the function of the translation apparatus based on fundamental physics.", "generated_text": "The simulation of complex biomolecular systems, particularly the ribosome, presents a significant challenge in computational biology. This study leverages advanced computer simulations and molecular dynamics (MD) to explore the intricate mechanisms of ribosome function, including translation and the interaction with antibiotics. By integrating data from cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we aim to enhance the accuracy of our simulations, providing a detailed understanding of the ribosome's structural dynamics at an atomic level. Our approach not only sheds light on the fundamental processes of protein synthesis but also offers insights into the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This research underscores the importance of combining computational and experimental techniques to unravel the complexities of biomolecular systems.", "label": 1}
