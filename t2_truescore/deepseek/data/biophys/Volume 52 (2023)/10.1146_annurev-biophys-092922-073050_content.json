{"grounding": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are critical intracellular immune receptors in both animals and plants. Perception of pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals induces NLR oligomerization to form multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes in animals or resistosomes in plants to mediate host immune response. Significant progress has been made during the past few years in our understanding of NLR biology, particularly the structural perspective of these two types of NLR-containing complexes. In this article, we review the latest advances in our structural knowledge of how NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are activated and assembled and how the structural information provides insight into their distinct mechanisms of action. Commonalities and differences between NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are also discussed.", "generated_text": "The assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes represent pivotal mechanisms in the innate immune response, orchestrating the defense against pathogens and cellular stress. NLR proteins, characterized by their nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat motifs, undergo autoinhibition in their resting state. Upon ligand recognition, these proteins assemble into high-molecular-weight complexes, forming either inflammasomes, which activate inflammatory caspases, or resistosomes, which can function as NADase holoenzymes or form channels in the plasma membrane. This review delves into the structural and functional aspects of these complexes, highlighting the molecular mechanisms underlying their assembly, the specificity of ligand recognition, and their roles in immune signaling. Understanding the architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes provides insights into their activation and regulation, offering potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases and infections.", "label": 1}
