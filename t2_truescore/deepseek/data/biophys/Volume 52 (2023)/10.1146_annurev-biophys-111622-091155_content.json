{"grounding": "Proteins guide the flows of information, energy, and matter that make life possible by accelerating transport and chemical reactions, by allosterically modulating these reactions, and by forming dynamic supramolecular assemblies. In these roles, conformational change underlies functional transitions. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction methods characterize these transitions either by directly triggering sequences of functionally important motions or, more broadly, by capturing the motions of which proteins are capable. To date, most successful have been experiments in which conformational change is triggered in light-dependent proteins. In this review, I emphasize emerging techniques that probe the dynamic basis of function in proteins lacking natively light-dependent transitions and speculate about extensions and further possibilities. In addition, I review how the weaker and more distributed signals in these data push the limits of the capabilities of analytical methods. Taken together, these new methods are beginning to establish a powerful paradigm for the study of the physics of protein function.", "generated_text": "The study of protein dynamics is pivotal for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions. Recent advancements in time-resolved X-ray diffraction techniques, particularly serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) and time-resolved X-ray crystallography (TRX), have opened new avenues for capturing the transient states and structural changes of proteins at atomic resolution. These methods leverage the ultrashort pulses of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) to probe the excited states of proteins, providing insights into their mechanical responses to external stimuli such as electric fields. This review highlights the emerging applications of these techniques in elucidating the dynamic behavior of proteins, from conformational changes to the propagation of mechanical signals. By integrating these approaches with computational modeling, researchers can now explore the intricate interplay between protein structure and function in unprecedented detail, offering a deeper understanding of biological processes and aiding in the design of novel therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
