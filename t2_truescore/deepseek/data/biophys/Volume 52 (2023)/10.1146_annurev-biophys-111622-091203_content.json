{"grounding": "Synthetic biology seeks to probe fundamental aspects of biological form and function by construction [i.e., (re)synthesis] rather than deconstruction (analysis). In this sense, biological sciences now follow the lead given by the chemical sciences. Synthesis can complement analytic studies but also allows novel approaches to answering fundamental biological questions and opens up vast opportunities for the exploitation of biological processes to provide solutions for global problems. In this review, we explore aspects of this synthesis paradigm as applied to the chemistry and function of nucleic acids in biological systems and beyond, specifically, in genome resynthesis, synthetic genetics (i.e., the expansion of the genetic alphabet, of the genetic code, and of the chemical make-up of genetic systems), and the elaboration of orthogonal biosystems and components.", "generated_text": "The field of synthetic biology has significantly advanced the understanding and manipulation of biological systems, leading to the conceptualization of the Expanded Central Dogma. This paradigm extends beyond the traditional flow of genetic information to include genome resynthesis, the development of orthogonal biosystems, and the exploration of synthetic genetics. Central to this expansion is the synthesis of entire genomes, which allows for the creation of organisms with customized genetic codes. Orthogonal biosystems, which operate independently of natural cellular processes, enable the incorporation of unnatural base pairs and xenonucleic acids (XNA), broadening the chemical diversity of genetic information. Synthetic genetics further explores the potential of these novel genetic systems to encode and propagate information, offering insights into the fundamental principles of life and the potential for groundbreaking applications in biotechnology and medicine.", "label": 1}
