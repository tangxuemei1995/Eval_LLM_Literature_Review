{"grounding": "Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has matured into a robust method for the determination of biological macromolecule structures in the past decade, complementing X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Constant methodological improvements in both cryo-EM hardware and image processing software continue to contribute to an exponential growth in the number of structures solved annually. In this review, we provide a historical view of the many steps that were required to make cryo-EM a successful method for the determination of high-resolution protein complex structures. We further discuss aspects of cryo-EM methodology that are the greatest pitfalls challenging successful structure determination to date. Lastly, we highlight and propose potential future developments that would improve the method even further in the near future.", "generated_text": "High-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a transformative tool in structural biology, enabling the determination of 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes at near-atomic resolution. This technique has significantly advanced our understanding of biological processes by providing detailed insights into the molecular architecture of complex assemblies. However, the prospects of cryo-EM are tempered by several limitations, including challenges associated with sample preparation, the presence of optical aberrations, and the need for substantial computational resources. Despite these hurdles, ongoing technological advancements in detector sensitivity, image processing algorithms, and aberration correction methods continue to push the boundaries of resolution and applicability. This review highlights the current state of cryo-EM, its potential for future discoveries, and the critical challenges that must be addressed to fully realize its capabilities in structural biology.", "label": 1}
