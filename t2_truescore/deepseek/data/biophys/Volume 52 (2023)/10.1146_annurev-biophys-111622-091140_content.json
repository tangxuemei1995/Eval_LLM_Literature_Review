{"grounding": "Hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods have become indispensable tools for the study of biomolecules. In this article, we briefly review the basic methodological details of QM/MM approaches and discuss their applications to various energy transduction problems in biomolecular machines, such as long-range proton transports, fast electron transfers, and mechanochemical coupling. We highlight the particular importance for these applications of balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Using several recent examples, we illustrate the value and limitations of QM/MM methodologies for both ground and excited states, as well as strategies for calibrating them in specific applications. We conclude with brief comments on several areas that can benefit from further efforts to make QM/MM analyses more quantitative and applicable to increasingly complex biological problems.", "generated_text": "Hybrid Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) methods have emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the intricate mechanisms of energy transduction in biomolecular machines. These methods allow for the detailed study of processes such as proton and electron transfers, as well as nucleotide hydrolysis, by combining the accuracy of quantum mechanics for the active site with the efficiency of molecular mechanics for the surrounding environment. This review highlights recent advancements in QM/MM methodologies and their application to understanding the dynamic behavior and energy conversion mechanisms of biomolecular machines. By bridging the gap between quantum and classical descriptions, QM/MM approaches provide invaluable insights into the molecular basis of energy transduction, paving the way for the design of novel biomimetic systems and therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
