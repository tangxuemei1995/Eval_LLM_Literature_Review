{"grounding": "The human lung cellular portfolio, traditionally characterized by cellular morphology and individual markers, is highly diverse, with over 40 cell types and a complex branching structure highly adapted for agile airflow and gas exchange. While constant during adulthood, lung cellular content changes in response to exposure, injury, and infection. Some changes are temporary, but others are persistent, leading to structural changes and progressive lung disease. The recent advance of single-cell profiling technologies allows an unprecedented level of detail and scale to cellular measurements, leading to the rise of comprehensive cell atlas styles of reporting. In this review, we chronical the rise of cell atlases and explore their contributions to human lung biology in health and disease.", "generated_text": "The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of lung biology, enabling the construction of comprehensive lung cell atlases that delineate cellular heterogeneity in health and disease. This study leverages scRNA-seq to explore the molecular and cellular landscapes of pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), providing unprecedented insights into the pathogenesis of these conditions. By comparing diseased states to healthy lung profiles, we identify distinct cellular populations and molecular pathways implicated in disease progression. Our findings highlight the potential of lung cell atlases to uncover novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers, offering a roadmap for precision medicine in pulmonary diseases. This research underscores the importance of scRNA-seq in advancing our understanding of lung pathology and in the development of targeted interventions.", "label": 0}
