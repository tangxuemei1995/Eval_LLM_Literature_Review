{"grounding": "The endothelium is one of the largest organ systems in the body, and data continue to emerge regarding the importance of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction in vascular aging and a range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Over the last two decades and as a process intimately related to EC dysfunction, an increasing number of studies have also implicated endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) as a potentially disease-causal pathobiologic process that is involved in a multitude of differing CVDs. However, EndMT is also involved in physiologic processes (e.g., cardiac development), and transient EndMT may contribute to vascular regeneration in certain contexts. Given that EndMT involves a major alteration in the EC-specific molecular program, and that it potentially contributes to CVD pathobiology, the clinical translation opportunities are significant, but further molecular and translational research is needed to see these opportunities realized.\n", "generated_text": "Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) is a complex biological process where endothelial cells lose their specific markers and acquire a mesenchymal or stem cell-like phenotype. This transition plays a pivotal role in both physiological processes, such as embryonic development and wound healing, and pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, and cancer. In the context of cardiovascular health, EndMT contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and cardiac fibrosis by promoting vascular remodeling and tissue fibrosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT, including the roles of TGF-Î², Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways, offers potential therapeutic targets for mitigating its adverse effects in disease states. This review highlights the dual role of EndMT in health and disease, emphasizing the need for further research to unravel its complexities and therapeutic implications in cardiovascular and other diseases.", "label": 1}
