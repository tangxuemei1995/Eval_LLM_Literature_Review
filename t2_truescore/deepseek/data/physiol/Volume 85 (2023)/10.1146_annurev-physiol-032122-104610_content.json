{"grounding": "Membrane contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM), or ER-PM junctions, are found in all eukaryotic cells. In excitable cells they play unique roles in organizing diverse forms of Ca2+ signaling as triggered by membrane depolarization. ER-PM junctions underlie crucial physiological processes such as excitation-contraction coupling, smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, and various forms of activity-dependent signaling and plasticity in neurons. In many cases the structure and molecular composition of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells comprise important regulatory feedback loops linking depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling at these sites to the regulation of membrane potential. Here, we describe recent findings on physiological roles and molecular composition of native ER-PM junctions in excitable cells. We focus on recent studies that provide new insights into canonical forms of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling occurring at junctional triads and dyads of striated muscle, as well as the diversity of ER-PM junctions in these cells and in smooth muscle and neurons.", "generated_text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) form specialized junctions known as membrane contact sites (MCSs), which play a pivotal role in cellular signaling and homeostasis. This study investigates the role of ER-PM junctions in depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling within excitable cells, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles, as well as neurons. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that these junctions serve as critical hubs for the rapid transmission of Ca2+ signals following membrane depolarization. The spatial organization of ion channels and second messengers at ER-PM junctions facilitates efficient Ca2+ influx and subsequent intracellular Ca2+ release, highlighting their importance in the regulation of muscle contraction and neuronal activity. Our findings underscore the significance of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying Ca2+ signaling and its implications for cellular function and disease.", "label": 1}
