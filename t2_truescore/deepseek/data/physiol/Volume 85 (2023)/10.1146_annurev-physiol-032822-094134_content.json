{"grounding": "Liver regeneration occurs in response to diverse injuries and is capable of functionally reestablishing the lost parenchyma. This phenomenon has been known since antiquity, encapsulated in the Greek myth where Prometheus was to be punished by Zeus for sharing the gift of fire with humanity by having an eagle eat his liver daily, only to have the liver regrow back, thus ensuring eternal suffering and punishment. Today, this process is actively leveraged clinically during living donor liver transplantation whereby up to a two-thirds hepatectomy (resection or removal of part of the liver) on a donor is used for transplant to a recipient. The donor liver rapidly regenerates to recover the lost parenchymal mass to form a functional tissue. This astonishing regenerative process and unique capacity of the liver are examined in further detail in this review.", "generated_text": "The mammalian liver exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity and maintains homeostasis through complex mechanisms involving cellular heterogeneity and plasticity. Liver zonation, a key feature of hepatic architecture, underpins the organ's functional diversity and response to injury. This review explores the multifaceted aspects of liver homeostasis and regeneration, focusing on the roles of distinct cell populations within the liver's lobular structure. We delve into the cellular and molecular pathways that facilitate recovery from acute and chronic injuries, highlighting the adaptive plasticity of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver repair and mitigate the progression of liver diseases. The interplay between liver zonation, cellular heterogeneity, and regenerative mechanisms offers insights into the liver's resilience and potential targets for intervention in pathological conditions.", "label": 1}
