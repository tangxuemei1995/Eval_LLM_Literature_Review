{"grounding": "Neural mechanisms of perceptual decision making have been extensively studied in experimental settings that mimic stable environments with repeating stimuli, fixed rules, and payoffs. In contrast, we live in an ever-changing environment and have varying goals and behavioral demands. To accommodate variability, our brain flexibly adjusts decision-making processes depending on context. Here, we review a growing body of research that explores the neural mechanisms underlying this flexibility. We highlight diverse forms of context dependency in decision making implemented through a variety of neural computations. Context-dependent neural activity is observed in a distributed network of brain structures, including posterior parietal, sensory, motor, and subcortical regions, as well as the prefrontal areas classically implicated in cognitive control. We propose that investigating the distributed network underlying flexible decisions is key to advancing our understanding and discuss a path forward for experimental and theoretical investigations.", "generated_text": "Flexible decision-making is a cornerstone of adaptive behavior, allowing organisms to adjust their actions in response to changing environmental demands. This study delves into the neural mechanisms underpinning the flexibility of perceptual decisions, focusing on the interplay between sensory-guided behavior and task-switching capabilities. By examining stimulus-action mapping and decision policy adjustments within distributed neural networks, we uncover the dynamic processes that facilitate rapid and efficient transitions between different decision-making strategies. Our findings highlight the critical role of neural plasticity and the reconfiguration of functional connectivity in enabling the brain to navigate complex and unpredictable environments. Through a synthesis of empirical data and computational modeling, we propose a framework that elucidates how distributed neural networks support flexible decision-making, offering insights into the neural basis of cognitive adaptability and its implications for understanding behavioral flexibility in both health and disease.", "label": 1}
