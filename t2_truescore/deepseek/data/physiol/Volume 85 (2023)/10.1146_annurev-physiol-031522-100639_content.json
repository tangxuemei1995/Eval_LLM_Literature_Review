{"grounding": "Numerous trafficking and quality control pathways evolved to handle the diversity of proteins made by eukaryotic cells. However, at every step along the biosynthetic pathway, there is the potential for quality control system failure. This review focuses on the mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis. Inspired by diseases caused by misfolded proteins in the kidney (mucin 1 and uromodulin), we outline the general principles of protein biosynthesis, delineate the recognition and degradation pathways targeting misfolded proteins, and discuss the role of cargo receptors in protein trafficking and lipid homeostasis. We also discuss technical approaches including live-cell fluorescent microscopy, chemical screens to elucidate trafficking mechanisms, multiplexed single-cell CRISPR screening platforms to systematically delineate mechanisms of proteostasis, and the advancement of novel tools to degrade secretory and membrane-associated proteins. By focusing on components of trafficking that go awry, we highlight ongoing efforts to understand fundamental mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis and implications for the treatment of human proteinopathies.", "generated_text": "Protein trafficking and quality control are fundamental processes that ensure the proper localization and function of proteins within cells, particularly in the kidney where these mechanisms are crucial for maintaining homeostasis. This review delves into the intricate pathways of protein trafficking, focusing on the roles of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and vesicular transport systems in the kidney and other tissues. We explore the significance of transmembrane emp24 domain-containing proteins (TMEDs) in cargo selection and vesicle formation, highlighting their impact on the secretory pathway and lysosomal function. Additionally, we examine the proteome's role in quality control, emphasizing how dysregulation of these processes can lead to kidney disease. By integrating recent findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying protein trafficking and quality control, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for kidney-related pathologies and beyond.", "label": 1}
