{"grounding": "Coughing is a dynamic physiological process resulting from input of vagal sensory neurons innervating the airways and perceived airway irritation. Although cough serves to protect and clear the airways, it can also be exploited by respiratory pathogens to facilitate disease transmission. Microbial components or infection-induced inflammatory mediators can directly interact with sensory nerve receptors to induce a cough response. Analysis of cough-generated aerosols and transmission studies have further demonstrated how infectious disease is spread through coughing. This review summarizes the neurophysiology of cough, cough induction by respiratory pathogens and inflammation, and cough-mediated disease transmission.", "generated_text": "Cough, a common symptom of respiratory tract infections, serves as a critical defense mechanism but also facilitates disease transmission. This study explores the infectious and inflammatory pathways leading to cough, focusing on the role of sensory neurons in the respiratory tract. By analyzing the interaction between pathogens, immune responses, and neural pathways, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cough reflex sensitization. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between microbial invasion, inflammatory mediators, and neuronal activation, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for cough management and prevention of disease spread.", "label": 1}
