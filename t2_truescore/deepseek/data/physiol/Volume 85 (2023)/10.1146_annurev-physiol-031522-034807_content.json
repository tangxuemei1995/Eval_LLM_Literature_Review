{"grounding": "Pericytes, attached to the surface of capillaries, play an important role in regulating local blood flow. Using optogenetic tools and genetically encoded reporters in conjunction with confocal and multiphoton imaging techniques, the 3D structure, anatomical organization, and physiology of pericytes have recently been the subject of detailed examination. This work has revealed novel functions of pericytes and morphological features such as tunneling nanotubes in brain and tunneling microtubes in heart. Here, we discuss the state of our current understanding of the roles of pericytes in blood flow control in brain and heart, where functions may differ due to the distinct spatiotemporal metabolic requirements of these tissues. We also outline the novel concept of electro-metabolic signaling, a universal mechanistic framework that links tissue metabolic state with blood flow regulation by pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, with capillary KATP and Kir2.1 channels as primary sensors. Finally, we present major unresolved questions and outline how they can be addressed.", "generated_text": "Pericytes, multifunctional mural cells embedded within the microvascular walls of the brain and heart, play a pivotal role in the regulation of blood flow, ensuring the metabolic demands of these organs are met. This review delves into the intricate mechanisms by which pericytes contribute to neurovascular coupling in the brain and electro-metabolic signaling in the heart, highlighting their involvement in the modulation of ion channels, particularly calcium and potassium channels. Through these pathways, pericytes influence vascular tone and blood flow, thereby supporting the high metabolic rates required for neuronal activity and cardiac function. The emerging understanding of pericyte function underscores their potential as therapeutic targets in conditions characterized by impaired blood flow regulation, such as ischemic stroke and heart failure. This synthesis of current knowledge aims to bridge gaps in our understanding of pericyte biology and its implications for cardiovascular and neurological health.", "label": 1}
