{"grounding": "Salt taste, the taste of sodium chloride (NaCl), is mechanistically one of the most complex and puzzling among basic tastes. Sodium has essential functions in the body but causes harm in excess. Thus, animals use salt taste to ingest the right amount of salt, which fluctuates by physiological needs: typically, attraction to low salt concentrations and rejection of high salt. This concentration-valence relationship is universally observed in terrestrial animals, and research has revealed complex peripheral codes for NaCl involving multiple taste pathways of opposing valence. Sodium-dependent and -independent pathways mediate attraction and aversion to NaCl, respectively. Gustatory sensors and cells that transduce NaCl have been uncovered, along with downstream signal transduction and neurotransmission mechanisms. However, much remains unknown. This article reviews classical and recent advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying salt taste in mammals and insects and discusses perspectives on human salt taste.", "generated_text": "Salt taste, a fundamental aspect of gustation, plays a critical role in dietary sodium intake and overall health. This review delves into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the perception of saltiness, focusing on the role of sodium ions (Na+) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in taste transduction. ENaC, expressed in taste receptor cells, is pivotal for the detection of low concentrations of salt, contributing to the appetitive valence of salt taste. Additionally, the involvement of other ion channels and receptors in sensing higher salt concentrations is explored, highlighting the complexity of salt taste perception. The interplay between these molecular entities not only elucidates the physiological basis of salt taste but also sheds light on its hedonic value, offering insights into the neural encoding of taste valence. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for addressing health issues related to excessive salt consumption and for developing strategies to modulate salt taste perception.", "label": 1}
