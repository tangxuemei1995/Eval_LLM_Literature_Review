{"grounding": "Polycystin subunits can form hetero- and homotetrameric ion channels in the membranes of various compartments of the cell. Homotetrameric polycystin channels are voltage- and calcium-modulated, whereas heterotetrameric versions are proposed to be ligand- or autoproteolytically regulated. Their importance is underscored by variants associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and by vital roles in fertilization and embryonic development. The diversity in polycystin assembly and subcellular distribution allows for a multitude of sensory functions by this class of channels. In this review, we highlight their recent structural and functional characterization, which has provided a molecular blueprint to investigate the conformational changes required for channel opening in response to unique stimuli. We consider each polycystin channel type individually, discussing how they contribute to sensory cell biology, as well as their impact on the physiology of various tissues.", "generated_text": "Polycystin channel complexes play a pivotal role in cellular signaling and are integral to the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. These complexes, comprising polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), function as non-selective cation channels, with PC2 also belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. The gating mechanism of these channels, influenced by mechanical and chemical stimuli, is crucial for their function in primary cilia, sensory organelles implicated in a variety of ciliopathies. This review explores the structural and functional aspects of polycystin channel complexes, their role in ADPKD, and the broader implications for understanding ciliopathies. Insights into the molecular mechanisms governing these channels may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting ADPKD and related disorders.", "label": 1}
