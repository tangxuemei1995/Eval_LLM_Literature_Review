{"grounding": "Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are components of plasma membranes and an efficient fuel source and also serve as metabolic regulators through FA signaling mediated by membrane FA receptors. Impaired tissue FA uptake has been linked to major complications of obesity, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Fatty acid interactions with a membrane receptor and the initiation of signaling can modify pathways related to nutrient uptake and processing, cell proliferation or differentiation, and secretion of bioactive factors. Here, we review the major membrane receptors involved in FA uptake and FA signaling. We focus on two types of membrane receptors for long-chain FAs: CD36 and the G protein–coupled FA receptors FFAR1 and FFAR4. We describe key signaling pathways and metabolic outcomes for CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 and highlight the parallels that provide insight into FA regulation of cell function.", "generated_text": "Fatty acids (FAs) play a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism, signaling, and structural integrity. This review delves into the mechanisms of FA transport and signaling, highlighting the critical roles of CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 receptors in mediating these processes. CD36 facilitates the uptake of long-chain FAs, while FFAR1 and FFAR4, as G protein-coupled receptors, are instrumental in FA signaling pathways that regulate insulin secretion, inflammation, and energy homeostasis. The involvement of caveolin in organizing FA transport and signaling complexes within membrane microdomains is also discussed, underscoring its importance in cellular FA dynamics. Furthermore, the review explores the physiological implications of FA signaling, including its impact on β-oxidation and tissue repair processes. Understanding these mechanisms offers insights into the therapeutic potential of targeting FA transport and signaling pathways in metabolic diseases and tissue regeneration.", "label": 1}
