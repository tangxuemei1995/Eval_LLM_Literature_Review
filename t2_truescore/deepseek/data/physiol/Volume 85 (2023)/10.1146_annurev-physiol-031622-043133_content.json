{"grounding": "Insulin action is impaired in type 2 diabetes. The functions of the hormone are an integrated product of insulin secretion from pancreatic Î²-cells and insulin clearance by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation, mostly in liver (hepatocytes) and, to a lower extent, in extrahepatic peripheral tissues. Substantial evidence indicates that genetic or acquired abnormalities of insulin secretion or action predispose to type 2 diabetes. In recent years, along with the discovery of the molecular foundation of receptor-mediated insulin clearance, such as through the membrane glycoprotein CEACAM1, a consensus has begun to emerge that reduction of insulin clearance contributes to the disease process. In this review, we consider the evidence suggesting a pathogenic role for reduced insulin clearance in insulin resistance, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and type 2 diabetes.", "generated_text": "Insulin clearance plays a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, with its efficiency varying significantly across different physiological and pathological states. This review explores the mechanisms of insulin action and clearance, highlighting the impact of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia on these processes. Special attention is given to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition increasingly recognized for its association with altered insulin dynamics. Furthermore, the influence of age and ethnicity on insulin clearance is examined, shedding light on the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. By synthesizing current evidence, this paper aims to enhance understanding of insulin clearance in health and disease, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for conditions characterized by insulin dysregulation.", "label": 1}
