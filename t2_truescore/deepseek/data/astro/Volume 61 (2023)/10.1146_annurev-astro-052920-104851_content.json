{"grounding": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) is a critical stepping stone in the gas evolution cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way. Hi traces both the cold, premolecular state before star formation and the warm, diffuse ISM before and after star formation. This review describes new, sensitive Hi absorption and emission surveys, which, together with high angular and spectral resolution Hi emission data, have revealed the physical properties of Hi, its structure, and its association with magnetic fields. We give an overview of the Hi phases and discuss how Hi properties depend on the environment and what its structure can tell us about feedback in the ISM. Key findings include the following:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe mass fraction of the cold neutral medium is ≲40% on average, increasing with A\nV due to the increase of mean gas density.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe cold disk extends to at least R ∼ 25 kpc.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tApproximately 40% of the Hi is warm, with structural characteristics that derive from feedback events.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tCold Hi is highly filamentary, whereas warm Hi is more smoothly distributed.\n\n\n\nWe summarize future observational and simulation opportunities that can be used to unravel the 3D structure of the atomic ISM and the effects of heating and cooling on Hi properties.", "generated_text": "The study of atomic hydrogen (Hi) in the Milky Way offers profound insights into the complex processes driving galaxy evolution. As the most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen plays a pivotal role in the lifecycle of galaxies, from the formation of stars to the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM). This research delves into the distribution, kinematics, and physical properties of Hi within our galaxy, employing cutting-edge radio astronomy techniques to map its presence and interaction with magnetic fields. By analyzing Hi absorption and emission lines, we uncover the intricate balance between gravitational forces, magnetic pressures, and thermal processes that govern the ISM. Furthermore, this investigation highlights the significance of Hi as a tracer of galactic structure and evolution, providing a stepping stone for understanding the mechanisms that shape galaxies across the cosmos. The findings underscore the importance of atomic hydrogen in the cosmic narrative, from the early universe to the present day, offering a window into the past and future of galactic development. This study not only advances our knowledge of the Milky Way but also contributes to the broader field of astrophysics, shedding light on the universal processes that drive the evolution of galaxies.", "label": 1}
