{"grounding": "This article depicts my life and career over the past decades, beginning with my birth in 1927 and ending in my two dreams yet to be realized. This article focuses on my school years during wartime and my work with Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) from 1951 on—serving as Director of SHAO during 1981–1993 and a Member of CAS since 1980—and shares some social activities I've been involved in for the benefits of women and children. Special focus is given to the endeavors of building one of the world's most precise Universal Time systems in the 1960s, a very long baseline interferometry network, a satellite laser ranging research station during the 1970s–1990s, and the 65-m Radio Telescope in the early twenty-first century; developing astro-geodynamics in China and advancing the Asia-Pacific Space Geodynamics Program in the late twentieth century; and leading SHAO in international cooperation while serving as Chair of the International Astronomical Union Finance Committee during 1985–1988, the IAU Vice-President during 1988–1994, and a foreign fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society of Britain in 1985. This autobiographical account should, hopefully, serve its purpose of offering a glimpse of me and my lifelong interaction with time and space.", "generated_text": "This autobiographical narrative chronicles the journey of a strategic scientist whose career spans several decades, marked by significant contributions to the fields of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), astro-geodynamics, and radio astronomy. Set against the backdrop of China's rapid development in space science and technology, the account delves into the personal and professional challenges faced, alongside the triumphs achieved in advancing deep space exploration. The narrative highlights the pivotal role of international cooperation in overcoming technical and scientific hurdles, fostering a global community of researchers dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the universe. Through a reflective lens, the author examines the interplay between time and space, not only in the context of astronomical phenomena but also in the evolution of a scientific career that has contributed to humanity's understanding of the cosmos. This journey underscores the importance of perseverance, innovation, and collaboration in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and capability in the realm of space exploration.", "label": 1}
