{"grounding": "After decades of fast-paced technical advances, optical/infrared (O/IR) interferometry has seen a revolution in recent years:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with four 8-m telescopes reaches thousand-times-fainter objects than possible with earlier interferometers, and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array (CHARA) routinely offers up to 330-m baselines and aperture synthesis with six 1-m telescopes.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe observed objects are fainter than 19 mag, the images have submilliarcsecond resolution, and the astrometry reaches microarcsecond precision.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThis led to breakthrough results on the Galactic Center, exoplanets, active galactic nuclei, young stellar objects, and stellar physics.\n\n\n\nFollowing a primer in interferometry, we summarize the advances that led to the performance boost of modern interferometers:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tSingle-mode beam combiners now combine up to six telescopes, and image reconstruction software has advanced over earlier developments for radio interferometry.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tWith a combination of large telescopes, adaptive optics (AO), fringe tracking, and especially dual-beam interferometry, GRAVITY has boosted the sensitivity by many orders of magnitude.\n\n\n\nAnother order-of-magnitude improvement will come from laser guide star AO. In combination with large separation fringe tracking, O/IR interferometry will then provide complete sky coverage for observations in the Galactic plane and substantial coverage for extragalactic targets.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in optical and infrared interferometry have significantly enhanced our understanding of various astronomical phenomena, ranging from the intricate dynamics of the Galactic Center to the detailed characterization of exoplanets. This paper reviews the latest developments in interferometric instrumentation, which have enabled unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We explore the application of these technologies in studying active galactic nuclei (AGN), where interferometry has provided insights into the structure and kinematics of the central regions, shedding light on the mechanisms of accretion and jet formation. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of interferometry in the observation of young stellar objects (YSOs), offering a closer look at the processes of star formation and the evolution of circumstellar disks. The study of stars, particularly in the context of stellar surfaces and atmospheres, has also benefited from these advancements, allowing for detailed measurements of stellar diameters, limb darkening, and surface features. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent findings, this paper underscores the transformative impact of optical and infrared interferometry on astrophysical research, paving the way for future discoveries in the field.", "label": 1}
