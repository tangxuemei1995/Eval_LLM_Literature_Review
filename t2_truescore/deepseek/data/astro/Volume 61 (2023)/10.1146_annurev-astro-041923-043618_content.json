{"grounding": "We review the progress in modeling the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations of the Î›CDM cosmogony. State-of-the-art simulations now broadly reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies; the distributions of key characteristics, such as mass, size, and SFR; and scaling relations connecting diverse properties to mass. Such improvements engender confidence in the insight drawn from simulations. Many important outcomes, however, particularly the properties of circumgalactic gas, are sensitive to the details of the subgrid models used to approximate the macroscopic effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback processes. We compare the outcomes of leading simulation suites with observations, and with each other, to identify the enduring successes they have cultivated and the outstanding challenges to be tackled with the next generation of models. Our key conclusions include the following:", "generated_text": "Hydrodynamical simulations have become a cornerstone in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, offering detailed insights into the complex interplay between gas dynamics, star formation, and feedback mechanisms within galaxy halos. These simulations have successfully replicated key observational features of the galaxy population, such as the galaxy luminosity function and the distribution of galaxy morphologies. However, challenges remain in accurately modeling the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium, the impact of feedback from active galactic nuclei, and the role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution. This paper reviews the enduring successes of hydrodynamical simulations in capturing the essence of galaxy formation, while also highlighting the outstanding challenges that must be addressed to further our understanding of the cosmic evolution of galaxies.", "label": 1}
