{"grounding": "Planets form in disks of gas and dust around young stars. The disk molecular reservoirs and their chemical evolution affect all aspects of planet formation, from the coagulation of dust grains into pebbles to the elemental and molecular compositions of the mature planet. Disk chemistry also enables unique probes of disk structures and dynamics, including those directly linked to ongoing planet formation. We review the protoplanetary disk chemistry of the volatile elements H, O, C, N, S, and P; the associated observational and theoretical methods; and the links between disk and planet chemical compositions. Three takeaways from this review are:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe disk chemical composition, including the organic reservoirs, is set by both inheritance and in situ chemistry.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tDisk gas and solid O/C/N/H elemental ratios often deviate from stellar values due to a combination of condensation of molecular carriers, chemistry, and dynamics.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tChemical, physical, and dynamical processes in disks are closely linked, which complicates disk chemistry modeling, but these links also present an opportunity to develop chemical probes of different aspects of disk evolution and planet formation.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The study of protoplanetary disk chemistry is pivotal in understanding the complex processes leading to planet formation. This research delves into the astrochemical pathways that govern the evolution of molecular species within protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets. By examining the interplay between gas-phase reactions, grain-surface chemistry, and the dynamic physical conditions of disks, we aim to elucidate the chemical inventory available for planet formation. Advanced observational techniques and sophisticated chemical models are employed to trace the distribution and evolution of key molecular species, from simple diatomic molecules to complex organic compounds. This investigation not only sheds light on the chemical diversity of protoplanetary disks but also provides insights into the initial conditions for planetary systems, including our own. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of astrochemistry and its implications for the origins of planetary systems, offering a chemical perspective on the processes that shape the architecture of nascent planetary systems.", "label": 1}
