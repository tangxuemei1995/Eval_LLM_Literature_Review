{"grounding": "The past two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain data sets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity, and comparative robustness, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such data sets. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modeling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain data sets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code; discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability; and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open-source GP software packages. In summary:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tGP regression is a conceptually simple but statistically principled and powerful tool for the analysis of astronomical time series.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tIt is already widely used in some subfields, such as exoplanets, and gaining traction in many others, such as optical transients.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tDriven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time-domain astronomy for many years to come.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The analysis of astronomical time series data presents unique challenges due to its irregular sampling, noise characteristics, and the complex nature of the underlying astrophysical processes. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) emerges as a powerful tool in this context, offering a flexible, non-parametric approach to model and predict time series data. This paper explores the application of GPR in the field of time-domain astronomy, highlighting its advantages in handling the intricacies of astronomical datasets. We discuss the theoretical foundations of GPR, including kernel selection and optimization, which are crucial for accurately capturing the temporal correlations and variability in astronomical observations. Furthermore, we present case studies demonstrating the efficacy of GPR in various astronomical applications, such as the detection of exoplanets, the study of variable stars, and the analysis of transient events. These examples illustrate how GPR can be integrated into the astrostatistics toolkit to enhance the interpretation of time-domain data. The paper also addresses computational considerations, providing insights into the scalability and efficiency of GPR methods when applied to large-scale astronomical surveys. By bridging the gap between statistical theory and astronomical practice, this work aims to foster the adoption of GPR in the astronomical community, paving the way for more sophisticated analyses of the dynamic universe.", "label": 1}
