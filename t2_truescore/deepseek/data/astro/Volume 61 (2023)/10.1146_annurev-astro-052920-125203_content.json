{"grounding": "Spurred by rich, multiwavelength observations and enabled by new simulations, ranging from cosmological to subparsec scales, the past decade has seen major theoretical progress in our understanding of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We review key physical processes in the CGM. Our conclusions include the following:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe properties of the CGM depend on a competition between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. When cooling is slow relative to free fall, the gas is hot (roughly virial temperature), whereas the gas is cold (T ∼ 104 K) when cooling is rapid.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tGas inflows and outflows play crucial roles, as does the cosmological environment. Large-scale structure collimates cold streams and provides angular momentum. Satellite galaxies contribute to the CGM through winds and gas stripping.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tIn multiphase gas, the hot and cold phases continuously exchange mass, energy, and momentum. The interaction between turbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical. A broad spectrum of cold gas structures, going down to subparsec scales, arises from fragmentation, coagulation, and condensation onto gas clouds.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tMagnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays can substantially modify how the cold and hot phases interact, although microphysical uncertainties are presently large.\n\n\nKey open questions for future work include the mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics, and how the CGM affects the evolution of galaxies.", "generated_text": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies, acting as a reservoir for gas that fuels star formation and as a repository for feedback from stellar and supermassive black hole activity. This study delves into the key physical processes governing the CGM, including hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and the interaction between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galactic halos. By synthesizing observations and theoretical models, we explore the mechanisms of gas accretion, cooling, and heating within the CGM, and how these processes influence galaxy formation and evolution. Special attention is given to the role of feedback mechanisms in regulating the thermal and dynamic state of the CGM, and the implications for cosmological theory. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between the CGM and its host galaxy, underscoring the importance of multi-wavelength observations and advanced numerical simulations in unraveling the mysteries of the CGM. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the cosmic baryon cycle and the intricate relationship between galaxies and their surrounding environments.", "label": 1}
