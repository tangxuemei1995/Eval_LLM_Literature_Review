{"grounding": "Quasars at cosmic dawn provide powerful probes of the formation and growth of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the Universe, their connections to galaxy and structure formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). Hundreds of quasars have been discovered in the first billion years of cosmic history, with the quasar redshift frontier extended to z ∼ 7.6. Observations of quasars at cosmic dawn show the following:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe number density of luminous quasars declines exponentially at z > 5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerge at z ∼ 10; the lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution indicates a rapid buildup of the active galactic nucleus environment.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tBillion-solar-mass black holes (BHs) already exist at z > 7.5; they must form and grow in less than 700 Myr, by a combination of massive early BH seeds with highly efficient and sustained accretion.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe rapid quasar growth is accompanied by strong star formation and feedback activity in their host galaxies, which show diverse morphological and kinetic properties, with typical dynamical mass lower than that implied by the local BH/galaxy scaling relations.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tHi absorption in quasar spectra probes the tail end of cosmic reionization at z ∼ 5.3–6 and indicates the EoR midpoint at 6.9 < z < 7.6, with large spatial fluctuations in IGM ionization. Observations of heavy element absorption lines suggest that the circumgalactic medium also experiences evolution in its ionization structure and metal enrichment during the EoR.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The epoch of cosmic dawn marks a pivotal phase in the universe's history, characterized by the formation of the first stars, galaxies, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). This study delves into the intricate relationship between quasars, powered by SMBHs, and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during this transformative era. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of observational data and theoretical models, we explore how quasars contribute to the process of cosmic reionization, a critical event that led to the ionization of hydrogen in the IGM. Our findings highlight the significant role of quasars in shaping the thermal and ionization state of the IGM, thereby influencing the subsequent evolution of galaxies. We also investigate the feedback mechanisms between quasars and their host galaxies, shedding light on the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies. The study underscores the importance of quasars as probes of the early universe, offering insights into the properties of the IGM and the timeline of cosmic reionization. By integrating observations from the latest generation of telescopes with advanced cosmological simulations, this research advances our understanding of the complex interplay between quasars, the IGM, and galaxy evolution during the cosmic dawn.", "label": 1}
