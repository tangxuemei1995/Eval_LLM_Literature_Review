{"grounding": "The first generation of stars, often called Population III (or Pop III), form from metal-free primordial gas at redshifts z ∼ 30 and below. They dominate the cosmic star-formation history until z ∼ 15–20, at which point the formation of metal-enriched Population II stars takes over. We review current theoretical models for the formation, properties, and impact of Pop III stars and discuss existing and future observational constraints. Key takeaways from this review include the following:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tPrimordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III stars form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tFeedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation, but major uncertainties remain regarding its immediate impact.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tIn extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 105M⊙. Their remnants may be the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tDirect observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe remain extremely challenging. Indirect constraints from the global 21-cm signal or gravitational waves are more promising.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tStellar archeological surveys allow us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of the first stars marks a pivotal epoch in the history of the Universe, setting the stage for the cosmic evolution that followed. This study delves into the intricate processes governing the birth of Population III stars, the Universe's inaugural stellar generation, characterized by their primordial composition devoid of metals. We explore the theoretical frameworks and observational evidence that shed light on their formation mechanisms, properties, and the subsequent emergence of Population II stars, which contain trace amounts of metals. Utilizing the tools of galactic archeology and insights from the high-redshift Universe, we investigate the impact of these early stellar populations on the reionization of the Universe, the enrichment of the intergalactic medium with heavy elements, and the formation of the first galaxies. Our analysis underscores the significance of understanding the first stars in unraveling the complexities of cosmic dawn and the evolutionary pathways of galaxies. This research contributes to the broader field of cosmology by providing a comprehensive overview of the first stars' role in shaping the Universe's structure and composition, offering new perspectives on the origins of cosmic diversity.", "label": 0}
