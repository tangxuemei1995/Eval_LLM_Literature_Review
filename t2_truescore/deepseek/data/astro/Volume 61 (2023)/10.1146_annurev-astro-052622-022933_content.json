{"grounding": "We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in big disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include the following:\n\n\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tCircumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at P\nb (the binary period) or ∼5P\nb, depending on the binary eccentricity e\nb and mass ratio q\nb.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tThe inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical processes (e.g., planet migration) taking place in the disk.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tOver long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary parameters (e\nb and q\nb) and on the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas.\n\n▪ \n\t\t\t\tA misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when e\nb is significant, the disk can evolve toward “polar alignment,” with the disk plane perpendicular to the binary plane.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Circumbinary accretion plays a pivotal role in the evolution of binary systems, ranging from stellar binaries to massive binary black holes. This process involves the transfer of mass and angular momentum from a circumbinary disk to the binary components, significantly influencing their orbital dynamics and growth. In the context of star formation, circumbinary disks around young stellar binaries are crucial for understanding the formation of planets and the distribution of angular momentum. Similarly, in the realm of black hole physics, circumbinary accretion disks around supermassive binary black holes are key to deciphering the mechanisms of black hole growth and the emission of gravitational waves. This study delves into the hydrodynamics of circumbinary accretion, employing both analytical models and numerical simulations to explore the complex interactions between the disk and the binary. We examine the impact of various parameters, such as the binary mass ratio, eccentricity, and disk viscosity, on the accretion process and the resulting observational signatures. Our findings shed light on the formation and evolution of exoplanets in binary star systems and the coalescence of supermassive black holes, providing insights into the broader astrophysical implications of circumbinary accretion.", "label": 1}
