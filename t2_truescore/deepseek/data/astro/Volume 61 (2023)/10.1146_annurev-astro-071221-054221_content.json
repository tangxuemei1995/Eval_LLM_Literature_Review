{"grounding": "Interstellar interlopers are bodies formed outside of the Solar System but observed passing through it. The first two identified interlopers, 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited unexpectedly different physical properties. 1I/‘Oumuamua appeared unresolved and asteroid-like, whereas 2I/Borisov was a more comet-like source of both gas and dust. Both objects moved under the action of nongravitational acceleration. These interlopers and their divergent properties provide our only window so far onto an enormous and previously unknown galactic population. The number density of such objects is ∼0.1 AU−3 which, if uniform across the galactic disk, would imply 1025 to 1026 similar objects in the Milky Way. The interlopers likely formed in, and were ejected from, the protoplanetary disks of young stars. However, we currently possess too little data to firmly reject other explanations.", "generated_text": "The discovery of interstellar interlopers, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has opened a new frontier in the study of cometary science and the dynamics of protoplanetary disks. These objects, originating from beyond our solar system, provide unique insights into the processes of planetary system formation and the chemical diversity of the galaxy. This research delves into the characteristics and trajectories of these interstellar visitors, comparing them with native comets to understand their origins and the conditions of their parent systems. By analyzing the spectral data and orbital mechanics of these interlopers, we aim to shed light on the early stages of planetary system evolution and the potential for interstellar exchange of organic materials. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of the cosmos and the mechanisms driving the diversity of planetary systems.", "label": 1}
