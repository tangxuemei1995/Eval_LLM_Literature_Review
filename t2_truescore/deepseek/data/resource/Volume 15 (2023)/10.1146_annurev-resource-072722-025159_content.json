{"grounding": "In 2015, the United Nations and the G20 put food loss and food waste on the global agenda. While progress has been made since then, the scale of the problem persists because food loss and food waste are measured together, not separately. The paucity of data also poses a challenge. This article reviews the measurements, causes, and determinants of food loss as well as the interventions to reduce it. The review finds that food loss is considered in isolation, even though it is one of the causes and results of how agrifood systems function. The review calls for improved microdata collection and standardized measurements to separate food loss from food waste. Such efforts would help integrate feedback loops and cascading effects across the value chain with agrifood systems to identify intervention hot spots, trade-offs, and synergies of interventions as well as the effects of food loss reduction on socioeconomic, environmental, and food security goals.", "generated_text": "Food losses within agrifood systems represent a critical challenge to global food security, economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. This study synthesizes current knowledge on food losses, focusing on their measurement, determinants, and potential interventions across various stages of the value chain. By reviewing a comprehensive body of literature, we identify key factors contributing to food losses, including technological, managerial, and socio-economic determinants. The analysis highlights the complexity of agrifood systems and the multifaceted nature of food loss, which varies significantly across different regions, commodities, and stages of the supply chain. Furthermore, the paper explores a range of interventions aimed at reducing food losses, from technological innovations to policy measures and behavioral changes. The findings underscore the importance of a holistic approach that considers the entire agrifood system to effectively address food losses. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable food systems by providing insights into the mechanisms of food loss and offering recommendations for stakeholders across the value chain.", "label": 1}
