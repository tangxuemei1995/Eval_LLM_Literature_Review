{"grounding": "Based on an extensive literature review and publicly available data, this article provides insights into the differences in prevalence, sociodemographics, contributing factors, socioeconomic consequences, health effects, and public policies related to obesity between developed and developing countries. Most importantly, it explores the relationship between obesity and life expectancy and identifies potential mechanisms through which obesity affects mortality, highlighting the differences between developed and developing countries and by gender. It also examines how the associations between obesity and life expectancy differ at the population level compared with the individual level. The evidence shows a negative association between obesity and longevity, as well as an increased risk of various diseases with the rising rates of obesity. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing countries and by gender. The article also discusses the effectiveness of various policies adopted to address obesity and provides suggestions to address obesity problems and improve health and well-being in these countries.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy across developed and developing countries, utilizing a comprehensive global dataset. Obesity, a significant public health concern, has been linked to various chronic diseases and increased mortality rates. However, its impact on life expectancy varies considerably between nations, influenced by factors such as healthcare quality, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle choices. Our analysis reveals that in developed countries, where healthcare systems are more robust, the negative impact of obesity on life expectancy is somewhat mitigated. Conversely, in developing countries, the lack of access to adequate healthcare and preventive measures exacerbates the detrimental effects of obesity, leading to a more pronounced reduction in life expectancy. Furthermore, we explore the role of public health interventions and policies in addressing obesity and its consequences. The findings underscore the need for tailored strategies that consider the unique challenges and resources of each country to effectively combat the global obesity epidemic and its impact on life expectancy.", "label": 1}
