{"grounding": "Agroecology is often considered as the ultimate and most comprehensive solution to the many challenges of the agricultural and food system, also referred to as the agri-food system. This review investigates to what extent agroecology can become the mainstream model for transforming agriculture toward more sustainable and resilient agri-food systems within the given economic and political context. We find that enhancing agroecology will require a fully integrated multiscale systems approach from farm to region to globe. The approach must consider relevant processes and relationships, actors and stakeholders as well as drivers, sustainability indicators, and the respective assessment methods across all scales. Giving specific attention to drivers related to economy, technology, and policy we point out that agroecology needs to be economically viable for farmers and other food system actors. In particular, new and emerging technologies related to digitalization and breeding should be given more consideration in agroecological transformation. We stress the need for an analytical and operational framework and adequate multiscale policy design and suggest six areas of needed attention to support the large-scale adoption of agroecology.", "generated_text": "The transition towards sustainable agriculture and food systems is imperative to address the pressing challenges of food security, environmental degradation, and climate change. This paper explores the role of agroecology as a transformative approach that integrates ecological principles into agricultural practices, fostering resilience, biodiversity, and sustainability. By examining case studies from diverse geographical contexts, we highlight how local agroecological solutions can be scaled up to achieve broader impacts. The study emphasizes the importance of multiactor approaches, involving farmers, policymakers, researchers, and consumers, in co-creating knowledge and strategies for sustainable agricultural transformation. Furthermore, we analyze the interplay between agricultural and food policies in facilitating the adoption of agroecological practices at multiple scales. The paper also investigates the potential of emerging technologies to enhance agroecological systems, ensuring their efficiency and scalability. Our findings suggest that agroecology, supported by coherent policies and innovative technologies, can significantly contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture and food systems, offering a pathway towards ecological balance and food sovereignty.", "label": 1}
