{"grounding": "Having experienced low prices for about a decade, the European Union Emissions Trading System has been supplemented with the market stability reserve (MSR) that adjusts the supply of allowances to market outcomes. We critically review the literature assessing the performance of the MSR against several policy objectives. In doing so, we cover both conceptual aspects and quantitative assessments. We conclude by pointing out important policy implications and open issues for further research.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), focusing on its role in stabilizing carbon prices and reducing surplus allowances. By analyzing the interaction between the MSR and overlapping climate policies, the study highlights the challenges and effectiveness of the MSR in achieving long-term emission reductions. The findings suggest that while the MSR enhances market stability, its impact is contingent on the broader policy landscape and market conditions.", "label": 1}
