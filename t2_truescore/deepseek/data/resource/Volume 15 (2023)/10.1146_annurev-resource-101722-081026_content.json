{"grounding": "This article provides an overview of the recent economics literature analyzing the effect of air pollution on health outcomes. We review the common approaches to measuring and modeling air pollution exposures and the epidemiological and biological literature on health outcomes that undergird federal air regulations in the United States. The article contrasts the methods used in the epidemiology literature with the causal inference framework used in economics. In particular, we review the common sources of estimation bias in epidemiological approaches that the economics literature has sought to overcome with research designs that take advantage of natural experiments. We review new promising research designs for estimating concentration-response functions and identify areas for further research.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in causal inference methodologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the complex relationship between air pollution and health outcomes. Leveraging natural experiments and sophisticated epidemiological designs, researchers are now better equipped to isolate the causal effects of air pollutants on various health conditions. This progress is further supported by integrated science assessments that synthesize evidence across disciplines, offering a more comprehensive view of the health impacts of air pollution. These developments not only improve the accuracy of risk assessments but also inform policy decisions aimed at mitigating the adverse health effects of air pollution. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of causal inference techniques with environmental health research promises to uncover new insights into the mechanisms linking air quality to public health.", "label": 0}
