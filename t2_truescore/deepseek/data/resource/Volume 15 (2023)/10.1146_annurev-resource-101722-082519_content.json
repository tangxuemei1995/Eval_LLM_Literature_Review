{"grounding": "We take stock of the major changes in methodology for studying the impacts of international agricultural research, focusing on the period 2006â€“2020. Impact assessment of agricultural research has a long and recognized tradition. Until the mid-2000s, such assessments were dominated by a model of demand for and supply of agricultural products in partial equilibrium. The basic ideas for this approach were sketched out by Griliches more than half a century ago. We describe the implications of heightened standards of evidence for good practice in three domains of research design: causal inference, valid measurement, and statistical representativeness. We document advances in each of these domains and review recent evidence that demonstrates the lessons that can be learned from adopting these practices, emphasizing the importance of evidence at-scale, the need to consider portfolios of innovations at a national level, and the challenges of accounting for innovations that are promoted as bundles.", "generated_text": "The field of international agricultural research for development is undergoing a significant transformation, marked by the adoption of more rigorous standards of evidence for impact assessment. This 'Rigor Revolution' emphasizes the importance of robust measurement techniques and the establishment of causality to accurately evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of interventions. Traditional approaches, often criticized for their reliance on anecdotal evidence and lack of methodological rigor, are being replaced by innovative methodologies that leverage advanced statistical tools and experimental designs. These new standards aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how agricultural research contributes to development outcomes, ensuring that investments are directed towards interventions with proven impact. By focusing on causality and scale, this revolution seeks to enhance the credibility and utility of impact assessments, ultimately supporting more informed decision-making and policy formulation in the realm of agricultural research for development.", "label": 0}
