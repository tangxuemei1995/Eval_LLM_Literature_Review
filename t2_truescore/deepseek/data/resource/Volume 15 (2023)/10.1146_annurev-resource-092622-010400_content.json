{"grounding": "Traditionally, competition law and practice serve to preserve competition, with a focus on the maximization of consumer welfare. This has been criticized as conflicting with society's overarching goal of achieving greater (environmental) sustainability. Consequently, various jurisdictions have recently reformed their laws and guidance allowing them to account for sustainability benefits in the assessment of cooperation between competitors, with potentially considerable implications for how firms can jointly develop and introduce more sustainable technologies and products. This has opened a new research frontier in the long-standing tradition of marrying the theory of industrial organization with the field of environmental and resource economics. The consideration of sustainability benefits in competition analysis also requires both the transfer and adaptation of measurement techniques. We summarize recent developments and sketch potential research opportunities.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, focusing on the role of competition analysis and antitrust regulations in fostering or hindering sustainability agreements among firms. By integrating insights from industrial organization theory, we examine how firm green preferences and cooperative strategies can align with competitive practices to promote environmental objectives. The research highlights the potential for antitrust frameworks to adapt to the challenges of sustainability, suggesting that regulatory bodies could play a pivotal role in encouraging eco-friendly innovations while maintaining market competition. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing debate on how competition policy can be effectively designed to support environmental goals without compromising the principles of fair competition.", "label": 1}
