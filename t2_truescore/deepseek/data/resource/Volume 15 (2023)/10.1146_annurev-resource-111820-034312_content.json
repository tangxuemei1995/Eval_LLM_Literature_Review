{"grounding": "R&D is slow magic. It takes many years before research investments begin to affect productivity, but then they can affect productivity for a long time. Many economists get this wrong. Here, we revisit the conceptual foundations for R&D lag models used to represent the temporal links between research investments and impact, review prevalent practice, and document and discuss a range of evidence on R&D lags in agriculture and other industries. Our theory and evidence consistently support the use of longer lags with a different overall lag profile than is typically imposed in studies of industrial R&D and government compilations of R&D knowledge stocks. Many studies systematically fail to recognize the many years of investment and effort typically required to create a new technology and bring it to market and the subsequent years as the technology is diffused and adopted. Consequential distortions in the measures and economic understanding are implied.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dynamics of research and development (R&D) lags in the agricultural and industrial sectors, focusing on the interplay between knowledge stocks and flows, adoption rates, and technological change. By comparing the R&D lag models specific to each sector, we aim to uncover the underlying factors that contribute to the slower pace of innovation adoption in agriculture compared to industry. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical data, we investigate how differences in R&D investment, knowledge dissemination, and sector-specific challenges influence the rate of technological advancement. Our findings suggest that the agricultural sector experiences longer R&D lags due to its unique biological constraints, regulatory hurdles, and the complexity of integrating new technologies into diverse ecosystems. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving innovation in both sectors and offers insights for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to accelerate technological adoption and enhance productivity.", "label": 1}
