{"grounding": "Identifying mechanisms of real-life human decision-making is central to inform effective, human-centric public policy. Here, we report larger trends and synthesize preliminary lessons from behavioral economic and neuro-economic investigations focusing on environmental values. We review the currently available evidence at different levels of granularity, from insights into how individuals value natural resources (individual level), evidence from work on group externalities, common pool resources, and social norms (social group level) to the study of incentives, policies, and their impact (institutional level). At each level, we identify viable directions for future scientific research and actionable items for policy-makers. Coupled with new technological and methodological advances, we suggest that behavioral economic and neuroeconomic insights may inform an effective strategy to optimize environmental resources. We conclude that the time is ripe for action to enrich policies with scientifically grounded insights, making an impact in the interest of current and future generations.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics in understanding environmental values and their impact on individual decision-making regarding common pool resources. By integrating insights from both disciplines, we aim to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie the valuation of environmental goods and the propensity for sustainable behavior. Our analysis highlights the role of heuristics, biases, and emotional responses in shaping environmental decisions, offering a nuanced perspective on the challenges of managing common pool resources. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for the design of effective environmental policies, emphasizing the importance of aligning policy interventions with the psychological and neural underpinnings of human behavior. This research contributes to the growing body of literature seeking to bridge the gap between economic theory and neuroscientific evidence, providing a comprehensive framework for addressing environmental issues through informed policy-making.", "label": 1}
