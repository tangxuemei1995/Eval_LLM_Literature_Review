{"grounding": "More than five billion metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually worldwide. Despite having multiple uses and significant potential to augment crop and livestock production, a large share of crop residues is burned, especially in Asian countries. This unsustainable practice causes tremendous air pollution and health hazards while restricting soil nutrient recycling. In this review, we examine the economic rationale for unsustainable residue management. The sustainability of residue utilization is determined by several economic factors, such as local demand for and quantity of residue production, development and dissemination of technologies to absorb excess residue, and market and policy instruments to internalize the social costs of residue burning. The intervention strategy to ensure sustainable residue management depends on public awareness of the private and societal costs of open residue burning.", "generated_text": "The management of crop residues presents a critical intersection of agricultural productivity, environmental sustainability, and economic viability, particularly for smallholder farmers. This study explores the economics of crop residue management, focusing on the trade-offs between residue burning and alternative practices such as incorporation into the soil or use as bioenergy feedstock. Residue burning, while cost-effective, contributes significantly to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change and health issues. Conversely, adopting sustainable residue management technologies can mitigate environmental effects and potentially offer economic benefits through improved soil health and energy production. However, the adoption of such technologies by smallholder farmers is hindered by financial constraints, lack of access to technology, and insufficient knowledge. This research highlights the need for policy interventions and support mechanisms to promote sustainable crop residue management practices, balancing economic incentives with environmental and health considerations.", "label": 1}
