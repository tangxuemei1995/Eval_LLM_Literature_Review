{"grounding": "Food fraud represents a serious threat to the integrity of the global agri-food marketing system and has received considerable attention by policy makers, academics, and the public at large. This review presents the conditions that enable fraudulent activity in agri-food supply chains (such as asymmetric information, imperfect certification processes, supply chain complexity, and weak monitoring and enforcement systems) and discusses recent efforts to document and deter food fraud and the growing theoretical and empirical literature on the economics of food fraud. The article concludes by identifying some gaps in the literature and provides suggestions for future research.", "generated_text": "Food fraud, encompassing practices such as adulteration and mislabeling, poses significant risks to public health and undermines consumer trust. This study explores the underlying causes of food fraud, including asymmetric information and the credence goods nature of food products, which complicate consumer verification of quality. The consequences of such fraudulent activities are far-reaching, affecting not only consumer health but also the economic stability of the food industry. To combat these issues, the paper evaluates deterrence strategies, emphasizing the role of certification schemes and the challenges of costly and imperfect enforcement mechanisms in ensuring food authenticity and safety.", "label": 1}
