{"grounding": "This article reviews the literature on the financial sector impacts of natural disasters and physical climate change risks, covering banking, insurance, stock markets, bond markets, and international financial flows. Most studies have applied statistical approaches to historical data from developed countries to identify these impacts, while some have also used theoretical and computational modeling to assess future risks under climate change scenarios. The findings show that natural disasters and climate change risks generally lower insurer profitability and risk-sharing capacity, bank stability and credit supply, returns and stability of stock and bond markets, foreign direct investment inflows, and international lending. Factors such as income levels, rigorous financial regulations, capital abundance, market diversification, and adaptation strategies mitigate the negative effects. Natural disasters increase remittance inflows and financial assistance to low- and middle-income countries. We recommend future research on forward-looking computational modeling to assess the future financial sector impacts of climate change, while accounting for adaptation actions and their drivers. Future research should also consider hazard correlations and the interactions between financial industries and regions to more comprehensively assess the economic effects of natural disasters in general and for vulnerable countries in particular.", "generated_text": "Climate change poses significant risks to the global financial sector, with potential impacts ranging from increased frequency and severity of natural disasters to long-term shifts in climate patterns. This review synthesizes current research on how these risks affect banking, insurance, and financial markets. It highlights the direct and indirect consequences of climate-related events on financial institutions, including asset devaluation, increased insurance claims, and disrupted financial services. The paper also explores the role of financial markets in pricing climate risks and the challenges in accurately assessing and managing these risks. Furthermore, it discusses the adaptive strategies employed by the financial sector to mitigate the impacts of climate change, such as the development of green financial products and the integration of climate risk into investment decisions. The review concludes with a call for enhanced collaboration among financial institutions, policymakers, and researchers to develop robust frameworks for climate risk assessment and management, ensuring the resilience of the financial sector in the face of ongoing climate change.", "label": 1}
