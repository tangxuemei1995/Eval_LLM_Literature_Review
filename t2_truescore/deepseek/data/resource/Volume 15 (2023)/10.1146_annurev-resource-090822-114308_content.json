{"grounding": "This review evaluates three micro and three macro estimation approaches to determine whether unrealistic differences exist in estimating the size of nonobserved/shadow economies. While some macro-MIMIC estimates are higher than estimates using the statistical discrepancy approach, when adjusting for double-counting, MIMIC approaches provide similar results. Macro approaches usually cover not only typical shadow economy activities, but also voluntary work, do-it-yourself activities, and classical crime activities; by nature, macro approaches will lead to higher and more accurate estimates than micro approaches. However, if certain adjustments are made, the estimated size of the shadow economy using the MIMIC approach comes close to the size of the shadow economy indicated by micro survey approaches. Hence, claims that macro approaches are unrealistically high and rely on unrealistic assumptions must be reconsidered.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the extent to which different estimation methods yield implausible differences in the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. By comparing the MIMIC (Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes) estimation approaches, micro survey approaches, survey techniques, and the consumption-income gap approach, we aim to identify the methodological disparities that lead to significant variations in shadow economy estimates. Preliminary findings suggest that each method carries inherent biases and assumptions that can substantially affect the outcomes. The MIMIC approach, for instance, often results in higher estimates due to its reliance on macroeconomic indicators, whereas micro survey approaches tend to provide lower estimates, reflecting the challenges in capturing informal activities. This research underscores the importance of methodological transparency and the need for a consensus on a standardized approach to accurately measure the shadow economy.", "label": 1}
