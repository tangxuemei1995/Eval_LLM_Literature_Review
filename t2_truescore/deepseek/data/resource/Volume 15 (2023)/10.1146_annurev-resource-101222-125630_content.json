{"grounding": "This article reviews recent economic studies on the causal effects of temperature on labor productivity. The negative effects of extreme temperatures are widespread, and the magnitudes of the impact differ across social and economic factors. In addition to physical outputs, extreme temperatures also impair mental productivity, including cognition and learning. In utero exposure to extreme temperatures has profound effects on human development. Although the literature has detected various adaptation strategies, the conclusions are mixed. We discuss some limitations of existing studies and propose several directions for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the multifaceted effects of temperature on labor productivity, encompassing both physical and mental dimensions. By analyzing data across various sectors, we explore how temperature fluctuations influence work efficiency and the capacity for cognitive tasks. Special attention is given to the role of adaptation mechanisms and early-life exposure to temperature extremes in shaping productivity outcomes. Additionally, the research highlights the distributional effects of temperature on labor productivity, revealing disparities across different demographic and socioeconomic groups. Our findings underscore the importance of considering environmental factors in labor policy and workplace design to mitigate productivity losses.", "label": 1}
