{"grounding": "Tumor cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can function as mediators of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment. EVs contain a host of bioactive cargo, including membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins, in addition to noncoding RNAs, other RNA types, and double-stranded DNA fragments. These shed vesicles may deposit paracrine information and can also be taken up by stromal cells, causing the recipient cells to undergo phenotypic changes that profoundly impact diverse facets of cancer progression. For example, this unique form of cellular cross talk helps condition the premetastatic niche, facilitates evasion of the immune response, and promotes invasive and metastatic activity. These findings, coupled with those demonstrating that the number and content of EVs produced by tumors can vary depending on their tumor of origin, disease stage, or response to therapy, have raised the exciting possibility that EVs can be used for risk stratification, diagnostic, and even prognostic purposes. We summarize recent developments and the current knowledge of EV cargoes, their impact on disease progression, and implementation of EV-based liquid biopsies as tumor biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, have emerged as pivotal mediators in the tumor microenvironment (TME), facilitating intercellular communication and modulating various aspects of tumor progression. These EVs carry a diverse array of cargoes, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which can influence the behavior of recipient cells, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating cells. By transferring oncogenic molecules, tumor-derived EVs promote cell migration, tumor invasion, and the establishment of a pre-metastatic niche, thereby contributing to cancer metastasis. Furthermore, the unique molecular signatures of tumor-derived EVs offer promising opportunities for the development of liquid biopsies, enabling non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. This review highlights the multifunctional roles of tumor-derived EVs in the TME, emphasizing their contributions to tumor progression and their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. Understanding the complex interplay between tumor-derived EVs and the TME is crucial for advancing cancer research and improving patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
