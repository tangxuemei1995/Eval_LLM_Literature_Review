{"grounding": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) features a prominent stromal microenvironment with remarkable cellular and spatial heterogeneity that meaningfully impacts disease biology and treatment resistance. Recent advances in tissue imaging capabilities, single-cell analytics, and disease modeling have shed light on organizing principles that shape the stromal complexity of PDAC tumors. These insights into the functional and spatial dependencies that coordinate cancer cell biology and the relationships that exist between cells and extracellular matrix components present in tumors are expected to unveil therapeutic vulnerabilities. We review recent advances in the field and discuss current understandings of mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment shapes PDAC pathogenesis and therapy resistance.", "generated_text": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. This review explores the intricate interplay between pancreatic cancer cells and the TME, focusing on the roles of tumor immunology, stroma, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The TME in pancreatic cancer is characterized by a dense desmoplastic stroma and an immunosuppressive milieu, which not only promotes tumor progression but also hinders the efficacy of conventional and novel therapies. Understanding the dynamic interactions within the TME offers potential therapeutic targets, aiming to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer.", "label": 1}
