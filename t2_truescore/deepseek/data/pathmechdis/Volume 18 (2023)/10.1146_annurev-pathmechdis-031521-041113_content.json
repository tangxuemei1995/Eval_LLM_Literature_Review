{"grounding": "Reprogrammed metabolism is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC cells are geared toward rapid proliferation, requiring nutrients and the removal of cellular waste in nutrient-poor environments. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs), the primary cell of origin for CRCs, must adapt their metabolism along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to the unique features of their complex microenvironment that include interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, stromal cells, commensal microbes, and dietary components. Emerging evidence implicates modifiable risk factors related to the environment, such as diet, as important in CRC pathogenesis. Here, we focus on describing the metabolism of ISCs, diets that influence CRC initiation, CRC genetics and metabolism, and the tumor microenvironment. The mechanistic links between environmental factors, metabolic adaptations, and the tumor microenvironment in enhancing or supporting CRC tumorigenesis are becoming better understood. Thus, greater knowledge of CRC metabolism holds promise for improved prevention and treatment.", "generated_text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with its pathogenesis intricately linked to metabolic alterations. This review delves into the complex interplay between metabolism and CRC, highlighting how dietary factors and the gut microbiome influence cancer development and progression. Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic reprogramming in CRC cells supports their rapid proliferation and survival, while dietary components can either mitigate or exacerbate cancer risk. The gut microbiome, acting as a metabolic interface between diet and host physiology, plays a pivotal role in modulating CRC risk through the production of metabolites that can influence inflammation, DNA damage, and immune responses. Understanding the metabolic pathways involved in CRC and the impact of diet and microbiome on these pathways offers promising avenues for prevention and therapeutic intervention. This synthesis of current knowledge underscores the importance of a holistic approach to CRC, integrating metabolic, dietary, and microbial perspectives to combat this prevalent disease.", "label": 1}
