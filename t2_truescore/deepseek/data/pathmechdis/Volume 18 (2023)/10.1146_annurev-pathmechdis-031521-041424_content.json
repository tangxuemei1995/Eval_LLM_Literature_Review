{"grounding": "Human papillomavirusâ€“positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-OPSCC) has one of the most rapidly increasing incidences of any cancer in high-income countries. The most recent (8th) edition of the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system separates HPV-OPSCC from its HPV-negative counterpart to account for the improved prognosis seen in the former. Indeed, owing to its improved prognosis and greater prevalence in younger individuals, numerous ongoing trials are examining the potential for treatment deintensification as a means to improve quality of life while maintaining acceptable survival outcomes. Owing to the distinct biology of HPV-OPSCCs, targeted therapies and immunotherapies have become an area of particular interest. Importantly, OPSCC is often detected at an advanced stage, highlighting the need for diagnostic biomarkers to aid in earlier detection. In this review, we highlight important advances in the epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and clinical management of HPV-OPSCC and underscore the need for a progressive understanding of the molecular basis of this disease toward early detection and precision care.", "generated_text": "Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has seen a significant epidemiological shift, with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cases now constituting a majority in many developed countries. This review focuses on HPV-related OPSCC, particularly its nonkeratinizing variant, which is characterized by distinct molecular and clinical features compared to its HPV-negative counterpart. The role of HPV, especially type 16, in the pathogenesis of OPSCC is explored, highlighting the virus's ability to integrate into the host genome and express oncoproteins E6 and E7, leading to tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the review delves into the mechanisms of immune escape employed by HPV-related OPSCC, including the downregulation of antigen presentation and the creation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic strategies. The review also discusses the implications of HPV status on prognosis and treatment outcomes, emphasizing the need for HPV testing in the diagnostic workup of OPSCC to guide personalized treatment approaches.", "label": 1}
