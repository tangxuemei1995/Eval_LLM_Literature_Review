{"grounding": "Metastatic dissemination has lethal consequences for cancer patients. Accruing evidence supports the hypothesis that tumor cells can migrate and metastasize as clusters of cells while maintaining contacts with one another. Collective metastasis enables tumor cells to colonize secondary sites more efficiently, resist cell death, and evade the immune system. On the other hand, tumor cell clusters face unique challenges for dissemination particularly during systemic dissemination. Here, we review recent progress toward understanding how tumor cell clusters overcome these disadvantages as well as mechanisms they utilize to gain advantages throughout the metastatic process. We consider useful models for studying collective metastasis and reflect on how the study of collective metastasis suggests new opportunities for eradicating and preventing metastatic disease.", "generated_text": "This study explores the orchestration of collective migration and metastasis by tumor cell clusters, a phenomenon increasingly recognized for its role in cancer progression. Focusing on the mechanisms of collective metastasis, we delve into the polyclonal seeding process, where clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) disseminate and colonize distant organs. The research highlights the significance of collective migration, emphasizing how cell-cell interactions and collective signaling pathways facilitate the survival and metastatic potential of these clusters. By integrating recent findings from in vitro and in vivo models, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular dynamics underlying the collective behavior of tumor cells. This work underscores the potential of targeting collective migration and signaling pathways as novel therapeutic strategies to combat metastasis.", "label": 1}
