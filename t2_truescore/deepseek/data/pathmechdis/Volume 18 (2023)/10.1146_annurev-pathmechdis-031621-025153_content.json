{"grounding": "African trypanosomes are bloodstream protozoan parasites that infect mammals including humans, where they cause sleeping sickness. Long-lasting infection is required to favor parasite transmission between hosts. Therefore, trypanosomes have developed strategies to continuously escape innate and adaptive responses of the immune system, while also preventing premature death of the host. The pathology linked to infection mainly results from inflammation and includes anemia and brain dysfunction in addition to loss of specificity and memory of the antibody response. The serum of humans contains an efficient trypanolytic factor, the membrane pore-forming protein apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). In the two human-infective trypanosomes, specific parasite resistance factors inhibit APOL1 activity. In turn, many African individuals express APOL1 variants that counteract these resistance factors, enabling them to avoid sleeping sickness. However, these variants are associated with chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of virus-induced inflammation such as coronavirus disease 2019. Vaccination perspectives are discussed.", "generated_text": "African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a life-threatening disease caused by the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The pathogenesis of this disease is complex, involving intricate interactions between the parasite and the host immune system. A key feature of African trypanosomes is their ability to undergo antigenic variation, primarily through the expression of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs), which allows them to evade the host's immune response. This mechanism of immune evasion is central to the parasite's survival and the chronic nature of the disease. Additionally, the role of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) in human innate immunity against trypanosomes has been highlighted, with certain APOL1 variants conferring resistance to T. b. rhodesiense infection. However, these same variants are associated with an increased risk of kidney disease in individuals of African descent, illustrating a complex interplay between pathogen resistance and disease susceptibility. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of African trypanosomiasis is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies and vaccines.", "label": 1}
