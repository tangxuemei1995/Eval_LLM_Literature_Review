{"grounding": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging virus from the Flaviviridae family that is transmitted to humans by mosquito vectors and represents an important health problem. Infections in pregnant women are of major concern because of potential devastating consequences during pregnancy and have been associated with microcephaly in newborns. ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis. We discuss recent reports on the mechanisms used by ZIKV to replicate efficiently, and we highlight potential new areas of research for the development of therapeutic approaches.", "generated_text": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, has emerged as a significant public health concern due to its association with severe neurological disorders. This review delves into the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection, focusing on its cellular tropism and the mechanisms by which it evades host immune responses. ZIKV exhibits a broad tropism, infecting various cell types including neural progenitor cells, leading to neurodevelopmental defects. A key aspect of ZIKV pathogenesis is its interaction with the host ubiquitin system, particularly the role of TRIM7, a ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in the antiviral response. ZIKV has developed strategies to antagonize immune responses, including the inhibition of type I interferon signaling, which is crucial for the host's antiviral defense. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV pathogenesis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies and vaccines to combat this emerging viral threat.", "label": 1}
