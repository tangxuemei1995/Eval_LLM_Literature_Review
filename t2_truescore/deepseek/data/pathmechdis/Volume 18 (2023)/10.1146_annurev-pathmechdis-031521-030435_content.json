{"grounding": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one of the major diseases arising from chronic alcohol consumption and is one of the most common causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality. ALD includes asymptomatic liver steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and alcohol-associated hepatitis and its complications. The progression of ALD involves complex cell-cell and organ-organ interactions. We focus on the impact of alcohol on dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms and regulation of injury and repair in the liver. In particular, we discuss recent advances in understanding the disruption of balance between programmed cell death and prosurvival pathways, such as autophagy and membrane trafficking, in the pathogenesis of ALD. We also summarize current understanding of innate immune responses, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction and hepatic stellate cell activation, and gut-liver and adipose-liver cross talk in response to ethanol. In addition,we describe the current potential therapeutic targets and clinical trials aimed at alleviating hepatocyte injury, reducing inflammatory responses, and targeting gut microbiota, for the treatment of ALD.", "generated_text": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) represents a spectrum of liver injuries caused by chronic alcohol consumption, ranging from simple steatosis to more severe forms such as alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Recent advances have significantly enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of ALD, highlighting the critical roles of programmed cell death (PCD), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the complement system, and the gut-liver axis. PCD mechanisms, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, have been implicated in the progression of liver damage, offering potential therapeutic targets. PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors, recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns, initiating inflammatory responses that contribute to liver injury. The complement system, a key component of innate immunity, has been shown to exacerbate liver inflammation and fibrosis in ALD. Furthermore, the gut-liver axis, emphasizing the interplay between gut microbiota, intestinal barrier integrity, and liver health, has emerged as a pivotal factor in ALD pathogenesis. These insights pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the burden of ALD.", "label": 1}
