{"grounding": "Despite the advent of sophisticated and efficient new biologics to treat inflammation in asthma, the disease persists. Even following treatment, many patients still experience the well-known symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. What are we missing? Here we examine the evidence that mucus plugs contribute to a substantial portion of disease, not only by physically obstructing the airways but also by perpetuating inflammation. In this way, mucus plugs may act as an immunogenic stimulus even in the absence of allergen or with the use of current therapeutics. The alterations of several parameters of mucus biology, driven by type 2 inflammation, result in sticky and tenacious sputum, which represents a potent threat, first due to the difficulties in expectoration and second by acting as a platform for viral, bacterial, or fungal colonization that allows exacerbations. Therefore, in this way, mucus plugs are an overlooked but critical feature of asthmatic airway disease.", "generated_text": "Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, is characterized by variable airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and underlying inflammation. Despite advances in understanding its pathophysiology, the role of mucus and airway obstruction remains a critical area of investigation. This review focuses on the pathological mechanisms contributing to airway obstruction in asthma, with particular emphasis on the role of mucus hypersecretion and the involvement of galectin-10 and neutrophils. Galectin-10, a protein associated with Charcot-Leyden crystals, has been implicated in the inflammatory processes of asthma, while neutrophils contribute to the persistence of inflammation and tissue damage. The interplay between these elements and their impact on airway obstruction is explored, highlighting the challenges in targeting these pathways for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the complex pathology of asthma, including the roles of mucus, galectin-10, and neutrophils, is essential for developing more effective treatments and improving patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
