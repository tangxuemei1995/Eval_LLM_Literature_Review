{"grounding": "Among human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-associated disorders, celiac disease has an immunopathogenesis that is particularly well understood. The condition is characterized by hypersensitivity to cereal gluten proteins, and the disease lesion is localized in the gut. Still, the diagnosis can be made by detection of highly disease-specific autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 in the blood. We now have mechanistic insights into how the disease-predisposing HLA-DQ molecules, via presentation of posttranslationally modified gluten peptides, are connected to the generation of these autoantibodies. This review presents our current understanding of the immunobiology of this common disorder that is positioned in the border zone between food hypersensitivity and autoimmunity.", "generated_text": "Celiac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, characterized by a specific immune response against self-antigens. This review delves into the immunobiology and pathogenesis of CD, highlighting the critical roles of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules in presenting gluten peptides to T cells, initiating an autoimmune cascade. The involvement of B cells in producing autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2, a key enzyme in the disease process, is also explored. Understanding the intricate interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and immune dysregulation offers insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for managing this prevalent autoimmune condition.", "label": 1}
