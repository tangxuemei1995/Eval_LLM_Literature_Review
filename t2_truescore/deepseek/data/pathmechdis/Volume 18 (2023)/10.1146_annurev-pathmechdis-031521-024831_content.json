{"grounding": "Hepatocytes are the main workers in the hepatic factory, managing metabolism of nutrients and xenobiotics, production and recycling of proteins, and glucose and lipid homeostasis. Division of labor between hepatocytes is critical to coordinate complex complementary or opposing multistep processes, similar to distributed tasks at an assembly line. This so-called metabolic zonation has both spatial and temporal components. Spatial distribution of metabolic function in hepatocytes of different lobular zones is necessary to perform complex sequential multistep metabolic processes and to assign metabolic tasks to the right environment. Moreover, temporal control of metabolic processes is critical to align required metabolic processes to the feeding and fasting cycles. Disruption of this complex spatiotemporal hepatic organization impairs key metabolic processes with both local and systemic consequences. Many metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetes, are associated with impaired metabolic liver zonation. Recent technological advances shed new light on the spatiotemporal gene expression networks controlling liver function and how their deregulation may be involved in a large variety of diseases. We summarize the current knowledge about spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and consequences on liver pathobiology.", "generated_text": "The liver exhibits a remarkable spatiotemporal organization, with metabolic functions distributed across its lobular architecture in a process known as liver zonation. This intricate spatial arrangement is crucial for the organ's diverse roles in metabolism, detoxification, and homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the influence of circadian rhythms on liver zonation, suggesting a temporal layer to this spatial organization that affects hepatic function and disease. The WNT signaling pathway has emerged as a key regulator of zonation, orchestrating the expression of metabolic enzymes in a gradient-dependent manner. Disruptions in this zonation pattern are implicated in various liver pathologies, including monogenic liver diseases and broader liver pathophysiology. Understanding the mechanisms underlying liver zonation and its circadian regulation offers new insights into liver pathology and opens avenues for therapeutic interventions. Chronopharmacology, the study of how the timing of drug administration affects efficacy and toxicity, is particularly relevant in this context, as it leverages the temporal aspects of liver function to optimize treatment strategies. This review explores the current understanding of spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation, its regulatory mechanisms, and its implications for liver health and disease.", "label": 1}
