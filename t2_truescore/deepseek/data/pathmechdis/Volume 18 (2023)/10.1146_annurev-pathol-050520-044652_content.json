{"grounding": "Molecular monitoring of tumor-derived alterations has an established role in the surveillance of leukemias, and emerging nucleic acid sequencing technologies are likely to similarly transform the clinical management of lymphomas. Lymphomas are well suited for molecular surveillance due to relatively high cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA concentrations, high somatic mutational burden, and the existence of stereotyped variants enabling focused interrogation of recurrently altered regions. Here, we review the clinical scenarios and key technologies applicable for the molecular monitoring of lymphomas, summarizing current evidence in the literature regarding molecular subtyping and classification, evaluation of treatment response, the surveillance of active cellular therapies, and emerging clinical trial strategies.", "generated_text": "Lymphomas, a diverse group of malignancies originating from lymphocytes, present significant challenges in monitoring and treatment response assessment. The advent of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis through next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the molecular monitoring of lymphomas, offering a non-invasive, sensitive, and specific method for detecting measurable residual disease (MRD). This approach enables real-time insights into tumor dynamics, facilitating early detection of relapse and assessment of therapeutic efficacy. By leveraging ctDNA, clinicians can tailor treatment strategies more precisely, potentially improving patient outcomes. This review highlights the transformative impact of ctDNA-based MRD monitoring in lymphoma management, underscoring its role in advancing personalized medicine and enhancing our understanding of lymphoma biology.", "label": 0}
