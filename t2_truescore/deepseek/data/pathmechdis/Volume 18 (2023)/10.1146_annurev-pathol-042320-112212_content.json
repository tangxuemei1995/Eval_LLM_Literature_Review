{"grounding": "Tuft cells are found in tissues with distinct stem cell compartments, tissue architecture, and luminal exposures but converge on a shared transcriptional program, including expression of taste transduction signaling pathways. Here, we summarize seminal and recent findings on tuft cells, focusing on major categories of function—instigation of type 2 cytokine responses, orchestration of antimicrobial responses, and emerging roles in tissue repair—and describe tuft cell–derived molecules used to affect these functional programs. We review what is known about the development of tuft cells from epithelial progenitors under homeostatic conditions and during disease. Finally, we discuss evidence that immature, or nascent, tuft cells with potential for diverse functions are driven toward dominant effector programs by tissue- or perturbation-specific contextual cues, which may result in heterogeneous mature tuft cell phenotypes both within and between tissues.", "generated_text": "Tuft cells, a conserved chemosensory lineage, play pivotal roles in mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis through context- and tissue-specific programming. These cells are characterized by their unique expression of type II taste transduction components, enabling them to detect and respond to environmental cues. In the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, tuft cells contribute to mucociliary clearance and host defense by secreting acetylcholine and cysteinyl leukotrienes, which modulate immune responses and epithelial function. Notably, tuft cells are integral to type 2 immunity, orchestrating responses to parasitic infections and allergens through the release of interleukin-25 (IL-25). This cytokine activates innate lymphoid cells, driving protective and pathological immune reactions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying tuft cell function across different tissues offers insights into their dual roles in health and disease, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets in inflammatory and infectious conditions.", "label": 1}
