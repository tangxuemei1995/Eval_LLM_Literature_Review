{"Abstract": "This study revisits the anthropological understanding of masculinity, addressing the often overlooked aspects of men's experiences in gender studies. By examining masculinity through an intersectional lens, we explore how various cultural, social, and economic factors shape male identities and behaviors across diverse societies. The research draws on ethnographic data from multiple cultural contexts to analyze how masculinity intersects with sexuality, power dynamics, and social inequalities. We argue that contemporary masculinities are undergoing significant transformations in response to global shifts in gender norms and socioeconomic conditions. The findings reveal the complex and sometimes contradictory ways in which men negotiate their identities, challenging essentialist notions of masculinity. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on men and masculinities, offering new insights into the processes of gender construction and the potential for positive change in gender relations."}
