{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate relationship between environmental factors, epigenetic mechanisms, and the rate of human aging. Recent advances in epigenetic research have revealed that environmental exposures can significantly influence the epigenome, potentially altering the pace of biological aging. We discuss the concept of the epigenetic clock as a measure of biological age and its potential as a biomarker for age-related diseases. The review examines various environmental factors, including diet, physical activity, stress, and pollutants, and their impact on epigenetic modifications associated with aging. We also consider the implications of these findings for understanding individual variations in aging trajectories and the development of age-related diseases. Finally, we highlight the potential for targeted interventions aimed at modifying epigenetic patterns to slow the aging process and improve healthspan, opening new avenues for personalized medicine and preventive healthcare strategies."}
