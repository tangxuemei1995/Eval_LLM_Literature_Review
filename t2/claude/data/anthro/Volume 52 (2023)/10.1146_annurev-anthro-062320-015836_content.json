{"Abstract": "This paper presents an autobiographical reflection on a career spanning decades in European Neolithic archaeology, digital archaeology, and the history of archaeology. The author examines the evolution of their research interests and methodological approaches, highlighting the significant influences and inspirations that shaped their academic journey. The narrative explores the author's engagement with feminist practices in archaeology, the development of digital tools and techniques, and the application of middle-range research strategies in prehistoric studies. By tracing the shifts and pivots in their standpoints over time, the author demonstrates how personal experiences, intellectual encounters, and changing theoretical paradigms have contributed to their understanding and construction of the past. This introspective account not only provides insights into the author's professional growth but also offers a unique perspective on the broader transformations within archaeological practice and theory over the past several decades, particularly in the context of European prehistory and the emerging field of digital archaeology."}
