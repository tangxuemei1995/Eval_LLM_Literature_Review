{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex interplay between social movements, power dynamics, and mediated visibility in the digital age. By analyzing the role of visual media in shaping public perception and mobilizing support, we explore how social movements navigate the challenges posed by state actors and corporate interests. The research investigates the impact of technological advancements on activism, highlighting the ways in which social media platforms both empower and constrain grassroots organizations. Through case studies and comparative analysis, we demonstrate how the struggle for visibility in the digital realm has become a crucial aspect of contemporary social movements, influencing their strategies, outcomes, and relationships with established power structures."}
