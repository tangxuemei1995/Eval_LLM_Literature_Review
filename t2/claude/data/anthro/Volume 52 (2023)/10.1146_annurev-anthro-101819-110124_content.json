{"Abstract": "This paper examines recent archaeological discoveries and methodological advances in the study of long-distance connections across the ancient Indian Ocean. Focusing on South Asia's maritime networks, we analyze new evidence from beads and ceramics to reconstruct patterns of trade and cultural exchange. Recent excavations at coastal sites in India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia have yielded significant assemblages of imported goods, providing insights into the extent and nature of these connections. Advanced analytical techniques, such as isotope analysis and ceramic petrography, have enhanced our understanding of production centers and trade routes. The paper also explores the role of intermediary ports and the impact of monsoon patterns on maritime activities. These findings contribute to a more nuanced comprehension of the complex socio-economic relationships that characterized the ancient Indian Ocean world, challenging previous assumptions about the scale and intensity of long-distance exchange in this region."}
