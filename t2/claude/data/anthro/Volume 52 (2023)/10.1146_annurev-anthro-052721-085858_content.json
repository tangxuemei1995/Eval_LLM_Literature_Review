{"Abstract": "This study examines human physiological and metabolic adaptations to extreme environments, focusing on thermoregulation in response to climate change. We analyze data from diverse populations exposed to extreme heat, cold, and altitude, investigating the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Our findings reveal significant variations in metabolic efficiency and thermoregulatory mechanisms across different groups, highlighting the human body's remarkable adaptability. However, we also uncover concerning disparities in adaptation capabilities linked to structural inequalities, such as access to resources and healthcare. These results underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions and policy measures to address the disproportionate impact of extreme environments on vulnerable populations. This research contributes to our understanding of human resilience and informs strategies for mitigating the health effects of climate change."}
