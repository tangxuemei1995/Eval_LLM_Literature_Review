{"Abstract": "This study examines the invisible labor and ethical considerations of interpreters within the context of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews with professional interpreters, we explore the complex role of these linguistic mediators in facilitating cross-cultural communication. Our findings reveal that interpreters often engage in unrecognized emotional and cognitive labor, navigating cultural nuances and power dynamics while striving to maintain neutrality. We argue that the invisibility of interpreters' work in global capitalist systems and humanitarian contexts raises significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding voice, agency, and representation. The study highlights the need for greater recognition of interpreters' contributions and the development of ethical frameworks that address the unique challenges they face. By shedding light on these hidden aspects of interpretation, we contribute to ongoing discussions about language, power, and ethics in an increasingly interconnected world."}
