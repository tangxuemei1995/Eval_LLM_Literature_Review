{"Abstract": "The Pirahã language, spoken by an indigenous Amazonian group, has sparked a heated debate in linguistic anthropology and cognitive science. This controversy centers on the language's purported lack of recursion, a feature long considered universal in human languages. The 'Great Pirahã Brouhaha' challenges Chomsky's theory of universal grammar and the innate language faculty, while highlighting the importance of linguistic diversity. This paper examines the implications of the Pirahã case for our understanding of language universals, cognitive processes, and the nature of human communication. By analyzing conflicting interpretations of Pirahã data and situating the debate within broader discussions of linguistic relativity, we explore how this single case study has far-reaching consequences for theories of language acquisition, evolution, and the relationship between language and thought. The Pirahã controversy underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches in studying the world's endangered indigenous languages and their unique contributions to our knowledge of human cognition."}
