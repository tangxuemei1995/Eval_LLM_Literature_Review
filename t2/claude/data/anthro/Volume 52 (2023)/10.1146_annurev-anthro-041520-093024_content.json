{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines dominant approaches to global health interventions, focusing on the military, 'magic bullet', and deterministic models. Drawing on anthropological perspectives and postcolonial theory, it analyzes the historical roots and contemporary manifestations of these intervention paradigms in global public health and medicine. The study argues that these approaches often perpetuate colonial power dynamics and oversimplify complex health challenges in diverse cultural contexts. By exploring case studies of health care aid initiatives, the research highlights the limitations of narrowly focused, top-down interventions. The paper proposes alternative frameworks that emphasize local knowledge, cultural sensitivity, and holistic understandings of health determinants. It concludes by advocating for more nuanced, context-specific approaches to global health interventions that address the broader socioeconomic and political factors influencing health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries."}
