{"Abstract": "This article examines the intersections of security regimes, empire, and transnational power dynamics through the lenses of race and gender. Drawing on political anthropology and transnational feminist perspectives, we analyze how imperial legacies shape contemporary security practices and discourses. The study explores how racialized and gendered narratives inform security policies, surveillance mechanisms, and border control strategies across different geopolitical contexts. By investigating the transnational and imperial entanglements of security regimes, we reveal the complex power relations that underpin global security frameworks. Our findings highlight the ways in which security apparatuses perpetuate historical inequalities and reinforce existing hierarchies of race and gender. This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of security regimes, emphasizing the need for critical approaches that address the intersectional nature of security challenges in a post-colonial world."}
