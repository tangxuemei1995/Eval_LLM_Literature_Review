{"Abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in shaping our physiology, metabolism, and immune function. This review explores the intricate relationships between gut microbial communities, human ecology, and evolutionary processes. We examine how environmental factors, dietary patterns, and lifestyle choices influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Additionally, we investigate the bidirectional interactions between host genetics and microbial populations, highlighting their impact on phenotypic variation and health outcomes. Drawing comparisons with nonhuman primates, we discuss the evolutionary trajectories of host-microbial symbiosis and their implications for human adaptation. Our findings underscore the importance of considering the gut microbiome as a key factor in understanding human ecology and evolution, offering new perspectives on the complex interplay between microbial communities and their hosts in shaping our species' past, present, and future."}
