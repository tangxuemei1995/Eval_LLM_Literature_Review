{"Abstract": "Water insecurity, a growing global concern exacerbated by climate change, has profound implications for human biology. This review explores the intricate relationship between water needs, water insecurity, and physiological responses in human populations. We examine the biological mechanisms of hydration and thirst, and how these are affected by chronic water scarcity. The paper investigates various coping strategies employed by water-insecure communities and their impact on health outcomes. Furthermore, we analyze the concept of embodiment in relation to water insecurity, considering how sociocultural and environmental factors shape biological responses to water stress. The review also addresses the long-term consequences of water insecurity on human growth, development, and overall well-being. By synthesizing current research, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological dimensions of water insecurity and highlight areas for future interdisciplinary research to inform policy and intervention strategies."}
