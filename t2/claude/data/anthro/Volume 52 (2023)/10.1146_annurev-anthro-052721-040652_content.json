{"Abstract": "This paper examines the ongoing process of decolonizing museums, focusing on the paradigm shift necessary to address historical injustices and promote indigenous representation. Drawing on Native American scholarship and contemporary museum practices, the study explores strategies for indigenization and the reimagining of cultural institutions. The research highlights the importance of collaborative approaches, shared authority, and the integration of indigenous knowledge systems in curatorial practices. By analyzing case studies of successful decolonization efforts, the paper identifies key challenges and opportunities in transforming museum spaces. The findings suggest that meaningful decolonization requires a fundamental reevaluation of institutional power structures, collection policies, and interpretive frameworks. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on museum decolonization and offers practical recommendations for institutions seeking to engage in more equitable and inclusive practices."}
