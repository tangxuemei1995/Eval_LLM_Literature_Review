{"Abstract": "This paper explores the concept of biological normalcy in human populations, examining the intersection of biological variation, cultural norms, and statistical measures. We investigate how normative views of human biology are shaped by societal expectations and scientific understanding. The study analyzes diverse data sets to quantify the range of biological variation across different populations and traits. We critically evaluate the use of statistical measures, such as means and standard deviations, in defining biological normalcy. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between perceived norms and actual biological diversity, highlighting the influence of cultural factors on interpretations of human biology. We argue for a more nuanced approach to defining biological normalcy that acknowledges both statistical trends and the inherent variability of human traits. This research contributes to ongoing discussions about diversity, inclusion, and the social construction of biological norms."}
