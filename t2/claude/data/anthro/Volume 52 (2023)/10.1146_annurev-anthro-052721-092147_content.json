{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of linguistic anthropology and visual culture, examining how images function as semiotic resources within social and cultural contexts. Drawing on theories of entextualization, performativity, and enregisterment, we analyze the ways in which images are imbued with meaning, circulated, and interpreted across diverse communicative settings. Through ethnographic fieldwork and multimodal discourse analysis, we investigate how visual elements interact with linguistic practices to construct and negotiate social identities, ideologies, and power relations. Our findings reveal the complex processes through which images become entextualized, performatively enacted, and enregistered within specific cultural frameworks. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of visual communication in shaping social realities and offers new insights into the application of linguistic anthropological concepts to the study of images."}
