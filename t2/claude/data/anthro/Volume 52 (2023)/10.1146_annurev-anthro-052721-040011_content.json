{"Abstract": "This article examines the emerging field of Critical University Studies (CUS) and its intersections with higher education, decolonization, abolition, and Black studies. CUS challenges traditional approaches to understanding universities by critically analyzing power structures, institutional practices, and historical legacies that shape contemporary higher education. The study explores how CUS engages with decolonial perspectives to interrogate the Eurocentric foundations of academia and advocates for the inclusion of marginalized knowledge systems. Additionally, it investigates the role of abolitionist frameworks in reimagining university structures and practices. The article highlights the significant contributions of Black studies to CUS, emphasizing the importance of centering Black experiences and knowledge in critiquing and transforming higher education. By synthesizing these interconnected themes, this research contributes to ongoing discussions about the future of universities and their potential for fostering social justice and equity."}
