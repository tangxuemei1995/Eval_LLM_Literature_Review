{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the historical perception of Neandertals in scientific discourse and popular culture, exploring the intersection of paleoanthropology, race theory, and cognitive archaeology. We analyze how early misconceptions about Neandertal intelligence and behavior were rooted in racist ideologies of the 19th and early 20th centuries. By reviewing recent archaeological evidence of Neandertal symbolic behavior, we challenge long-held assumptions about their cognitive capabilities. The concept of the 'uncanny valley' is applied to understand modern humans' psychological responses to Neandertal reconstructions and their implications for public engagement with human evolution. This interdisciplinary approach reveals how scientific interpretations of Neandertals have been shaped by cultural biases and how new evidence is transforming our understanding of human cognitive evolution. We argue for a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to studying our extinct hominin relatives, free from the prejudices of the past."}
