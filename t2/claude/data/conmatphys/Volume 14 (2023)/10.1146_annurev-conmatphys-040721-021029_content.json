{"Abstract": "This review explores generalized symmetries in condensed matter systems, focusing on their role in quantum phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking. We examine low-energy effective field theories and their applications in understanding exotic quantum states, providing insights into the fundamental nature of symmetry in quantum matter."}
