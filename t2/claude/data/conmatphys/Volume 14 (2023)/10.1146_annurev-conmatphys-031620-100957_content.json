{"Abstract": "This study presents a data-driven approach for the discovery of robust materials for photocatalytic energy conversion. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and high-throughput computational screening, we systematically explored a vast chemical space to identify promising photocatalysts with enhanced stability and efficiency. Our methodology integrates experimental data, theoretical calculations, and predictive models to evaluate key properties such as band gap, aqueous stability, and photocatalytic activity. We developed a novel descriptor-based framework that enables rapid assessment of candidate materials, significantly accelerating the discovery process. Our findings reveal several previously unexplored classes of materials with exceptional potential for photocatalytic energy conversion applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability and transferability of our approach, paving the way for future advancements in renewable energy technologies. This work highlights the power of data-driven strategies in materials discovery and offers new insights into the design principles for robust and efficient photocatalysts."}
