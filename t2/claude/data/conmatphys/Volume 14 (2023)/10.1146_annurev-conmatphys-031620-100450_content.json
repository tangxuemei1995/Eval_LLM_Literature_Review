{"Abstract": "This study explores the physics of human crowds, examining their dynamics through the lens of active matter and social physics. We investigate emergent phenomena in pedestrian flows using observational experiments. Our findings reveal complex patterns of self-organization and collective behavior, shedding light on the fundamental principles governing crowd dynamics. This research contributes to our understanding of human social systems and has implications for crowd management and urban planning."}
