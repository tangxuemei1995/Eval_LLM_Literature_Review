{"Abstract": "The study of Fermi surfaces in topological metals has emerged as a crucial area of research in condensed matter physics, offering insights into the interplay between electronic structure and topological properties. This review explores the fermiology of topological metals, focusing on the unique characteristics of their Fermi surfaces and the associated quantum phenomena. We discuss the role of Berry phase in shaping the electronic properties of these materials and its manifestation in quantum oscillation experiments. The geometry and topology of Fermi surfaces in various classes of topological metals, including Dirac and Weyl semimetals, are examined in detail. We highlight the importance of magnetic breakdown in probing the intricate structure of these surfaces and its implications for understanding the underlying band structure. The review also covers recent experimental advances in mapping Fermi surfaces of topological metals using techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillation measurements. Furthermore, we explore the theoretical frameworks developed to describe the complex Fermi surface geometries in these materials and their connection to observable physical properties. This comprehensive overview provides a foundation for understanding the rich physics of topological metals and paves the way for future investigations into novel quantum states and potential technological applications."}
