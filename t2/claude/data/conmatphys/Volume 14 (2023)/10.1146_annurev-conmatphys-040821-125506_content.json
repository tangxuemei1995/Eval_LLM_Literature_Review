{"Abstract": "This study explores the novel concepts of odd viscosity and odd elasticity in continuum mechanics, with a focus on their applications in fluid mechanics and active matter systems. We investigate the emergence of these unconventional properties in nonequilibrium systems and their impact on hydrodynamic behavior. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate how odd viscosity and odd elasticity lead to unique rheological responses and flow patterns that deviate from traditional fluid dynamics. Our findings reveal the importance of these odd transport coefficients in describing the complex behavior of active fluids and soft materials. This work contributes to the growing field of nonequilibrium physics and provides new insights into the fundamental principles governing the mechanics of active matter systems."}
