{"Abstract": "Random quantum circuits have emerged as powerful tools for studying fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and developing quantum technologies. This review explores recent advances in the field, focusing on their applications in probing entanglement, nonequilibrium dynamics, and quantum chaos. We discuss how random circuits serve as effective models for quantum simulators, enabling the investigation of complex quantum systems that are challenging to study analytically or simulate classically. The role of quantum measurements in random circuits is examined, highlighting their impact on entanglement dynamics and information scrambling. Furthermore, we analyze the connections between random quantum circuits and quantum chaos, shedding light on the nature of quantum information propagation and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. This work synthesizes theoretical developments and experimental implementations, providing insights into the potential of random quantum circuits for advancing our understanding of quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing."}
