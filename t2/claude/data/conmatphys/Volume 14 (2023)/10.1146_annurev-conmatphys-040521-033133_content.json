{"Abstract": "This review explores the rapidly evolving field of non-Hermitian topological phenomena, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian physics and topological phases of matter. We discuss the unique features of non-Hermitian systems, including exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, and their impact on topological properties. The breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian settings is examined, along with proposed generalizations. We survey recent theoretical advances in spectral theory applied to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and their topological classifications. Experimental realizations in photonic, acoustic, and mechanical systems are highlighted, demonstrating the practical significance of these concepts. Finally, we outline open questions and potential future directions in this interdisciplinary field, emphasizing its implications for fundamental physics and technological applications."}
