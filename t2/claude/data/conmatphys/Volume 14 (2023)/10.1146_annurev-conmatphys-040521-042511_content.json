{"Abstract": "This study investigates the interplay between superconductivity and local inversion-symmetry breaking in crystalline materials. We explore how the absence of inversion symmetry at atomic sites, coupled with strong spin-orbit interactions, can lead to unconventional superconducting states. Our theoretical analysis reveals that Rashba spin-orbit coupling, induced by local inversion-symmetry breaking, plays a crucial role in generating topological superconductivity. We demonstrate that hidden spin polarization, a consequence of site-specific symmetry breaking, can significantly influence the superconducting order parameter. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we predict novel superconducting phases and identify potential materials for experimental realization. Our findings provide new insights into the fundamental relationship between crystal symmetry and exotic superconducting states, paving the way for the design of topological superconductors with enhanced functionality for quantum computing applications."}
