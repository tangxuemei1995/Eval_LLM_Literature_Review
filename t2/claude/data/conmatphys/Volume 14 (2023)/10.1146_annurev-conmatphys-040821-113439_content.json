{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of learning in physical systems without traditional neural networks. We investigate how principles of physical learning can be applied to various domains, including metamaterials, self-assembly, and molecular computing. By leveraging inverse design techniques and machine learning algorithms, we demonstrate that non-neural physical systems can exhibit learning behaviors comparable to those of conventional neural networks. Our research focuses on developing a unified learning theory for physical systems, encompassing both natural and artificial structures. We present experimental results showcasing the potential of physical learning in diverse applications, such as adaptive metamaterials and self-organizing molecular systems. This work provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying learning in non-neural contexts and opens new avenues for designing intelligent materials and computing systems that harness the inherent learning capabilities of physical phenomena."}
