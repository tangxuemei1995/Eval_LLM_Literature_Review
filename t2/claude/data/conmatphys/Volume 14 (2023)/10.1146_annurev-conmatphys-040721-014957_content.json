{"Abstract": "The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating various phenomena in solid-state physics. This review explores the SSE's role as a sensitive probe for elementary excitations, spin correlations, transport mechanisms, magnetic order, and domain structures in solids. We discuss its applications in spintronics and antiferromagnetic spintronics, highlighting the interplay with the inverse spin Hall effect. The SSE's ability to detect and manipulate magnons, nuclear spins, and quantum spin liquid states is examined, revealing its potential for advancing our understanding of complex magnetic systems. Furthermore, we analyze the SSE's sensitivity to magnetic domain dynamics and its implications for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena. This comprehensive overview demonstrates the SSE's versatility as a non-invasive technique for probing fundamental properties of magnetic materials, paving the way for novel applications in quantum technologies and beyond."}
