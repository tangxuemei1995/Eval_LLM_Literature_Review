{"Abstract": "This review explores the modeling of active colloids, ranging from simple active Brownian particle models to complex hydrodynamic and chemical field descriptions. We discuss various numerical approaches used to simulate microswimmers, including their interactions with complex environments and each other. The review covers recent advancements in modeling active baths and active engines, highlighting the importance of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions in these systems. We examine the challenges and opportunities in simulating large-scale collective behavior of active colloids, emphasizing the need for multiscale modeling techniques. The paper also addresses the role of external fields and confinement in shaping the dynamics of active colloids. Finally, we provide insights into future directions for numerical modeling of active matter systems and their potential applications in various fields."}
