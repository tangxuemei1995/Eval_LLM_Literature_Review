{"Abstract": "Quantum many-body scars have emerged as a fascinating phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, challenging the conventional understanding of eigenstate thermalization. This study presents a novel quasiparticle perspective on quantum many-body scars, offering insights into their underlying mechanisms. By analyzing constrained dynamics in various quantum systems, we demonstrate how quasiparticles can give rise to non-thermalizing behavior and long-lived coherent oscillations. Our approach provides a unified framework for understanding scarred eigenstates and their stability across different models. We explore the connections between quantum chaos, localization, and the emergence of scars, shedding light on the interplay between these phenomena. Our findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on non-ergodic quantum systems and have potential implications for quantum information processing and the design of novel quantum materials."}
