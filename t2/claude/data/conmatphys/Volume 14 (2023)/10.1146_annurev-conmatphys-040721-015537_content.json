{"Abstract": "This study investigates Floquet states in open quantum systems, bridging the gap between periodically driven systems and nonequilibrium statistical physics. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the dynamics of quantum systems subject to both periodic driving and environmental interactions. Our approach combines Floquet theory with open quantum system techniques, revealing novel phenomena such as dissipation-induced topological phase transitions and non-trivial steady states. We demonstrate that the interplay between driving and dissipation leads to unique spectral properties and long-lived coherences. Furthermore, we explore the implications for quantum thermodynamics and propose experimental protocols to observe these effects in engineered quantum systems. Our findings provide crucial insights into the behavior of driven-dissipative quantum systems and pave the way for new applications in quantum technologies and nonequilibrium physics."}
