{"Abstract": "The spatial and temporal organization of chromatin plays a crucial role in gene regulation and cellular function. This review explores the multiscale nature of chromatin structure, from nucleosome positioning to higher-order chromatin loops. We discuss recent advances in understanding DNA-protein interactions, nucleosome dynamics, and the role of epigenetic modifications in shaping local chromatin architecture. Additionally, we examine the mechanisms of loop extrusion and its impact on large-scale chromatin organization. The interplay between these small and large-scale structures is analyzed, revealing how changes at one level can propagate to affect the entire chromatin landscape. Finally, we highlight the implications of chromatin organization for gene expression, DNA replication, and cellular differentiation, emphasizing the importance of this field for understanding fundamental biological processes."}
