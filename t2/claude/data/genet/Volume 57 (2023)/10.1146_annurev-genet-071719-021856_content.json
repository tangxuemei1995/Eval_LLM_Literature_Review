{"Abstract": "RNA repair mechanisms, once thought to be rare, are increasingly recognized as crucial components of cellular RNA metabolism. This review explores the emerging field of RNA repair, focusing on tRNA restriction and splicing processes. We examine the intricate mechanisms of end healing and end sealing, highlighting the roles of key enzymes such as polynucleotide kinaseâ€“phosphatase and RNA ligase. Recent discoveries in enzyme function and substrate specificity have shed light on the complexity and diversity of RNA repair pathways. We discuss how these repair mechanisms contribute to maintaining RNA integrity and regulating gene expression. Furthermore, we explore the potential implications of RNA repair in various biological contexts, including stress response and disease pathogenesis. This review underscores the importance of continued research in this field, as understanding RNA repair mechanisms may lead to novel therapeutic strategies and biotechnological applications."}
