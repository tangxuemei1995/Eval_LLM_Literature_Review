{"Abstract": "The precise regulation of developmental rate is crucial for proper embryogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This review explores the concept of the 'clockwork embryo,' examining the intricate interplay of biological clocks and developmental processes that govern the timing of embryonic events. We synthesize recent findings in developmental biology that shed light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling developmental rate across various model organisms. Key topics include the role of oscillatory gene expression, cell cycle regulation, and metabolic cues in pacing embryonic development. We also discuss the importance of species-specific developmental timers and their evolutionary significance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging technologies, such as real-time imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, that are advancing our understanding of temporal control in embryogenesis. By integrating these diverse lines of evidence, we propose a unified framework for conceptualizing the regulation of developmental time and identify critical areas for future research in this rapidly evolving field."}
