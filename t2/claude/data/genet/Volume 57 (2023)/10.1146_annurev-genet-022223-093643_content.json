{"Abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play crucial roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to pathological conditions. Recent advancements in RNA sequencing technologies have revealed unprecedented insights into microglial heterogeneity and their diverse transcriptional signatures across different CNS regions and disease states. This review synthesizes current knowledge on microglial transcriptomics, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of these cells. We discuss how distinct microglial subpopulations exhibit unique gene expression profiles that reflect their functional specialization and responsiveness to environmental cues. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these transcriptional signatures in understanding microglial function in both health and disease, including neurodegenerative disorders and neuroinflammatory conditions. By unraveling the intricate molecular landscape of microglia, this research paves the way for developing targeted therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for CNS disorders, ultimately advancing our understanding of brain function and pathology."}
