{"Abstract": "Identifying functional noncoding variants in the vast genomic landscape remains a significant challenge. This review explores innovative strategies for uncovering regulatory variants, focusing on enhancer regions and their impact on gene expression. We discuss the integration of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare-variant association tests, and machine learning approaches to prioritize candidate variants. Additionally, we examine the role of functional assays in validating predicted regulatory elements and their potential clinical implications."}
