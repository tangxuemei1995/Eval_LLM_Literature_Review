{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex relationship between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change, focusing on the impact of human activities and climate change on the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We review current literature to examine how environmental contamination with antibiotics and resistant organisms, coupled with climate-induced alterations in ecosystems, contribute to the emergence and dissemination of AMR. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic factors, including pollution and land-use changes, interact synergistically with climate change to create favorable conditions for the evolution and transmission of resistant pathogens. We highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to address this global health threat, emphasizing the importance of sustainable antibiotic use, improved waste management, and climate change mitigation strategies. This research underscores the urgency of integrating AMR considerations into environmental policies and public health initiatives to safeguard human and ecological health."}
