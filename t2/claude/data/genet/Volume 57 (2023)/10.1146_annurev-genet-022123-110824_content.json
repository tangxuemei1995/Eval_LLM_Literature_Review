{"Abstract": "Single-cell genomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, but its potential to elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits remains largely untapped. This study presents a novel approach that integrates single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility data with quantitative genetics to uncover the genetic architecture of complex traits. By analyzing diverse populations of mutants, we demonstrate how single-cell resolution can reveal cell type-specific genetic effects and identify causal variants with unprecedented precision. Our method leverages the power of population genetics to dissect the contributions of individual genes and regulatory elements to trait variation. We showcase the utility of this approach in model organisms and human populations, providing new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying complex phenotypes. This integrative framework opens new avenues for understanding the genetic basis of diseases and traits at single-cell resolution."}
