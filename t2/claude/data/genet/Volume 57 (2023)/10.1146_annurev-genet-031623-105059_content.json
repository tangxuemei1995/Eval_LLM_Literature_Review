{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential of CRISPR-based genetic biocontrol techniques for manipulating wild populations. We investigate gene drive systems, including homing-based approaches, for both population suppression and modification. Our findings reveal the efficacy and limitations of these methods in various ecological contexts, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and potential unintended consequences in real-world applications."}
