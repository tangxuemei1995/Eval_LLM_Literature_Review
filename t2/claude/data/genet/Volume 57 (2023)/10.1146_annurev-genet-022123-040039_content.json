{"Abstract": "Germline immortality, the ability of germ cells to maintain their replicative potential across generations, is a fundamental aspect of reproductive biology. This review explores the role of asymmetric stem cell division in preserving germline immortality and its implications for aging. We examine the mechanisms by which asymmetric division segregates damaged cellular components, particularly ribosomal DNA, to somatic daughter cells while maintaining the integrity of germ cells. The interplay between asymmetric division and the regulation of ribosomal DNA copy number is discussed as a potential factor in germline maintenance. Understanding these processes may provide insights into the aging process and potential interventions to promote cellular longevity in both germline and somatic tissues."}
