{"Abstract": "Transcriptionâ€“replication conflicts (TRCs) have emerged as a significant source of genome instability, with profound implications for cellular health and disease. This review explores the mechanisms underlying TRCs, focusing on the collision between the replisome and RNA polymerase complexes during simultaneous DNA replication and transcription. We discuss how TRCs can lead to replication stress, DNA damage, and genomic instability, highlighting the cellular responses and repair pathways activated to mitigate these conflicts. The review also examines the role of origin firing regulation in preventing TRCs and the consequences of persistent conflicts on gene expression and genome stability. Understanding the complex interplay between transcription and replication machineries provides crucial insights into the maintenance of genome integrity and the development of potential therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with genomic instability."}
