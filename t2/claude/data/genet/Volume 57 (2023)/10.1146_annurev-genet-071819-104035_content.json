{"Abstract": "Paramecium, a genus of ciliated protozoa, has emerged as a powerful model system for studying evolutionary cell biology and genome evolution. This review synthesizes recent advances in Paramecium genetics, genomics, and evolution, highlighting the unique features that make this organism an invaluable tool for understanding fundamental biological processes. We explore the complex genomic architecture of Paramecium, characterized by extensive gene duplication events and the presence of both micro- and macronuclei. The review delves into the mechanisms driving genome evolution in ciliates, including whole-genome duplications, gene family expansions, and the role of transposable elements. Population genomics studies have revealed insights into Paramecium's genetic diversity, adaptation, and speciation processes. We discuss how comparative genomics approaches have elucidated the evolutionary history of key cellular functions, such as ciliary motility and symbiont interactions. Furthermore, we examine the implications of Paramecium research for understanding broader evolutionary patterns in eukaryotes and the potential applications in biotechnology and environmental monitoring. This comprehensive overview underscores the significance of Paramecium as a model organism in the fields of genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology."}
