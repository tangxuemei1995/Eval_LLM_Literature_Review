{"Abstract": "Color patterns in vertebrates play crucial roles in camouflage, communication, and mate selection. This review explores the mechanisms underlying the formation and evolution of vertebrate color patterns. We examine the interplay between genetic factors, cellular processes, and environmental influences that contribute to the development of diverse pigmentation patterns. Recent advances in molecular biology and developmental genetics have revealed key signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks involved in pattern formation. We discuss how these mechanisms operate across different vertebrate taxa, highlighting both conserved and divergent features. Additionally, we consider the evolutionary forces shaping color pattern diversity, including natural and sexual selection. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the origins of biological complexity and has implications for fields such as biomimicry and conservation biology."}
