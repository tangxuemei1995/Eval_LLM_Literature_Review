{"Abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process traditionally associated with multicellular organisms. However, recent research has revealed that PCD also occurs in unicellular microorganisms, challenging our understanding of its evolutionary origins and functions. This review compares and contrasts PCD mechanisms in unicellular and multicellular organisms, exploring their similarities, differences, and potential evolutionary links. We examine the molecular pathways involved in microbial cell death, including apoptosis-like, autophagy-like, and necrosis-like processes, and discuss their roles in population dynamics, stress responses, and community interactions. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptive significance of PCD in microorganisms, considering its potential benefits in nutrient recycling, genetic diversity, and biofilm formation. By synthesizing current knowledge on PCD across diverse life forms, this review provides insights into the evolutionary conservation and divergence of cell death mechanisms, highlighting the importance of regulated cell death in all domains of life."}
