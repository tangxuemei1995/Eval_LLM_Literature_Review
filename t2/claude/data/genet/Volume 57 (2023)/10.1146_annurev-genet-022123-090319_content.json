{"Abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have revolutionized the field of disease modeling and drug discovery. This review explores the current state of iPSC technology in understanding human disease biology and its in vitro applications. We discuss the role of iPSCs in elucidating gene regulation mechanisms and genetic factors underlying various disorders. The potential of iPSC-derived organoids in recapitulating complex tissue structures and disease phenotypes is examined. We evaluate the evidence supporting the utility of iPSCs in drug screening, toxicity testing, and personalized medicine approaches. Additionally, we address the challenges and limitations of iPSC-based models, including epigenetic memory and maturation issues. Overall, this review highlights the significant impact of iPSCs on advancing our understanding of human diseases and their potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies."}
