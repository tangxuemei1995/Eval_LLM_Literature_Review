{"Abstract": "The integration of complex life cycles in comparative developmental biology offers a novel perspective on the evolution of body plans and developmental modes. This review explores how diverse life cycle strategies, particularly those involving larval stages, influence the formation and modification of head and trunk structures across animal phyla. We examine the developmental mechanisms underlying the transition from larval to adult forms, highlighting the plasticity and constraints in body plan evolution. By synthesizing recent findings from molecular, genetic, and morphological studies, we demonstrate the importance of considering entire life cycles when investigating developmental processes. This approach reveals previously overlooked connections between seemingly disparate animal groups and provides insights into the evolutionary origins of complex body plans. Our analysis underscores the significance of integrating life cycle diversity in comparative developmental biology to gain a more comprehensive understanding of animal evolution and development."}
