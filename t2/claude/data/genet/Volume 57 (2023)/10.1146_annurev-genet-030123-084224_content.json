{"Abstract": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a group of disorders characterized by dysregulation of the innate immune system. This review explores the genetic underpinnings of SAIDs, focusing on monogenic, digenic, and polygenic forms. We discuss recent advances in understanding the complex genetic architecture of these conditions, including the role of epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations. The review highlights key genes and pathways involved in SAIDs, such as those regulating inflammasome activation and cytokine signaling. Additionally, we examine how genetic insights have led to improved diagnostic approaches and targeted therapies. Finally, we address the challenges in interpreting genetic data and the potential for personalized medicine in managing SAIDs. This comprehensive overview provides a foundation for understanding the genetic basis of autoinflammatory diseases and its implications for clinical practice."}
