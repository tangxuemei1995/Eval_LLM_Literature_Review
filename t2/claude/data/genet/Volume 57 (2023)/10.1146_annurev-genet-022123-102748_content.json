{"Abstract": "Coral reefs face unprecedented threats from climate change, necessitating a deeper understanding of their adaptive potential. This review synthesizes recent advances in coral reef population genomics, focusing on local adaptation, evolutionary rescue, and dispersal in reef-associated fish species. We examine how genomic tools reveal fine-scale population structure and adaptive variation across environmental gradients. The interplay between gene flow and local adaptation is explored, highlighting the role of connectivity in maintaining genetic diversity and facilitating evolutionary rescue. We discuss how genomic data can inform conservation strategies, including assisted gene flow and the design of marine protected areas. Finally, we identify key knowledge gaps and future research directions to enhance our ability to predict and manage coral reef responses to global change, emphasizing the integration of genomic data with ecological and environmental information."}
