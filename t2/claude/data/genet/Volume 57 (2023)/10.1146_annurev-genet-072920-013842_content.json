{"Abstract": "Pooled CRISPR screens have revolutionized functional genomics, enabling high-throughput interrogation of gene function. However, traditional bulk approaches limit the resolution of cellular phenotypes. This study presents a novel method for conducting genome-scale CRISPR screens at single-cell resolution, combining CRISPR technology with single-cell sequencing and cell sorting. By integrating guide RNA expression with transcriptome profiling in individual cells, we achieve unprecedented insights into gene function and cellular heterogeneity. Our approach allows for the simultaneous assessment of multiple phenotypes and the identification of subtle cellular states affected by genetic perturbations. We demonstrate the utility of this method by screening for genes involved in cell differentiation and drug resistance in cancer cells. This powerful technique enhances our understanding of complex biological processes and has broad applications in various fields, including developmental biology, cancer research, and drug discovery."}
