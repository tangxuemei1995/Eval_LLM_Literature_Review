{"Abstract": "Chloroplasts, essential organelles in plant cells, rely on a complex proteostasis network to maintain their function and adapt to environmental changes. This review explores the intricate processes involved in chloroplast proteostasis, focusing on protein import, sorting, ubiquitination, and proteolysis. We discuss the mechanisms of protein translocation across chloroplast membranes, highlighting the role of translocons and chaperones in facilitating efficient import. The review also examines the sorting of proteins to various chloroplast compartments and the importance of targeting signals. Furthermore, we analyze the emerging role of ubiquitination in chloroplast protein quality control and its interplay with proteolysis. The diverse proteolytic systems within chloroplasts, including stromal and thylakoid-associated proteases, are examined in detail. Understanding these interconnected processes is crucial for unraveling chloroplast function and developing strategies to enhance plant productivity and stress tolerance."}
