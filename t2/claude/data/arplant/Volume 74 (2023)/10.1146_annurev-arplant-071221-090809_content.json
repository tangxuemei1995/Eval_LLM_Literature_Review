{"Abstract": "Replicated evolution, encompassing both convergent and parallel adaptations, is a fascinating phenomenon observed in plant species across diverse environments. This review explores the mechanisms driving replicated evolution in plants, focusing on the interplay between adaptive pressures and genetic constraints. We examine case studies of convergent and parallel evolution in various plant lineages, highlighting their roles in speciation and adaptation to similar ecological niches. The paper discusses the molecular basis of replicated traits, including the contribution of gene duplication, regulatory changes, and horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, we analyze the evolutionary constraints that shape these repeated patterns and their implications for understanding plant diversity and predicting future adaptations. This synthesis provides insights into the predictability of evolution and the factors influencing the repeatability of adaptive solutions in the plant kingdom."}
