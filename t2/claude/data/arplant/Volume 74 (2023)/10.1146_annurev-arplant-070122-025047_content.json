{"Abstract": "Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in plant development and stress responses. This review explores the intricate mechanisms of epigenetic control, focusing on histone modifications and DNA methylation, and their impact on gene expression and transposable element activity. We examine how these epigenetic marks are established, maintained, and dynamically altered during various stages of plant development, from seed germination to flowering. Additionally, we discuss the emerging concept of epigenetic memory, particularly in the context of heat stress responses. The capacity for plants to retain epigenetic information across generations and its potential implications for adaptive responses to environmental challenges are evaluated. Understanding these epigenetic processes provides valuable insights into plant plasticity and resilience, with implications for crop improvement and adaptation to changing climates."}
