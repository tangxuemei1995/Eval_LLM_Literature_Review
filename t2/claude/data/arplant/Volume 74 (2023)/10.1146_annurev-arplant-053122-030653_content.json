{"Abstract": "De novo domestication using genome editing presents a promising avenue for rapidly developing climate-resilient crops. This review explores the potential and challenges of this approach, integrating insights from plant developmental genetics, ethnobotany, and climate change research. We examine how CRISPR-Cas9 and other genome editing tools can be used to introduce domestication traits into wild plant species, potentially accelerating the creation of new crop varieties. The paper discusses key targets for genetic modification, including yield, nutritional content, and stress tolerance. We also consider the ecological and ethical implications of de novo domestication, as well as potential barriers to adoption. By synthesizing current research and identifying knowledge gaps, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the power and perils of de novo domestication in the context of global food security and environmental change."}
