{"Abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) is a crucial component of oxygenic photosynthesis, enabling the conversion of light energy into chemical energy and driving water oxidation. This review explores the evolution and evolvability of PSII, tracing its origins from anoxygenic photosynthetic ancestors to its current form in cyanobacteria and plants. We examine the structural and functional changes that occurred during PSII's evolutionary journey, focusing on the D1 protein and its role in water oxidation. The emergence of PSII marked a pivotal moment in Earth's history, facilitating the rise of atmospheric oxygen and complex life forms. We discuss the molecular mechanisms that allowed PSII to adapt to diverse environmental conditions and the potential implications for understanding the origin of life. Additionally, we consider how insights into PSII evolution can inform strategies for improving photosynthetic efficiency in crops and developing artificial photosynthetic systems for sustainable energy production."}
