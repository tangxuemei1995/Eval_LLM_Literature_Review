{"Abstract": "This review explores the engineering principles underlying plant forms and functions, emphasizing the intricate relationship between structure and function in botanical systems. We examine key biomechanical concepts such as bilayer structures, slender bodies, and self-similarity, which are prevalent in plant architecture and contribute to their remarkable adaptability and efficiency. The study highlights how these engineering themes have shaped plant evolution and design, enabling them to overcome environmental challenges and optimize resource utilization. By analyzing the mechanical properties and functional adaptations of various plant structures, we demonstrate the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding plant biology. This synthesis of engineering and botanical perspectives provides valuable insights into biological design principles and their potential applications in biomimetic technologies."}
