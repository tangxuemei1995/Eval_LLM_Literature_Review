{"Abstract": "Recent advances in plant photoperiodism research have unveiled novel mechanisms underlying the perception and measurement of day length. This review explores emerging concepts that challenge the traditional external coincidence model, highlighting the role of metabolic processes in daylength measurement. We discuss the discovery of noncanonical photoperiod measurement systems that operate independently of the circadian clock, providing plants with additional flexibility in responding to environmental cues. Furthermore, we examine the intriguing connection between photosynthesis and photoperiodic responses, shedding light on how plants integrate light signals with their metabolic status. These findings not only expand our understanding of plant adaptation to seasonal changes but also offer potential applications in crop improvement and climate change mitigation strategies. As we unravel the complexities of plant photoperiodism, new horizons emerge for both basic research and practical applications in agriculture and environmental science."}
