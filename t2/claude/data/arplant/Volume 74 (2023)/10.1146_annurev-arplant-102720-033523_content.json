{"Abstract": "Auxin, a crucial plant hormone, orchestrates numerous developmental processes and adaptive responses. This review explores the intersection of auxin biology and computational approaches, highlighting how bioinformatics and modeling have revolutionized our understanding of auxin signaling and transport. We discuss recent advances in decoding auxin-responsive gene networks, predicting auxin distribution patterns, and simulating auxin-mediated developmental processes. The integration of large-scale genomic data with computational models has provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of auxin pathways and their role in plant diversification. Furthermore, we examine how synthetic biology approaches, guided by in silico predictions, are enabling the engineering of novel auxin-based tools and systems. This synthesis of auxin biology and computational science not only enhances our fundamental knowledge but also opens new avenues for crop improvement and biotechnological applications."}
