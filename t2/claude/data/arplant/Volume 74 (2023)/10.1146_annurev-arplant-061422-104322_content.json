{"Abstract": "As global food security faces increasing challenges from soil salinization, the development of salt-tolerant crops has become a critical research priority. This review examines recent advances in enhancing salinity tolerance in major crop species, focusing on three key approaches: traditional breeding, genetic modification, and neodomestication of crop wild relatives. We evaluate the progress made in identifying and incorporating salt tolerance traits, highlighting successful examples and persistent obstacles. The potential of emerging technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and high-throughput phenotyping, in accelerating the development of salt-tolerant varieties is discussed. Additionally, we address the complexities of translating laboratory successes to field-level improvements in crop yield under saline conditions. This comprehensive analysis underscores the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to deliver salt-tolerant crops that can meet the growing global demand for food in increasingly challenging environments."}
