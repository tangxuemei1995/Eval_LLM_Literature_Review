{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cellular processes across eukaryotes. This review explores the current understanding of SWI/SNF ATPases and their impact on nucleosome positioning, chromatin structure, and transcriptional regulation. We discuss the mechanisms by which these complexes interact with and remodel nucleosomes, facilitating access for transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. The diverse subunit compositions of SWI/SNF complexes and their tissue-specific functions are examined, highlighting their importance in development and cellular differentiation. Additionally, we address the role of SWI/SNF remodelers in mediating cellular responses to various stimuli, including environmental stress and signaling pathways. Recent advances in structural biology and genomic approaches have provided new insights into the molecular details of SWI/SNF activity and their genome-wide binding patterns. We also consider the implications of SWI/SNF dysfunction in human diseases, particularly in cancer, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these complexes. This comprehensive review underscores the fundamental importance of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers in maintaining genomic plasticity and cellular homeostasis."}
