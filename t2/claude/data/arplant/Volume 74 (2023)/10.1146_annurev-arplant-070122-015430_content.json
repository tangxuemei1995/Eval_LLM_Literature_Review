{"Abstract": "This review explores the fascinating realm of between-plant signaling, focusing on the intricate communication networks facilitated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and common mycelial networks. We examine the mechanisms underlying interplant signaling, including the role of systemic signaling pathways and the influence of parasitic plants on these processes. The study highlights how plants utilize underground fungal networks to exchange information and resources, effectively creating a 'wood wide web' that connects diverse plant species within ecosystems. We discuss the implications of these signaling pathways for plant defense, resource allocation, and community dynamics. Additionally, we investigate the potential applications of this knowledge in agriculture and ecosystem management. Our findings underscore the complexity of plant communication systems and their significance in shaping plant interactions and ecosystem functioning."}
