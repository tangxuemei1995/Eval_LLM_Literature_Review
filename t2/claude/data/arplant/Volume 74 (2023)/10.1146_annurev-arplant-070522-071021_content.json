{"Abstract": "Invasive plants pose significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. This review explores the factors contributing to the success of invasive plants in their non-native habitats. We examine the role of functional traits, such as rapid growth rates and high reproductive output, in conferring competitive advantages to invasive species. Additionally, we investigate how biotic interactions, including reduced herbivory and pathogen pressure in novel environments, facilitate invasion success. The concept of ecosystem invasibility is discussed, highlighting how disturbance and resource availability influence community susceptibility to invasion. We also consider the importance of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptations in enabling invasive plants to thrive across diverse environmental conditions. By synthesizing recent research on invasive plant ecology, this review provides insights into the complex mechanisms underlying invasion success and offers implications for management strategies and future research directions."}
