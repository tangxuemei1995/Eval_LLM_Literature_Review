{"Abstract": "RNA modifications play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cellular processes in plants. This review explores the diversity and functions of RNA modifications in plants, focusing on mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA modifications. We discuss the most prevalent modifications, including N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and their impact on plant development and stress responses. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed the widespread occurrence of these modifications across plant transcriptomes. We examine the functional diversity of RNA modifications, highlighting their roles in mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and alternative splicing. Additionally, we address the involvement of RNA modifications in plant stress responses, including abiotic and biotic stresses. The review also covers the enzymes responsible for writing, reading, and erasing these modifications, as well as their evolutionary conservation across plant species. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps and propose future research directions to further elucidate the complex interplay between RNA modifications and plant physiology. Understanding these modifications will provide valuable insights into plant adaptation mechanisms and potentially lead to novel strategies for crop improvement."}
