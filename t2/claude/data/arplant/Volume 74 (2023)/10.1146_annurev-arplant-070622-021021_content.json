{"Abstract": "This review explores the multifaceted role of RNA in biological systems, focusing on its significance in gene expression, plant virus interactions, and disease resistance mechanisms. We examine the evolutionary implications of RNA-based processes and their potential applications in agricultural technology. The paper discusses recent advancements in our understanding of RNA's role in plant-pathogen interactions and how this knowledge can be harnessed to develop novel strategies for crop protection. Additionally, we consider the broader evolutionary context of RNA's functions, from its hypothesized role in the origin of life to its current importance in cellular processes. The review concludes with an autobiographical perspective on the author's journey in RNA research, highlighting key discoveries and future directions in this rapidly evolving field."}
