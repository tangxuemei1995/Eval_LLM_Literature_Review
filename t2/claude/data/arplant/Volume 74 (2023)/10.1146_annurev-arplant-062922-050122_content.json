{"Abstract": "The BAHD acyltransferase gene family plays a crucial role in plant metabolism, catalyzing the transfer of acyl groups to diverse acceptor molecules. This review explores the expanding functions of BAHD enzymes, focusing on their involvement in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, particularly hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCTs). We discuss the evolutionary significance of BAHD enzymes in land plant adaptation and their contributions to the production of various secondary metabolites, including acylsugars, esters, and amides. Recent advances in understanding BAHD enzyme structure-function relationships and their regulation in different plant species are highlighted. Additionally, we examine the potential applications of BAHD acyltransferases in metabolic engineering and crop improvement. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of BAHD enzymes in plant biology and their potential for biotechnological applications, paving the way for future research directions in this rapidly evolving field."}
