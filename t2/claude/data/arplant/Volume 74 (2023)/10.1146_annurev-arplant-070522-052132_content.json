{"Abstract": "Proximity labeling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleotide interactions, and subcellular proteomes in plants. This technique allows for the identification of spatially and temporally proximate molecules within living cells, providing valuable insights into cellular organization and function. Recent advancements in proximity labeling methods have enabled researchers to investigate cell type-specific proteomes and quantify protein interactions with unprecedented resolution. This review summarizes the current state of proximity labeling in plant biology, highlighting its applications in elucidating protein complexes, mapping organelle proteomes, and uncovering dynamic protein associations. We discuss various proximity labeling approaches, including BioID, APEX, and TurboID, and their adaptations for use in plant systems. Furthermore, we explore the integration of proximity labeling with other cutting-edge technologies, such as single-cell proteomics and in situ protein analysis. The challenges and limitations of proximity labeling in plants are addressed, along with potential solutions and future directions. As this technique continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize our understanding of plant cellular biology and provide new avenues for crop improvement and biotechnological applications."}
