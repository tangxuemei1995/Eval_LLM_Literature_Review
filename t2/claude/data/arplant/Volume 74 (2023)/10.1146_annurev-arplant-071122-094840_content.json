{"Abstract": "Optogenetics, a revolutionary technique combining optics and genetics, has emerged as a powerful tool in plant biology research. This review explores the application of optogenetic methods in plants, focusing on the utilization of photoreceptors, rhodopsins, biosensors, and optoswitches. We discuss the development of light-sensitive proteins and their integration into plant systems to control cellular processes with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. The review highlights recent advances in engineering plant photoreceptors and rhodopsins for optogenetic applications, as well as the design of novel biosensors for real-time monitoring of cellular events. Additionally, we examine the use of optoswitches to regulate gene expression and protein activity in plants. The potential of optogenetics in elucidating complex plant signaling networks, studying developmental processes, and improving crop traits is addressed. Finally, we consider future directions and challenges in expanding the optogenetic toolkit for plant research and biotechnology applications."}
