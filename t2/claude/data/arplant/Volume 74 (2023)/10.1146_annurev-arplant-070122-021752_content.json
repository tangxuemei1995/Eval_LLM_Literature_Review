{"Abstract": "Lipid droplets, also known as oil bodies in seeds, are unique cellular organelles that play a crucial role in the storage and metabolism of hydrophobic molecules within the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm. This review explores the biogenesis, structure, and function of lipid droplets, with a particular focus on their importance in seed tissues. Lipid droplets primarily consist of a neutral lipid core, predominantly composed of triacylglycerols, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and associated proteins. The formation of these organelles involves a complex interplay of lipid synthesis, protein targeting, and membrane remodeling processes. We discuss the current understanding of lipid droplet biogenesis, including the role of the endoplasmic reticulum in their formation and the mechanisms of lipid accumulation. Furthermore, we examine the diverse functions of lipid droplets in cellular metabolism, energy homeostasis, and stress responses. The review also highlights the significance of lipid droplets in seed tissues, where they serve as essential energy reserves for germination and early seedling growth. Finally, we address the potential applications of lipid droplet research in biotechnology and agriculture, including the development of high-oil yield crops and the production of biofuels."}
