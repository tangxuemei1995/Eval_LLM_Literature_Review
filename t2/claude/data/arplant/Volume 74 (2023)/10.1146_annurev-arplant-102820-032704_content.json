{"Abstract": "The phyllosphere microbiome, comprising microorganisms inhabiting plant aerial surfaces, plays a crucial role in plant health and ecosystem functioning. This review explores the complex interactions between phyllosphere microbiota and their host plants, drawing parallels with the gut microbiome in animals. We examine the diversity of epiphytes and endophytes, their colonization strategies, and their impact on plant immunity. The concept of dysbiosis in the phyllosphere is discussed, highlighting its potential consequences for plant health and productivity. Furthermore, we investigate the factors influencing phyllosphere community composition, including environmental conditions, plant genotype, and anthropogenic activities. The phytobiome approach, which considers the plant and its associated microorganisms as a holistic system, is presented as a promising framework for understanding and manipulating plant-microbe interactions. This review underscores the importance of phyllosphere microbiome research in developing sustainable agricultural practices and enhancing plant resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses."}
