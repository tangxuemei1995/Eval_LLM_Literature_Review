{"Abstract": "Small RNAs play crucial roles in plant development and stress responses through gene regulation. This review explores the biogenesis, regulatory mechanisms, and functions of three major classes of plant small RNAs: microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). We discuss the distinct pathways involved in their production, including the roles of key enzymes such as Dicer-like proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The review highlights the diverse regulatory functions of these small RNAs in gene silencing, chromatin modification, and defense against pathogens. Special attention is given to mobile siRNAs, which can move between cells and tissues, facilitating long-distance signaling and systemic regulation. We also examine the involvement of small RNAs in various aspects of plant development, including organ formation, flowering time control, and stress responses. Understanding these complex regulatory networks is crucial for advancing our knowledge of plant biology and developing novel strategies for crop improvement."}
