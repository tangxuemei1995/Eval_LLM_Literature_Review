{"Abstract": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) ion channels have emerged as crucial components in plant signaling and physiology, bridging the gap between structural elements and signaling pathways. This review explores the multifaceted roles and mechanisms of GLRs in plants, highlighting their importance in excitability, cell-cell communication, and various signaling cascades. GLRs, which share structural similarities with their animal counterparts, are involved in calcium transport and signaling, contributing to the generation and propagation of action potentials in plants. These ion channels respond to a diverse array of amino acids and other ligands, including glutathione, thereby integrating multiple environmental and physiological cues. Recent advances in structural biology and electrophysiology have provided insights into the gating mechanisms and ion selectivity of plant GLRs, revealing both conserved features and unique adaptations compared to animal glutamate receptors. The review discusses the involvement of GLRs in long-distance electrical signaling, which mediates rapid systemic responses to various stimuli, including biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, we examine the role of GLRs in amino acid signaling and their potential contributions to plant nutrition and development. The complex interplay between GLRs and other signaling components, such as calcium-dependent protein kinases and transcription factors, is also addressed. Understanding the functions and mechanisms of plant GLRs not only enhances our knowledge of plant signaling networks but also offers potential applications in crop improvement and stress tolerance."}
