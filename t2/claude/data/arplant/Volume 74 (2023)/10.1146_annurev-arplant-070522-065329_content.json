{"Abstract": "Circadian rhythms play a crucial role in organisms' adaptation to their environment, but the impact of rapidly changing climatic conditions on these internal clocks remains poorly understood. This review explores the intersection of circadian rhythms and environmental adaptation in the context of climate change. We examine how alterations in temperature, light cycles, and other environmental cues affect signaling networks that regulate circadian rhythms across diverse species. Recent findings suggest that disruptions to these rhythms may have far-reaching consequences for organismal fitness, population dynamics, and ecosystem functioning. We discuss the potential for circadian plasticity as a mechanism for coping with environmental change and highlight the need for integrative research approaches. Understanding the complex interplay between circadian systems and changing environments is essential for predicting and mitigating the ecological impacts of climate change on biological timekeeping mechanisms."}
