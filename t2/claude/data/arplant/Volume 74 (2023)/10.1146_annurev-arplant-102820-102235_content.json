{"Abstract": "Plants, as sessile organisms, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense and respond to temperature fluctuations. This review explores the current understanding of temperature sensing in plants, focusing on Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. We discuss the molecular basis of thermosensors and their roles in mediating plant responses to both heat and cold stress. The review highlights key thermosensory pathways involved in plant adaptation and thermomorphogenesis, including the regulation of gene expression, protein stability, and cellular signaling cascades. Recent advances in identifying novel temperature-responsive elements and their integration into broader stress response networks are examined. Understanding these intricate temperature sensing mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to enhance crop resilience in the face of climate change and extreme weather events."}
