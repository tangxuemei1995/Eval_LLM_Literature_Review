{"Abstract": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis plays a crucial role in plant growth and stress adaptation across diverse ecosystems. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of mycorrhizal interactions, from molecular mechanisms to ecosystem-level impacts. We explore the genetic basis of symbiosis establishment, the role of mycorrhizae helper bacteria, and the complex nutrient exchange processes between plants and fungi. The common mycorrhizal network is examined as a key facilitator of inter-plant communication and resource allocation. We discuss how mycorrhizal associations enhance plant stress resistance, including drought tolerance and pathogen defense. The autoregulation of mycorrhizae is investigated as a critical control mechanism in symbiosis development. Finally, we consider the broader ecological implications of mycorrhizal symbiosis, including its influence on plant community structure and ecosystem functioning. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the multifaceted nature of mycorrhizal symbiosis and its significance in plant biology and ecology."}
