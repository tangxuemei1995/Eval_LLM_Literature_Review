{"Abstract": "Plant volatiles play crucial roles in ecological signaling, yet our understanding of their spatiotemporal dynamics and environmental influences remains limited. This review synthesizes current knowledge on where, when, and why plant volatiles mediate ecological interactions. We explore the spatial distributions of volatile signals, from leaf-level emissions to landscape-scale patterns, and examine their temporal dynamics across diurnal, seasonal, and evolutionary timescales. The interplay between plant volatiles and environmental factors, including wind, temperature, and atmospheric chemistry, is critically assessed. We highlight how advancements in analytical techniques and modeling approaches have enhanced our ability to track volatile signals in complex ecosystems. However, significant research gaps persist, particularly in understanding the long-range effects of volatiles and their interactions with changing climates. This review underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches combining plant biology, atmospheric science, and ecology to fully elucidate the multifaceted nature of plant volatile-mediated ecological signaling."}
