{"Abstract": "Mutation rate variability in plant genomes is a critical factor influencing plant evolution and adaptation. This review explores the underlying causes of this variability, focusing on DNA repair mechanisms, chromatin structure, and their interactions. We examine how differences in DNA repair efficiency across plant species and genomic regions contribute to mutation rate heterogeneity. The role of chromatin organization in modulating DNA accessibility and repair processes is also discussed, highlighting its impact on mutation rates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental factors and plant-specific genomic features, such as polyploidy and transposable elements, influence mutation rates. Understanding these causes of mutation rate variability provides insights into plant genome evolution, adaptation to changing environments, and the potential for crop improvement through targeted manipulation of mutation rates in breeding programs."}
