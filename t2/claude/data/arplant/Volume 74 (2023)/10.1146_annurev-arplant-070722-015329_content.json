{"Abstract": "Plant hormones, or phytohormones, are essential signaling molecules that regulate various aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. This review explores the intricate mechanisms of hormone transport and localization, which are crucial for maintaining hormone homeostasis and facilitating their functions. We examine the latest findings on the transport mechanisms of key phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). The role of specific transporters and their regulation in hormone distribution is discussed, highlighting the importance of spatial and temporal control in hormone signaling. Understanding these transport processes provides valuable insights into plant hormone action and offers potential targets for improving crop productivity and stress tolerance in agriculture."}
