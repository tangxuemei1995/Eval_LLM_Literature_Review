{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of parenting in promoting social mobility within and across generations. Drawing on longitudinal data from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, we examine how parenting practices influence the development of crucial skills that contribute to social mobility. Our findings reveal that effective parenting strategies, such as fostering cognitive and non-cognitive skills, significantly enhance children's prospects for upward mobility. We observe that parents who actively engage in their children's education, provide emotional support, and create stimulating home environments contribute to narrowing the skills gap between advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Furthermore, our intergenerational analysis demonstrates that positive parenting practices can break cycles of inequality by equipping children with the tools necessary to overcome socioeconomic barriers. The study also highlights the importance of early intervention programs and parental support initiatives in reducing disparities in human development. These results underscore the critical role of parenting in shaping social mobility outcomes and suggest that targeted interventions to improve parenting skills could be a powerful lever for addressing persistent inequalities in society."}
