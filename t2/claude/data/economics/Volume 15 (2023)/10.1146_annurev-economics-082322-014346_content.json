{"Abstract": "This paper examines the economic implications of digital privacy in the modern data-driven economy. We analyze the complex interplay between individual privacy preferences, data externalities, and market dynamics. Our research highlights the challenges posed by the commodification of personal information and the resulting data externalities that affect both individuals and society at large. We explore the effectiveness of current privacy regulations and their impact on market competition, innovation, and consumer welfare. Using a game-theoretic approach, we model the strategic interactions between data collectors, consumers, and regulators. Our findings suggest that optimal privacy protection requires a nuanced balance between individual rights, market efficiency, and societal benefits. We propose policy recommendations that address the unique economic characteristics of personal data and aim to mitigate the negative externalities associated with privacy breaches while fostering innovation in the digital economy."}
