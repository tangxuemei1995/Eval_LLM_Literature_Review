{"Abstract": "This paper examines the economic implications of antitrust reform in the context of evolving market dynamics and technological advancements. Drawing on recent empirical studies and theoretical frameworks, we analyze the effectiveness of current antitrust policies in promoting competition and preventing monopolistic practices. The research explores the challenges posed by digital platforms, network effects, and data-driven economies to traditional antitrust enforcement. We evaluate proposed reforms, including stricter merger controls, enhanced regulatory oversight, and novel approaches to defining market power. Our findings suggest that while antitrust reform is necessary to address contemporary market realities, policymakers must carefully balance pro-competitive interventions with potential innovation disincentives. The paper concludes by offering policy recommendations aimed at fostering a more dynamic and competitive economic landscape while safeguarding consumer welfare and long-term economic growth."}
