{"Abstract": "This study investigates the interplay between micro-level propagation and macro-level aggregation in production networks, focusing on their impact on aggregate productivity and resource misallocation. By analyzing firm-level data and industry linkages, we develop a novel framework that bridges the gap between microeconomic shocks and macroeconomic outcomes. Our findings reveal that sector-specific disturbances can propagate through production networks, leading to significant comovement across industries and amplifying aggregate fluctuations. We demonstrate that the structure of these networks plays a crucial role in determining the extent of shock propagation and its effects on overall economic performance. Furthermore, our research highlights how resource misallocation at the micro level can accumulate and manifest as substantial productivity losses at the macro level, emphasizing the importance of efficient resource allocation in fostering economic growth."}
