{"Abstract": "This paper introduces local projections as a flexible and robust alternative to vector autoregressions (VARs) in applied economics research. We demonstrate how local projections can be used to estimate impulse response functions in both time series and panel data settings. The method's key advantage lies in its ability to accommodate non-linear and state-dependent relationships, making it particularly useful for analyzing complex economic dynamics. We also show how local projections can be integrated with the potential outcomes framework, allowing for causal inference in observational studies. Through empirical examples and Monte Carlo simulations, we illustrate the method's performance relative to traditional VAR approaches and highlight its applicability across various economic contexts."}
