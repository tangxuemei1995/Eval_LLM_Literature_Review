{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of China's financial system and its impact on the country's economic development since the initiation of economic reforms. We examine the evolution of China's financial markets, banking sector, and regulatory framework, highlighting the unique characteristics that have shaped its growth trajectory. The study explores the concept of implicit guarantees in the Chinese financial system and their implications for risk management and market efficiency. Additionally, we analyze the rapid emergence of fintech and its transformative effects on traditional financial services. Our findings suggest that while China's financial system has played a crucial role in supporting economic growth, significant challenges remain in terms of market liberalization, risk mitigation, and regulatory oversight. We conclude by discussing potential policy implications and future directions for China's financial system in the context of its ongoing economic development."}
