{"Abstract": "This study explores cognitive limitations in decision-making, focusing on failures of contingent thinking. Through behavioral experiments and cognitive economic analysis, we investigate violations of the sure-thing principle. Results reveal systematic deviations from rational decision-making, highlighting the impact of cognitive constraints on judgment. Our findings contribute to the understanding of human reasoning processes and have implications for economic theory and policy design."}
