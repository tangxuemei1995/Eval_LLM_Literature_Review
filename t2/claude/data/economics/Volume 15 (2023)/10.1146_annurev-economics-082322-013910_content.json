{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of non-CES aggregators, exploring their applications in economic modeling beyond the commonly used constant elasticity of substitution framework. We examine various classes of aggregators, including those incorporating nonhomothetic preferences, constant returns to scale production functions, and implicitly additive forms. The study investigates the properties of these aggregators, focusing on their ability to capture gross substitutes and complements, as well as essential and inessential goods. We discuss the theoretical foundations and practical implications of each aggregator type, highlighting their strengths and limitations in modeling complex economic relationships. The paper also addresses the challenges in empirical implementation and estimation of these non-CES aggregators. By synthesizing existing literature and presenting new insights, this guided tour aims to enhance researchers' understanding and facilitate the appropriate selection of aggregators for diverse economic analyses."}
