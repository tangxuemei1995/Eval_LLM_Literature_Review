{"Abstract": "This paper examines the economic rationale and potential impacts of border carbon adjustment (BCA) mechanisms in climate policy. As countries implement diverse carbon pricing strategies, concerns about carbon leakage and competitiveness have led to growing interest in BCAs. We analyze the theoretical foundations of BCAs, their compatibility with international trade rules, and their potential effectiveness in reducing global emissions. Using a computable general equilibrium model, we simulate various BCA scenarios to assess their impacts on trade flows, emissions, and economic welfare across countries. Our results suggest that while BCAs can mitigate carbon leakage to some extent, their effectiveness depends on design features and the formation of climate clubs. We find that BCAs may have distributional consequences, potentially affecting developing countries disproportionately. The paper concludes by discussing policy implications and areas for future research on optimizing BCA design."}
