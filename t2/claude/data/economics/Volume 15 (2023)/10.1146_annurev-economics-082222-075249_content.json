{"Abstract": "This study examines the organizational structures and management practices of social enterprises, exploring the intersection of nonprofit and for-profit models in pursuit of social impact. Drawing on a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, we analyze the unique challenges and opportunities faced by social entrepreneurs in balancing financial sustainability with mission-driven objectives. The research investigates various legal forms, including nonprofits, public benefit corporations, and hybrid models, assessing their effectiveness in addressing social issues while maintaining operational viability. Our findings reveal that successful social enterprises often employ innovative governance structures, stakeholder engagement strategies, and impact measurement tools to navigate the complex landscape of social entrepreneurship. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on social enterprise organization and offers practical insights for practitioners and policymakers in the field."}
