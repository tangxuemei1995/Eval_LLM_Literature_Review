{"Abstract": "This paper examines the complex dynamics of US-China trade relations, focusing on the impacts of trade policies and the so-called 'China shock' on US manufacturing employment. Utilizing a dynamic spatial economics framework and incorporating input-output linkages, we analyze the long-term effects of trade liberalization and recent trade tensions between the two nations. Our findings reveal that while the China shock led to significant job losses in certain US manufacturing sectors, it also spurred productivity gains and created new opportunities in others. We explore the heterogeneous regional impacts of these trade dynamics and evaluate the effectiveness of various policy responses, including tariffs and targeted support for affected communities. The study contributes to the ongoing debate on optimal trade policies and offers insights for policymakers navigating the challenges of global economic integration in an era of shifting geopolitical landscapes."}
