{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex dynamics of corporate taxation, focusing on its impact on multinational companies and economic crises. We analyze tax incidence across various stakeholders and explore how corporate tax policies affect business decisions and economic stability. Our findings reveal that the burden of corporate taxation is often shifted to consumers and workers, while multinational firms employ sophisticated strategies to minimize their tax liabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the role of corporate taxation in mitigating or exacerbating economic crises, providing insights for policymakers seeking to balance fiscal needs with economic growth."}
