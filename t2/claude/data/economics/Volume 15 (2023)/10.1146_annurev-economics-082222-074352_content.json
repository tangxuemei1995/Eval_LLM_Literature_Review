{"Abstract": "This paper explores the application of text algorithms in economics, focusing on the emerging field of 'text as data.' We review key methodologies including topic models, word embeddings, and large language models, with particular emphasis on transformer-based architectures. The study examines how these techniques can extract valuable insights from unstructured textual data, enhancing economic analysis and prediction. We discuss the potential of these algorithms to revolutionize various subfields of economics, including finance, labor markets, and consumer behavior. The paper also addresses challenges and limitations associated with implementing text algorithms in economic research, highlighting areas for future development and interdisciplinary collaboration."}
