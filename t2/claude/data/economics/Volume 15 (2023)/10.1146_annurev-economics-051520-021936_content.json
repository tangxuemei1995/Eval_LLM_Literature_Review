{"Abstract": "This paper examines the challenges of regulating collusion in the modern business landscape. We analyze the impact of the Twombly decision on antitrust litigation and explore the evolving burden of proof in collusion cases. The study investigates the effectiveness of safe tests and consent orders as regulatory tools. Additionally, we consider the emerging role of artificial intelligence in both facilitating and detecting collusive behavior. Our findings suggest a need for more adaptive regulatory approaches to address the complexities of contemporary collusion, balancing deterrence with the promotion of legitimate business practices."}
