{"Abstract": "This paper explores new developments in Austrian economics, integrating insights from behavioral and development economics. It examines the role of entrepreneurship and governance in addressing societal challenges such as infectious diseases, natural disasters, and war. The study applies robust political economy principles to analyze the social economy's response to these issues. By synthesizing Austrian economic theory with contemporary approaches, we offer fresh perspectives on economic resilience and adaptability. Our findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and institutional dynamics can enhance economic policy formulation and implementation in the face of complex global challenges."}
