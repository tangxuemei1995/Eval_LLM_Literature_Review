{"Abstract": "This study examines gender differences in negotiation outcomes and explores potential interventions to reduce the persistent gap. Drawing on a comprehensive review of literature and empirical data, we investigate the effectiveness of three interventions: negotiation training, banning salary history inquiries, and increasing pay transparency. Our findings suggest that while each intervention shows promise, their impact varies. Negotiation training appears to boost women's confidence and assertiveness, narrowing the gender gap in bargaining outcomes. Banning salary history inquiries helps prevent the perpetuation of past wage disparities. Pay transparency initiatives demonstrate mixed results, with some evidence of reduced gender pay gaps but potential unintended consequences. We conclude that a multi-faceted approach combining these interventions may be most effective in addressing gender disparities in negotiation outcomes. Future research should focus on long-term effects and potential synergies between interventions."}
