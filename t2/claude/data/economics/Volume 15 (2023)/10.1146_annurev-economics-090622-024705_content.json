{"Abstract": "This paper examines the complex economic factors driving tropical deforestation and its far-reaching consequences. Utilizing remote sensing data and economic models, we analyze the interplay between land use change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss in tropical regions. Our findings reveal that deforestation is largely driven by short-term economic gains, often at the expense of long-term environmental and social costs. We explore the role of externalities and common-property resource management in exacerbating deforestation rates. The study also investigates the political economy of tropical forest conservation, highlighting the challenges in aligning local, national, and global interests. Our research underscores the urgent need for innovative economic incentives and policy interventions to promote sustainable forest management and mitigate climate change impacts. By integrating environmental economics with natural resource management strategies, this paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue on balancing economic development with tropical forest conservation in the face of global environmental challenges."}
