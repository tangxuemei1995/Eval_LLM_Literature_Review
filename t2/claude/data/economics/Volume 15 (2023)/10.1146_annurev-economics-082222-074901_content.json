{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of non-bank financial intermediation in transmitting global risk shocks to emerging markets. We focus on investment funds as key players in international capital flows and analyze their impact on emerging market vulnerabilities. Using a comprehensive dataset of fund flows and holdings, we investigate how benchmark investing and global risk perceptions influence capital allocation decisions. Our findings reveal that non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly investment funds, amplify the transmission of global risk shocks to emerging markets. We document significant tail risk spillovers and demonstrate how benchmark-driven investing can exacerbate market volatility during periods of heightened global uncertainty. The results highlight the need for policymakers to consider the growing importance of non-bank financial intermediation in assessing and mitigating emerging market vulnerabilities to global risk shocks."}
