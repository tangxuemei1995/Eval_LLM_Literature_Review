{"Abstract": "This paper explores the econometric analysis of nonlinear budget sets in consumer choice models. We develop a random utility framework to estimate preferences and welfare effects in the presence of complex budget constraints. Our approach combines bunching techniques with instrumental variables to address endogeneity concerns and identify structural parameters. We demonstrate the model's applicability using simulated data and an empirical application to labor supply decisions under progressive taxation. The results reveal significant nonlinear responses to budget set kinks and provide insights into optimal tax design. Our methodology offers a flexible tool for analyzing consumer behavior and policy impacts in various economic contexts with nonlinear incentives."}
