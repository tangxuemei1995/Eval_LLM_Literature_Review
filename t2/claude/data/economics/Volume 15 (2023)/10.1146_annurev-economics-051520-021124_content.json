{"Abstract": "This paper surveys recent advancements in partial identification methods within econometrics. We review key developments in set identification techniques, focusing on their application to treatment effect estimation and the incorporation of shape restrictions. The paper examines how researchers have leveraged bounds analysis to extract meaningful information from data when point identification is not feasible. We discuss the role of optimizing behavior assumptions in tightening identified sets and improving inference. Additionally, we explore novel approaches to incorporating economic theory into partial identification frameworks. The survey highlights the increasing importance of partial identification in empirical work, particularly in settings with limited data or when traditional assumptions are untenable. We conclude by discussing open challenges and promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field."}
