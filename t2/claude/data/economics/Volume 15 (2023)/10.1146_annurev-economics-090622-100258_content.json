{"Abstract": "This paper reviews recent advances in the economic theory of cultural transmission, focusing on the evolution of institutions. We examine models that explore how cultural traits and institutional norms are passed between generations and across populations. The analysis encompasses the roles of social learning, network effects, and economic incentives in shaping cultural dynamics. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding cultural transmission mechanisms for predicting institutional change and designing effective policies."}
