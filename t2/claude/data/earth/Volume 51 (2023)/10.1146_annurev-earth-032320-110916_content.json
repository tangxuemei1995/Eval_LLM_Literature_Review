{"Abstract": "Iceberg calving, the process by which ice breaks off from glaciers and ice shelves, plays a crucial role in ice-sheet stability and global sea-level rise. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of calving regimes and transitions, focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. We examine the complex interplay of factors influencing calving, including ice thickness, surface melt, ocean forcing, and basal topography. Recent observations and modeling studies have revealed distinct calving regimes, ranging from small-scale, frequent events to large, episodic collapses. These regimes are governed by the balance between driving forces and resistive stresses within the ice. We discuss how transitions between calving regimes can lead to rapid ice loss and potential tipping points in ice-sheet stability. The review highlights the importance of ice shelves in buttressing upstream ice flow and the consequences of their disintegration for overall ice-sheet mass balance. We also explore the challenges in accurately representing calving processes in ice-sheet models and the implications for projections of future sea-level rise. Recent technological advancements, including high-resolution satellite imagery and autonomous underwater vehicles, have greatly improved our ability to monitor and quantify calving events. However, significant uncertainties remain regarding the long-term evolution of calving rates under different climate scenarios. This review underscores the critical need for continued research into iceberg calving mechanisms to enhance our ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of ice-sheet mass loss on global sea levels."}
