{"Abstract": "The ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle plays a crucial role in shaping Earth's tectonic processes and the evolution of its surface. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of the deformation mechanisms and ductile flow behavior of the lithospheric mantle, with a focus on olivine, the dominant mineral in this region. We examine the interplay between various deformation mechanisms, including dislocation creep, diffusion creep, and grain boundary sliding, and their dependence on temperature, pressure, and stress conditions. The review highlights the importance of microstructural evolution, grain size distribution, and the presence of secondary phases in controlling the rheological behavior of the lithospheric mantle. We discuss the implications of these findings for large-scale geodynamic processes, such as plate tectonics, mantle convection, and lithospheric deformation. Additionally, we explore the role of water content and melt fraction in modifying the plasticity of olivine and other mantle minerals. The integration of experimental data, theoretical models, and field observations provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex ductile deformation processes occurring within the Earth's lithospheric mantle, offering new insights into the dynamics of our planet's interior."}
