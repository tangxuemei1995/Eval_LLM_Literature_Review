{"Abstract": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Carbon Isotope Excursion (LJCIE) represents a significant perturbation in the global carbon cycle during the Paleoproterozoic era, closely associated with the Great Oxidation Event. This study critically examines the LJCIE, synthesizing recent geological, geochemical, and isotopic data to provide a comprehensive understanding of its causes, duration, and global implications. We review evidence from sedimentary sequences worldwide, focusing on δ13C values in carbonate rocks, to reconstruct the temporal and spatial extent of the excursion. Our analysis suggests that the LJCIE lasted approximately 160-250 million years, with peak δ13C values reaching +8‰ to +12‰. We propose a multi-stage model for the excursion, involving enhanced organic carbon burial, methane cycling, and carbonate weathering. The study also explores the relationship between the LJCIE and contemporaneous environmental changes, including atmospheric oxygenation and the evolution of early eukaryotes. By deconstructing the LJCIE, we provide new insights into Precambrian Earth system dynamics and highlight the interconnectedness of biogeochemical cycles during this critical period in Earth's history."}
