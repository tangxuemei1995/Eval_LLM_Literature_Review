{"Abstract": "Understanding the energy budget of earthquakes is crucial for comprehending fault mechanics and seismic hazard assessment. This study investigates the relationship between fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquake ruptures, focusing on their roles in dynamic weakening processes and overall rupture dynamics. We analyze a comprehensive dataset of well-documented earthquakes, combining seismological observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations to quantify these energy components across various tectonic settings and fault zone structures. Our results reveal a complex interplay between fracture energy and breakdown work, influenced by factors such as fault roughness, thermal pressurization, and off-fault damage. We find that the ratio of fracture energy to breakdown work varies systematically with earthquake magnitude and fault maturity, suggesting a scale-dependent evolution of energy partitioning during rupture propagation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating realistic fault zone structures in rupture models significantly impacts the estimated energy budget, highlighting the importance of considering geological complexity in earthquake simulations. These findings provide new insights into the physical mechanisms governing earthquake ruptures and have important implications for improving seismic hazard models. Our work underscores the need for integrating multidisciplinary approaches to better constrain the energy dissipation processes during earthquakes and enhance our understanding of fault zone dynamics."}
