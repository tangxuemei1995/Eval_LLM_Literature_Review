{"Abstract": "The Saturnian moon Mimas has long been considered a frozen, geologically inactive body. However, recent observations and theoretical models have challenged this view, suggesting that Mimas may be more complex than previously thought. This review examines the latest evidence for Mimas as a potential ocean world, exploring its internal structure, surface features, and rotational dynamics. We analyze data from Cassini mission observations, coupled with new models of tidal heating and orbital evolution. The possibility of a subsurface ocean is discussed in the context of Mimas' formation history and its role in Saturn's ring system. We also consider the implications of tectonic activity on Mimas' surface, which may indicate ongoing geological processes. Furthermore, we investigate the moon's rotational state and its potential for harboring a liquid water layer. By synthesizing these diverse lines of evidence, we aim to reassess Mimas' place in the spectrum of icy satellites, from a simple frozen fragment to a potentially active ocean world. This reevaluation has significant implications for our understanding of satellite formation and evolution in the outer solar system."}
