{"Abstract": "Giant impacts play a crucial role in the final stages of planet formation, shaping the physical and chemical properties of terrestrial planets. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of these catastrophic events and their implications for planetary evolution. We examine the latest numerical simulations and theoretical models that describe the mechanics of giant impacts, including their frequency, energy scales, and outcomes. The review highlights the importance of these collisions in determining planetary mass, rotation rates, and the formation of satellite systems. We discuss how giant impacts influence the distribution of elements within planets, potentially explaining observed compositional variations in the inner Solar System. The role of these events in atmospheric loss and volatile delivery is also explored, with implications for the development of habitable conditions on rocky planets. Furthermore, we consider how giant impacts may contribute to the diversity of exoplanetary systems observed to date. By integrating findings from various disciplines, including planetary science, geophysics, and astronomy, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding giant impacts in planet formation and identifies key areas for future research."}
