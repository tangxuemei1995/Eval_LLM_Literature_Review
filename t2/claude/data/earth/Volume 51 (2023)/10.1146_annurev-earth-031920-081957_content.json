{"Abstract": "The rock-hosted biosphere represents a vast and largely unexplored frontier in microbial ecology. This review synthesizes current knowledge on endolithic communities and their role in shaping the Earth's crust. We examine the diverse metabolic strategies employed by microorganisms in these extreme environments, with a focus on chemolithoautotrophy. The significance of rock fractures as conduits for nutrient and energy flow is discussed, highlighting their importance in sustaining microbial activity in the deep subsurface. We explore recent advances in understanding the extent and diversity of life in crustal ecosystems, from shallow aquifers to deep continental and oceanic settings. The potential implications of rock-hosted microbial activity on global biogeochemical cycles and the evolution of life on Earth are also considered. This review underscores the need for further research to fully comprehend the ecological and geochemical impacts of the rock-hosted biosphere."}
