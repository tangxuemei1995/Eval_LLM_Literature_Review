{"Abstract": "The evolution of plants has profoundly influenced Earth's environment throughout geological time, particularly during the late Paleozoic era. This study presents a comprehensive systems approach to understanding the complex interactions between plant functional traits, ecosystem dynamics, and global climate patterns in deep time. By integrating plant functional strategies, ecosystem modeling, and Earth system modeling, we investigate the transformative impact of vegetation on the planet's biogeochemical cycles and climate. Our analysis focuses on key plant innovations, such as the development of deep root systems, lignified tissues, and complex vascular structures, which emerged during the late Paleozoic. These adaptations not only enhanced plant survival and colonization of terrestrial environments but also significantly altered atmospheric composition, hydrological cycles, and soil formation processes. Through the application of advanced Earth system models, we simulate the feedbacks between vegetation and climate, revealing the critical role of plant-driven changes in albedo, evapotranspiration, and carbon sequestration. Our findings demonstrate that the diversification of plant functional traits and strategies during this period led to increased primary productivity, enhanced weathering rates, and substantial modifications to global biogeochemical cycles. This research provides new insights into the co-evolution of plants and Earth's environment, highlighting the importance of vegetation-climate interactions in shaping the planet's long-term ecological and climatic trajectories. By elucidating the mechanisms through which plants transformed Earth's systems in deep time, this study contributes to our understanding of past climate changes and offers valuable perspectives for predicting future ecosystem responses to global environmental challenges."}
