{"Abstract": "This study explores unexpected findings in the hydrological functioning of landscapes, focusing on the interplay between hydrology, ecohydrology, and catchment processes. We employed a multi-faceted approach, combining field observations, isotope tracing techniques, and advanced modeling to investigate water movement and storage across various spatial scales, from hillslopes to entire catchments. Our results revealed several surprising patterns that challenge conventional understanding of runoff generation and water cycling in ecosystems. Notably, we found that subsurface flow paths were more complex and spatially variable than previously thought, with significant implications for both water quantity and quality. Isotope data indicated that vegetation played a more substantial role in modulating catchment hydrology than expected, particularly during drought conditions. Furthermore, our analysis uncovered previously unrecognized temporal dynamics in hillslope-stream connectivity, which have important consequences for predicting flood responses and managing water resources. These instructive surprises highlight the need for a paradigm shift in hydrological conceptualization and modeling approaches. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating ecohydrological processes and embracing the inherent complexity of landscape-scale water cycling to improve our understanding and management of water resources in a changing environment."}
