{"Abstract": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen levels throughout the Phanerozoic eon has been a subject of intense scientific inquiry due to its profound implications for the development of complex life on Earth. This study revisits and refines our understanding of oxygen dynamics during this crucial period, integrating recent advancements in geochemistry, paleontology, and Earth system modeling. By analyzing multiple proxy records, including carbon and sulfur isotopes, trace element distributions, and fossil evidence, we present a comprehensive reconstruction of atmospheric O2 concentrations over the past 541 million years. Our findings reveal significant fluctuations in oxygen levels, with notable peaks during the Carboniferous-Permian and Cretaceous periods, and relative lows in the early Triassic and Jurassic. These variations are closely linked to major events in Earth's history, such as the evolution of land plants, mass extinctions, and changes in global climate. Furthermore, we explore the intricate feedbacks between oxygen availability, the carbon cycle, and the evolution of animal life, providing new insights into the co-evolution of Earth's biosphere and atmosphere. This revised understanding of Phanerozoic oxygen dynamics offers critical context for interpreting the fossil record and elucidating the environmental factors that have shaped the trajectory of life on our planet."}
