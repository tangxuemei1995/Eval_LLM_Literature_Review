{"Abstract": "The formation of Earth's Moon has been a subject of intense scientific inquiry for decades. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of lunar chronology, focusing on the period from the hypothesized giant impact to the solidification of the lunar magma ocean. New analytical techniques, improved isotopic measurements, and refined numerical models have led to significant revisions in the timeline of lunar formation. The giant impact hypothesis remains the leading theory, but the timing of this event has been pushed back to approximately 4.5 billion years ago, earlier than previously thought. The duration of the lunar magma ocean stage has been a topic of considerable debate, with recent studies suggesting a more protracted cooling period lasting up to 200 million years. This extended timeline has important implications for the thermal and chemical evolution of the Moon. Radiometric dating of lunar samples, coupled with geochemical and geophysical modeling, has provided new constraints on the ages of major lunar events and processes. The integration of multiple chronometers, including short-lived and long-lived isotope systems, has improved the precision of age determinations. However, discrepancies between different dating methods and model ages persist, highlighting the complexity of lunar chronology. This review also discusses the implications of revised lunar formation timelines for our understanding of early Solar System dynamics and the evolution of terrestrial planets. The ongoing refinement of lunar chronology continues to shape our perspective on the Moon's origin and early history, underscoring the need for future sample return missions and advanced analytical techniques."}
