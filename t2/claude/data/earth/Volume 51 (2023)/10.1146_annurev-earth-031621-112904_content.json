{"Abstract": "Xenolithic eclogites entrained in kimberlite magmas provide invaluable insights into the composition and evolution of the deep lithospheric mantle and paleo-subduction zones. This study investigates the petrogenesis and geodynamic significance of kimberlite-borne xenolithic eclogites from various cratonic regions worldwide. Detailed petrographic, geochemical, and isotopic analyses reveal diverse origins and complex histories for these enigmatic rocks. Results indicate that many xenolithic eclogites represent fragments of subducted oceanic crust, while others originate from mafic lower crustal cumulates or mantle-derived melts. The eclogites exhibit evidence of multistage metamorphism, metasomatism, and partial melting, reflecting their prolonged residence in the lithospheric mantle. Trace element and isotopic signatures suggest variable degrees of interaction between the eclogites and the surrounding mantle, as well as involvement in deep geochemical cycles. The spatial and temporal distribution of xenolithic eclogites provides crucial information on the architecture and evolution of continental lithosphere. Furthermore, the geochemical characteristics of these rocks offer insights into the nature of paleo-subduction processes and their role in continent formation and stabilization. This study highlights the significance of xenolithic eclogites as unique probes of lithospheric mantle dynamics and emphasizes their importance in understanding the complex interplay between the convecting mantle and continental lithosphere throughout Earth's history."}
