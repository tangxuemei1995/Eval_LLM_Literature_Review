{"Abstract": "Solar geoengineering, a proposed climate intervention strategy to mitigate global warming, has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However, its potential impacts on the hydrological cycle remain poorly understood. This study investigates the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering through a comprehensive analysis of climate model simulations and observational data. We focus on the effects of solar radiation modification on global and regional precipitation patterns, evaporation rates, and overall water availability. Our results indicate that while solar geoengineering may effectively reduce global mean temperature, it could lead to significant alterations in the hydrologic cycle. We find that solar radiation modification techniques tend to decrease global precipitation, particularly in tropical regions, and may exacerbate existing water stress in arid and semi-arid areas. Furthermore, changes in atmospheric circulation patterns induced by solar geoengineering could result in shifts in monsoon systems and extreme precipitation events. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar geoengineering, climate change, and the hydrological cycle, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of potential trade-offs and unintended consequences. Our study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to climate intervention strategies, taking into account not only temperature reduction but also the broader impacts on Earth's water systems and their implications for global water security."}
