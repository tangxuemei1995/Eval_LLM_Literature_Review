{"Abstract": "This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques in earthquake seismology, focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence and neural networks to enhance our understanding and prediction of seismic events. We review recent advancements in machine learning algorithms and their implementation in various aspects of seismological research, including earthquake detection, location, and magnitude estimation. The study highlights the potential of deep learning models to process vast amounts of seismic data more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods. We discuss the challenges and limitations of current machine learning approaches in seismology, such as data quality issues and model interpretability. Additionally, we examine promising future directions, including the development of hybrid models that combine physics-based simulations with data-driven techniques. Our findings suggest that machine learning has the potential to revolutionize earthquake monitoring and forecasting, ultimately contributing to improved hazard assessment and risk mitigation strategies."}
