{"Abstract": "Mars seismology has emerged as a crucial tool for understanding the Red Planet's interior structure and geological activity. The InSight mission, which landed on Mars in 2018, has provided unprecedented data on Martian seismic activity through its highly sensitive seismometer. This abstract summarizes recent advancements in Mars seismology, focusing on marsquakes, impacts, and their implications for the planet's interior structure. Seismic events on Mars, primarily originating from the tectonically active Cerberus Fossae region, have been recorded and analyzed, revealing valuable information about the planet's crust, mantle, and core. Marsquakes, ranging from low to moderate magnitudes, have been detected and characterized, providing insights into the planet's current stress state and potential for ongoing geological processes. Additionally, seismic signals from meteorite impacts have been identified, offering a unique opportunity to study both the planet's interior and its impact flux. The analysis of seismic wave propagation through the Martian interior has led to refined models of the planet's layered structure, including estimates of crustal thickness, mantle composition, and core size. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of Mars' formation, evolution, and potential for past or present habitability. As more data is collected and analyzed, Mars seismology continues to play a pivotal role in unraveling the mysteries of the Red Planet's internal dynamics and geological history."}
