{"Abstract": "Elastic thermobarometry is an emerging technique in metamorphic petrology that utilizes the residual elastic strain preserved in mineral inclusions to determine pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions of rock formation. This method combines principles of elastic deformation with Raman spectroscopy to measure shifts in vibrational modes of trapped inclusions. Unlike traditional thermobarometry, which relies on chemical equilibrium, elastic thermobarometry can provide insights into P-T conditions even when chemical re-equilibration has occurred. The technique exploits the contrast in elastic properties between host and inclusion minerals, allowing for the reconstruction of entrapment conditions. However, challenges arise from the interplay of elastic, viscous, and plastic deformation processes during exhumation. This review explores the theoretical foundations, applications, and limitations of elastic thermobarometry, highlighting its potential to revolutionize our understanding of metamorphic histories in various geological settings."}
