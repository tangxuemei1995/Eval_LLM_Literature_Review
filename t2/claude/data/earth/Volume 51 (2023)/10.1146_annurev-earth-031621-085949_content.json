{"Abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has emerged as a powerful tool in geochemistry, revolutionizing our understanding of Earth's past climates and environments. This review explores the latest advancements and challenges in this rapidly evolving field. Clumped isotope thermometry is based on the temperature-dependent formation of rare isotopologues in carbonate minerals, particularly the 13C-18O bond. Recent developments have significantly improved analytical precision and reduced sample size requirements, expanding the technique's applicability to a wider range of geological and environmental studies. We discuss the current state of calibration efforts, addressing discrepancies between different laboratories and carbonate materials. The review also examines innovative applications in paleoclimatology, diagenesis, and biomineralization, highlighting how clumped isotopes provide unique insights into past temperatures and fluid compositions. Furthermore, we explore the integration of clumped isotope data with other proxies and numerical models, enhancing our ability to reconstruct complex paleoenvironmental conditions. Challenges remain in understanding the effects of kinetic fractionation, solid-state reordering, and other non-equilibrium processes on clumped isotope signatures. Looking ahead, we identify promising research directions, including the development of new analytical techniques, expansion into non-carbonate minerals, and the potential for high-resolution time series reconstructions. This review underscores the transformative impact of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry on geochemistry and its continuing potential to unlock new dimensions in Earth science research."}
