{"Abstract": "The Mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MPT), occurring approximately 0.8-1.2 million years ago, marks a fundamental shift in Earth's climate system, characterized by a change from 41,000-year to 100,000-year glacial-interglacial cycles. This study synthesizes recent paleoclimate research to elucidate the mechanisms driving this transition and its implications for understanding long-term climate variability. We examine multiple proxy records, including ice cores, marine sediments, and terrestrial archives, to reconstruct changes in ice volume, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and global temperature patterns across the MPT. Our analysis reveals that the transition was likely triggered by a complex interplay of orbital forcing, ice sheet dynamics, and carbon cycle feedbacks. We find evidence for a gradual cooling trend and ice sheet expansion in the Northern Hemisphere, which may have altered the sensitivity of the climate system to orbital forcing. Additionally, our results suggest that changes in the carbon cycle, particularly in oceanic carbon storage and release, played a crucial role in amplifying and sustaining the 100,000-year cycles. The study also highlights the importance of non-linear feedbacks and threshold behaviors in the Earth system, which may have contributed to the abrupt shift in glacial-interglacial periodicity. These findings provide new insights into the long-term evolution of Earth's climate and have important implications for predicting future climate change under anthropogenic forcing. Further research is needed to fully unravel the complex interactions between orbital cycles, ice sheets, and the carbon cycle during this critical period in Earth's climate history."}
