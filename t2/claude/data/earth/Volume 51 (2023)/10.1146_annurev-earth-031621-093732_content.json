{"Abstract": "River deltas are dynamic coastal systems that play a crucial role in global ecosystems and human settlements. However, these vulnerable landscapes are increasingly threatened by accelerating sea-level rise due to climate change. This study synthesizes recent research on the complex interactions between river deltas and sea-level rise, focusing on geomorphological processes, sedimentary geology, and shoreline dynamics. We review the latest findings on delta formation, evolution, and response to changing environmental conditions, emphasizing the importance of sediment supply, subsidence, and hydrodynamic forces. Our analysis reveals that while some deltas demonstrate resilience through natural adaptation mechanisms, many are experiencing significant land loss, saltwater intrusion, and habitat degradation. We examine case studies from various global delta systems, highlighting the diverse range of impacts and adaptation strategies employed. The research also explores the implications of sea-level rise on delta-dependent human populations, including the potential for forced migrations and economic disruptions. Furthermore, we discuss emerging approaches in delta management, such as nature-based solutions and integrated coastal zone management, which aim to enhance delta resilience in the face of rising seas. This comprehensive review underscores the urgent need for interdisciplinary research and adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of sea-level rise on river deltas and their associated coastal communities. The findings presented here contribute to a better understanding of delta-sea level interactions and provide valuable insights for policymakers and coastal managers working to protect these vital ecosystems in an era of rapid environmental change."}
