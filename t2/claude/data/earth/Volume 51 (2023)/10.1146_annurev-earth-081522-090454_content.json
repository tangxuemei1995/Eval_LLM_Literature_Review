{"Abstract": "The Amazonian flora, renowned for its exceptional biodiversity, has undergone significant transformations throughout the Neogene period. This study synthesizes geological, palynological, and molecular phylogenetic data to provide a comprehensive perspective on the historical development of Amazonian plant communities. We examine the interplay between tectonic events, particularly the uplift of the Andes, and climatic fluctuations in shaping the region's floral composition and distribution patterns. Palynological records from sedimentary deposits across the Amazon Basin reveal shifts in vegetation types and species assemblages, reflecting changing environmental conditions over millions of years. These fossil pollen data are complemented by molecular phylogenetic analyses of extant taxa, offering insights into the timing and patterns of diversification within key plant lineages. Our findings indicate that the Andean orogeny played a crucial role in driving speciation and migration events, creating new ecological niches and altering drainage patterns. Climate change, including periods of increased aridity and cooler temperatures, further influenced floristic turnover and the expansion of savanna-like ecosystems during certain intervals. The integration of multiple lines of evidence suggests a complex history of plant evolution in Amazonia, characterized by both gradual adaptations and rapid radiations in response to environmental perturbations. This study highlights the importance of considering long-term geological and climatic processes in understanding the origins and maintenance of Amazonian biodiversity. Furthermore, it underscores the value of interdisciplinary approaches in reconstructing past vegetation dynamics and predicting potential responses to future environmental changes in this ecologically critical region."}
