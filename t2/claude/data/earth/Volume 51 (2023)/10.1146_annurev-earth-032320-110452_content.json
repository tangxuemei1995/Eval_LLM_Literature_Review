{"Abstract": "The Gangdese Batholith in southern Tibet provides a unique window into continental crustal growth processes within a magmatic arc setting. This study investigates the temporal and spatial evolution of the batholith to elucidate the mechanisms of crustal stratification and growth in collision zones. Integrating field observations, geochemical analyses, and geochronological data, we reveal a complex history of magmatism spanning from the Late Triassic to the early Miocene. Our results indicate that the batholith formed through multiple pulses of magma emplacement, with distinct compositional trends reflecting changes in tectonic regime and source characteristics. Early stages of arc development are characterized by more mafic compositions, gradually evolving towards more felsic signatures as crustal thickening progressed. Isotopic data suggest a significant contribution from juvenile mantle-derived melts, particularly during the early stages, with increasing crustal assimilation over time. Crustal stratification is evidenced by vertical variations in geochemical and isotopic signatures, indicating a transition from lower crustal melting to upper crustal contamination. The collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates markedly influenced the magmatic evolution, triggering a shift in magma sources and emplacement styles. This study highlights the importance of long-lived magmatic arcs in continental crustal growth and provides insights into the complex interplay between tectonic processes, magma generation, and crustal evolution in collision zones."}
