{"Abstract": "The Phanerozoic eon, spanning approximately 541 million years, has witnessed significant fluctuations in Earth's carbon cycle and climate. This review synthesizes insights from various modeling approaches to elucidate the evolution of carbon sources and sinks throughout this extensive period. We examine how different models, ranging from simple box models to complex Earth system models, have contributed to our understanding of long-term carbon cycle dynamics. The models consistently highlight the critical role of silicate weathering as a primary carbon sink and its feedback mechanisms in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels over geological timescales. They also emphasize the importance of volcanic and metamorphic degassing as major carbon sources, with variations in these processes linked to tectonic activity and paleogeography. Our analysis reveals that models have been instrumental in quantifying the relative contributions of organic carbon burial, carbonate deposition, and weathering to the overall carbon budget. Furthermore, we discuss how models have helped to explain major climatic events and carbon cycle perturbations, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events. The integration of proxy data with modeling results has improved our ability to constrain past atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global temperature trends. However, significant uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the parameterization of biological processes and their evolution over deep time. We identify key areas where model improvements are needed, including better representation of land plants' influence on weathering rates, more accurate reconstructions of paleogeography, and enhanced coupling between the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical cycles. This review underscores the value of modeling approaches in unraveling the complex interplay between the carbon cycle and climate over the Phanerozoic, while also highlighting the ongoing challenges in accurately reconstructing Earth's distant past."}
