{"Abstract": "Oropharyngeal carcinoma, particularly human papillomavirus (HPV)-related squamous cell carcinoma, has emerged as a distinct entity within head and neck cancers. This review explores the unique characteristics of HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), focusing on its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical implications. The rising incidence of HPV-related OPSCC, especially in younger patients, is discussed in the context of changing sexual behaviors and HPV transmission. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying HPV-induced carcinogenesis, including viral integration and oncogene expression. The review highlights the distinct histopathological features of HPV-related OPSCC, notably its nonkeratinizing morphology. Additionally, we explore the complex interplay between HPV and the immune system, elucidating mechanisms of immune escape that contribute to tumor progression. Understanding these aspects is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes in this evolving subset of head and neck cancers."}
