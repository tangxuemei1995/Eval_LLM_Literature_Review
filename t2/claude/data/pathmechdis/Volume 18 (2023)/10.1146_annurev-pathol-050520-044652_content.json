{"Abstract": "Molecular monitoring of lymphomas has emerged as a crucial tool in assessing treatment response and detecting measurable residual disease. This review explores the application of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis and next-generation sequencing techniques in lymphoma management. These non-invasive approaches offer superior sensitivity compared to conventional imaging methods, enabling early detection of relapse and guiding personalized treatment decisions. We discuss the current landscape of ctDNA-based assays, their clinical utility in various lymphoma subtypes, and their potential to revolutionize response assessment criteria. Additionally, we highlight the challenges and future directions in standardizing molecular monitoring techniques for widespread clinical implementation, emphasizing the need for prospective studies to validate their prognostic value in lymphoma care."}
