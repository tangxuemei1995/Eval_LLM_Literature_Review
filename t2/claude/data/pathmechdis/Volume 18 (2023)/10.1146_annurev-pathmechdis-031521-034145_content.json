{"Abstract": "Parkinson's syndrome, encompassing Parkinson's disease and related parkinsonism disorders, is a complex neurodegenerative condition with diverse genetic and environmental factors contributing to its pathogenesis. This review explores the genetic landscape of Parkinson's syndrome, highlighting the roles of key genes such as GBA, LRRK2, and alpha-synuclein. We discuss the emerging concept of oligogenic inheritance and the application of functional genomics in unraveling disease mechanisms. The heterogeneity of Parkinson's syndrome is examined, emphasizing the interplay between genetic variants and cellular processes. Particular attention is given to the involvement of synaptic dysfunction, lysosomal impairment, and mitochondrial abnormalities in disease progression. By integrating recent genetic discoveries with cellular and molecular insights, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of Parkinson's syndrome pathogenesis, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine approaches."}
