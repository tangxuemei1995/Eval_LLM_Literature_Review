{"Abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization is a significant challenge in transfusion medicine, particularly for patients requiring chronic transfusions. This review explores the development and consequences of RBC alloimmunization, focusing on its impact in sickle cell disease. We examine the immunological mechanisms underlying alloantibody formation, risk factors contributing to alloimmunization, and the clinical implications for patients. The review highlights the increased risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions, difficulties in finding compatible blood units, and potential delays in urgent transfusions. Additionally, we discuss current strategies for preventing and managing alloimmunization, including extended antigen matching and immunomodulatory approaches. The growing understanding of genetic factors influencing alloimmunization susceptibility is also addressed. This comprehensive overview emphasizes the need for continued research and improved clinical practices to mitigate the adverse effects of RBC alloimmunization in transfusion-dependent patients."}
