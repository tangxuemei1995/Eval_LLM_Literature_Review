{"Abstract": "Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting millions worldwide, is characterized by airway obstruction and inflammation. Despite extensive research, our understanding of its pathology remains incomplete. This review explores recent advances in asthma pathophysiology, focusing on the role of mucus hypersecretion and its interaction with inflammatory cells. We examine the contribution of galectin-10, a protein highly expressed in eosinophils, to mucus production and airway remodeling. Additionally, we investigate the emerging role of neutrophils in severe asthma and their potential as therapeutic targets. Our analysis reveals that the complex interplay between mucus, inflammatory cells, and structural changes in the airways presents significant challenges in developing effective treatments. We propose that a more comprehensive approach, considering these multiple factors, is necessary to overcome current obstacles in asthma management and to improve patient outcomes."}
