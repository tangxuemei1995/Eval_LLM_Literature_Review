{"Abstract": "Recent studies have unveiled a complex interplay between nerves and cancer, highlighting the significance of neuroepithelial interactions in tumor progression. This review explores the multifaceted relationship between the nervous system and cancer, focusing on axonogenesis, neurogenesis, and perineural invasion. We discuss the emerging evidence of bidirectional communication between cancer cells and nerves, including the role of neurotransmitters and growth factors in tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, we examine the phenomenon of neuronal transdifferentiation in cancer cells and its potential implications for disease progression and treatment resistance. The review also addresses the clinical relevance of these findings, emphasizing the potential for targeting nerve-cancer interactions as a novel therapeutic approach. Understanding these neuroepithelial interactions may provide valuable insights into cancer biology and open new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in oncology."}
