{"Abstract": "Adipose tissue remodeling plays a crucial role in various pathophysiological conditions, including burns, cachexia, and infectious diseases. This review explores the dynamic nature of adipose tissue and its adaptive responses to different stressors. We examine the processes of browning, where white adipose tissue acquires characteristics of brown adipose tissue, and fibrosis, which involves excessive extracellular matrix deposition. The impact of severe burns on adipose tissue metabolism and function is discussed, along with the mechanisms underlying cachexia-induced adipose tissue wasting. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between adipose tissue and infectious diseases, highlighting the tissue's role in immune responses. Understanding these remodeling processes provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for managing metabolic disorders and improving patient outcomes in various pathological conditions."}
