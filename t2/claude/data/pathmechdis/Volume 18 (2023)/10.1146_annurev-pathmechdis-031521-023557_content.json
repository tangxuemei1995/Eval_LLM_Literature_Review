{"Abstract": "Recent studies have unveiled the critical role of tumor cell clusters in orchestrating collective migration and metastasis. This review explores the mechanisms underlying collective metastasis, focusing on polyclonal seeding and the formation of circulating tumor cell clusters. We examine how these clusters facilitate enhanced survival, colonization, and metastatic potential compared to single tumor cells. The review also delves into the complex signaling networks that govern collective migration, highlighting the importance of cell-cell adhesion and communication within clusters. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical implications of these findings, including potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers. Understanding the intricacies of collective metastasis may pave the way for novel strategies to combat cancer progression and improve patient outcomes."}
