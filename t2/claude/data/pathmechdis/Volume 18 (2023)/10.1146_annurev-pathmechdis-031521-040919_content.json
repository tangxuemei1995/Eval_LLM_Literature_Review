{"Abstract": "Osteoclasts, the master sculptors of bone, play a crucial role in skeletal homeostasis through their unique ability to resorb mineralized tissue. This review explores the intricate processes of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, and osteolysis, highlighting the complex interplay between osteoclasts and other bone cells during remodeling. We examine the molecular mechanisms governing osteoclast differentiation, activation, and function, as well as the regulatory pathways that control their activity. Recent advances in understanding the crosstalk between osteoclasts and the immune system are discussed, shedding light on the pathogenesis of bone-related disorders. Furthermore, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption for the treatment of osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other skeletal diseases. This comprehensive overview underscores the significance of osteoclasts in maintaining bone health and their potential as therapeutic targets in skeletal disorders."}
