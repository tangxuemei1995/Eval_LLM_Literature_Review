{"Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with increasing evidence suggesting a strong link between metabolism and CRC development. This review explores the complex interplay between metabolic processes, diet, and the gut microbiome in CRC pathogenesis. We examine how alterations in cellular metabolism, including dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism, contribute to tumor growth and progression. The impact of dietary factors on CRC risk is discussed, highlighting the role of specific nutrients and dietary patterns in modulating cancer-related metabolic pathways. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the gut microbiome on CRC development through its effects on host metabolism and immune responses. Understanding these metabolic interactions provides valuable insights into potential prevention strategies and targeted therapeutic approaches for CRC, emphasizing the importance of personalized nutrition and microbiome modulation in cancer management."}
