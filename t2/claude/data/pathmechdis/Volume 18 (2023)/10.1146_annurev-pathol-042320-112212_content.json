{"Abstract": "Tuft cells, a conserved epithelial cell lineage, play crucial roles in various tissues, particularly in type II taste transduction and immune regulation. This review explores the context- and tissue-specific programming of tuft cells, highlighting their diverse functions across different organ systems. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying tuft cell development and activation, focusing on key signaling pathways involving IL-25, acetylcholine, and cysteinyl leukotrienes. The review also discusses the importance of tuft cells in mucociliary clearance and their contribution to type 2 immunity. By synthesizing recent findings, we provide insights into the plasticity and adaptability of tuft cells in response to environmental cues and tissue-specific demands. Understanding the multifaceted nature of tuft cells may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for various epithelial-related disorders and immune-mediated diseases."}
