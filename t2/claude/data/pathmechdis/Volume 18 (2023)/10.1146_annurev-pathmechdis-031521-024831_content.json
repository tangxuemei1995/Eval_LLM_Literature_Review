{"Abstract": "The liver's unique spatial organization and circadian rhythm play crucial roles in its metabolic functions and pathophysiology. This review explores the intricate relationship between spatiotemporal liver zonation and its impact on various hepatic processes. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation, with a focus on WNT signaling and its influence on metabolic gradients across hepatic lobules. The circadian regulation of liver metabolism is discussed, highlighting its importance in maintaining homeostasis and influencing drug metabolism. We analyze how disruptions in spatial and temporal liver zonation contribute to the development of liver diseases, including monogenic disorders and complex pathologies. The review also addresses the implications of liver zonation on hepatic detoxification processes and drug metabolism, emphasizing the potential for chronopharmacological approaches in liver disease treatment. By integrating current knowledge on spatiotemporal liver zonation, this review provides insights into the complex interplay between liver structure, function, and pathophysiology, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies in hepatology."}
