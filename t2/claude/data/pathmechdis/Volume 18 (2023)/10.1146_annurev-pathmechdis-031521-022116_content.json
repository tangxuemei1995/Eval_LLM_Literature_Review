{"Abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, have emerged as crucial mediators of intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment. This review explores the multifaceted roles of tumor-derived EVs in modulating the behavior of various cell types, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. We discuss the diverse EV cargoes, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, and their impact on recipient cells. The review highlights how EVs influence cell migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis through the transfer of bioactive molecules. Additionally, we examine the potential of EVs as liquid biopsies for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The complex interplay between tumor-derived EVs and the surrounding stromal cells is analyzed, revealing novel insights into tumor progression and potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the intricate functions of EVs in the tumor microenvironment may pave the way for innovative cancer treatment strategies and improved diagnostic tools."}
