{"Abstract": "African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, remains a significant health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. This review explores the complex pathogenesis of the disease, focusing on the intricate interplay between African trypanosomes and host immune responses. We examine the parasites' remarkable ability to evade host defenses through antigenic variation, particularly the role of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) in this process. The review also discusses the host's innate immune mechanisms, including the trypanolytic factor apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). Interestingly, APOL1 variants that confer resistance to trypanosomiasis are associated with increased risk of kidney disease in affected populations. By elucidating these molecular interactions and their consequences, this review aims to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for managing both African trypanosomiasis and related kidney disorders."}
