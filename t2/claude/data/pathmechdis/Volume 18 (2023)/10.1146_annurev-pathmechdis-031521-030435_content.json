{"Abstract": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) remains a significant global health concern, with recent advances shedding light on its complex pathogenesis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on key mechanisms underlying ALD progression. Emerging evidence highlights the crucial role of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, in hepatocyte injury and inflammation. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been identified as central mediators of the innate immune response in ALD, while the complement system's involvement in liver damage and repair has gained attention. The gut-liver axis has emerged as a critical factor, with alcohol-induced intestinal dysbiosis and increased gut permeability contributing to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Understanding these interconnected pathways provides new insights into potential therapeutic targets for ALD. This review aims to summarize recent findings and their implications for developing novel treatment strategies to combat this prevalent liver disease."}
