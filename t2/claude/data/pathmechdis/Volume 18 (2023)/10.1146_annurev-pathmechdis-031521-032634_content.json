{"Abstract": "Celiac disease is a complex autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. This review explores the immunobiology and pathogenesis of celiac disease, focusing on the interplay between genetic factors, particularly HLA-DQ2/DQ8, and environmental triggers. We discuss the crucial roles of both innate and adaptive immune responses, including the activation of gluten-specific T cells and the production of autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2. The review also examines the involvement of B cells in disease progression and the potential for novel therapeutic approaches targeting key immunological pathways. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing improved diagnostic tools and targeted treatments for celiac disease."}
