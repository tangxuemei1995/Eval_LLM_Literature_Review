{"Abstract": "Viral lung infections, particularly influenza, can cause severe damage to the alveolar epithelium, disrupting respiratory function and homeostasis. This review explores the intricate processes of regeneration, repair, and reestablishment of homeostasis between the alveolar epithelium and innate immune system following viral-induced lung injury. We examine the roles of various alveolar epithelial cell types in initiating and coordinating repair mechanisms, focusing on their interactions with innate immune cells. The review highlights the importance of epithelial progenitor cells in regenerating damaged tissue and the complex signaling pathways involved in this process. Additionally, we discuss the delicate balance between protective and potentially harmful immune responses during the repair phase. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies to enhance lung repair and prevent long-term complications following viral infections. This knowledge may also provide insights into other forms of acute lung injury and chronic respiratory diseases."}
