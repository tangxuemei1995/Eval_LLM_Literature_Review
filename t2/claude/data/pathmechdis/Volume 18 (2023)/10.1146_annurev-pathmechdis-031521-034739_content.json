{"Abstract": "This review explores the pathogenesis of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, focusing on its cellular tropism, interactions with the host ubiquitin system, and mechanisms of immune response antagonism. ZIKV, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has gained global attention due to its association with severe neurological complications. We discuss the virus's ability to infect various cell types, particularly neural progenitor cells, and its impact on fetal development. The role of ubiquitin in ZIKV replication and the virus's manipulation of host ubiquitination processes are examined, with special emphasis on the interaction between ZIKV and TRIM7, a member of the tripartite motif protein family. Additionally, we analyze ZIKV's strategies for evading host immune responses, including interference with interferon signaling pathways. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutic interventions and preventive strategies against ZIKV infection."}
