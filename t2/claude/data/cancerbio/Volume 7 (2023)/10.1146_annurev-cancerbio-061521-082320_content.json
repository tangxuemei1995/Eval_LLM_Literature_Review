{"Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells represent a promising frontier in cancer immunotherapy. This review explores the potential of CAR NK cells as an off-the-shelf product for cancer treatment, highlighting their advantages over traditional CAR T cells. We discuss the unique properties of NK cells, including their innate tumor-killing abilities and reduced risk of cytokine release syndrome. The article examines recent advancements in CAR NK cell engineering, focusing on enhanced targeting specificity and persistence. Additionally, we address challenges in large-scale production and clinical translation. With ongoing clinical trials showing encouraging results, CAR NK cells are poised to revolutionize cancer treatment, offering a potentially safer and more accessible alternative to current cell therapies."}
