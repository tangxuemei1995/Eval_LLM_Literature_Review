{"Abstract": "Recent advances in sequencing technologies have revealed the presence of somatic mutations in normal tissues, challenging our understanding of early carcinogenesis. This review explores the accumulation of mutations in stem cells throughout the aging process and their potential role in cancer initiation. We discuss how environmental carcinogens and endogenous processes contribute to the mutational landscape of normal tissues, and examine the implications for cancer prevention strategies. The concept of field cancerization is revisited in light of these findings, highlighting the importance of early detection and intervention. Furthermore, we analyze the interplay between stem cell dynamics, tissue microenvironment, and mutational burden in driving neoplastic transformation. This emerging field offers new perspectives on cancer risk assessment and opens avenues for developing targeted prevention approaches aimed at maintaining genomic integrity in aging tissues."}
