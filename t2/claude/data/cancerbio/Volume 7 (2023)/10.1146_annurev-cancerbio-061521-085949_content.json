{"Abstract": "This review explores the pivotal roles of macrophages and dendritic cells in the cancer microenvironment, focusing on their biological functions and potential as therapeutic targets. We examine the complex interactions between these mononuclear phagocytes and tumor cells, highlighting their impact on cancer progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. The plasticity of macrophages and dendritic cells in response to environmental cues is discussed, emphasizing their dual nature in both promoting and inhibiting tumor growth. We analyze current strategies for modulating these cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity, including reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages and optimizing dendritic cell-based immunotherapies. Additionally, we evaluate emerging approaches that combine targeting of mononuclear phagocytes with existing cancer treatments. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the intricate biology of macrophages and dendritic cells in cancer and their potential for therapeutic manipulation."}
