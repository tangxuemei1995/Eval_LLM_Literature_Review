{"Abstract": "This review explores the potential of T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular therapy in targeting driver oncogenes and public neoantigens for cancer treatment. We discuss recent advances in identifying and characterizing these tumor-specific antigens, which are shared across multiple patients and cancer types. The study highlights the advantages of targeting public neoantigens, including their prevalence and potential for off-the-shelf therapies. We examine various TCR-based approaches, such as engineered T cells and TCR-mimic antibodies, and their efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings. Additionally, we address challenges in developing these therapies, including optimal target selection, TCR affinity optimization, and potential off-target effects. The review concludes by outlining future directions for improving TCR-based cellular therapies and their potential impact on cancer immunotherapy outcomes."}
