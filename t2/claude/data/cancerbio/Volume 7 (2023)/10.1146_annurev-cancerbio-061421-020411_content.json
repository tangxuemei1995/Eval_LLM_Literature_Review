{"Abstract": "Combination therapies have emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment, offering potential advantages over single-agent interventions. This review explores the rationales behind combining therapies, focusing on three key mechanisms: independent action, response correlation, and collateral sensitivity, as well as synergy. We examine how these concepts influence treatment outcomes and discuss their implications for clinical trial design. Particular attention is given to the role of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in combination strategies, highlighting their potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy. By analyzing the interplay between different treatment modalities, we aim to provide insights into optimizing combination therapies for improved patient outcomes. This comprehensive overview of combination therapy rationales serves as a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop more effective cancer treatment strategies and design targeted clinical trials."}
