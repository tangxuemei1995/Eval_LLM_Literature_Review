{"Abstract": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet many tumors remain unresponsive due to their 'cold' immunosuppressive microenvironment. This review explores strategies to convert cold tumors into 'hot' immunogenic ones, enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We discuss approaches such as radiation therapy, oncolytic viruses, and targeted molecular agents that can stimulate immune cell infiltration and activation. Recent clinical trials combining these strategies with immunotherapies are examined, highlighting promising outcomes and potential challenges. By understanding and manipulating the tumor microenvironment, we can potentially expand the reach of immunotherapy to a broader range of cancer patients."}
