{"Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a significant challenge in the development of effective treatments for central nervous system (CNS) tumors. This review explores the implications of the BBB for experimental cancer therapeutics, focusing on its impact on drug delivery, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. We examine recent advances in strategies to overcome the BBB, including novel drug formulations, targeted delivery systems, and methods to temporarily disrupt the barrier. The review also discusses the importance of considering BBB permeability in the early stages of therapeutic development for CNS tumors. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of emerging technologies, such as nanoparticle-based therapies and gene editing approaches, in addressing the BBB challenge. Understanding and addressing the BBB's role in drug efficacy is crucial for improving outcomes in patients with CNS tumors and advancing the field of neuro-oncology."}
