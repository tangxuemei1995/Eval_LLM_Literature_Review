{"Abstract": "Intratumor heterogeneity poses significant challenges in cancer treatment, particularly in the context of immunotherapy. This review explores the complex relationship between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance, focusing on its implications for immune checkpoint inhibition. We examine how diverse subclonal populations within tumors can influence immune recognition, escape mechanisms, and treatment responses. Recent studies have revealed that clonal neoantigen burden and T cell infiltration patterns are critical determinants of immunotherapy efficacy. Furthermore, we discuss how heterogeneity-driven immune evasion strategies can lead to treatment resistance and disease progression. Understanding these intricate interactions is crucial for developing more effective immunotherapeutic approaches and personalized treatment strategies. This review highlights the need for innovative techniques to assess and target clonal heterogeneity in order to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy."}
