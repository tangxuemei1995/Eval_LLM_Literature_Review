{"Abstract": "Tumor organoids have emerged as powerful tools for cancer research, but their limited representation of the tumor immune microenvironment remains a significant challenge. This review explores recent advances in engineering immune components into organoid models, focusing on patient-derived organoids and coculture systems. We discuss various strategies for incorporating immune cells into organoid cultures, including the development of coculture organoids that better recapitulate the complex interactions between tumor cells and immune cells. The integration of diverse immune cell types, such as T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages, into organoid models is examined, along with the challenges and opportunities presented by these approaches. Furthermore, we highlight the potential applications of immune-competent organoid models in cancer immunotherapy research, drug screening, and personalized medicine. This review underscores the importance of engineering the immune microenvironment into organoid models to enhance their physiological relevance and translational potential in cancer research and therapy development."}
