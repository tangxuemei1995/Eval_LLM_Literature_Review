{"Abstract": "Recent studies have unveiled the critical role of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the formation of biomolecular condensates, which are implicated in various cellular processes. This review explores the emerging significance of phase-separated condensates in fusion oncoprotein-driven cancers. We examine how these condensates influence transcriptional regulation, kinase signaling, and other oncogenic processes. The review highlights the sequence features and intrinsically disordered regions that contribute to the phase separation properties of fusion oncoproteins. We discuss how these condensates can alter gene expression patterns, enhance signaling pathway activation, and promote cancer progression. Furthermore, we explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting phase-separated condensates in fusion oncoprotein-driven cancers. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these malignancies and opens new avenues for developing targeted therapies."}
