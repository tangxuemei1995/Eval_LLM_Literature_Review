{"Abstract": "The intersection of immune cell metabolism and immuno-oncology has emerged as a critical area of research in cancer therapeutics. This review explores the complex interplay between immune cell metabolic pathways and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the potential for targeting metabolic processes to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. We discuss how cancer cells manipulate the metabolic landscape to evade immune surveillance and suppress effector immune cell functions. Recent advances in understanding the metabolic requirements of various immune cell subsets, including T cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells, are examined. Additionally, we evaluate promising strategies for metabolic reprogramming of immune cells to improve their anti-tumor efficacy. The review also addresses the challenges and opportunities in developing metabolism-targeted immunotherapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the metabolic crosstalk between immune cells and cancer cells. Overall, this work underscores the importance of immunometabolism in shaping the future of immuno-oncology and personalized cancer treatment approaches."}
