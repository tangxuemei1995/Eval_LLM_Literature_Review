{"Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by an extensive desmoplastic reaction and a complex tumor microenvironment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in this microenvironment, contributing to tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the multifaceted roles of CAFs in pancreatic cancer. We explore the origins, heterogeneity, and functional diversity of CAFs, highlighting their interactions with cancer cells and other stromal components. The review discusses how CAFs modulate the extracellular matrix, influence immune cell infiltration, and promote tumor growth through paracrine signaling. We examine the emerging concept of CAF subtypes and their distinct contributions to pancreatic cancer biology. Furthermore, we analyze the potential of targeting CAFs as a therapeutic strategy, including approaches to reprogram or eliminate these cells. The challenges and opportunities in translating CAF-directed therapies from preclinical models to clinical applications are critically evaluated. By dissecting the lessons learned from pancreatic cancer, this review provides insights into the broader implications of CAFs in cancer biology and potential avenues for improving patient outcomes in this devastating disease."}
