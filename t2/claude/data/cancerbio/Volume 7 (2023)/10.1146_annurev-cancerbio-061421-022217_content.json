{"Abstract": "FLASH radiotherapy, characterized by ultrahigh dose rates, has emerged as a groundbreaking approach in cancer treatment. This review explores the fundamental principles of FLASH radiotherapy and its potential to revolutionize radiobiology. We compare FLASH to conventional radiotherapy, highlighting its unique ability to spare normal tissues while maintaining isoefficient tumor killing. The underlying mechanisms of the FLASH effect are examined, including oxygen depletion, DNA damage response, and immune system modulation. We discuss the challenges in translating FLASH to clinical practice, such as technical limitations and dosimetry concerns. Finally, we consider the implications of FLASH for radiobiology research and the need to reevaluate established radiobiological models in light of this innovative treatment modality."}
