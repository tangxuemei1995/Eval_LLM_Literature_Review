{"Abstract": "Recent advances in lineage tracing techniques have revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology and tumor evolution. This review explores cutting-edge tools for in vivo lineage tracing in cancer research, focusing on single-cell analysis and cell barcoding methods. We discuss how these technologies enable the tracking of individual cancer cells and their progeny throughout tumor progression and metastasis. The integration of genetic barcoding with high-throughput sequencing has provided unprecedented insights into clonal dynamics and heterogeneity within tumors. Additionally, we examine the application of CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage tracing systems, which offer enhanced spatiotemporal resolution and multiplexing capabilities. These innovative approaches have revealed critical information about cancer stem cells, therapy resistance, and metastatic potential. By elucidating the complex cellular hierarchies and evolutionary trajectories within tumors, these new lineage tracing tools are poised to significantly impact cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies."}
