{"Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary approach in cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating remarkable success in treating certain hematological malignancies. However, the efficacy of CAR T cells in solid tumors remains limited due to various resistance mechanisms. This review explores the intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to CAR T cell resistance, including antigen loss, T cell exhaustion, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We discuss the molecular and cellular pathways involved in these resistance mechanisms and highlight potential strategies to overcome them. Recent advances in CAR design, combination therapies, and novel targeting approaches are examined as promising avenues to enhance CAR T cell efficacy. Understanding and addressing these resistance mechanisms is crucial for improving the clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapy and expanding its application to a broader range of cancer types."}
