{"Abstract": "Cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, plays a complex and paradoxical role in cancer biology. This review explores the dual nature of senescence in tumor suppression and promotion. We discuss how senescence acts as a barrier to malignant transformation through growth arrest and immune surveillance, while simultaneously contributing to tumor progression via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The potential of therapy-induced senescence as a cancer treatment strategy is examined, along with the emerging concept of 'one-two punch' therapy combining senescence induction with senolytic drugs. We also address the challenges and opportunities in targeting senescent cells within the tumor microenvironment. This comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between senescence and cancer, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach in harnessing senescence for therapeutic interventions."}
