{"Abstract": "Estrogen receptor (ER) signaling plays a crucial role in breast cancer development and progression. This review explores the latest advancements in ER-targeted therapeutics, focusing on next-generation selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs). We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these novel compounds and their potential to overcome resistance to current endocrine therapies. The review highlights recent clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of emerging SERMs and SERDs, as well as their impact on patient outcomes. Additionally, we examine combination strategies involving these agents with other targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Finally, we address the challenges and future directions in developing more potent and selective ER-targeted therapeutics, emphasizing the importance of personalized medicine approaches in breast cancer treatment."}
