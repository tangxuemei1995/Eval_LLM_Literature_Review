{"Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing computational pathology in cancer research and diagnosis. This review explores the integration of machine learning and deep learning techniques in oncology, focusing on their applications in tumor detection, biomarker identification, and histopathological analysis. We examine how AI-driven approaches are enhancing diagnostic workflows, improving accuracy, and potentially leading to better clinical outcomes. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities in implementing AI systems for analyzing complex pathological data, including issues of data quality, model interpretability, and clinical validation. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of AI to uncover novel biomarkers and patterns in histopathological images that may escape human detection. While acknowledging the promising advancements, we also address the need for robust validation studies and ethical considerations in the clinical adoption of AI-assisted pathology tools for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning."}
