{"Abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a debilitating condition affecting millions worldwide, remains a significant challenge in pain management. This review explores the complex mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain, with a focus on sex differences and similarities in its manifestation and treatment. We examine the intricate interplay between immune cells and neurons in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain, highlighting key molecular pathways and cellular interactions. The paper discusses emerging evidence of sex-specific differences in pain processing, including variations in immune responses and neuromodulation. Additionally, we evaluate potential therapeutic approaches that consider these sex-based distinctions, emphasizing the importance of tailored treatment strategies. By synthesizing current research on neuropathic pain mechanisms and sex-specific factors, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of this global health issue and guide future directions in developing more effective, personalized interventions for neuropathic pain management."}
