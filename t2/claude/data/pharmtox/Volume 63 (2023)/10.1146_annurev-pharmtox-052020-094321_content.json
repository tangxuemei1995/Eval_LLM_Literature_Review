{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive roadmap for achieving universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV/AIDS patients globally. The study analyzes current barriers to ART access and proposes strategies to overcome them, aligning with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. Key focus areas include improving HIV testing rates, enhancing linkage to care, and ensuring long-term adherence to treatment. The roadmap emphasizes the importance of health system strengthening, community engagement, and innovative service delivery models. It also addresses challenges related to drug resistance, immune reconstitution, and the need for sustainable funding mechanisms. By implementing these evidence-based interventions, the authors argue that universal ART coverage can be achieved, leading to significant reductions in HIV transmission rates and improved health outcomes for people living with HIV/AIDS. This roadmap provides a valuable framework for policymakers and healthcare professionals working towards ending the AIDS epidemic."}
