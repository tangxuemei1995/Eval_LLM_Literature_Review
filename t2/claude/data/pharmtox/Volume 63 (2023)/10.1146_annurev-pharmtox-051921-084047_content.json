{"Abstract": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have emerged as promising candidates for resolution pharmacology in the management of pain and itch. This review explores the neuroimmune modulatory effects of SPMs, particularly resolvins and neuroprotectins, on nociceptive sensory neurons and their potential to alleviate chronic pain and pruritus. We discuss the mechanisms by which SPMs interact with TRP channels and other molecular targets to attenuate neuronal hyperexcitability and inflammation. Recent preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of SPMs in various pain and itch models are examined, highlighting their potential as novel therapeutic agents. Additionally, we address the challenges and opportunities in translating SPM-based therapies from bench to bedside, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize their clinical application in pain and itch management."}
