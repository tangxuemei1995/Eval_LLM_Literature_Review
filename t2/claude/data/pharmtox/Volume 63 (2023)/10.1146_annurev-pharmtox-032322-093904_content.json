{"Abstract": "Obesity and its associated metabolic complications pose significant health challenges worldwide. This review explores the potential of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-based pharmacotherapies as novel treatments for obesity-related metabolic disorders. We examine the role of FGFs in regulating energy homeostasis, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Recent advances in developing FGF analogs and agonistic antibodies targeting FGF receptors are discussed, highlighting their therapeutic potential. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of FGF-based interventions in improving insulin sensitivity, reducing body weight, and alleviating metabolic dysfunction are critically evaluated. Additionally, we address the challenges and limitations of current FGF-based approaches, including off-target effects and the need for optimized delivery methods. This review provides insights into the promising future of FGF-based protein therapeutics in combating obesity and its metabolic complications, emphasizing the importance of continued research and development in this field."}
