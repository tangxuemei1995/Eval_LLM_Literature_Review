{"Abstract": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-ω3-PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their potential cardiovascular benefits. This review examines the pros and cons of LC-ω3-PUFAs in cardiovascular health. While numerous studies have demonstrated their positive effects on reducing inflammation, improving lipid profiles, and potentially lowering the risk of cardiovascular events, conflicting evidence exists regarding their efficacy in preventing heart disease. Some research suggests that high doses of LC-ω3-PUFAs may increase the risk of atrial fibrillation in certain populations. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the sustainability of fish oil sources and potential contamination with environmental pollutants. This review aims to provide a balanced perspective on the current evidence surrounding LC-ω3-PUFAs and their role in cardiovascular health, highlighting both the potential benefits and limitations of their use."}
