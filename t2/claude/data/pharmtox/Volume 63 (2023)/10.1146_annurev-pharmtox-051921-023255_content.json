{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in drug discovery has revolutionized the lead-to-candidate decision-making process. This review explores the applications of AI and ML in enhancing decision quality throughout the drug development pipeline. We examine how these technologies improve the efficiency and accuracy of computational toxicology, target identification, and lead optimization. The paper discusses the implementation of advanced algorithms for predicting drug-like properties, toxicity profiles, and potential off-target effects. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of AI-driven approaches on reducing attrition rates and accelerating the transition from lead compounds to viable drug candidates. The review also highlights the challenges and limitations of current AI/ML methodologies in drug discovery, emphasizing the need for continuous refinement and validation of these tools. Finally, we provide insights into future directions and potential breakthroughs in AI-assisted drug discovery processes."}
