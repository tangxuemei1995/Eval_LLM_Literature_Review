{"Abstract": "This review explores the role of key drug transporters, including OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MRP2, MRP4, and BCRP, in the context of the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory. These transporters, belonging to the SLC22, SLCO, and ABC families, play crucial roles in the absorption, distribution, and elimination of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. The Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory proposes that these transporters function as a coordinated network to maintain homeostasis by sensing and regulating the levels of metabolites, signaling molecules, and xenobiotics across different organs and tissues. This review examines the molecular mechanisms, substrate specificity, and physiological functions of these transporters, as well as their involvement in drug-drug interactions and disease states. Furthermore, it discusses how the interplay between these transporters contributes to the body's ability to detect and respond to changes in the internal and external environment, highlighting the importance of this theory in understanding drug disposition and toxicity."}
