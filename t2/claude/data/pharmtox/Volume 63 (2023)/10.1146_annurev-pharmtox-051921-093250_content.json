{"Abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia that significantly impacts patients' functional outcomes. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, focusing on the roles of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission. We examine the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction in cognitive impairment and its potential as a therapeutic target. The review also discusses the utility of mismatch negativity, an event-related potential, as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we evaluate current pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches aimed at improving cognitive function in schizophrenia patients. By synthesizing recent findings in neurobiology and clinical research, this review provides insights into the complex relationship between cognitive impairment and schizophrenia, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies to enhance cognitive outcomes in this patient population."}
