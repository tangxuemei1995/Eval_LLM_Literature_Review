{"Abstract": "The integration of electronic health records (EHRs) and genomic data has emerged as a powerful approach for drug discovery. This review explores the synergistic potential of EHRs and genomics in identifying novel drug targets and repurposing existing medications. We discuss the application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) in leveraging large-scale EHR data to uncover genetic associations with disease phenotypes. Additionally, we examine the role of Mendelian randomization in establishing causal relationships between genetic variants and drug targets. The review highlights successful case studies where EHR-genomic integration has led to the discovery of promising drug candidates. Furthermore, we address the challenges and limitations of this approach, including data quality, privacy concerns, and the need for diverse population representation. Finally, we provide insights into future directions and the potential impact of EHR-genomic integration on personalized medicine and drug development pipelines."}
