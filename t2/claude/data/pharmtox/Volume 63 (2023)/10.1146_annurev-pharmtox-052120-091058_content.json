{"Abstract": "Biased agonism, a phenomenon where ligands selectively activate specific signaling pathways downstream of a receptor, has emerged as a promising approach in drug discovery. This review focuses on the lessons learned from studies of opioid receptor agonists, which have been at the forefront of biased agonism research. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand bias at opioid receptors, particularly the differential activation of G protein and Î²-arrestin pathways. The potential therapeutic implications of biased agonism are discussed, including the development of analgesics with reduced side effects. We also address the challenges in quantifying and interpreting ligand bias, as well as the complexities of translating in vitro findings to in vivo efficacy. Finally, we highlight recent advances in structural biology and computational approaches that are enhancing our understanding of biased agonism at opioid receptors and guiding future drug design efforts."}
