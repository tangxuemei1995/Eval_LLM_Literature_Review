{"Abstract": "KATP channels, composed of Kir6.x and SURx subunits, play crucial roles in various physiological processes. Mutations in these subunits can lead to severe pathologies, including congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant√∫ syndrome. This review explores recent advances in personalized therapeutics for KATP-dependent disorders. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions and the development of targeted therapies based on specific genetic mutations. The potential of pharmacological modulators, gene therapy approaches, and precision medicine strategies in treating KATP-related diseases is examined. Additionally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities in translating these personalized interventions from bench to bedside. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the future of tailored treatments for patients with KATP-dependent pathologies, emphasizing the importance of genetic profiling and individualized therapeutic approaches."}
