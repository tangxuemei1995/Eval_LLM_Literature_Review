{"Abstract": "Lipoxins, endogenous pro-resolving mediators, play a crucial role in the resolution of inflammation. This review explores the potential of lipoxin mimetics as therapeutic agents for inflammatory disorders and fibrosis. We focus on two novel lipoxin analogs, AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT, which demonstrate enhanced stability and potency compared to natural lipoxins. These mimetics exhibit promising anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties in various preclinical models, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases. By promoting the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair, lipoxin mimetics offer a novel approach to treating chronic inflammatory conditions. We discuss the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles of these compounds, as well as their potential advantages over traditional anti-inflammatory therapies. The development of lipoxin mimetics represents a significant advancement in the field of inflammation resolution and may lead to more effective treatments for a wide range of inflammatory disorders."}
