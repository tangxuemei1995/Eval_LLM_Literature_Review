{"Abstract": "This review examines the current pharmacological interventions used in labor and delivery, focusing on their effects on myometrial function and their role in managing common obstetric complications. We explore the mechanisms of action and efficacy of drugs used to address dystocia, preterm delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage. The review highlights the importance of understanding uterine contractility and the molecular pathways involved in myometrial activation. We discuss the use of oxytocin receptor agonists and antagonists, prostaglandins, and tocolytics in modulating uterine contractions. Additionally, we evaluate the potential of emerging therapies targeting specific molecular pathways in the myometrium. The review emphasizes the need for personalized approaches in pharmacological management of labor and delivery, considering the complex interplay between maternal factors, fetal well-being, and drug efficacy. Finally, we identify areas for future research to improve outcomes in obstetric care."}
