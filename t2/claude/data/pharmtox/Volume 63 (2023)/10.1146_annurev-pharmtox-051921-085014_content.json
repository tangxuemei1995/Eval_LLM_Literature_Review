{"Abstract": "Leukotrienes, derived from arachidonic acid, play a crucial role in inflammatory processes and are implicated in various endemic diseases. This review examines the structural biology of key leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes and its application in structure-based drug design. Recent advancements in crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of these enzymes. We discuss how this structural information has facilitated the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting leukotriene pathways. The review highlights successful examples of structure-guided drug discovery, including inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene receptors. Additionally, we explore emerging strategies for modulating leukotriene biosynthesis and signaling, offering promising avenues for treating inflammatory disorders and related endemic diseases. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of structural biology in advancing leukotriene-targeted therapeutics."}
