{"Abstract": "Granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, play crucial roles in innate immunity and inflammation. However, dysregulation of granulocyte function and survival can contribute to various pathological conditions. This review explores the potential of pharmacologically induced granulocyte cell death as a therapeutic strategy for treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying granulocyte apoptosis and discuss how these pathways can be targeted by novel drug candidates. The review also compares the efficacy and specificity of granulocyte-targeted therapies with existing treatments that affect broader lymphocyte populations. Furthermore, we address the challenges and potential side effects associated with manipulating granulocyte survival, including the risk of compromising host defense. Finally, we highlight promising preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inducing granulocyte apoptosis in various disease models, paving the way for future targeted immunomodulatory therapies."}
