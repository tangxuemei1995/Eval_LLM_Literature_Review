{"Abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, initially developed for treating erectile dysfunction, have shown promising therapeutic potential beyond their primary indication. This review explores the expanding applications of PDE5 inhibitors in various clinical disorders. By modulating the cGMP signaling pathway, these drugs demonstrate beneficial effects on endothelial function, cardioprotection, and metabolic disorders. Recent studies have also revealed their potential in addressing age-related conditions and certain types of cancer. The pleiotropic effects of PDE5 inhibitors on multiple organ systems highlight their versatility as therapeutic agents. This paper examines the current evidence supporting the use of PDE5 inhibitors in these diverse clinical contexts, discussing their mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety profiles. The findings suggest that PDE5 inhibitors may offer novel treatment strategies for a wide range of disorders, warranting further investigation into their broader clinical applications."}
