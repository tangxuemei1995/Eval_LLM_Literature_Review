{"Abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) have emerged as a significant public health concern, representing a diverse class of new psychoactive substances designed to mimic the effects of cannabis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs, focusing on their interaction with the endocannabinoid system and their potential for abuse. We examine the chemical structures, mechanisms of action, and metabolic pathways of various SC compounds, highlighting their increased potency and unpredictable effects compared to natural cannabinoids. The review also addresses the challenges in detection, regulation, and treatment of SC-related substance use disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the acute and chronic health risks associated with SC consumption, including cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric complications. This analysis underscores the urgent need for improved monitoring, prevention strategies, and targeted interventions to address the growing threat posed by synthetic cannabinoids in the landscape of drug abuse."}
