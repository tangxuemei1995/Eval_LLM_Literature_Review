{"Abstract": "Zebrafish have emerged as a powerful and versatile model organism for in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology studies. This review explores the advantages of zebrafish as a scalable in vivo model, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between traditional in vitro assays and mammalian models. We discuss the unique features of zebrafish, including their rapid development, optical transparency, and genetic similarity to humans, which make them ideal for high-throughput screening and mechanistic studies. The review also examines recent advances in zebrafish-based assays for drug discovery, toxicity assessment, and disease modeling. Furthermore, we address the challenges and limitations of using zebrafish as an alternative model and provide insights into future directions for improving their predictive power and translational relevance. Overall, this review underscores the growing importance of zebrafish in accelerating drug development and toxicology research."}
