{"Abstract": "The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has emerged as a crucial mediator of estrogen signaling, offering novel insights into the complex mechanisms of estrogen action. This review explores the molecular pharmacology of GPER and its potential therapeutic applications across various physiological systems. We examine the receptor's structure, signaling pathways, and interactions with both endogenous and synthetic ligands. The diverse roles of GPER in cancer, cardiovascular health, endocrine function, immunity, and metabolism are discussed, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target. Recent advances in developing GPER-selective agonists and antagonists have opened new avenues for drug discovery and personalized medicine. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of GPER in estrogen biology and its promising potential in treating a wide range of diseases, from hormone-dependent cancers to metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases."}
