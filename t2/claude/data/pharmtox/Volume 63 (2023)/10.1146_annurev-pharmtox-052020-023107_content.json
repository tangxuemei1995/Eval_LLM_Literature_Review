{"Abstract": "Aspirin, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has gained renewed interest in the field of cancer chemoprevention. This review explores recent pharmacological developments and the potential of aspirin in cancer prevention. We examine the drug's mechanism of action, focusing on its effects on cyclooxygenase enzymes and the subsequent modulation of prostaglandin, thromboxane, and prostacyclin synthesis. The paper discusses emerging evidence supporting aspirin's chemopreventive properties across various cancer types, highlighting its ability to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, we analyze the optimal dosing regimens and potential side effects associated with long-term aspirin use. The review also addresses the challenges in translating preclinical findings into clinical practice and the ongoing efforts to identify biomarkers for patient stratification. Finally, we consider the implications of these findings for public health policies and future research directions in cancer chemoprevention strategies involving aspirin and related compounds."}
