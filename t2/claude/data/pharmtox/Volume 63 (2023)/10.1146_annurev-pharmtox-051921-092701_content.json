{"Abstract": "Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in optimizing antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This review explores the impact of genetic variations, focusing on the CYP2C19 gene, on the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet drugs. We examine the current evidence supporting guided antiplatelet therapy based on pharmacogenomic testing and its potential to improve clinical outcomes. The implementation of precision medicine approaches in antiplatelet treatment is discussed, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in translating pharmacogenetic knowledge into clinical practice. Additionally, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of genotype-guided therapy and its potential to reduce adverse events and improve patient outcomes. This review underscores the importance of pharmacogenetics in tailoring antiplatelet therapy to individual patients, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatment strategies in cardiovascular medicine."}
