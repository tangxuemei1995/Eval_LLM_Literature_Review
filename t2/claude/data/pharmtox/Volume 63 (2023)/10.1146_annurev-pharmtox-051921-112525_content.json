{"Abstract": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are increasingly recognized as significant complications in older surgical patients, with postoperative delirium being a common manifestation. This review explores experimental models and potential druggable targets for age-related PND. We examine the role of neuroinflammation in PND pathogenesis and discuss various cognitive assessment tools used to detect these disorders. The importance of perioperative brain health is emphasized, highlighting the need for comprehensive care pathways to mitigate PND risk. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PND have revealed promising therapeutic targets. By integrating findings from preclinical studies and clinical observations, this review aims to provide insights into novel strategies for preventing and managing age-related PND, ultimately improving outcomes for older surgical patients."}
