{"Abstract": "Arsenic, a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, poses significant health risks to humans worldwide. This review explores the complex duality of arsenic metabolism, focusing on its speciation, toxicity, and the body's detoxification mechanisms. We examine the paradoxical role of methylation in arsenic metabolism, which can both activate and detoxify arsenic compounds. The interplay between various arsenic species and their impact on human health is discussed, highlighting the importance of understanding individual variations in arsenic metabolism. Additionally, we analyze the factors influencing arsenic toxicity, including genetic polymorphisms and environmental exposures. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the intricate relationship between arsenic metabolism and human health, emphasizing the need for further research to develop effective strategies for mitigating arsenic-related health risks."}
