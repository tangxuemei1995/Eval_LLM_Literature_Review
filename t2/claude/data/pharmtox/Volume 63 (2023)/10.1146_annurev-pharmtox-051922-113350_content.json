{"Abstract": "This review explores the concept of the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood, focusing on the complex mixture of xenobiotics and natural contaminants that can impact human health. We examine recent advances in human biomonitoring techniques and their application in assessing prenatal exposure to various chemicals. The role of the placenta as both a barrier and a potential source of exposure is discussed, highlighting its significance in fetal development. The review synthesizes current knowledge on the diverse range of chemicals that constitute the exposome, including environmental pollutants, pharmaceuticals, and dietary compounds. We also address the challenges in measuring and interpreting exposome data, particularly in the context of early life stages. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the potential long-term health effects of early chemical exposures and emphasizes the need for continued research in this critical area of environmental health."}
