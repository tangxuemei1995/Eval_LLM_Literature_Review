{"Abstract": "Resolution pharmacology represents a paradigm shift in treating inflammatory disorders, focusing on actively promoting the resolution phase rather than merely suppressing inflammation. This review explores the therapeutic potential of pro-resolving mediators, particularly annexin A1 and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), in innovative inflammation treatments. Annexin A1 peptides and SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in preclinical models of various inflammatory conditions. These endogenous molecules orchestrate the resolution process by modulating immune cell functions, reducing pro-inflammatory mediators, and promoting tissue repair. The development of stable analogs and targeted delivery systems has enhanced their therapeutic applicability. This emerging field offers promising avenues for treating chronic inflammatory diseases, potentially providing more effective and safer alternatives to traditional anti-inflammatory drugs. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms and optimize the clinical translation of these pro-resolving therapies."}
