{"Abstract": "Lysosomes, once considered mere cellular waste disposal units, are now recognized as crucial signaling hubs involved in various physiological processes. This review focuses on lysosomal ion channels, particularly TPCs, TRPMLs, and TMEM175, exploring their roles in cellular function and potential as therapeutic targets. These channels regulate lysosomal pH, calcium signaling, and membrane potential, influencing processes such as autophagy, exocytosis, and nutrient sensing. Recent research has implicated lysosomal channel dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We discuss the current understanding of these channels' structure, function, and regulation, highlighting their importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, we examine the emerging evidence supporting lysosomal ion channels as druggable targets for treating neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage disorders. This review underscores the potential of targeting lysosomal channels for developing novel therapeutic strategies and identifies key areas for future research in this rapidly evolving field."}
