{"Abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases have long been considered undruggable targets due to their highly conserved active sites and shallow catalytic pockets. However, recent advances in structural biology and drug discovery techniques have challenged this notion. This review explores the emerging potential of MAPK phosphatases, including protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases, as viable therapeutic targets. We discuss the identification of allosteric sites and the development of small molecule inhibitors that exploit these novel binding regions. The impact of these inhibitors on cell signaling pathways and their potential applications in various diseases are examined. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges and opportunities in targeting MAPK phosphatases, including selectivity issues and the need for improved pharmacokinetic properties. This evolving field holds promise for the development of novel therapeutics targeting previously elusive phosphatases, potentially revolutionizing treatment strategies for numerous pathological conditions."}
