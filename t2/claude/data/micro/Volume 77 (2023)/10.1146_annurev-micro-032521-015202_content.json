{"Abstract": "Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are complex microbial communities that play crucial roles in arid and semi-arid ecosystems worldwide. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the microbiology of BSCs, focusing on their composition, ecological functions, and adaptations to extreme environments. Cyanobacteria emerge as key players in BSC formation and stability, contributing to soil aggregation and carbon fixation. The diverse microbial assemblages in BSCs, including bacteria, archaea, and fungi, drive essential biogeochemical processes such as nitrogen fixation and nutrient cycling. These microorganisms have evolved remarkable strategies to withstand desiccation and other environmental stresses, including the production of extracellular polymeric substances and specialized pigments. Understanding the microbial ecology of BSCs is vital for predicting their responses to climate change and informing conservation efforts in arid lands. This review highlights recent advances in BSC microbiology and identifies critical areas for future research to enhance our comprehension of these unique and ecologically significant microbial ecosystems."}
