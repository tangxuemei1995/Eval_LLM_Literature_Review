{"Abstract": "Transporter proteins play a crucial role in the ecological adaptations and genomic diversity of microbial eukaryotes. This study investigates the significance of transporter proteins as components of both core and accessory genomes in eukaryotic microorganisms. We analyze pangenomes from diverse microbial eukaryotic species, focusing on the distribution and functional diversity of transporter proteins. Our findings reveal that transporter genes are overrepresented in accessory genomes, suggesting their importance in niche-specific adaptations. We observe that horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events contribute significantly to the expansion of transporter gene families. Furthermore, we identify specific transporter proteins associated with virulence factors, highlighting their potential role in pathogenicity. This research provides insights into the evolutionary dynamics of transporter proteins and their contribution to the ecological success and genomic plasticity of microbial eukaryotes, with implications for understanding adaptation mechanisms and potential targets for therapeutic interventions."}
