{"Abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, influencing various physiological processes through complex host-microbe interactions. This review explores the emerging evidence on essential amino acid metabolites as key chemical mediators in these interactions, focusing on valine, isoleucine, leucine, and tryptophan. We discuss how microbial metabolism of these amino acids produces bioactive compounds that affect host metabolism, immune function, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Particular attention is given to tryptophan metabolism and its impact on serotonin production, highlighting the gut-brain axis. The review also examines the potential therapeutic implications of modulating these metabolic pathways in treating gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic diseases, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Understanding these intricate relationships between essential amino acid metabolites and the gut microbiome opens new avenues for developing targeted interventions to improve human health."}
