{"Abstract": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are essential components of the bacterial outer membrane, facilitating active transport of vital nutrients across the cell envelope. This review explores the structure and function of TBDTs, focusing on their Î²-barrel architecture and the energy-coupling mechanism involving the TonB complex. We discuss the diversity of substrates transported by TBDTs, including iron siderophores, vitamin B12, and carbohydrates, with particular emphasis on their role in Bacteroidetes. The potential of TBDTs as targets for novel antimicrobial strategies, such as Trojan horse antibiotics, is examined. Recent advances in structural biology and biophysical techniques have provided new insights into the transport mechanism, paving the way for rational drug design and innovative approaches to combat antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria."}
