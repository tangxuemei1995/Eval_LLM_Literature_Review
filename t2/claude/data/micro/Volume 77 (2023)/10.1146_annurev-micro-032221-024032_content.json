{"Abstract": "Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factors represent a crucial component of bacterial signal transduction, alongside one- and two-component systems. This review explores the evolution, distribution, and regulatory diversity of ECF σ factors across bacterial species. We analyze comparative genomic data to reveal the prevalence and variability of ECF σ factors in different bacterial phyla, highlighting their importance in adapting to diverse environmental stresses. The regulatory mechanisms governing ECF σ factor activity are examined, including anti-σ factors, partner-switching modules, and novel control strategies. We discuss the role of ECF σ factors in transcription initiation and their impact on gene expression patterns during stress responses. Furthermore, we present recent advances in understanding ECF σ factor-mediated signal transduction pathways and their integration with other regulatory networks. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential applications of ECF σ factors in synthetic biology and biotechnology."}
