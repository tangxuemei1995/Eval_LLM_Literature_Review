{"Abstract": "Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is a reproductive manipulation strategy employed by Wolbachia endosymbionts to enhance their transmission through host populations. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying CI, focusing on recent discoveries in the field. We discuss the identification of key Wolbachia proteins, including nucleases and deubiquitylases, that act as toxins to induce CI. The interplay between these toxins and their corresponding antidotes in the host reproductive system is examined, shedding light on the complex molecular interactions driving CI. Additionally, we investigate the role of Wolbachia in male killing, another reproductive manipulation phenotype. The review highlights the evolutionary significance of these mechanisms and their potential applications in vector control strategies. Understanding the molecular biology of CI caused by Wolbachia provides valuable insights into host-symbiont interactions and opens new avenues for manipulating insect populations to combat vector-borne diseases."}
