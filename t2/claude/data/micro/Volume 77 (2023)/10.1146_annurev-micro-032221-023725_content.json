{"Abstract": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a crucial process in microbial metabolism, particularly in metal-reducing bacteria such as Shewanella and Geobacter species. This review explores the mechanisms by which these organisms transfer electrons beyond their outer membrane to external electron acceptors. We discuss the role of multiheme cytochromes in facilitating direct electron transfer and the importance of conductive pili in long-range electron transport. Additionally, we examine the use of electron shuttles, both endogenous and exogenous, in mediating indirect electron transfer. Recent advances in understanding the molecular structures and electron transfer kinetics of key proteins involved in EET are highlighted. The implications of these findings for biotechnological applications, including microbial fuel cells and bioremediation, are also addressed. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the diverse strategies employed by bacteria to 'put electrons to rest' beyond their cellular boundaries."}
