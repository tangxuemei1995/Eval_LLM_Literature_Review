{"Abstract": "The early fossil record of eukaryotes presents significant challenges for interpretation, particularly in the Precambrian era. This review examines frameworks for understanding eukaryote evolution during the Proterozoic, focusing on the process of eukaryogenesis and its relationship to major environmental changes. We explore the current evidence for early eukaryotic fossils and discuss the potential impact of the Great Oxidation Event on eukaryote diversification. The paper evaluates various hypotheses regarding the timing and mechanisms of eukaryote origin, considering both molecular and fossil data. We also address the limitations of the fossil record and the importance of integrating multiple lines of evidence to reconstruct early eukaryotic evolution. This synthesis provides a comprehensive overview of current perspectives on interpreting the early eukaryotic fossil record and highlights areas for future research."}
