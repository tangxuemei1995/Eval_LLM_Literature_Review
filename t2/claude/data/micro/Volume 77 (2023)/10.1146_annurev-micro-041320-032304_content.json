{"Abstract": "This review explores the evolutionary processes driving habitat transitions in bacteria and archaea, focusing on the interplay between dispersal and adaptation. We examine the mechanisms enabling microbial colonization of diverse environments, from extreme habitats to the human microbiome. Special attention is given to the Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria, which have undergone remarkable habitat transitions throughout their evolutionary history. The study synthesizes recent findings in environmental microbiology and human microbiome research to elucidate the factors influencing successful habitat shifts. We discuss the role of horizontal gene transfer, metabolic flexibility, and niche adaptation in facilitating these transitions. Additionally, we consider the implications of habitat transitions for microbial community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the evolutionary strategies employed by microorganisms to colonize new habitats and highlights the importance of understanding these processes in the context of global environmental changes and human health."}
