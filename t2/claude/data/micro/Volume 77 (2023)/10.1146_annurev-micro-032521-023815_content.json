{"Abstract": "Bacterial cross-feeding, the exchange of metabolites between microbial species, is a fundamental process in microbial ecology. This review explores the mechanisms underlying metabolite externalization in bacteria, focusing on the concept of 'leaky' cells. We examine various pathways through which bacteria release metabolites, including passive diffusion, active efflux, and cell lysis. The role of membrane permeability, transporter proteins, and environmental factors in facilitating metabolite exchange is discussed. We also consider the evolutionary implications of metabolite leakage, addressing whether it represents an adaptive strategy or an unavoidable consequence of cellular metabolism. By synthesizing recent findings in microbial interactions and metabolism, this review provides insights into the complex dynamics of bacterial communities and their potential applications in biotechnology and human health. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for deciphering microbial ecosystems and developing strategies to manipulate bacterial interactions."}
