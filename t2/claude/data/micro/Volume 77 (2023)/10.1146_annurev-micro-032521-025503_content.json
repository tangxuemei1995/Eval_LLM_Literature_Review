{"Abstract": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are essential virulence factors in many pathogenic bacteria, playing crucial roles in both the bacterial flagellum and the injectisome. This review synthesizes recent structural insights into these complex nanomachines, focusing on advances made possible by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques. We compare and contrast the structural features of the flagellar and injectisome T3SS, highlighting their shared evolutionary origins and functional similarities. The review examines the architecture of key components, including the basal body, export apparatus, and cytoplasmic components, revealing intricate mechanisms of assembly and regulation. Furthermore, we discuss how these structural findings inform our understanding of T3SS function, substrate specificity, and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. This comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for future research aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of T3SS and developing novel strategies to combat bacterial infections."}
