{"Abstract": "Secretory IgA (SIgA) plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity, protecting against enteropathogens such as Salmonella. This review explores the structure-function relationships of SIgA across multiple scales, from molecular to organismal levels. We examine the unique polymeric nature of SIgA and its interaction with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, which facilitates its secretion into mucosal surfaces. The ability of SIgA to form clumps, or agglutinate pathogens, is a key mechanism in its protective function. We discuss how this 'clumping license' enables SIgA to effectively neutralize and clear enteropathogens from mucosal surfaces. Additionally, we highlight recent advances in understanding SIgA's role in maintaining gut homeostasis and modulating the microbiome. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex interplay between SIgA structure and its diverse functions in mucosal immunity."}
