{"Abstract": "Inflammasomes are crucial components of the innate immune system, orchestrating inflammatory responses to microbial threats. This review explores the intricate interplay between bacterial pathogens and inflammasome signaling pathways. We examine how diverse bacterial species modulate the activation of key inflammasome components, including NLRs, caspase-1, and caspase-8. The role of gasdermin-mediated pyroptosis in bacterial infection is also discussed. We highlight recent discoveries revealing both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive strategies employed by bacteria to manipulate inflammasome signaling. Understanding these complex interactions is essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches to combat bacterial infections and associated inflammatory disorders. This review provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial influence on inflammasome activation and its implications for host-pathogen interactions and immune regulation."}
