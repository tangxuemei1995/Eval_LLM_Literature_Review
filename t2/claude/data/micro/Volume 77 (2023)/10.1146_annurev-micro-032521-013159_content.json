{"Abstract": "Brucella, a genus of Alphaproteobacteria, is a zoonotic intracellular pathogen responsible for brucellosis, a globally significant disease affecting both animals and humans. This review focuses on the unique cell envelope of Brucella, a gram-negative bacterium with distinctive structural and functional properties. We examine the composition and organization of the outer membrane, periplasmic space, and inner membrane, highlighting the role of lipopolysaccharides, proteins, and other components in pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions. The cell envelope's contribution to Brucella's survival within host cells, evasion of immune responses, and resistance to antimicrobial agents is discussed. Understanding the complexities of the Brucella cell envelope is crucial for developing new strategies to combat this persistent pathogen and improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for brucellosis management."}
