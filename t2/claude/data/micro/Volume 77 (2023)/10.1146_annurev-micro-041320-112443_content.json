{"Abstract": "Fungal genomes exhibit remarkable plasticity, enabling rapid adaptation to diverse environmental stresses. This review explores the dynamic nature of fungal genomes, focusing on polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation as key mechanisms for stress response. We examine how these genomic alterations contribute to phenotypic diversity and enhanced fitness under challenging conditions. Recent advances in genomic technologies have revealed the prevalence and significance of these phenomena across various fungal species. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these genomic changes, their impact on gene expression and cellular physiology, and their role in evolution and adaptation. Furthermore, we highlight the potential implications of fungal genome plasticity for biotechnology, medicine, and agriculture. Understanding these dynamic processes provides valuable insights into fungal biology and may inform strategies for controlling pathogenic fungi or harnessing beneficial species for industrial applications."}
