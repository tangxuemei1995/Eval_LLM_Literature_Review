{"Abstract": "The emergence of metazoan multicellularity represents a pivotal moment in evolutionary history, yet its origins remain enigmatic. This review explores the potential for a microbial 'black swan' event as a catalyst for metazoan evolution. By synthesizing recent genomic and phylogenetic data from holozoans and their unicellular relatives, we propose a novel hypothesis for the transition to multicellularity. Our analysis suggests that a rare, transformative interaction between ancestral unicellular organisms and specific microbial communities may have triggered the genomic and cellular innovations necessary for metazoan development. We examine key genetic and molecular mechanisms that could have been influenced by this hypothetical event, including cell adhesion, signaling pathways, and developmental gene regulatory networks. Furthermore, we discuss how this scenario aligns with existing fossil evidence and molecular clock estimates. While speculative, this 'black swan' hypothesis offers a fresh perspective on metazoan origins and highlights the potential role of microbial interactions in major evolutionary transitions. Our findings underscore the need for further investigation into the complex interplay between unicellular ancestors, their microbial environments, and the emergence of animal multicellularity."}
