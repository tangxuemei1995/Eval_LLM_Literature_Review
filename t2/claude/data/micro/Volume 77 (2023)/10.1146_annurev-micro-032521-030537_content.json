{"Abstract": "The Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) comprises devastating plant pathogens that cause bacterial wilt in numerous crops worldwide. This study investigates the phc quorum-sensing system, a crucial regulatory mechanism in RSSC pathogenicity and virulence. We examine the molecular components and signaling pathways of the phc system across different RSSC species, including R. solanacearum and R. pseudosolanacearum. Our findings reveal that the phc system plays a pivotal role in cell-cell communication, coordinating gene expression and virulence factor production in response to bacterial population density. We demonstrate that mutations in key phc genes significantly impact pathogen fitness, host colonization, and disease progression. Furthermore, we identify species-specific variations in the phc system that may contribute to the diverse host ranges and geographical distributions observed within the RSSC. This research provides valuable insights into RSSC pathogenicity mechanisms and potential targets for developing novel control strategies against bacterial wilt."}
