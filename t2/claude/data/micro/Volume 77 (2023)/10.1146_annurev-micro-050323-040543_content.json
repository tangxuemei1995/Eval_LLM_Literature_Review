{"Abstract": "LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) represent one of the most abundant and versatile families of bacterial transcription factors. This review explores the common and uncommon facets of LTTRs, highlighting their structural complexity and functional diversity. We discuss the conserved DNA-binding domain and variable effector-binding domain that enable LTTRs to respond to a wide range of environmental signals. The dual role of LTTRs as both activators and repressors is examined, along with their capacity for global regulation of multiple genes. We also delve into the less common features of some LTTRs, including their involvement in complex regulatory networks and their ability to modulate virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. The review emphasizes the importance of understanding LTTR mechanisms for potential applications in biotechnology and the development of novel antimicrobial strategies."}
