{"Abstract": "This study explores the presence and adaptations of fungi in extreme environments, specifically glacial ice and hypersaline waters. We investigate the diversity and ecological roles of psychrophilic and halophilic fungi in these harsh conditions. Through metagenomic analysis and culture-based techniques, we identified several extremophilic fungal species capable of thriving in sub-zero temperatures and high salinity. Our findings reveal unique adaptations, including the production of antifreeze proteins and osmolytes, which enable these fungi to survive and even flourish in such challenging habitats. Furthermore, we examine the potential biotechnological applications of these extremophilic fungi, particularly in the fields of bioremediation and enzyme production. This research contributes to our understanding of fungal biodiversity in extreme environments and highlights the remarkable resilience and adaptability of these microorganisms in the face of severe environmental stressors."}
