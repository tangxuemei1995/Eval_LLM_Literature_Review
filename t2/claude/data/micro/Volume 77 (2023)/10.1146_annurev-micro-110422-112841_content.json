{"Abstract": "This article explores the journey of Listeria monocytogenes from a little-known bacterium to a prominent model system in cellular microbiology and infection biology. It highlights key discoveries in DNA-protein interactions, RNA-mediated regulation, and postgenomic approaches that have contributed to our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis. The author provides an autobiographical perspective on the development of the 'Listeria paradigm,' emphasizing its impact on the field and its potential for future research in microbial pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions."}
