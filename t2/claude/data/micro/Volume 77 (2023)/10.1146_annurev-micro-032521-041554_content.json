{"Abstract": "Malaria parasites, particularly Plasmodium species, employ sophisticated epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression and adapt to host environments. This review explores recent advances in understanding the epigenetic landscape of Plasmodium at the single-cell level. We discuss the role of chromatin architecture in parasite development and the emerging importance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in epigenetic regulation. The dynamic interplay between histone modifications, chromatin remodeling complexes, and lncRNAs is examined, revealing intricate regulatory networks that govern parasite virulence and survival. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of epigenetic targets for novel antimalarial therapies and the challenges in translating these findings into clinical applications. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex epigenetic machinery of malaria parasites and its implications for disease control strategies."}
