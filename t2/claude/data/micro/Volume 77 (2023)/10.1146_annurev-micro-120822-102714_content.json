{"Abstract": "The ChvG-ChvI two-component regulatory system is a highly conserved global regulatory circuit found across the Alphaproteobacteria. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the ChvG-ChvI network, highlighting its pervasive impacts on host interactions and diverse cellular processes. The system plays crucial roles in regulating the cellular envelope, stress responses, and virulence factors in various bacterial species. Comparative genomic analyses reveal a core regulon conserved among different genera, as well as species-specific adaptations. The ChvG-ChvI system integrates environmental signals to modulate gene expression, influencing bacterial survival and host colonization. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of ChvG-ChvI signaling and identified novel target genes. Understanding this regulatory network provides insights into bacterial adaptation strategies and potential targets for therapeutic interventions in both pathogenic and symbiotic interactions between Alphaproteobacteria and their hosts."}
