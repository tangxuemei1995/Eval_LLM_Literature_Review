{"Abstract": "Candida auris has emerged as a significant global health threat due to its multidrug-resistant nature and rapid spread. This review explores the genetic factors contributing to C. auris' emergence and antifungal resistance. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins, focusing on alterations in drug targets and efflux pumps. The unique cell wall composition of C. auris is discussed, highlighting its role in virulence and stress tolerance. Additionally, we investigate the MAP kinase signaling pathways involved in stress response and drug resistance. Understanding these genetic and molecular aspects is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat C. auris infections. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex interplay of factors driving the emergence and persistence of this formidable pathogen in healthcare settings worldwide."}
