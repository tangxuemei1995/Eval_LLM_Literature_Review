{"Abstract": "The human gut phageome, comprising bacteriophages within the intestinal microbiome, plays a crucial role in shaping microbial communities and influencing host health. This review explores the factors contributing to variations in the gut phageome across individuals and populations. We examine the impact of diet, age, geography, and lifestyle on phage diversity and abundance. Additionally, we discuss the dynamic interactions between phages and their bacterial hosts, including lysogeny and lytic cycles, which significantly influence phageome composition. The review also addresses the potential role of the gut phageome in health and disease, highlighting its involvement in maintaining microbial balance, modulating immune responses, and its potential as a biomarker for various conditions. Furthermore, we explore emerging technologies for studying the phageome and discuss challenges in characterizing these complex viral communities. Understanding the factors affecting gut phageome variation is crucial for developing targeted interventions and harnessing the therapeutic potential of bacteriophages in human health."}
