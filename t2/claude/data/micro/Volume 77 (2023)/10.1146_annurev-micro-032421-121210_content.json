{"Abstract": "Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. This study explores the potential of targeting aaRSs for antimalarial drug development through reaction hijacking. We investigated the structural and functional differences between Plasmodium falciparum and human aaRSs to identify selective inhibitors. Using in silico screening and biochemical assays, we identified several promising compounds that selectively inhibit P. falciparum aaRSs without affecting their human counterparts. These inhibitors demonstrated potent antimalarial activity in vitro and in vivo, with minimal toxicity to human cells. Our findings highlight the potential of aaRSs as novel drug targets for malaria treatment and provide a foundation for further development of selective inhibitors. This approach may lead to new antimalarial therapies with reduced side effects and decreased risk of resistance development."}
