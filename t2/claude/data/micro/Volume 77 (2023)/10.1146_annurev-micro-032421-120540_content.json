{"Abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, possess unique mitochondrial features that distinguish them from other eukaryotes. This review explores the distinctive properties of apicomplexan mitochondria, focusing on their electron transport complexes and ATP synthase. These organelles exhibit streamlined metabolic pathways and unconventional structural adaptations, which contribute to their essential roles in parasite survival and replication. We discuss the recent advances in understanding the composition and function of apicomplexan respiratory chain components, highlighting their divergence from canonical mitochondrial systems. Additionally, we examine the potential of these unique mitochondrial features as targets for antiparasitic drug development. The atypical characteristics of apicomplexan mitochondria not only provide insights into the evolutionary history of the Myzozoa phylum but also offer promising avenues for therapeutic interventions against devastating parasitic diseases."}
