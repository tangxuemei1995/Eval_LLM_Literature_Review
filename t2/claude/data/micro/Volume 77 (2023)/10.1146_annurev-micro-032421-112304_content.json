{"Abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, yet our ability to manipulate its composition and function remains limited. This review explores recent advances in microbiome engineering, focusing on expanding the repertoire of genetically tractable members of the human gut microbiome. We discuss novel techniques for genetic modification of commensal bacteria, including CRISPR-Cas systems and synthetic biology approaches. The development of stable colonization methods and improved in vitro culture systems for previously unculturable species are highlighted. Additionally, we examine the potential applications of engineered gut microbes in therapeutics, diagnostics, and metabolic engineering. Challenges and ethical considerations in microbiome manipulation are also addressed. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and future directions in microbiome engineering, emphasizing the importance of expanding our toolkit for precise modulation of the gut ecosystem."}
