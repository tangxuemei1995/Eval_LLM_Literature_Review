{"Abstract": "The microbiome assembly in fermented foods is a complex process influenced by various factors, including environmental conditions, substrate composition, and microbial interactions. This review explores the dynamics of microbial community formation in diverse fermented products such as cheese, sourdough, and fermented vegetables. We examine the key drivers of microbiome assembly, including selective pressures, species interactions, and temporal succession patterns. The role of starter cultures, environmental microbes, and indigenous populations in shaping the final microbial composition is discussed. Additionally, we highlight the impact of fermentation parameters on community structure and function. Understanding these assembly processes is crucial for optimizing product quality, safety, and consistency in fermented food production. This knowledge also provides insights into the broader field of microbial ecology and may inform strategies for manipulating microbiomes in other contexts, such as human health and environmental applications."}
