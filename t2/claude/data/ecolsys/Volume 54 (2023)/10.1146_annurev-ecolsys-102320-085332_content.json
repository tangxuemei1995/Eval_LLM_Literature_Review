{"Abstract": "This study investigates the response of deep soil organic carbon (SOC) to global change factors, including climate change, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. We synthesize data from long-term field experiments and global observational studies to assess the sensitivity of deep SOC pools to these drivers. Our findings reveal that deep SOC is more responsive to global change than previously thought, with significant implications for carbon cycling and climate feedbacks. Elevated CO2 and warming generally increase deep SOC accumulation, while land use change can lead to substantial losses. However, the magnitude and direction of responses vary across ecosystems and soil types. We identify key mechanisms governing deep SOC dynamics and highlight critical knowledge gaps. This research underscores the importance of considering deep soil processes in Earth system models and carbon management strategies to improve predictions of future carbon-climate feedbacks."}
