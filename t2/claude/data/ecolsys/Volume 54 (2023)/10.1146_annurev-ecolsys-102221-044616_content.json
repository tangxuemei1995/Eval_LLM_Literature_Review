{"Abstract": "Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for pollinator communities and plant-pollinator interactions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on urban pollination ecology, exploring how urbanization affects pollinator diversity, behavior, and ecosystem services. We examine the impacts of habitat fragmentation, artificial lighting, and urban heat islands on pollinator populations and their mutualistic relationships with plants. The study highlights the importance of green spaces, urban gardens, and corridor connectivity in supporting pollinator communities within cities. We analyze pollination networks in urban landscapes, investigating how they differ from rural counterparts in terms of structure and resilience. Additionally, we discuss the potential for cities to serve as refugia for certain pollinator species and the role of urban planning in promoting pollinator conservation. This review underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understand and enhance urban pollination ecology, integrating insights from ecology, urban planning, and conservation biology."}
