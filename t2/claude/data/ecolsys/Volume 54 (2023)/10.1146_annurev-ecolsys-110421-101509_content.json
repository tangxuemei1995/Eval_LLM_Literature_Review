{"Abstract": "The quest to understand life's origins remains a fundamental scientific challenge. This review explores how studying modern life can inform hypotheses about its emergence. We examine key processes in extant organisms, including CO2 fixation, metabolism, and the use of proton-motive force, as potential clues to primordial biochemistry. The role of FeS clusters in ancient metabolic pathways is discussed, along with the possibility of an 'RNA world' preceding modern genetic systems. We consider how protocells might have evolved, integrating metabolism with primitive replication mechanisms. The universality of the genetic code is examined as a potential window into early life. By synthesizing insights from diverse fields, including biochemistry, genetics, and geochemistry, we aim to bridge the gap between the chemistry of the early Earth and the complexity of modern life, offering new perspectives on life's origins."}
