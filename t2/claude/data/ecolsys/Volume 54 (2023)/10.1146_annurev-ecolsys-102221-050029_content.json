{"Abstract": "Sky islands, isolated mountain ranges surrounded by contrasting lowland environments, serve as natural laboratories for studying the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. This review synthesizes recent research on sky islands worldwide, highlighting their potential as predictive tools for understanding ecological and evolutionary responses to global warming. We examine how these unique ecosystems foster genetic variation, relict populations, and convergent evolution across diverse taxa. By comparing sky island communities at different elevations and latitudes, researchers can simulate future climate scenarios and forecast species' adaptations or potential extinctions. The isolation and environmental gradients characteristic of sky islands also provide insights into the mechanisms driving speciation and local adaptation. As climate change accelerates, sky islands offer valuable opportunities to study real-time evolutionary processes and inform conservation strategies for vulnerable montane ecosystems globally."}
