{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impacts of climate change on terrestrial phosphorus cycling across diverse ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and tundra. Through a combination of field experiments and modeling approaches, we examine how altered temperature and precipitation patterns affect phosphorus availability, limitation, and cycling in these ecosystems. Our results reveal significant variations in phosphorus dynamics among different biomes, with tundra ecosystems showing the most pronounced responses to climatic shifts. We observe increased phosphorus mineralization rates in warmer conditions, potentially alleviating nutrient limitation in some ecosystems. However, changes in soil moisture regimes may counteract these effects, particularly in water-limited grasslands. Our model projections suggest that climate-induced alterations in phosphorus cycling could have cascading effects on ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration. This research highlights the need for ecosystem-specific management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on terrestrial phosphorus dynamics and associated ecosystem functions."}
