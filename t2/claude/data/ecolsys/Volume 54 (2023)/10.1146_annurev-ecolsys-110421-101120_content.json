{"Abstract": "This study explores the impacts of novel disturbance regimes on ecological systems and their subsequent responses. As global environmental changes intensify, ecosystems face unprecedented challenges, necessitating a deeper understanding of their resilience and recovery mechanisms. We examine how altered disturbance patterns affect succession processes and ecosystem dynamics, focusing on response traits that enable species to adapt to new conditions. Our research investigates ecological thresholds and tipping points, identifying factors that determine whether systems can maintain their structure or shift to alternative states. By synthesizing recent literature and case studies, we highlight the importance of adaptive management strategies in navigating these complex ecological transitions. Our findings emphasize the need for interdisciplinary approaches to predict and mitigate the effects of novel disturbances, ultimately informing conservation efforts and policy decisions in an era of rapid environmental change."}
