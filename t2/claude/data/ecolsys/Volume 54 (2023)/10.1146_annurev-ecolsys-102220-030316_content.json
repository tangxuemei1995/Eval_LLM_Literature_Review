{"Abstract": "Background acoustics play a crucial role in terrestrial ecology, influencing animal behavior, community dynamics, and ecosystem functioning. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the impacts of natural and anthropogenic soundscapes on terrestrial organisms. We explore how background acoustics affect animal communication, predator-prey interactions, and habitat selection through direct and indirect effects. The phenomenon of acoustic masking is examined, highlighting its consequences for species' fitness and community structure. We discuss the importance of considering hearing capabilities across taxa when assessing the ecological implications of soundscapes. Furthermore, we analyze how changes in background acoustics can cascade through ecosystems, altering community composition and ecological processes. By integrating insights from behavioral ecology, community ecology, and bioacoustics, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted role of background acoustics in terrestrial ecosystems and emphasizes the need for further research in this rapidly evolving field."}
