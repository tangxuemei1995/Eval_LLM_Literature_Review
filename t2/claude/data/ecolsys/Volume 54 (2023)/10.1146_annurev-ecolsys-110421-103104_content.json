{"Abstract": "South Florida, recognized as the world's most invaded continental ecoregion, presents a unique opportunity to study patterns of non-native species introduction, spread, and ecological impact. This review synthesizes current knowledge on invasion biology in the region, focusing on the mechanisms facilitating successful establishment and the consequences for native ecosystems. We examine the role of the empty niche hypothesis in explaining the high invasibility of South Florida's ecosystems and evaluate the effectiveness of biological control and eradication efforts. Our analysis reveals that anthropogenic disturbances, climate change, and the region's subtropical climate contribute to the success of non-native species. Furthermore, we identify key pathways of introduction and discuss the varying impacts of invasive species on different trophic levels. This comprehensive overview provides valuable insights for developing targeted management strategies and improving our understanding of invasion dynamics in highly susceptible ecosystems."}
