{"Abstract": "Conservation paleobiology offers a unique perspective on the long-term dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems, providing crucial insights for addressing contemporary biodiversity challenges. This review synthesizes recent advances in the field, exploring how fossil records illuminate the responses of terrestrial communities to past environmental stressors. We examine case studies that demonstrate the resilience and vulnerability of ecosystems over geological timescales, highlighting parallels with current Anthropocene pressures. The integration of paleontological data with modern ecological observations reveals patterns of community assembly, species interactions, and adaptive responses to climate change. These findings inform conservation strategies by identifying ecological baselines, predicting potential future scenarios, and guiding restoration efforts. We argue that incorporating deep-time perspectives into conservation planning is essential for developing effective, long-term approaches to preserving biodiversity and ecosystem function in the face of unprecedented global change."}
