{"Abstract": "Seed dispersal is a critical process in plant ecology, influencing plant population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of the causes and consequences of seed dispersal. We explore the various dispersal processes and syndromes, highlighting the complex interactions between plants and their dispersal agents. The generalized gravity framework and movement ecology paradigm are discussed as valuable tools for predicting dispersal patterns across landscapes. We introduce the concept of 'seedscape' to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of seeds, emphasizing its importance in shaping plant communities. Finally, we examine seed dispersal effectiveness and its implications for plant fitness, species coexistence, and ecosystem resilience. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the multifaceted nature of seed dispersal and its far-reaching ecological impacts."}
