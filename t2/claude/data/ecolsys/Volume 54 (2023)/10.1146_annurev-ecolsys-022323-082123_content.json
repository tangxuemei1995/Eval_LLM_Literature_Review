{"Abstract": "Marine ecosystems are experiencing unprecedented changes due to climate change, with increasing attention focused on extreme events like heatwaves. However, this study emphasizes the critical role of both smooth (mean) and spiky (variable) temperature changes in shaping ecological responses. We synthesize recent research on the impacts of temperature variability across different marine habitats and depths, highlighting the importance of considering both gradual shifts and acute fluctuations. Our findings reveal that organisms' responses to temperature changes are complex, influenced by factors such as depth refuges, acclimation potential, and legacy effects from previous exposures. We demonstrate that solely focusing on mean temperature changes may underestimate the true ecological impacts of climate change in marine systems. This work underscores the need for a more nuanced approach in climate change ecology, integrating both smooth and spiky temperature dynamics to better predict and manage marine ecosystem responses."}
