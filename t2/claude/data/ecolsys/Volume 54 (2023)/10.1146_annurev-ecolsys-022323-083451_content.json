{"Abstract": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple traits, plays a crucial role in shaping evolutionary processes and disease susceptibility. This review explores the patterns and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on its impact on adaptation, antagonistic effects, and the cost of complexity. We examine how pleiotropic mutations can simultaneously affect multiple phenotypic traits, potentially leading to trade-offs in fitness. The concept of antagonistic pleiotropy is discussed in relation to aging and disease, where genes beneficial early in life may have detrimental effects later. We also investigate how pleiotropy contributes to the cost of complexity in organisms, potentially constraining evolutionary trajectories. Furthermore, we analyze the implications of pleiotropy for understanding genetic architecture and its role in complex diseases. This synthesis provides insights into the intricate relationship between genetic variation, phenotypic diversity, and evolutionary dynamics, highlighting the significance of pleiotropy in biological systems."}
