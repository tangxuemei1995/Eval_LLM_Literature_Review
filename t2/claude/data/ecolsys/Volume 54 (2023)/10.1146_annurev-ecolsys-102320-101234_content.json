{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has provided unprecedented opportunities to study the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. This review synthesizes key insights gained from the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, focusing on zoonotic spillover, viral evolution, and human social behavior. We examine how anthropogenic activities facilitate pathogen transmission from wildlife to humans and discuss the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants in response to host immunity and interventions. The pandemic has highlighted the critical role of human social behavior in disease spread and control, revealing complex interactions between individual decision-making and population-level outcomes. Furthermore, we explore how lessons learned from COVID-19 can inform strategies for preventing and managing future zoonotic outbreaks. By integrating perspectives from ecology, evolution, and social sciences, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of emerging infectious diseases and their impacts on global health and ecosystems."}
