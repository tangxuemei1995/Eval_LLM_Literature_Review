{"Abstract": "This review explores the ecophysiological factors driving foraging behavior and evolution in cetaceans, with a focus on the interplay between body size, diving capabilities, and feeding strategies. We examine how scaling relationships influence diving capacity, metabolic rates, and prey capture efficiency across cetacean species. The evolution of gigantism in baleen whales is discussed in the context of their unique filter-feeding adaptations and the energetic trade-offs associated with their large size. We analyze the physiological limits of diving, including oxygen storage capacity and cardiovascular adaptations, and how these constraints shape foraging patterns. The review also considers the ecological implications of cetacean foraging strategies on marine ecosystems and food webs. By synthesizing current research on cetacean ecophysiology, we provide insights into the evolutionary pressures that have shaped these remarkable marine mammals and their pivotal roles in ocean ecosystems."}
