{"Abstract": "Anolis lizards have long served as a model system for studying evolution and adaptive radiation, particularly in the Caribbean. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of anole evolution, ecology, and adaptation. We highlight new insights into the mechanisms driving phenotypic diversification, including the role of developmental plasticity and genomic architecture. Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between anoles and their changing environments, shedding light on their responses to anthropogenic pressures. We discuss how anoles are adapting to urban environments and climate change, providing valuable lessons for conservation in the Anthropocene. Additionally, we explore how cutting-edge technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing and 3D imaging, are revolutionizing anole research. By integrating these diverse approaches, researchers are gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary processes that have shaped this remarkable group of lizards and their potential for future adaptation."}
