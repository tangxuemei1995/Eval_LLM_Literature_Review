{"Abstract": "Density-dependent selection is a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology that explores how population density influences the fitness and survival of organisms. This review synthesizes current research on density-dependent selection, examining its role in shaping age structure, population regulation, and norms of reaction. We discuss the interplay between r-selection and K-selection strategies in the context of varying population densities, highlighting how these processes contribute to adaptive responses and evolutionary trajectories. The paper also investigates the mechanisms underlying density-dependent selection, including competition for resources, predation pressure, and habitat availability. By integrating empirical studies and theoretical models, we demonstrate the significance of density-dependent selection in maintaining genetic diversity, driving speciation, and influencing ecosystem dynamics. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex relationships between population density, natural selection, and evolutionary outcomes, emphasizing the importance of considering density-dependent processes in ecological and evolutionary research."}
