{"Abstract": "Amphibians exhibit diverse parental care strategies, offering valuable insights into the evolution of parental care across vertebrates. This review examines the relationship between fertilization mode, terrestriality, and parental care in amphibians, focusing on protection, transport, and nutrition provided by parents. We explore how these factors have shaped parental sex roles and care patterns throughout amphibian evolution. Our analysis reveals that terrestrial adaptations and fertilization modes strongly influence the type and extent of parental care observed. External fertilization is often associated with paternal care, while internal fertilization tends to correlate with maternal care. Additionally, we discuss how environmental pressures and reproductive strategies have driven the development of unique care behaviors in various amphibian species. Understanding these patterns in amphibians can provide crucial perspectives on the broader evolution of parental care in vertebrates and inform conservation efforts for endangered amphibian populations."}
