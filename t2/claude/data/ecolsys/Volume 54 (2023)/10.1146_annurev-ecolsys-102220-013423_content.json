{"Abstract": "Biological invasions pose significant threats to ecosystems worldwide, yet the mechanisms underlying successful invasions remain poorly understood. This study investigates the functional trait variation of invasive animal species along their invasion pathways, focusing on physiological and phenotypic plasticity. We synthesize data from multiple taxa across diverse ecosystems to identify common patterns in trait expression during different invasion stages. Our findings reveal that successful invaders often exhibit a suite of traits consistent with the 'ideal weed' concept, including rapid growth, high reproductive output, and broad environmental tolerance. Notably, we observe significant shifts in trait expression as species progress from introduction to establishment and spread, highlighting the importance of phenotypic plasticity in invasion success. This research provides valuable insights into the eco-evolutionary dynamics of biological invasions and offers potential avenues for improving prediction and management of invasive species."}
