{"Abstract": "Large Old World fruit bats, particularly those of the genus Pteropus, are facing unprecedented threats to their survival. This review examines the primary causes of their decline, including habitat loss, hunting for bushmeat and traditional medicine, and the impacts of climate change. As keystone species and crucial seed dispersers, the potential extinction of these flying foxes could have far-reaching consequences for island ecosystems and biodiversity. We analyze the current conservation efforts and their effectiveness in protecting these species, with a focus on island habitats where many Pteropus species are endemic. The paper also explores the cultural significance of fruit bats in various societies and how this influences conservation strategies. Finally, we propose urgent measures needed to prevent the extinction of these ecologically vital species and maintain the health of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."}
