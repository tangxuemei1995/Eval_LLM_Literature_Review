{"Abstract": "This study examines the feasibility and effectiveness of deforestation-free commodity supply chains in achieving sustainable land use and forest governance. Despite growing commitments from corporations and governments to implement zero deforestation policies, the reality of these initiatives remains contentious. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and case studies, we evaluate the challenges and opportunities in translating pledges into tangible outcomes. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between market forces, policy frameworks, and local socio-economic conditions that influence the success of deforestation-free initiatives. We argue that while complete elimination of deforestation from supply chains remains elusive, significant progress can be made through a carefully designed policy mix that addresses both supply and demand-side factors. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on sustainable forest management and provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders in developing more effective strategies for forest conservation."}
