{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and application of metrics for decision-making in energy justice, focusing on the intersections of energy equity, distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice. The research synthesizes existing literature to identify key indicators and quantifiable measures that can guide policymakers and stakeholders in assessing and promoting energy justice. By analyzing case studies from diverse global contexts, the study evaluates the effectiveness of various metrics in capturing the multidimensional aspects of energy justice. The findings reveal the importance of integrating both quantitative and qualitative measures to comprehensively address energy equity issues. The research concludes by proposing a framework for implementing these metrics in decision-making processes, emphasizing the need for context-specific adaptations and continuous refinement of measurement tools."}
