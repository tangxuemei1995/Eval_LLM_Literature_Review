{"Abstract": "This review examines the evidence on sustainable intensification strategies for smallholder agricultural systems in the Global South, focusing on staple crops. We analyze the effectiveness of various approaches, including the adoption of improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI). The literature reveals that these strategies can significantly enhance food production while minimizing environmental impacts. Improved cultivars demonstrate increased yields and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. Push-pull systems effectively manage pests and improve soil fertility, leading to higher crop productivity. SRI shows promise in increasing rice yields while reducing water and input requirements. However, the success of these strategies depends on factors such as local agro-ecological conditions, socio-economic contexts, and farmer knowledge. This review highlights the potential of sustainable intensification approaches to address food security challenges in smallholder agricultural systems, while emphasizing the need for context-specific implementation and further research to optimize their effectiveness."}
