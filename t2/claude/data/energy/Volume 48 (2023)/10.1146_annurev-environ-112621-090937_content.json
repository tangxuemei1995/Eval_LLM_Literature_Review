{"Abstract": "This study explores the global diversity, distribution, and conservation status of fungi, focusing on major phyla including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and early diverging fungi. Utilizing advanced metabarcoding techniques, we present a comprehensive analysis of fungal biodiversity across various ecosystems worldwide. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into fungus:plant ratios and endemism patterns, challenging previous estimates. We identify hotspots of fungal diversity and assess their conservation status using IUCN Red List criteria. The research highlights the urgent need for both in situ and ex situ conservation strategies to protect threatened fungal species and their habitats. Our results underscore the critical role of fungi in ecosystem functioning and emphasize the importance of integrating fungal conservation into global biodiversity initiatives. This study provides a foundation for future research and conservation efforts aimed at preserving the world's fungal diversity in the face of increasing environmental pressures."}
