{"Abstract": "This study explores the nexus between urban decarbonization strategies and their potential co-benefits for health, climate resilience, and equity. Using an urban metabolism framework, we assess the interconnections between zero-carbon transitions and sustainable development goals (SDGs) in cities. Our analysis reveals significant synergies between decarbonization efforts and improvements in public health, well-being, and social equity. We identify key intervention points within urban systems that can simultaneously reduce carbon emissions, enhance climate resilience, and address socioeconomic disparities. The research highlights the importance of integrated approaches to urban planning and policy-making that consider these multiple dimensions. Our findings suggest that targeted investments in low-carbon infrastructure, green spaces, and sustainable transportation can yield substantial co-benefits across various SDGs. This study provides valuable insights for urban decision-makers seeking to implement holistic strategies that address climate change while promoting healthier, more equitable, and resilient cities."}
