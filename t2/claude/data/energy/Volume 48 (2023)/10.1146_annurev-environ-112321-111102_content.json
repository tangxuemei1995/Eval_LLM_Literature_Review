{"Abstract": "Great Green Walls, ambitious large-scale afforestation projects aimed at combating desertification and environmental degradation, have gained prominence in recent years. This review critically examines the hype, myths, and scientific evidence surrounding these initiatives, focusing on case studies from Algeria, the Sahel region, and China. While proponents tout their potential for ecological restoration and climate change mitigation, skeptics question their efficacy and sustainability. We analyze the scientific literature to evaluate the actual impacts of these projects on soil quality, biodiversity, and local livelihoods. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between ecological benefits and socio-economic challenges, highlighting the need for context-specific approaches. We argue that while Great Green Walls offer promise, their success depends on integrating scientific knowledge with local expertise and addressing underlying drivers of land degradation. This review provides insights for policymakers and researchers to enhance the design and implementation of dryland afforestation initiatives."}
