{"Abstract": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) pose significant threats to freshwater ecosystems and human health worldwide. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biological traits, mechanisms, and risks associated with HCBs, as well as control strategies. Climate change and eutrophication are identified as key drivers of HCB proliferation, exacerbating their frequency, intensity, and duration. The production of cyanotoxins, including microcystins, anatoxins, and cylindrospermopsins, is discussed, highlighting their diverse impacts on aquatic organisms and human health. We examine the complex interactions between cyanobacteria and their environment, emphasizing the role of adaptive strategies in bloom formation. Furthermore, we evaluate various control measures, including nutrient management, physical interventions, and biological control, to mitigate HCB occurrence and impacts. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for researchers, water managers, and policymakers in addressing the growing challenge of HCBs in freshwater systems."}
