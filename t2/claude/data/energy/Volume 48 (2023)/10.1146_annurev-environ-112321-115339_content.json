{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of opinion polarization and perceived polarization on environmental decision-making, with a focus on climate change issues. Drawing from research on intergroup relations and social psychology, we investigate how polarization affects individuals' willingness to engage in pro-environmental behaviors and support climate policies. Through a series of surveys and experiments involving 1,500 participants from diverse political backgrounds, we find that both actual and perceived polarization significantly influence environmental decision-making processes. Results indicate that higher levels of polarization are associated with decreased support for climate action and reduced willingness to compromise on environmental policies. Furthermore, we observe that perceived polarization often exceeds actual polarization, exacerbating the negative effects on decision-making. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing polarization in environmental discourse and suggest potential strategies for bridging ideological divides to promote more effective climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts."}
