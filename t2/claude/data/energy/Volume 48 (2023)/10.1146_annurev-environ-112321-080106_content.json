{"Abstract": "This paper reviews recent advances in qualitative methods for environmental research, focusing on their application to complex socioecological systems and climate change studies. We examine the growing importance of participatory research approaches in engaging diverse stakeholders and incorporating local knowledge. The review highlights innovative techniques for data collection and analysis, including digital ethnography, photovoice, and qualitative GIS. We discuss how these methods enhance our understanding of human-environment interactions and contribute to more holistic assessments of environmental challenges. The paper also explores the integration of qualitative methods with quantitative approaches, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Finally, we address ethical considerations and challenges in applying qualitative methods to sensitive environmental issues. This review underscores the vital role of qualitative research in informing environmental policy and practice, particularly in the context of rapidly changing ecosystems and climate conditions."}
