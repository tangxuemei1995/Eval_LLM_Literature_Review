{"Abstract": "This review examines the role of soils as carbon stores and sinks in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. We explore current expectations, observed patterns, and underlying processes of soil carbon dynamics using advanced modeling approaches such as the Century and Millennial models. The study investigates factors influencing carbon sequestration, including decomposition rates, litter quality, and root turnover. We analyze global soil mapping efforts to assess carbon storage potential and discuss the implications for soil health and climate policy. The review highlights the complex interplay between soil properties, land management practices, and environmental factors in determining soil carbon dynamics. Finally, we evaluate the prospects of transitioning towards enhanced soil carbon sequestration, considering both challenges and opportunities in implementing effective climate change mitigation strategies. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers and researchers working towards sustainable soil management and climate change adaptation."}
