{"Abstract": "The '30×30' initiative, which aims to protect 30% of Earth's land and ocean by 2030, has gained significant traction in recent years as a response to the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. This paper explores the historical development of climate change-integrated conservation strategies and examines the potential of the 30×30 goal to address these interconnected challenges. We review the evolution of conservation approaches from traditional static reserve designs to dynamic, climate-adaptive strategies that account for species range shifts and ecosystem transformations. The integration of climate change considerations into systematic conservation planning is analyzed, highlighting key milestones and methodological advancements. We discuss how the 30×30 initiative builds upon these foundations and incorporates emerging concepts in climate change biology, such as climate refugia and connectivity corridors. The paper also investigates the role of regional coordination in implementing effective climate-smart conservation networks, emphasizing the importance of transboundary collaboration and data sharing. We assess the potential benefits and limitations of the 30×30 approach in enhancing ecosystem resilience, facilitating species adaptation, and mitigating climate change impacts. Furthermore, we explore how this ambitious goal intersects with other global environmental targets and socioeconomic considerations. Looking ahead, we identify research priorities and policy recommendations to strengthen the implementation of the 30×30 initiative and maximize its effectiveness in addressing climate change and biodiversity conservation. This comprehensive review underscores the critical importance of integrating climate change projections into conservation planning and highlights the 30×30 goal as a pivotal opportunity to create a more resilient and biodiverse future in the face of global environmental change."}
