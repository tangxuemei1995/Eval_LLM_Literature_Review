{"Abstract": "Urban overheating, characterized by elevated temperatures in cities compared to surrounding rural areas, has become a critical environmental challenge. This comprehensive review examines the magnitude, characteristics, and impacts of urban heat islands across global cities. We analyze the complex interplay of factors contributing to urban overheating, including built environment, anthropogenic heat emissions, and reduced vegetation. The study explores the multifaceted consequences of overheating on human health, energy consumption, and urban ecosystems. We evaluate various heat mitigation strategies, such as green infrastructure, cool materials, and urban design modifications, assessing their effectiveness in different urban contexts. Additionally, we discuss adaptation measures to enhance urban resilience against heat stress. The review concludes by identifying key knowledge gaps and future research directions, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to address urban overheating in the face of climate change and rapid urbanization."}
