{"Abstract": "This paper explores the role of imagination and anticipation in shaping alternative futures within the context of the Anthropocene. By examining diverse future scenarios and visions, we investigate how cognitive processes and collective imagination influence societal transformations. The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from futures studies, cognitive science, and environmental psychology to analyze the construction and impact of future narratives. Our findings suggest that the ability to envision and articulate diverse futures plays a crucial role in fostering adaptive responses to global challenges. Furthermore, we identify key factors that contribute to the development of transformative future visions, including participatory scenario-building processes and the integration of multiple stakeholder perspectives. This research contributes to our understanding of how anticipatory thinking can guide decision-making and inspire action towards more sustainable and resilient futures in the face of unprecedented global change."}
