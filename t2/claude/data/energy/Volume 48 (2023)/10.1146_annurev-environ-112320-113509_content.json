{"Abstract": "This paper explores the concept of the commons, a fundamental framework for understanding collective resource management and governance. Drawing on extensive literature, we examine the evolution of commons theory from Hardin's 'tragedy of the commons' to Ostrom's groundbreaking work on common-pool resources. The study investigates various forms of common property regimes and their implications for natural resource policy. We analyze the process of commoning, whereby communities collectively manage and sustain shared resources, highlighting successful examples and challenges faced in different contexts. The research also addresses the role of institutions, social norms, and local knowledge in shaping effective resource governance. By synthesizing diverse case studies and theoretical perspectives, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable resource management and offers insights for policymakers and practitioners. Our findings underscore the importance of adaptive governance systems and the potential of commons-based approaches in addressing contemporary environmental and social challenges."}
