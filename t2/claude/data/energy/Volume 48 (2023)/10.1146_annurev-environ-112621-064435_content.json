{"Abstract": "This study examines the US legal and regulatory framework governing nuclear waste management for current and future reactors and their fuel cycles. It analyzes existing regulations, including the Standard Contract for spent nuclear fuel, and evaluates their applicability to advanced reactor designs and novel fuel cycles. The research explores challenges in adapting current policies to accommodate emerging technologies, particularly concerning waste retrievability and long-term storage solutions. Key focus areas include the regulatory gaps for non-traditional fuel types, the impact of new reactor designs on waste classification, and the potential need for updated legislation to address the unique characteristics of advanced nuclear systems. The findings highlight the importance of proactive policy development to ensure a robust regulatory framework capable of supporting innovation in nuclear energy while maintaining stringent safety and environmental standards."}
