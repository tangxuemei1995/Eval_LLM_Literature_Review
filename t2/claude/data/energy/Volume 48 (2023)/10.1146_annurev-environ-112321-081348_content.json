{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between governance structures and conservation effectiveness in protected areas (PAs) and indigenous and locally managed areas (ILMAs). We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 150 case studies from diverse ecosystems across six continents, spanning a 20-year period. Our findings reveal that governance models significantly influence conservation outcomes, with ILMAs demonstrating higher effectiveness in biodiversity preservation and sustainable resource management compared to traditional state-managed PAs. Key factors contributing to ILMA success include strong local institutions, traditional ecological knowledge integration, and adaptive co-management practices. However, we also identified challenges faced by ILMAs, such as external pressures from resource extraction industries and limited access to funding. For state-managed PAs, we found that those incorporating participatory approaches and benefit-sharing mechanisms achieved better conservation outcomes. Our research highlights the importance of context-specific governance arrangements and suggests that a hybrid approach, combining elements of state management and local governance, may offer the most promising path for effective conservation. These findings have important implications for policymakers and conservation practitioners in designing and implementing protected area strategies that balance ecological integrity with social equity and local livelihoods."}
