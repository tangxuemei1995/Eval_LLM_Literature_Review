{"Abstract": "The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have raised concerns about their connection to climate change. This study examines the attribution of extreme events to anthropogenic climate change, focusing on the methodologies, challenges, and implications for climate vulnerability assessments. We review recent advances in event attribution techniques, including probabilistic approaches and climate model simulations, to quantify the influence of human-induced climate change on specific extreme events. The research synthesizes findings from multiple case studies across various regions and event types, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts. Results indicate a growing body of evidence linking certain extreme events to climate change, with varying degrees of confidence depending on the event type and geographical location. However, challenges remain in attributing individual events due to natural variability and limitations in observational data. The study also explores the implications of event attribution for climate adaptation strategies and policy-making, emphasizing the importance of incorporating attribution findings into vulnerability assessments and risk management frameworks. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on climate change impacts and highlights the need for continued advancements in attribution science to inform effective climate resilience measures."}
