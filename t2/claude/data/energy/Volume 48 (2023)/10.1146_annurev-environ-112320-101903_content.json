{"Abstract": "Climate change poses significant threats to coastal critical infrastructure, with potential cascading effects on communities and economies. This study examines the multifaceted risks faced by coastal critical infrastructure due to climate-induced hazards, including sea-level rise, storm surge, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Through a comprehensive literature review and case study analysis, we assess the vulnerability of key infrastructure sectors such as energy, transportation, and water systems in coastal regions. Our findings reveal that the interconnected nature of these systems amplifies the potential for cascading failures, highlighting the need for integrated resilience strategies. We identify gaps in current risk assessment methodologies and propose a framework for evaluating the compound effects of multiple climate hazards on critical infrastructure. The study emphasizes the importance of adaptive management approaches and cross-sector collaboration in enhancing infrastructure resilience. Our research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on climate change adaptation and provides valuable insights for policymakers and infrastructure planners in developing robust, long-term strategies to safeguard coastal critical infrastructure."}
