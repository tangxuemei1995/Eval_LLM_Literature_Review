{"Abstract": "Brine, a highly concentrated saline solution, plays a crucial role in global resource recovery and sustainable development. This review explores the genesis of brine in salt lakes and other geological formations, focusing on its potential as a valuable source of minerals such as potash and lithium. We examine the complex processes involved in brine formation, including evaporation, mineral dissolution, and geothermal activity. The paper also evaluates various processing techniques employed for extracting valuable components from brine, highlighting recent advancements in separation and purification methods. Furthermore, we discuss the concept of comprehensive utilization, emphasizing the importance of maximizing resource recovery while minimizing environmental impact. Case studies from major brine-producing regions worldwide are presented to illustrate successful implementation of sustainable practices. This review aims to provide a holistic understanding of brine as a sustainable resource and to identify future research directions for optimizing its exploitation in an environmentally responsible manner."}
