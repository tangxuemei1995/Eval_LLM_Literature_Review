{"Abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of plastics in the environment has become a global concern, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and human health. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the environmental impact of plastics, focusing on their persistence, distribution, and potential risks. Microplastics, in particular, have emerged as a significant pollutant, contaminating terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. We examine the sources and pathways of plastic pollution, including industrial discharge, improper waste management, and degradation of larger plastic items. The review also explores the chemical properties of various polymers and their interactions with environmental contaminants, potentially exacerbating the spread of other pollutants. Furthermore, we discuss the bioaccumulation of plastics in food chains and its implications for wildlife and human health. The paper highlights the need for improved waste management strategies, innovative polymer designs, and stricter regulations to mitigate plastic pollution. Finally, we identify critical knowledge gaps and propose future research directions to better understand and address the complex challenges posed by plastics in the environment."}
