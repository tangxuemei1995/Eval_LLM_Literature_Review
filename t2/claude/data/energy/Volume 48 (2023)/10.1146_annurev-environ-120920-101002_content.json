{"Abstract": "This study examines the implications of green technologies for environmental justice, focusing on the concept of a just transition. The research investigates how the implementation of electrification, modal shift in transportation, and sustainable building practices affects distributional justice across different socioeconomic groups. Through a comprehensive literature review and case study analysis, we explore the potential benefits and challenges of these green technologies in addressing environmental inequalities. Our findings suggest that while these technologies have the potential to mitigate environmental harm, their implementation may inadvertently exacerbate existing disparities if not carefully managed. We propose a framework for policymakers to ensure that the transition to green technologies is equitable and inclusive, emphasizing the importance of community engagement, targeted subsidies, and workforce development programs. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on environmental justice and provides practical recommendations for achieving a truly just and sustainable future."}
