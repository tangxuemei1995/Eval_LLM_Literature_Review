{"Abstract": "Groundwater quality is a critical factor in public health, as it serves as a primary source of drinking water for many communities worldwide. This study examines the complex relationship between groundwater quality and human health, focusing on geogenic contaminants, emerging pollutants, and key substances of concern. We review recent literature to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of various groundwater contaminants on public health outcomes. The research highlights the importance of sustainable groundwater management practices in mitigating health risks associated with poor water quality. Our findings indicate that both natural and anthropogenic factors contribute to groundwater contamination, with geogenic contaminants such as arsenic and fluoride posing significant challenges in certain regions. Additionally, emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and microplastics, are increasingly recognized as potential threats to human health. This study emphasizes the need for comprehensive monitoring programs, improved water treatment technologies, and integrated approaches to groundwater management to safeguard public health and ensure long-term water security."}
