{"Abstract": "The Anthropocene epoch has witnessed unprecedented human influence on Earth's ecosystems, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of industrial impacts on global ecology. This study integrates Earth system science, biodiversity conservation, and social-ecological systems to map the complex interplay between industrial activities and ecological processes. We analyze land-use change patterns across diverse biomes, identifying critical areas of concern for conservation planning. Our findings reveal significant correlations between industrial expansion and biodiversity loss, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable development strategies. We propose a novel framework for assessing and mitigating industrial influences on ecosystems, incorporating both ecological and socio-economic factors. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on human-nature interactions in the Anthropocene and provides valuable insights for policymakers and conservationists working towards a more sustainable future."}
