{"Abstract": "This paper reviews the current state of modeling low energy demand futures for buildings and identifies key research needs. We examine approaches for developing scenarios of residential and commercial energy demand transformation in the context of climate change mitigation. The analysis covers methods for incorporating megatrends like urbanization, digitalization, and changing work patterns into long-term projections. We assess how models account for improvements in building efficiency, electrification of end-uses, and shifts in occupant behavior. The review highlights challenges in representing decent living standards and energy poverty alleviation within low demand scenarios. We find that most models struggle to capture the full potential of demand-side solutions and behavioral changes. Key research priorities include improving representations of heterogeneous consumers, energy service demands, and interactions between the building sector and other systems. Enhanced modeling of these factors is critical for exploring ambitious low energy demand pathways aligned with climate goals."}
