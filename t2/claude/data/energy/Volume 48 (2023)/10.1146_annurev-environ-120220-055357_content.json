{"Abstract": "Fire regimes are integral components of Earth's social-ecological systems, influencing biodiversity, climate change, and sustainability. This review synthesizes current knowledge on fire regimes and their role in shaping the Anthropocene. We examine how human activities have altered fire patterns globally, affecting ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity. Climate change is shown to exacerbate wildfire frequency and intensity, creating feedback loops within the Earth System. The paper explores the complex interactions between fire, vegetation, and human societies, highlighting the need for adaptive management strategies. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in developing sustainable fire management practices that balance ecological integrity with human safety and economic interests. By integrating insights from diverse disciplines, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of fire regimes and their implications for creating a more resilient and sustainable future in the Anthropocene."}
