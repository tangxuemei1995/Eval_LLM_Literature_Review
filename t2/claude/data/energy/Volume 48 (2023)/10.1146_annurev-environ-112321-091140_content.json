{"Abstract": "This comprehensive study assesses the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity sources, focusing on solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. The research synthesizes and analyzes data from numerous studies, reports, and databases to provide a holistic view of renewable energy potential worldwide. The technical potential is evaluated based on resource availability, land use constraints, and current technological capabilities. Economic potential is then derived by considering levelized costs of electricity, market conditions, and projected technological advancements. Finally, the feasible potential is estimated by incorporating socio-political factors, grid integration challenges, and environmental considerations. Results indicate that the technical potential of renewable electricity far exceeds current global electricity demand, with solar PV and wind energy showing the highest potential. However, economic and feasible potentials are significantly lower due to various constraints. The study finds that while the economic potential of renewables is rapidly increasing due to falling costs and improved efficiencies, the feasible potential faces limitations such as grid infrastructure, energy storage requirements, and policy frameworks. Regional variations in potential are also analyzed, highlighting opportunities for targeted renewable energy development. The research concludes that achieving high penetration of renewable electricity is technically possible and increasingly economically viable, but requires addressing key challenges in grid integration, energy storage, and supportive policies to realize its full feasible potential. These findings have important implications for energy planning, climate change mitigation strategies, and sustainable development goals on a global scale."}
