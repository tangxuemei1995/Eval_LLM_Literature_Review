{"Abstract": "Climate change is exacerbating the occurrence of concurrent flood and drought events, posing significant challenges to land management. This study explores the potential of land modifications as a strategy to mitigate these concurrent risks and investigates land users' perspectives on implementing such measures. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining geospatial analysis and stakeholder surveys, we assess the effectiveness of various land modification techniques in reducing flood and drought impacts. Results indicate that targeted interventions, such as improved drainage systems, water retention structures, and soil conservation practices, can significantly enhance landscape resilience. However, land users' motivations and barriers to adoption vary widely, influenced by factors including economic constraints, knowledge gaps, and policy support. Our findings highlight the need for tailored approaches that consider local contexts and stakeholder engagement to promote widespread implementation of land modifications as a climate change adaptation strategy."}
