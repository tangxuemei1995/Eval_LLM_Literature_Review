{"Abstract": "The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays a crucial role in regulating erythropoiesis, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review examines the effects of genetic and pharmacological perturbations on the HIF pathway and their implications for erythropoiesis. We explore the mechanisms by which HIF regulates erythropoietin (EPO) production and discuss the development of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) as a therapeutic approach for anemia in CKD patients. Furthermore, we analyze the potential of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors as a novel class of drugs to stimulate endogenous EPO production. The review also addresses the safety concerns associated with these treatments, including the risk of thromboembolism. By synthesizing current research, we provide insights into the complex interplay between the HIF pathway and erythropoiesis, highlighting potential avenues for improving anemia management in CKD patients while minimizing adverse effects."}
