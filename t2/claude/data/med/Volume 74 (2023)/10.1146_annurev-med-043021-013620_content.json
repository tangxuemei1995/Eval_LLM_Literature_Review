{"Abstract": "Chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure is a significant complication of various neuromuscular disorders, leading to decreased quality of life and increased mortality. This review explores the role of home assisted ventilation in managing this condition, focusing on noninvasive ventilation techniques. We examine the physiological mechanisms underlying respiratory failure in neuromuscular diseases and discuss the benefits of early intervention with home ventilation. The review highlights recent advancements in ventilator technology, patient interfaces, and monitoring systems that have improved the efficacy and acceptability of home-based respiratory support. Additionally, we address the challenges in implementing and maintaining long-term ventilation at home, including patient adherence, caregiver burden, and healthcare resource allocation. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in optimizing outcomes for patients with chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure."}
