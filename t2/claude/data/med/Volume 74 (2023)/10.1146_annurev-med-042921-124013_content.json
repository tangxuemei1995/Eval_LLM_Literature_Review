{"Abstract": "The ISCHEMIA trial has provided valuable insights into the management of stable ischemic heart disease. This landmark study compared invasive and conservative approaches in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia. Results demonstrated that an initial conservative strategy of optimal medical therapy was non-inferior to early invasive management for major adverse cardiovascular events. However, invasive therapy showed benefits in angina relief and quality of life. The trial emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment decisions, considering factors such as symptom burden and patient preferences. These findings have significant implications for clinical practice, potentially reducing unnecessary procedures and healthcare costs while maintaining optimal patient outcomes in stable angina management."}
