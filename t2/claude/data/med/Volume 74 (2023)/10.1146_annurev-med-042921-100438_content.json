{"Abstract": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common cause of secondary hypertension associated with increased cardiovascular and renal morbidity. This review explores the pathophysiology of PA and the therapeutic potential of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in protecting the heart and kidneys. We discuss the mechanisms by which excess aldosterone contributes to cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, highlighting the role of mineralocorticoid receptor activation in promoting inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress. The review examines the efficacy of MRAs in reducing blood pressure, improving cardiovascular outcomes, and preserving renal function in patients with PA. Additionally, we address the challenges in diagnosing PA and the importance of early intervention with MRAs to prevent end-organ damage. Finally, we consider emerging research on novel MRAs and their potential to enhance treatment options for PA."}
