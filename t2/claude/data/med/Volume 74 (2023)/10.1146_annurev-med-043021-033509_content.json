{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has significantly impacted global health, with emerging evidence suggesting a complex interplay between the virus and the endocrine system. This review explores the bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and various endocrine disorders, focusing on obesity, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, pituitary disorders, and reproductive health. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to exacerbate pre-existing endocrine conditions and potentially trigger new ones. Conversely, certain endocrine disorders, particularly obesity, have been associated with increased COVID-19 severity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying these interactions involve ACE2 receptor expression, cytokine storms, and direct viral effects on endocrine tissues. Understanding these connections is crucial for optimizing patient care, developing targeted therapies, and improving outcomes in individuals with endocrine disorders during the ongoing pandemic."}
