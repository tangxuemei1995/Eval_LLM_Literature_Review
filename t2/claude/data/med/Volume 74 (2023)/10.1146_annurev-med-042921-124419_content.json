{"Abstract": "The use of race in kidney function estimation has been a contentious issue in nephrology. This review examines the historical context, scientific validity, and ethical implications of incorporating race into clinical algorithms for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We analyze the lessons learned from recent efforts to remove race from these equations and discuss the broader implications for health equity. The paper explores alternative approaches to kidney function estimation that prioritize accuracy while avoiding the perpetuation of racial disparities. Finally, we propose a framework for developing more inclusive and just clinical tools, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and patient engagement in advancing health justice in nephrology and beyond."}
