{"Abstract": "Club cell secretory protein (CCSP), also known as CC10, uteroglobin, or SCGB1A1, is a multifunctional protein primarily produced by club cells in the respiratory tract. This review explores the emerging concepts and potential therapeutic applications of CCSP in lung diseases. Recent studies have highlighted CCSP's role as a biomarker for various pulmonary conditions and its involvement in maintaining lung homeostasis. The protein's anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antifibrotic properties make it a promising candidate for therapeutic interventions. We discuss the latest findings on CCSP's mechanisms of action, its potential as a diagnostic tool, and ongoing research into CCSP-based therapies for respiratory disorders. Additionally, we examine the challenges and future directions in harnessing CCSP's protective effects for clinical applications, emphasizing its significance in advancing lung disease management and treatment strategies."}
