{"Abstract": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a groundbreaking therapeutic class in the management of kidney diseases. Initially developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, these agents have demonstrated remarkable renoprotective effects in both diabetic and nondiabetic kidney diseases. This review explores the expanding role of SGLT2 inhibitors in nephrology, focusing on their impact on kidney outcomes, including reduced progression of chronic kidney disease and decreased risk of acute kidney injury. We examine the mechanisms underlying their renoprotective effects, which extend beyond glycemic control to include hemodynamic, metabolic, and anti-inflammatory actions. The potential of SGLT2 inhibitors in various kidney diseases is discussed, along with ongoing clinical trials and future directions for research in this rapidly evolving field."}
