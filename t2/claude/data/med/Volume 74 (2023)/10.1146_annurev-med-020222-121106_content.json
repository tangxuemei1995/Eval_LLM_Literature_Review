{"Abstract": "This review provides an update on adult transgender medicine, focusing on recent developments in gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT) for transfeminine and transmasculine individuals. We examine the latest research and clinical practices in accordance with the Endocrine Society's 2017 treatment guidelines. The article discusses advancements in hormone therapy regimens, including optimal dosing strategies and monitoring protocols. We explore the physiological and psychological effects of GAHT, as well as potential risks and long-term health outcomes. Additionally, we address emerging topics such as fertility preservation and the management of comorbid conditions in transgender patients. This comprehensive overview aims to equip healthcare providers with current knowledge to deliver effective, evidence-based care for transgender adults seeking medical transition."}
