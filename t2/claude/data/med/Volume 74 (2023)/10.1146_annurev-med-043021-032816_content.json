{"Abstract": "Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, plays a crucial role in health and disease. This review explores the intricate relationship between hepcidin and iron metabolism, focusing on its impact on inflammation, anemia, and iron overload disorders. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying hepcidin's action, its regulation by various factors, and its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target. The review highlights the importance of hepcidin in maintaining iron balance and its involvement in pathological conditions such as anemia of inflammation and hereditary hemochromatosis. Understanding the complex interplay between hepcidin and iron metabolism offers promising avenues for developing novel treatments for iron-related disorders."}
