{"Abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose significant global health challenges, particularly due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). This review examines the impact of these viral variants on disease transmission, severity, and vaccine efficacy. We analyze the genetic mutations characterizing major VOCs and their implications for public health measures. The study also explores the challenges in surveillance, diagnostic testing, and vaccine development posed by these evolving variants. Understanding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate the pandemic's impact and prepare for future outbreaks."}
