{"Abstract": "The global rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been crucial in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a rare but severe adverse event, vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), has emerged as a concern. This review examines the current understanding of VITT, its proposed pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management strategies. VITT is characterized by thrombosis in atypical sites, accompanied by thrombocytopenia, occurring 4-30 days post-vaccination. The condition is associated with the production of platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4). While the incidence of VITT is low, its potential severity necessitates prompt recognition and appropriate treatment. Management typically involves avoiding heparin, administering non-heparin anticoagulants, and intravenous immunoglobulin. This review aims to provide clinicians with essential knowledge to identify and manage VITT effectively, ensuring the continued safe use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."}
