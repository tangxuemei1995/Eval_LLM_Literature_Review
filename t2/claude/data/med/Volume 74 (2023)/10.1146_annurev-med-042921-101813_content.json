{"Abstract": "Recent advances in genomics and massively parallel sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of genetic kidney diseases. This review explores the unexpected role of rare disorders in elucidating the complex genetics underlying chronic kidney disease. We discuss how collapsing analysis techniques have uncovered novel gene-disease associations and highlight the potential of precision medicine approaches in nephrology. The integration of genomic data with clinical phenotypes has revealed surprising connections between seemingly unrelated kidney disorders, challenging traditional disease classifications. Furthermore, we examine how these discoveries are shaping diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions. As we unravel the intricate genetic landscape of kidney diseases, the boundaries between rare and common disorders are becoming increasingly blurred, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments in nephrology."}
