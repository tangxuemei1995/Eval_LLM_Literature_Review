{"Abstract": "Sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are complex, heterogeneous conditions with high mortality rates in critical care settings. Recent advances in biological phenotyping have revealed distinct subphenotypes within these syndromes, offering new insights into their underlying pathophysiology. This review explores the current state of biological phenotyping in sepsis and ARDS, highlighting key subphenotypes identified through various omics approaches and their potential implications for precision medicine. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in translating these findings into clinical practice, including the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies. By leveraging biological phenotyping, clinicians and researchers may be able to improve patient outcomes and advance our understanding of these critical illnesses."}
