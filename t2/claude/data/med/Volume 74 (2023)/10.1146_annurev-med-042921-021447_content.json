{"Abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Recent advancements in CFTR modulator therapies have revolutionized CF treatment. These modulators target specific defects in CFTR protein function, improving chloride transport and alleviating symptoms. This review explores the mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety profiles of various CFTR modulators, including potentiators, correctors, and amplifiers. We discuss the impact of these therapies on patient outcomes, quality of life, and disease progression. Additionally, we examine ongoing research and future directions in modulator therapy development for CF patients with rare mutations."}
