{"Abstract": "Maternal mortality in the United States remains a critical public health concern, with rates significantly higher than other developed nations. This review examines recent trends in maternal mortality, highlighting persistent disparities among racial and socioeconomic groups. We explore the role of preconception health and counseling in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal deaths. The analysis reveals that addressing modifiable risk factors before pregnancy, improving access to quality healthcare, and implementing evidence-based interventions can significantly reduce maternal mortality rates. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of targeted interventions for high-risk populations and the need for comprehensive policy changes to support maternal health. This review emphasizes the urgent need for a multifaceted approach to prevent maternal deaths and reduce disparities in maternal health outcomes across the United States."}
