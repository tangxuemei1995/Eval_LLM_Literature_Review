{"Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating hematological malignancies. However, antigen loss remains a significant challenge, leading to tumor escape and relapse. This study investigates the efficacy of multispecific CAR T cells in addressing antigen loss in lymphomas. We engineered bispecific and trispecific CAR T cells targeting combinations of CD19, CD20, and CD22 antigens. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated superior antitumor activity of multispecific CAR T cells compared to monospecific counterparts. Notably, trispecific CAR T cells exhibited enhanced persistence and reduced antigen escape in patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistic studies revealed increased activation and reduced exhaustion in multispecific CAR T cells. Our findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cells represent a promising approach to mitigate antigen loss and improve long-term outcomes in lymphoma patients, potentially revolutionizing CAR T cell therapy for hematological malignancies."}
