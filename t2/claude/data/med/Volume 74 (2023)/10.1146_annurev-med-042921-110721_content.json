{"Abstract": "Exome and genome sequencing have revolutionized the diagnosis of rare and undiagnosed genetic disorders. This review explores the application of next-generation sequencing technologies in identifying the molecular basis of Mendelian diseases and complex syndromes that have eluded traditional diagnostic approaches. We discuss the advantages and limitations of exome sequencing compared to whole-genome sequencing in the context of undiagnosed diseases. The paper examines recent advances in bioinformatics tools and variant interpretation strategies that have improved the diagnostic yield of these technologies. Additionally, we highlight the importance of integrating clinical phenotyping with genomic data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The review also addresses the challenges of interpreting variants of uncertain significance and the ethical considerations surrounding incidental findings. Finally, we present case studies demonstrating the successful application of exome/genome sequencing in solving diagnostic odysseys and discuss the potential for these technologies to guide personalized treatment strategies in rare disease management."}
