{"Abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has emerged as a significant factor in age-related health outcomes. This review explores the impact of CHIP on human health, focusing on its associations with aging, coronary artery disease (CAD), and malignancy. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying CHIP, including DNA methylation changes and clonal trajectories. Recent studies have revealed that CHIP is more prevalent in older individuals and is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events and hematological malignancies. The review discusses how CHIP-associated mutations in genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 contribute to altered hematopoietic stem cell function and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we analyze the potential of CHIP as a biomarker for age-related diseases and its implications for personalized medicine. Understanding the complex interplay between CHIP and human health may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for age-related disorders and cancer prevention."}
