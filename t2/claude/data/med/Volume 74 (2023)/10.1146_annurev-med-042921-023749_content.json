{"Abstract": "Tau protein aggregation and neurofibrillary tangle formation are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, yet our understanding of tau's role in neurodegeneration remains incomplete. This review explores recent advances in tau research, focusing on novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We examine the complex interplay between tau pathology and cognitive decline, highlighting the potential of tau-targeted interventions. Additionally, we discuss emerging imaging techniques and fluid-based assays that enable earlier and more accurate detection of tau-related changes. By synthesizing current knowledge on tau's multifaceted involvement in Alzheimer's disease, this review aims to provide insights into future directions for diagnosis and treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder."}
