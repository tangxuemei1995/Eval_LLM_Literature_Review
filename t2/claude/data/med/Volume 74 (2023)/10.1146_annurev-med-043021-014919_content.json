{"Abstract": "The obesity epidemic continues to pose significant health challenges worldwide. This review explores the latest advancements in obesity treatment, focusing on GLP-1 receptor agonists and emerging nutrient-stimulated hormone-based (NuSH) therapies. We discuss the efficacy and safety of current GLP-1 receptor agonists as antiobesity medications and examine the potential of dual and triple receptor agonists. Additionally, we investigate the promising field of NuSH-based therapies, which harness the body's natural appetite-regulating mechanisms. By analyzing recent clinical trials and preclinical studies, we highlight the potential of these innovative approaches to revolutionize obesity management and improve patient outcomes."}
