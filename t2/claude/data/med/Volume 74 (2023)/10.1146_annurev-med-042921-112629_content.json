{"Abstract": "Polygenic scores have emerged as a powerful tool in genomic research, offering new insights into the genetic architecture of complex diseases. This review focuses on recent advances and applications of polygenic scores in the context of coronary artery disease (CAD). We examine the development of increasingly accurate polygenic scores for CAD risk prediction, incorporating large-scale genome-wide association studies and advanced statistical methods. The integration of polygenic scores with traditional risk factors has shown promise in enhancing risk stratification and improving prevention strategies. We discuss the potential of polygenic scores in identifying high-risk individuals who may benefit from early intervention or more aggressive preventive measures. Additionally, we explore the challenges and limitations of implementing polygenic scores in clinical practice, including issues of generalizability across diverse populations and the need for standardization. Finally, we highlight future directions for research, including the potential for personalized medicine approaches based on polygenic risk assessment for CAD."}
