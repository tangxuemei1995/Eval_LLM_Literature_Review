{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating genetic disorder affecting millions worldwide. This review explores diverse approaches to gene therapy for SCD, focusing on recent advancements in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene editing techniques. We examine the potential of lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition and CRISPR-based gene editing strategies in correcting the underlying genetic defect. The progress in developing autologous transplantation methods to overcome limitations of allogeneic transplants is discussed. Additionally, we analyze the efficacy and safety profiles of various gene therapy approaches in clinical trials. While challenges remain, including optimizing delivery methods and minimizing off-target effects, gene therapy shows promise in providing long-term curative options for SCD patients. This review highlights the current state of gene therapy for SCD and its potential to revolutionize treatment paradigms."}
