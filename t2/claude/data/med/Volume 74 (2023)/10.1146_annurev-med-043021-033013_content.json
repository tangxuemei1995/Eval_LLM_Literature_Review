{"Abstract": "Hemophilia, a genetic bleeding disorder caused by deficiencies in coagulation factors VIII or IX, has long been a target for gene therapy. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have emerged as promising tools for delivering functional genes to treat both hemophilia A and B. This review explores recent advances in AAV-mediated gene therapy for hemophilia, highlighting successful clinical trials that have demonstrated long-term expression of therapeutic levels of clotting factors. We discuss the challenges of immune responses to AAV vectors and strategies to overcome them. Additionally, we examine ongoing efforts to optimize vector design, improve transgene expression, and enhance the safety profile of AAV-based therapies. The potential of AAV gene therapy to revolutionize hemophilia treatment is evaluated, considering both current limitations and future prospects."}
