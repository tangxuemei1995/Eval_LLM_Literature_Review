{"Abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a highly aggressive biliary tract malignancy, is characterized by frequent genetic alterations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene. These alterations, including mutations, fusions, amplifications, and in-frame deletions, contribute to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. This review explores the role of FGFR2 inhibition in cholangiocarcinoma treatment, focusing on its potential to overcome resistance mechanisms. We discuss the interplay between FGFR2 and other signaling pathways, such as RAS, EGFR, and MEK, which are implicated in resistance to FGFR2-targeted therapies. Recent clinical trials evaluating FGFR2 inhibitors have shown promising results, particularly in patients with FGFR2 fusions. However, acquired resistance remains a significant challenge. We examine emerging strategies to combat resistance, including combination therapies targeting multiple pathways and the development of next-generation FGFR2 inhibitors. Understanding the complex molecular landscape of cholangiocarcinoma and the mechanisms of resistance to FGFR2 inhibition is crucial for improving patient outcomes and guiding future therapeutic approaches."}
