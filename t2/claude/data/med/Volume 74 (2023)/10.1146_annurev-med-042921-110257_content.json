{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant risk of thrombotic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related thrombosis and evaluates current therapeutic strategies. We discuss the complex interplay between inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation activation in COVID-19 patients. The role of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in preventing and managing thrombotic events is critically examined, with a focus on their efficacy and safety profiles. Recent clinical trials and observational studies are analyzed to provide evidence-based recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in different patient populations. Additionally, we address the challenges in balancing the risk of thrombosis against the potential for bleeding complications. This comprehensive review aims to guide clinicians in optimizing antithrombotic strategies for COVID-19 patients and identifies areas for future research to improve outcomes in this evolving field."}
