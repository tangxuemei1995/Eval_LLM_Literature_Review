{"Abstract": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is an increasingly recognized clinical entity that challenges traditional understanding of acute coronary syndromes. This review explores the complex pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and management strategies for MINOCA. We examine various underlying mechanisms, including coronary spasm, takotsubo syndrome, and other causes of myocardial injury. The importance of accurate diagnosis through advanced imaging techniques and biomarker analysis is emphasized. Treatment approaches are discussed, highlighting the need for individualized therapy based on the specific etiology. Despite recent advances, MINOCA remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, with significant implications for patient outcomes. This review underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to MINOCA, integrating clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings to guide appropriate management and improve long-term prognosis for this unique patient population."}
