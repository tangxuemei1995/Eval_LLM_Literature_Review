{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted patients with kidney disease, particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and kidney transplant recipients. This review examines the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and kidney dysfunction, highlighting the increased vulnerability of these patient populations. We explore the mechanisms by which COVID-19 affects kidney function, including direct viral invasion, cytokine storm, and thrombotic complications. The challenges faced by dialysis centers in maintaining essential services while minimizing infection risk are discussed. Additionally, we analyze the unique considerations for kidney transplant recipients, who are at higher risk due to immunosuppression. The review also addresses the potential long-term renal consequences of COVID-19 infection and the implications for kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT). Finally, we outline strategies for optimizing care and reducing morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable patient population during the ongoing pandemic."}
