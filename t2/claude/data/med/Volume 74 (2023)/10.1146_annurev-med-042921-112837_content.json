{"Abstract": "Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by an excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to systemic hyperinflammation. This review explores the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of CSS, encompassing related conditions such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The dysregulated immune response in CSS results in widespread tissue damage, multi-organ failure, and potentially fatal outcomes. We discuss the complex interplay between various immune cells, particularly macrophages and T cells, and their role in perpetuating the inflammatory cascade. Additionally, we examine the diagnostic challenges, biomarkers, and current therapeutic approaches, including targeted immunomodulatory therapies. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of CSS is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes in this rapidly evolving field of immunology and critical care medicine."}
