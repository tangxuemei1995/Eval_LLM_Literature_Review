{"Abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant complication in transplant recipients, necessitating effective prophylaxis and treatment strategies. This review explores the role of letermovir, a novel antiviral agent, in CMV management for both solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. Letermovir's unique mechanism of action, targeting the viral terminase complex, offers a promising alternative to conventional antivirals. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in preventing CMV infection and disease in high-risk populations, with a favorable safety profile and reduced incidence of adverse events compared to standard therapies. The review examines letermovir's pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, and its potential for use in resistant CMV strains. Additionally, ongoing research investigating letermovir's application in treatment scenarios and its long-term outcomes is discussed. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into letermovir's current place in CMV management protocols and its future prospects in transplant medicine."}
