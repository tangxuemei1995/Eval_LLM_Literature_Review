{"Abstract": "The plant microbiota plays a crucial role in crop health, productivity, and resilience. Recent advances in microbiome research have revealed the intricate relationships between plants and their associated microbial communities. This review explores the potential of engineering crop microbiota through host genetics, focusing on the impact of plant domestication and breeding on microbial assemblages in the rhizosphere and root systems. We examine how selective breeding has inadvertently altered microbial communities and discuss strategies to harness host genetic variation to shape beneficial microbiomes. The review highlights key plant traits influencing microbial recruitment and colonization, including root exudate composition, immune responses, and root architecture. Furthermore, we assess the challenges and opportunities in integrating microbiome-aware approaches into crop improvement programs. By leveraging host genetics to optimize plant-microbe interactions, we can potentially enhance crop performance, reduce chemical inputs, and improve agricultural sustainability. This emerging field holds promise for developing resilient cropping systems capable of adapting to changing environmental conditions and meeting global food security challenges."}
