{"Abstract": "Ralstonia solanacearum, a devastating plant pathogen, causes bacterial wilt disease in numerous economically important crops worldwide. This review explores the complex arsenal of virulence strategies employed by R. solanacearum, including its ability to adapt to diverse environments and evade host defense mechanisms. We examine the evolutionary processes that have shaped the pathogen's genetic diversity and host range expansion. Additionally, we discuss current and emerging approaches for disease management, focusing on biological control methods and the manipulation of plant microbiota. The potential for developing durable resistance in host plants is evaluated, considering recent advances in genomics and molecular breeding techniques. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the intricate interactions between R. solanacearum and its hosts, offering valuable perspectives for future research and the development of sustainable control strategies."}
