{"Abstract": "Downy mildews, caused by oomycete pathogens, pose significant threats to agricultural crops worldwide. This study presents a comprehensive genome-enabled analysis of downy mildew biology and evolution, utilizing telomere-to-telomere assemblies of multiple species. We identified novel effector proteins and their evolutionary patterns, shedding light on host-pathogen interactions. Our findings reveal the prevalence of heterokaryosis in downy mildews, suggesting a mechanism for rapid somatic adaptation to environmental stresses and host defenses. We also uncovered genomic signatures of host specialization and explored the potential for biosurveillance applications. This research provides unprecedented insights into the genomic architecture and adaptive strategies of downy mildews, paving the way for improved disease management and resistance breeding programs. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of high-quality genome assemblies in understanding the complex biology and evolution of these devastating plant pathogens."}
