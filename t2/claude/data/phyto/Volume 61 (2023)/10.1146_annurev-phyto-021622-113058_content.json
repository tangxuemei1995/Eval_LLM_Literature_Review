{"Abstract": "Integrated nematode management (INM) faces significant challenges in a rapidly changing world. This review explores the constraints, policies, processes, and emerging technologies that will shape the future of INM. We examine the complex interactions between nematodes, plant microbiomes, and soil ecosystems, highlighting the need for holistic approaches to management. The paper discusses the role of policy in promoting sustainable INM practices and the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with cutting-edge scientific advancements. We analyze the potential of genome editing and genetics in developing nematode-resistant crop varieties, as well as the application of remote sensing technologies for early detection and monitoring of nematode infestations. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical importance of maintaining root health in INM strategies. By addressing these interconnected aspects, this review provides a comprehensive outlook on the future of INM and its potential to enhance global food security and agricultural sustainability."}
