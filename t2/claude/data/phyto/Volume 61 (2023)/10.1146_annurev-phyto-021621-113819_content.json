{"Abstract": "The coevolution of viruses and their plant hosts is a dynamic process shaped by complex interactions over millions of years. This review explores the intricate relationship between plant viruses and host resistance within geographic centers of plant diversity, focusing on the impact of plate tectonics and long-term evolutionary processes. We examine how the movement of continents has influenced the distribution and diversification of both plants and their associated pathogens, leading to unique coevolutionary trajectories in different regions. The study highlights the importance of crop centers of diversity as hotspots for virus-host interactions, using the recent emergence of Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) as a case study. By analyzing the genetic diversity and resistance mechanisms in wild relatives of cultivated crops, we gain insights into the evolutionary arms race between viruses and their hosts. This research underscores the significance of preserving genetic diversity in crop wild relatives and the potential for harnessing ancient resistance genes to develop more resilient cultivars in the face of emerging viral threats."}
