{"Abstract": "Kitaviruses represent a unique group of atypical plant viruses that cause nonsystemic diseases, primarily affecting citrus and other economically important crops. This review explores the characteristics and significance of three genera within the Kitaviridae family: Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus. These viruses are primarily transmitted by Brevipalpus mites and are associated with localized symptoms, most notably citrus leprosis. The article examines the genomic organization, replication strategies, and host-pathogen interactions of kitaviruses, highlighting their distinctive features compared to systemic plant viruses. Additionally, the review discusses the evolutionary relationships between kitaviruses and negeviruses, shedding light on their potential common ancestry. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of kitaviruses is crucial for developing effective management strategies to mitigate their economic impact on agriculture. This comprehensive overview provides valuable insights into the current state of knowledge on kitaviruses and identifies areas for future research in this emerging field of plant virology."}
