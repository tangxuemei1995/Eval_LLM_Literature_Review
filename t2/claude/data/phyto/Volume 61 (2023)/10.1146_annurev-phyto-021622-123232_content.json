{"Abstract": "Plant pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate host cellular processes, particularly membrane trafficking, to promote infection. This review explores how diverse pathogens subvert plant endomembrane systems, focusing on the interplay between effector proteins and key components of vesicle transport, protein secretion, and autophagy pathways. We discuss the mechanisms by which pathogens hijack these processes to suppress plant immunity, facilitate nutrient acquisition, and establish specialized infection structures such as haustoria. Recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of effector-mediated trafficking perturbations are highlighted, revealing common themes and unique adaptations across different pathosystems. This knowledge not only enhances our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions but also provides potential targets for developing novel disease resistance strategies in crops."}
