{"Abstract": "Plant diseases pose significant threats to global food security and agricultural sustainability. The development of novel, environmentally friendly strategies for plant disease control is crucial. This review explores the potential of functional peptides as innovative biopesticides for managing plant pathogens. We examine the diverse mechanisms of action employed by these peptides, including membrane disruption, enzyme inhibition, and modulation of host defense responses. The natural sources of functional peptides are discussed, ranging from plants and microorganisms to insects and marine organisms. We analyze various production methods, including extraction from natural sources, chemical synthesis, and recombinant expression systems, highlighting their advantages and limitations. The review also addresses the challenges and opportunities in developing functional peptides as commercial biopesticides, such as stability, formulation, and regulatory considerations. Furthermore, we present case studies of successful applications of peptide-based products in controlling economically important plant diseases. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the current state of functional peptides in plant disease control and their potential to revolutionize sustainable agriculture practices."}
