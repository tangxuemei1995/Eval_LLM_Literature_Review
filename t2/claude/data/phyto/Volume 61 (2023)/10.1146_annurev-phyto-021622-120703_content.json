{"Abstract": "The Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV), a highly contagious Tobamovirus, has emerged as a global pandemic threat to tomato and pepper crops. This review examines the rapid spread of ToBRFV across continents, its devastating impact on crop yields, and the challenges in controlling its transmission. We analyze the virus's ability to persist in seeds and plant debris, highlighting the critical role of stringent hygiene practices in preventing its spread. The study also explores the limitations of current control measures, including the breakdown of known resistance genes in tomato cultivars. Furthermore, we discuss ongoing research efforts to develop resistant varieties and improve detection methods. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for international cooperation in implementing comprehensive management strategies to mitigate the economic losses associated with this emerging viral threat in global tomato and pepper production."}
