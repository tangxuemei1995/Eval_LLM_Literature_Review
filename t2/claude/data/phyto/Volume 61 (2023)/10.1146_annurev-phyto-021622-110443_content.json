{"Abstract": "The ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in plant immunity and cellular homeostasis. This review explores how plant pathogens manipulate the UPS to promote infection and suppress host defenses. We examine the diverse strategies employed by microbial effectors to interfere with ubiquitination processes, proteasome function, and overall proteostasis. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogen-mediated UPS manipulation are discussed, highlighting the intricate interplay between plant immunity and microbial virulence factors. The review also addresses the potential of targeting the UPS for developing novel plant protection strategies. By elucidating the complex relationship between the UPS and plant-pathogen interactions, this work provides valuable insights into the evolution of microbial virulence mechanisms and opens new avenues for enhancing crop resistance to diseases."}
