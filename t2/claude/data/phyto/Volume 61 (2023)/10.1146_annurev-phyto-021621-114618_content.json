{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate relationship between international trade and the local impacts of viral and bacterial diseases in ornamental plant production. By analyzing global trade data and disease incidence reports, we investigate how the movement of flowers and ornamental plants across borders influences the spread and economic consequences of pathogens. Our findings reveal that increased international trade correlates with higher rates of disease transmission, particularly in regions with less stringent phytosanitary regulations. We also explore the economic impact on local producers, identifying significant losses in productivity and market share due to disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation in mitigating disease risks. This study contributes to the understanding of plant disease dynamics in a globalized market and provides insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders to develop effective strategies for disease management and sustainable ornamental plant production."}
