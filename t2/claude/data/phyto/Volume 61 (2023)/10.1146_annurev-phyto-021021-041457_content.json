{"Abstract": "Microbiome research has traditionally focused on taxonomic composition, but network analyses offer a powerful approach to uncover the complex interactions within microbial communities. This review explores the application of network-based methods in microbial ecology, with a particular emphasis on plant and soil microbiomes. We discuss how coassociation and co-occurrence networks can reveal functional modules and keystone species, providing insights into community organization and ecosystem processes. The review highlights the potential of network analyses to bridge the gap between microbial community structure and function, offering a more holistic understanding of microbiome dynamics. By synthesizing recent advances in network-based approaches, we demonstrate their utility in deciphering the intricate relationships that shape microbial ecosystems and their impact on host health and environmental processes."}
