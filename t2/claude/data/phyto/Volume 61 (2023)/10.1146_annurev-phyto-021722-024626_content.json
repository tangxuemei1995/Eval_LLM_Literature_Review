{"Abstract": "The global forest health crisis, exacerbated by biological invasions, climate change, and human activities, presents a critical public-good social dilemma requiring urgent international collective action. This paper examines the complex interplay between natural resource policy, global change, and conservation of biodiversity in addressing the deteriorating state of the world's forests. We analyze the challenges of coordinating efforts across national boundaries to combat invasive species, mitigate climate impacts, and preserve forest ecosystems. The study highlights the inadequacy of current policy frameworks and proposes innovative approaches to foster global cooperation. By framing forest health as a shared responsibility, we argue for the development of comprehensive, transnational strategies that balance economic interests with ecological imperatives. Our findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift in forest management, emphasizing the importance of collaborative research, knowledge sharing, and coordinated policy implementation to safeguard this vital global resource."}
