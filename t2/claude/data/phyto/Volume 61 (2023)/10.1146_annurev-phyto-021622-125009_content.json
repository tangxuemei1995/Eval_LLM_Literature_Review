{"Abstract": "This review explores the virulence and ecological adaptations of Agrobacteria through the lens of evolutionary genomics. We examine the complex interplay between chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes that contribute to the pathogenicity and environmental fitness of these versatile phytopathogens. The evolution of virulence factors, including the Ti plasmid and its associated genes, is discussed in relation to host-pathogen interactions and horizontal gene transfer. We analyze genomic data to elucidate the mechanisms driving genetic diversity and niche adaptation in Agrobacterium species. The role of mobile genetic elements in shaping the Agrobacterium genome and conferring novel traits is also investigated. By integrating ecological, genomic, and evolutionary perspectives, this review provides insights into the factors influencing Agrobacterium virulence and their implications for agricultural management and potential biotechnological applications."}
