{"Abstract": "Plant-pathogenic bacteria employ sophisticated mechanisms to sense and respond to host metabolites, enabling them to regulate their virulence and overcome plant immunity. This review explores the intricate inter-kingdom signaling between plants and bacterial pathogens, focusing on how host metabolites act as virulence-regulating signals. We discuss the role of metabolic signaling in modulating bacterial effector production and type III secretion systems, key components of bacterial pathogenicity. The review highlights recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions, including the identification of specific host metabolites and their corresponding bacterial receptors. Additionally, we examine how this knowledge can be leveraged to develop novel strategies for enhancing plant immunity and controlling bacterial diseases in agriculture. This research provides crucial insights into the complex communication between plants and pathogens, paving the way for innovative approaches in crop protection and disease management."}
