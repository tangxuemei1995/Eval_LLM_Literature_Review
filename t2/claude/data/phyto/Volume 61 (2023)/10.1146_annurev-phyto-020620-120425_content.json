{"Abstract": "The field of phycopathology, the study of algal diseases, is experiencing a renaissance driven by the increasing importance of algal aquaculture and ecological concerns. This review explores the resurgence of interest in algal pathogens and their impacts on both cultivated and natural algal populations. We examine recent advances in understanding algal disease dynamics, host-pathogen interactions, and the ecological consequences of infections. The paper also discusses the implications for biosecurity in algal aquaculture and the potential threats to marine ecosystems. By integrating insights from algal biology, ecology, and parasitology, this review highlights the critical role of phycopathology in addressing current challenges in algal research and management."}
