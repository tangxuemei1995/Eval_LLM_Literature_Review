{"Abstract": "Phytophthora capsici, a devastating oomycete plant pathogen, has been a significant threat to vegetable crops worldwide since its description a century ago. This review examines the recent advancements in understanding the fundamental biology of P. capsici and the progress made in disease management strategies. We explore the pathogen's complex life cycle, host range expansion, and genetic diversity, which contribute to its adaptability and persistence. The review also discusses the emergence of fungicide resistance and its impact on conventional control methods. Furthermore, we highlight innovative approaches in disease management, including the development of resistant cultivars through molecular breeding techniques, biological control agents, and integrated pest management strategies. Despite considerable progress, challenges remain in effectively controlling P. capsici, emphasizing the need for continued research and collaborative efforts to safeguard global food security."}
