{"Abstract": "Induced resistance in fruits and vegetables has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate postharvest disease development. This review explores the physiological mechanisms underlying induced resistance and its impact on fruit and vegetable quality during storage. We examine how various elicitors trigger defense responses, activating signaling pathways and enhancing the production of secondary metabolites. The interplay between induced resistance and ripening processes is discussed, highlighting the potential for maturation delay as a beneficial side effect. We analyze the influence of pre- and postharvest factors on the efficacy of induced resistance, including cultivar selection, environmental conditions, and application methods. The review also addresses challenges in implementing induced resistance strategies, such as maintaining product quality and optimizing treatment protocols. By integrating current knowledge on host physiological responses, this work provides insights into the development of sustainable approaches for reducing postharvest losses and preserving the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables."}
