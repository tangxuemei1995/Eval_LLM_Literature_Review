{"Abstract": "Coastal wetlands, including marshes and mangroves, are increasingly recognized as valuable nature-based solutions for storm protection. This review synthesizes recent research on the effectiveness of tidal wetlands in buffering against cyclones, hurricanes, and flooding events. Studies demonstrate that these ecosystems can significantly attenuate wave energy, reduce storm surge heights, and mitigate coastal erosion. The protective capacity of wetlands varies based on factors such as vegetation structure, topography, and storm characteristics. Mangroves, with their complex root systems and dense canopies, show particular promise in tropical and subtropical regions. However, the benefits of wetlands extend beyond storm protection, encompassing carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and water quality improvement. As coastal communities face increasing threats from climate change and sea-level rise, integrating wetland conservation and restoration into coastal engineering strategies offers a sustainable and cost-effective approach to enhancing resilience and protecting vulnerable shorelines."}
