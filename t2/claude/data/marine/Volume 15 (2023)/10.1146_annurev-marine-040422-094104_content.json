{"Abstract": "Lipid biogeochemistry plays a crucial role in understanding marine ecosystems and global carbon cycling. This review explores the intersection of lipid geochemistry and modern lipidomic techniques in the context of microbial oceanography. Recent advancements in high-resolution mass spectrometry and chromatography have revolutionized our ability to characterize complex lipid mixtures in marine environments. These lipidomic approaches, combined with meta-omic techniques, provide unprecedented insights into microbial community structure, function, and adaptation to environmental stressors. We discuss the application of these methods to elucidate the sources, transformations, and fates of lipids in the ocean, as well as their potential as biomarkers for past and present oceanic conditions. Furthermore, we highlight the integration of lipidomics with other -omics approaches to create a more comprehensive understanding of marine biogeochemical processes. This review emphasizes the importance of lipid biogeochemistry in addressing key questions in microbial oceanography and its potential to unravel the complexities of ocean-climate interactions."}
