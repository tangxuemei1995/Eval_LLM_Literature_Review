{"Abstract": "This study employs nuclear reprocessing tracers, particularly 129I, to investigate the complex circulation patterns and connectivity between the Arctic and Subpolar North Atlantic Oceans. By analyzing the spatial and temporal distribution of these tracers, we elucidate key flow features and quantify transit time distributions between these critical oceanic regions. Our findings reveal intricate pathways of water mass exchange, highlighting the role of boundary currents and mesoscale eddies in facilitating transport. The use of 129I as a primary tracer provides unprecedented insights into decadal-scale circulation patterns, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the Arctic-Atlantic exchange processes. This research contributes to our knowledge of ocean circulation dynamics, climate variability, and the potential impacts of changing Arctic conditions on the broader North Atlantic system. The results have important implications for improving climate models and predicting future changes in ocean circulation patterns."}
