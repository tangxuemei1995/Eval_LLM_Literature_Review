{"Abstract": "The ocean's biological pump plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, yet quantifying its impact on carbon sequestration remains challenging. This study combines satellite oceanography data with advanced biogeochemical modeling to assess the biological pump's efficiency and carbon export pathways on global scales. We analyze spatial and temporal variations in carbon export, identifying key regions of high sequestration potential. Our results reveal significant heterogeneity in pump efficiency across ocean basins, with notable differences between coastal and open ocean environments. We estimate that the biological pump annually sequesters approximately X Gt of carbon, with substantial interannual variability. This research provides new insights into the ocean's capacity for carbon storage and highlights the importance of integrating multiple data sources and modeling approaches to improve our understanding of the ocean carbon cycle's role in climate regulation."}
