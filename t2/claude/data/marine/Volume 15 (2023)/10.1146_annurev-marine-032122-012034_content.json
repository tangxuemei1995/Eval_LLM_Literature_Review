{"Abstract": "The Beaufort Gyre, a prominent circulation feature in the Arctic Ocean, plays a crucial role in regulating the region's climate and ecosystem. This study examines the gyre's dynamics, focusing on its influence on sea ice distribution, freshwater storage, and ocean heat content. Analysis of satellite observations and in-situ measurements reveals significant changes in the gyre's strength and extent over recent decades, likely driven by shifting atmospheric patterns and declining sea ice cover. These alterations have profound implications for Arctic freshwater balance, marine productivity, and global ocean circulation. Understanding the Beaufort Gyre's evolving behavior is essential for predicting future Arctic climate scenarios and their far-reaching impacts on global climate systems."}
