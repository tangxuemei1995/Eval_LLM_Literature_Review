{"Abstract": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has emerged as a potential strategy to mitigate climate change, but its implementation raises complex sociotechnical challenges. This review examines the multifaceted considerations surrounding ocean CDR, including technological feasibility, climate finance mechanisms, public perception, and environmental ethics. We analyze the current state of ocean CDR technologies and their potential impacts on marine ecosystems. The study also explores the role of international climate finance in supporting ocean CDR initiatives and the challenges of developing equitable funding models. Furthermore, we investigate public attitudes towards ocean-based climate interventions and the factors influencing societal acceptance. Ethical considerations, such as intergenerational justice and the potential for unintended consequences, are critically examined. By synthesizing these diverse perspectives, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sociotechnical landscape of ocean CDR and inform future policy and research directions."}
