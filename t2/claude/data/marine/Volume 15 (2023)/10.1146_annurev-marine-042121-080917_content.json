{"Abstract": "Coral reef ecosystems are increasingly threatened by global environmental changes, necessitating a deeper understanding of their functional dynamics. This review explores the pivotal role of microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in coral reef ecosystem function and resilience. We synthesize recent findings on how microbiomes mediate nutrient cycling and energy flow through their processing of DOM, highlighting the complex interplay between coral-associated microbes, water column microorganisms, and reef substrates. The review examines how anthropogenic stressors, such as ocean warming and deoxygenation, alter microbial-DOM interactions and subsequently impact reef health. We discuss the potential of leveraging microbial-DOM dynamics for reef conservation and restoration efforts, emphasizing the need for integrative approaches that consider these interactions in ecosystem management strategies. This synthesis underscores the critical importance of microbial-DOM interactions in maintaining coral reef ecosystem function and enhancing resilience in the face of global change."}
