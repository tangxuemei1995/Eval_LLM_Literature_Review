{"Abstract": "The Sea Around Us project has emerged as a pivotal resource in documenting the global impact of human activities on marine ecosystems. This comprehensive initiative combines data science and global studies to provide open access to crucial information on fisheries worldwide. By focusing on artisanal, subsistence, and large-scale fisheries, the project offers a holistic view of the complex interactions between human exploitation and ocean health. The Sea Around Us serves as an invaluable tool for civil society, policymakers, and researchers in the twenty-first century, enabling informed decision-making and fostering sustainable management practices. Through its commitment to open data and rigorous scientific methodologies, the project continues to illuminate the pressing challenges facing our oceans and supports efforts to mitigate human-induced pressures on marine ecosystems."}
