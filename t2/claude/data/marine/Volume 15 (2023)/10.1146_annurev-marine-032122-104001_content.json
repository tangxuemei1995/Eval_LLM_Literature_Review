{"Abstract": "This study explores the use of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes in diatoms, foraminifera, and corals as valuable proxies for reconstructing past oceanic conditions and biogeochemical cycles. We review recent advancements in analytical techniques that have enabled the extraction and measurement of nitrogen isotopes from biominerals, providing insights into nutrient dynamics and nitrogen cycling over geological timescales. Our analysis reveals that diatom-bound nitrogen isotopes offer a robust record of surface ocean nitrate utilization, while foraminiferal-bound nitrogen isotopes reflect changes in the marine nitrogen cycle and water column denitrification. Coral-bound nitrogen isotopes provide information on both local and basin-wide nitrogen sources and cycling. By comparing these proxies across different marine environments and time periods, we demonstrate their complementary nature in reconstructing past oceanic conditions. This research highlights the potential of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes as powerful tools for understanding long-term changes in marine ecosystems, nutrient availability, and global biogeochemical cycles, with implications for predicting future ocean responses to climate change."}
