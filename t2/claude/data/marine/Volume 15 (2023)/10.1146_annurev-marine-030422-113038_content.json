{"Abstract": "Marine organisms have evolved intricate endogenous oscillators to synchronize their biological processes with environmental cycles. This review explores the diverse rhythms and clocks observed in marine species, including circadian, circatidal, circalunar, and circannual patterns. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying these oscillators in various marine algae and animals, highlighting their adaptive significance in regulating physiological and behavioral responses to predictable environmental changes. The interplay between endogenous clocks and external cues, such as light, temperature, and tidal cycles, is discussed, emphasizing the importance of these interactions for survival and reproduction in marine ecosystems. Furthermore, we address the potential impacts of climate change on marine biological rhythms, considering how altered environmental cues may disrupt the timing of critical life-history events. This synthesis underscores the need for further research to elucidate the complex relationships between marine organisms' internal clocks and their changing environment, ultimately informing conservation strategies and predictions of ecosystem responses to global climate shifts."}
