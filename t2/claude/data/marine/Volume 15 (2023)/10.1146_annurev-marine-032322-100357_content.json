{"Abstract": "This study examines the current state of gender equity in the field of oceanography, addressing the persistent underrepresentation of women in leadership positions and research roles. Through a comprehensive analysis of global data from academic institutions, research vessels, and funding agencies, we investigate the factors contributing to gender disparities in oceanographic careers. Our findings reveal significant gaps in promotion rates, grant allocations, and publication opportunities between male and female oceanographers. We identify key barriers, including implicit bias, lack of mentorship, and work-life balance challenges specific to oceanographic fieldwork. The study proposes evidence-based strategies to promote gender equity, such as targeted mentoring programs, family-friendly policies for sea-going expeditions, and initiatives to increase visibility of female role models in the field. These findings contribute to the ongoing dialogue on diversity and inclusion in STEM disciplines and offer practical recommendations for institutions and policymakers to foster a more equitable oceanographic community."}
