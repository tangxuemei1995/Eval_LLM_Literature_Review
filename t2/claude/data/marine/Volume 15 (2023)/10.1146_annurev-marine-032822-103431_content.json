{"Abstract": "Iron isotopes have emerged as powerful tools for unraveling the complex biogeochemical cycling of iron in marine environments. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of iron isotope fractionation processes and their application to marine systems. We examine the isotopic signatures of major iron sources, including atmospheric dust, sediments, and hydrothermal vents, and discuss how these signatures are modified during transport and biological uptake. Data from the GEOTRACES program have provided unprecedented spatial coverage of iron isotope distributions in the global ocean, revealing distinct patterns that reflect the interplay of physical, chemical, and biological processes. These observations have led to new insights into the relative importance of different iron sources, the extent of iron recycling, and the role of organic ligands in controlling iron bioavailability. We highlight the potential of iron isotopes as tracers of past and present ocean biogeochemistry and discuss future research directions in this rapidly evolving field."}
