{"Abstract": "The deep ocean's water column harbors a diverse and abundant prokaryotic community, playing a crucial role in global biogeochemical cycles. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the distribution, diversity, and metabolic activities of bacteria and archaea in the deep ocean. Recent advances in microbial oceanography have revealed unique adaptations of these organisms to high-pressure, low-temperature environments. Molecular techniques have uncovered previously unknown prokaryotic lineages and metabolic pathways, highlighting the importance of chemosynthetic processes in sustaining deep-sea ecosystems. The vertical stratification of prokaryotic communities along the water column reflects changes in nutrient availability and physicochemical parameters. Furthermore, the deep ocean serves as a reservoir of genetic diversity and potential biotechnological resources. Understanding the ecology and function of deep-sea prokaryotes is essential for predicting the impacts of climate change on ocean ecosystems and global carbon cycling."}
