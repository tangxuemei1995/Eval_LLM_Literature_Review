{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes proxy- and model-based reconstructions of global Quaternary carbonate burial to assess variations between glacial and interglacial periods and their implications for the carbon cycle. We compile and analyze sediment core data, geochemical proxies, and Earth system model simulations to quantify changes in carbonate accumulation rates across different ocean basins. Our results indicate significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in carbonate burial, with generally higher rates during interglacials. However, uncertainties persist due to limited spatial coverage of proxy records and model parameterization challenges. We discuss the potential drivers of these variations, including changes in ocean chemistry, biological productivity, and sediment transport. The study highlights the complex interplay between climate, ocean circulation, and marine biogeochemistry in modulating carbonate burial. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the global carbon cycle and its response to glacial-interglacial transitions, with implications for future climate change projections."}
