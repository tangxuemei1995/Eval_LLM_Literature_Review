{"Abstract": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) play a crucial role in global marine ecosystems and fisheries productivity. This study examines the impacts of climate change on EBUS, focusing on the California, Humboldt, Canary, and Benguela systems. We analyze long-term observational data and employ high-resolution climate models to assess changes in upwelling intensity, seasonality, and associated oceanographic parameters. Results indicate a complex response to global warming, with regional variations in upwelling trends. While some areas show intensification of upwelling-favorable winds, others experience weakening or shifts in seasonality. These changes have significant implications for nutrient dynamics, primary productivity, and marine food webs. We also observe alterations in coastal stratification and oxygen levels, potentially leading to expanded oxygen minimum zones. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of EBUS to climate change and emphasize the need for adaptive management strategies to ensure the sustainability of these ecologically and economically important marine ecosystems."}
