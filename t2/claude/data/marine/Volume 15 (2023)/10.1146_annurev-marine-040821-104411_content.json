{"Abstract": "This study investigates the transport mechanisms of oil following the Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. We examine the complex interplay between oil spreading, dispersion, and droplet formation in the marine environment. Using advanced numerical models and field observations, we analyze the role of oceanic currents, wind patterns, and chemical dispersants in determining the fate and distribution of the released oil. Our findings reveal that eddy diffusivity plays a crucial role in the horizontal and vertical transport of oil droplets, significantly influencing the extent of the affected area. We also explore the impact of droplet size distribution on the oil's residence time in the water column and its potential for surface slick formation. The results provide valuable insights into the long-term consequences of deep-sea oil spills and offer improved predictive capabilities for future oil transport modeling. This research contributes to the development of more effective response strategies and environmental impact assessments for offshore drilling accidents."}
