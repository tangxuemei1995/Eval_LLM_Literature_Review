{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of cross-shore exchange in the nearshore region, focusing on the transport of plankton, pollutants, and particles. We examine the interplay of various physical processes, including turbulence, wind-driven currents, surface waves, and internal waves, to understand their collective impact on particle behavior and transport. Using a combination of field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling, we quantify the relative contributions of these mechanisms to cross-shore exchange rates. Our findings reveal that surface waves and internal waves play a dominant role in particle transport, while wind-driven currents and turbulence contribute to smaller-scale mixing processes. We also identify key differences in the transport patterns of plankton, pollutants, and inert particles, highlighting the importance of considering particle-specific characteristics in nearshore exchange models. These results provide valuable insights for coastal management and pollution mitigation strategies."}
