{"Abstract": "Pacific decadal variability (PDV) plays a crucial role in modulating global climate patterns and has significant implications for long-term climate change projections. This review synthesizes current understanding of the modes and mechanisms driving PDV in the Pacific Ocean. We examine the interplay between ocean-atmosphere teleconnections, El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and other climate phenomena that contribute to decadal-scale variability. The study explores the spatial and temporal characteristics of PDV, including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). We analyze observational data, paleoclimate records, and climate model simulations to elucidate the underlying physical processes and feedbacks that govern PDV. The review also addresses the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on PDV patterns and their global consequences. By integrating diverse lines of evidence, this work provides a comprehensive overview of PDV mechanisms and their implications for climate variability and predictability on decadal timescales."}
