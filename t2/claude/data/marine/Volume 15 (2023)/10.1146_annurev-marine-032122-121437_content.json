{"Abstract": "Marine heatwaves, characterized by prolonged periods of anomalously high ocean temperatures, are becoming increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biological impacts of these extreme events on marine ecosystems. We examine how marine heatwaves affect various trophic levels, from primary producers to top predators, and assess their consequences for ecosystem structure and function. The analysis reveals widespread impacts, including shifts in species distributions, alterations in community composition, and disruptions to ecosystem services. We also explore the potential for cumulative effects and tipping points in marine systems exposed to recurrent heatwaves. By integrating findings from diverse marine environments, this review highlights the urgent need for improved understanding and prediction of marine heatwave impacts to inform adaptive management strategies in a rapidly changing ocean."}
