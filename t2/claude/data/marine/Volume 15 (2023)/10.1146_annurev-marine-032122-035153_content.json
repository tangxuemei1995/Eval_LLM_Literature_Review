{"Abstract": "The biological carbon pump plays a crucial role in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels by exporting organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of carbon export processes from a biologist's perspective. We examine the formation and transformation of marine snow, fecal pellets, and other particulate organic matter that contribute to the vertical flux of carbon. The complex interplay between microbial degradation and zooplankton feeding on sinking particles is explored, highlighting their impact on flux attenuation. We discuss the importance of aggregate formation and disaggregation in modulating export efficiency. Additionally, we consider how changing ocean conditions, such as warming and acidification, may alter these biological processes and subsequently affect carbon export. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the intricate mechanisms governing the biological carbon pump and emphasizes the need for further research to better predict its response to global environmental changes."}
