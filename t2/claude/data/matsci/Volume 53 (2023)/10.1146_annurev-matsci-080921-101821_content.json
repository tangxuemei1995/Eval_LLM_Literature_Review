{"Abstract": "This study investigates the formation, structure, and properties of low-dimensional and confined ice systems. We explore the crystal growth mechanisms and morphological characteristics of ice in restricted geometries, such as nanopores, thin films, and interfaces. Advanced characterization techniques, including spectroscopy and microscopy, are employed to analyze the unique structural features of these confined ice formations. The research reveals significant deviations in the optical and mechanical properties of low-dimensional ice compared to bulk ice. We observe altered phase transitions, enhanced proton ordering, and modified hydrogen bonding networks in these confined systems. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of ice behavior in nanoscale environments, with implications for fields such as materials science, atmospheric chemistry, and biological systems. This work provides valuable insights into the fundamental nature of water in restricted spaces and opens new avenues for manipulating ice properties through dimensional confinement."}
