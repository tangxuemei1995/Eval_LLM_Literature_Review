{"Abstract": "Extreme abnormal grain growth (EAGG) is a fascinating phenomenon in materials science that results in the formation of exceptionally large grains within a fine-grained matrix. This review explores the underlying mechanisms and microstructural outcomes of EAGG, focusing on the interplay between grain boundary energy, mobility, and Zener pinning effects. We examine how these factors contribute to the initiation and propagation of EAGG, and discuss the role of crystallographic texture, impurities, and processing conditions in influencing the final microstructure. The review also highlights recent advances in experimental techniques and computational modeling that have enhanced our understanding of EAGG. By connecting mechanisms to microstructural outcomes, this work provides valuable insights for tailoring material properties and controlling grain growth in various engineering applications, from aerospace alloys to electronic materials."}
