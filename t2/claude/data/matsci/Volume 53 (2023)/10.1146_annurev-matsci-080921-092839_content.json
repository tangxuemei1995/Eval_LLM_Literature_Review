{"Abstract": "Piezoelectric composites have emerged as versatile materials with a wide range of applications, particularly in ultrasound technology. This review explores the various types of piezoelectric composites, focusing on their connectivity patterns and constituent materials. We examine the advantages of combining piezoelectric ceramics or single crystals with polymeric matrices to create composites with tailored properties. The paper discusses the impact of different connectivity configurations on the overall performance of these materials, highlighting their enhanced sensitivity and bandwidth compared to traditional piezoelectric ceramics. Additionally, we analyze the recent advancements in fabrication techniques and the integration of novel piezoelectric materials, such as single crystals, into composite structures. The versatility of piezoelectric composites is demonstrated through their applications in medical imaging, non-destructive testing, and underwater acoustics, showcasing their potential for future technological innovations."}
