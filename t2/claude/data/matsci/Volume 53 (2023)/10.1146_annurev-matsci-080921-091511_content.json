{"Abstract": "Grain boundary migration plays a crucial role in the evolution of microstructure and properties of polycrystalline materials. This review examines recent advances in understanding the mechanisms and kinetics of grain boundary migration during grain growth in polycrystals. We discuss the influence of various factors, including temperature, impurities, and applied stress, on the mobility and migration behavior of grain boundaries. The review highlights the importance of atomistic simulations and in situ experimental techniques in elucidating the fundamental processes governing grain boundary motion. Additionally, we explore the relationship between grain boundary character and migration rates, emphasizing the role of grain boundary energy and crystallographic orientation. The implications of grain boundary migration on the overall microstructural evolution and resulting material properties are also addressed. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex nature of grain boundary migration and its significance in materials science and engineering."}
