{"Abstract": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has become an indispensable tool in materials science, offering unprecedented insights into material structures and properties at the atomic scale. This review explores the latest advancements in quantitative STEM techniques for materials characterization, focusing on imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and tomography. We discuss the principles behind these methods and their applications in analyzing complex materials systems. Recent developments in simulation techniques and data analysis algorithms are examined, highlighting their role in enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of STEM data. The integration of multiple STEM modalities is shown to provide comprehensive, multi-dimensional information about material properties. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in quantitative STEM, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize our understanding of materials across various scientific and technological domains."}
