{"Abstract": "Polar metals, materials that exhibit both metallic conductivity and polar structural distortions, have emerged as a fascinating class of compounds with unique physical properties. This review explores the fundamental principles underlying polar metals and their potential applications. We discuss the apparent contradiction between metallicity and ferroelectricity, and how it can be resolved through various mechanisms, including improper ferroelectricity. The role of perovskite structures in realizing polar metals is examined, along with the challenges in measuring and characterizing polarization in these materials. Recent advances in synthesis techniques and theoretical predictions of new polar metal candidates are highlighted. Finally, we consider the prospects of polar metals in next-generation electronic devices, spintronics, and quantum computing applications, emphasizing the need for further research to fully harness their potential."}
