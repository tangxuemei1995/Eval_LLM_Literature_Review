{"Abstract": "Dynamic in situ electron microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of single-atom catalysis, offering unprecedented insights into real-time chemical processes at the atomic scale. This review explores recent developments in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the ability to observe and analyze catalytic reactions as they unfold. We discuss cutting-edge techniques that enable the visualization of individual atoms during catalytic events, providing crucial information about reaction mechanisms, intermediate states, and catalyst stability. The integration of environmental chambers and advanced detectors has facilitated the study of catalysts under realistic operating conditions, bridging the gap between idealized models and practical applications. By elucidating the dynamic behavior of single-atom catalysts, these advancements are revolutionizing catalyst design and optimization, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable chemical processes across various industries."}
