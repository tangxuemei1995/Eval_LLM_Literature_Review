{"Abstract": "This review explores the crucial role of material representations in machine learning applications for materials science. We examine various approaches to feature engineering, focusing on methods that capture essential characteristics of crystal structures and chemical compositions. The paper discusses traditional descriptors as well as advanced techniques, including graph-based representations and generative models. We analyze the strengths and limitations of different representation methods, considering their ability to encode complex structural and chemical information. The impact of these representations on the performance of machine learning models for predicting material properties and discovering novel materials is evaluated. Furthermore, we highlight recent developments in representation learning and their potential to revolutionize materials informatics. This comprehensive overview aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate representations for their specific materials science problems and to inspire future advancements in the field."}
