{"Abstract": "Noncentrosymmetric materials have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in various fields. This review explores the design principles for creating and optimizing noncentrosymmetric materials, focusing on their nonlinear optical responses, magnetic properties, and topological features. We discuss the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation of skyrmions and their topological protection in these materials. The relationship between crystal structure and electronic properties is examined, highlighting the role of symmetry breaking in enhancing desired characteristics. Additionally, we analyze the interplay between noncentrosymmetry and magnetism, and its impact on the materials' functional properties. By synthesizing recent advancements in the field, this review provides insights into rational design strategies for developing novel noncentrosymmetric materials with tailored properties for applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and quantum computing."}
