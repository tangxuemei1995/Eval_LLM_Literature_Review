{"Abstract": "Hydrous transition metal oxides have emerged as promising materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications due to their unique structural properties and versatile redox chemistry. This review explores the role of structural water in enhancing the performance of these materials for various applications, including supercapacitors, batteries, and electrocatalysis. We discuss the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and structure-property relationships of hydrous transition metal oxides, focusing on their insertion/extraction mechanisms and charge storage capabilities. The impact of structural water on electronic conductivity, ion diffusion, and stability is examined, along with strategies for optimizing water content and distribution. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in utilizing these materials for environmental applications, such as water treatment and gas sensing. Finally, we address the challenges and future prospects for hydrous transition metal oxides in electrochemical energy and environmental technologies, emphasizing the need for further research to fully exploit their potential."}
