{"Abstract": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for manipulating the electronic and magnetic properties of materials, offering unprecedented control over charge carrier density and phase transitions. This review explores the application of ionic gating to various systems, including transition metal oxides, magnetic thin films, and van der Waals 2D materials. We discuss the fundamental principles of ionic gating and its ability to induce superconductivity, modulate magnetic ordering, and tune electronic band structures. The review highlights recent advancements in the field, such as the use of ionic gating for neuromorphic computing applications and the exploration of novel quantum phenomena. We also address the challenges and limitations of this technique, including issues related to sample degradation and reversibility. Finally, we provide an outlook on future directions and potential breakthroughs in the field of ionic gating for materials engineering and device applications."}
