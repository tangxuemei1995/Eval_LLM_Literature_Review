{"Abstract": "Engineered wood has emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to traditional building materials, offering enhanced performance and environmental benefits. This review explores recent advancements in engineered wood technologies, focusing on nanocellulose-based composites and transparent wood. We examine the production methods, mechanical properties, and potential applications of these innovative materials. The integration of nanocellulose into engineered wood products significantly improves strength, durability, and fire resistance. Transparent wood, a novel material with unique optical and thermal properties, shows potential for energy-efficient building envelopes and solar energy harvesting. We also discuss the sustainability aspects of engineered wood, including its reduced carbon footprint and potential for thermal management in buildings. The growing adoption of these technologies in construction and other industries highlights the importance of continued research and development in this field."}
