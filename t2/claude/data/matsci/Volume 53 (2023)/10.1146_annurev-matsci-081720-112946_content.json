{"Abstract": "This review explores the potential and limitations of tailor-made additives in melt-grown molecular crystals, a field that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. We examine the fundamental principles governing the interaction between additives and growing crystal faces during melt crystallization, focusing on their effects on spherulite formation, crystal twisting, and the emergence of chirality and polarity. The review critically assesses the current understanding of additive-induced modifications in crystal morphology, growth kinetics, and internal structure. We discuss the challenges in designing effective tailor-made additives for melt systems, including considerations of thermal stability, miscibility, and selective adsorption. The potential applications of this approach in controlling crystal properties for various industrial and technological purposes are highlighted. Additionally, we address the limitations and open questions in this field, emphasizing the need for further research to fully exploit the potential of tailor-made additives in melt crystallization processes. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the current state of the art and future directions in this promising area of crystal engineering."}
