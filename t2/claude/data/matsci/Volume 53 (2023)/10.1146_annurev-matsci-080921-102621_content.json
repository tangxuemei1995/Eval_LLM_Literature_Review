{"Abstract": "This review explores recent advancements in understanding plastic localization through crystallographic slip in metallic materials. We examine emerging experimental techniques, including high-resolution digital image correlation and in-situ electron microscopy, which provide unprecedented insights into slip behavior at micro- and nanoscales. Complementary numerical approaches, such as crystal plasticity finite element modeling and atomistic simulations, are discussed for their ability to predict and interpret complex slip patterns. The synergy between these experimental and computational methods has significantly enhanced our comprehension of how slip localization influences mechanical properties and overall plasticity in metals. This improved understanding is crucial for developing more accurate models of material behavior and designing materials with tailored mechanical properties."}
