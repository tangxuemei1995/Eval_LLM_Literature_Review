{"Abstract": "This review explores strategies for scaling up photochemical reactions from laboratory to industrial production. We examine two primary approaches: numbering up and sizing up. Numbering up involves replicating small-scale reactors, while sizing up entails increasing reactor dimensions. The advantages and challenges of each method are discussed, with emphasis on maintaining reaction efficiency and product quality. Flow chemistry is highlighted as a promising technique for photochemical scale-up, offering improved light penetration and heat transfer. We also address key considerations in reactor design, light source selection, and process optimization. This comprehensive analysis aims to guide researchers and industry professionals in developing efficient, large-scale photochemical processes."}
