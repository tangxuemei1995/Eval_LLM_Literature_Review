{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving role of International Oil Companies (IOCs) in the global transition towards net-zero emissions. As the world shifts away from fossil fuels, IOCs face unprecedented challenges and opportunities in adapting their business models. The research analyzes how these companies are leveraging their expertise in energy carrier technologies, transport, and storage to remain relevant in a low-carbon future. It explores the potential for IOCs to diversify into renewable energy sources while capitalizing on their existing infrastructure and knowledge of high-density energy systems. The study also investigates the strategies employed by IOCs to balance short-term profitability with long-term sustainability goals. Findings suggest that IOCs' success in the energy transition will depend on their ability to innovate, invest in clean technologies, and transform their core operations while maintaining shareholder value."}
