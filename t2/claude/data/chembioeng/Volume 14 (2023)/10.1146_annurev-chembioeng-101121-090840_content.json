{"Abstract": "This review explores the potential of electrochemical manufacturing routes for organic chemical commodities as a sustainable alternative to traditional petrochemical processes. The growing interest in organic electrosynthesis is driven by the need for cleaner production methods and the push towards industrial electrification and decarbonization. We examine recent advancements in electrochemical technologies, focusing on their application in the synthesis of high-value organic compounds. The review highlights the advantages of electrochemical processes, including improved selectivity, milder reaction conditions, and reduced environmental impact. Key challenges, such as scale-up issues and electrode materials, are discussed alongside potential solutions. Finally, we assess the economic viability and environmental benefits of implementing electrochemical routes in the chemical manufacturing industry, providing insights into future research directions and industrial adoption strategies."}
