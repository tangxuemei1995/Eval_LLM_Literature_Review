{"Abstract": "This review explores the latest advancements in in situ and operando characterization techniques for electrochemical CO2 reduction. We discuss how these methods provide crucial mechanistic insights into catalyst behavior, electrolyte effects, and reaction intermediates during carbon dioxide electroreduction. The review covers a range of advanced techniques, including spectroscopic, microscopic, and synchrotron-based methods, highlighting their unique capabilities in probing the complex interfacial processes. By elucidating the dynamic changes occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface, these techniques contribute to a deeper understanding of reaction pathways and catalyst degradation mechanisms. This knowledge is essential for designing more efficient and selective catalysts, ultimately advancing the field of CO2 electroreduction for sustainable energy applications."}
