{"Abstract": "Oxidative stress poses a significant challenge to bacterial survival, necessitating rapid and efficient stress response mechanisms. This review explores the emerging role of RNAs as sensors of oxidative stress in bacteria. We discuss how specific RNA structures and sequences can directly detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and trigger protective responses. The mechanisms of RNA oxidation and its impact on gene expression are examined, highlighting the potential for RNA-based sensors in synthetic biology applications. We also consider the evolutionary implications of RNA-mediated stress sensing and its integration with other bacterial stress response pathways. This research provides insights into the complex interplay between RNA biology and oxidative stress, offering new perspectives on bacterial adaptation and potential targets for antimicrobial strategies."}
