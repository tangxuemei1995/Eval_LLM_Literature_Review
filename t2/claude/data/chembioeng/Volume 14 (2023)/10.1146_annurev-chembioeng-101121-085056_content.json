{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate dynamics of drying colloidal dispersions in sessile drops. We examine the complex interplay between evaporative patterns, evaporation-driven flows, and particle interactions that govern the final deposit morphology. The study encompasses various aspects of drying in complex fluids and configurations, highlighting the influence of substrate properties, environmental conditions, and particle characteristics on the drying process. We discuss recent advances in understanding and controlling the coffee-ring effect, as well as strategies for achieving uniform deposits. The review also addresses the challenges and opportunities in applying these insights to practical applications, such as inkjet printing and biosensing. By synthesizing current knowledge, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the field and identify promising directions for future research."}
