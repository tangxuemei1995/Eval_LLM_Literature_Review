{"Abstract": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a promising class of green solvents, attracting significant attention in various fields of chemistry and engineering. This review provides a comprehensive overview of DESs, exploring their fundamental properties, preparation methods, and diverse applications. We delve into the underlying principles of solid-liquid equilibrium and hydrogen bonding that govern DES formation, emphasizing the crucial role of melting temperature depression in eutectic mixtures. The review critically examines the advantages of DESs over conventional solvents, including their low toxicity, biodegradability, and tunable physicochemical properties. Furthermore, we discuss recent advancements in DES research, highlighting their potential in areas such as extraction, catalysis, and materials synthesis. By addressing common misconceptions and providing clarity on key concepts, this review aims to demystify DESs and encourage their wider adoption in sustainable chemical processes."}
