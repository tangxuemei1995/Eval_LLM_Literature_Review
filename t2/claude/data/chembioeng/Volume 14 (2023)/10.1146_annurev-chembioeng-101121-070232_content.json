{"Abstract": "Peptide-based vectors have emerged as a promising biomolecular engineering strategy for gene delivery, offering a versatile and efficient approach to overcome cellular barriers. This review explores the design and application of intracellular targeting peptides for the delivery of various nucleic acid cargoes, including silencing RNA (siRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and oligonucleotides. We discuss the key challenges in gene delivery, such as cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and highlight how peptide-based vectors address these obstacles. Recent advancements in peptide engineering for enhanced stability, specificity, and transfection efficiency are examined. Additionally, we review the progress of peptide-based gene delivery systems in clinical trials, focusing on their potential for therapeutic applications. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the current state of peptide-based vectors and their future prospects in advancing gene therapy and nucleic acid-based treatments."}
