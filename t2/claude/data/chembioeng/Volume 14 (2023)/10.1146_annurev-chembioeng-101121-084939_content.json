{"Abstract": "Active colloids represent a fascinating class of nonequilibrium systems that exhibit self-propelled motion and collective behavior. This review explores the multifaceted roles of active colloids as models for understanding fundamental principles of nonequilibrium physics, as novel materials with unique properties, and as potential microscale machines. We discuss recent advances in the design and fabrication of active colloidal particles, their propulsion mechanisms, and emergent collective phenomena in active colloidal assemblies. The review highlights how these systems serve as experimental platforms for studying active matter physics, including phase transitions, pattern formation, and self-organization. Furthermore, we examine the potential applications of active colloids in materials science, drug delivery, and microfluidics. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in the field, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of active colloidal research and its implications for diverse scientific domains."}
