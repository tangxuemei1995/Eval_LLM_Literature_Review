{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of machine learning techniques with traditional physical models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of thermodynamic modeling for fluid mixtures. By combining data-driven approaches with established thermodynamic principles, we develop a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of both methodologies. The proposed framework incorporates machine learning algorithms to capture complex non-linear relationships and physical constraints to ensure consistency with fundamental laws. We demonstrate the model's performance on various fluid mixture systems, comparing results with conventional equation of state models. Our findings indicate that this hybrid approach significantly improves predictive capabilities while maintaining physical interpretability. This research contributes to the advancement of thermodynamic modeling techniques and offers potential applications in process design, optimization, and simulation across multiple industries."}
