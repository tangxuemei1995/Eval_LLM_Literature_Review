{"Abstract": "Lignocellulosic biorefineries present a promising avenue for sustainable biobased polymer production, offering a viable alternative to petroleum-based materials. This review explores recent engineering innovations, challenges, and opportunities in the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass for polymer synthesis. We examine cutting-edge technologies in biomass pretreatment, fractionation, and conversion processes, highlighting advancements in enzymatic and chemical catalysis. The integration of these processes within biorefinery systems is discussed, emphasizing the importance of process optimization and life-cycle management. We address key challenges, including feedstock variability, process scalability, and product quality control. Furthermore, we evaluate the environmental and economic implications of lignocellulosic biorefineries, considering sustainability metrics and market competitiveness. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the future of biobased polymer production and its potential to revolutionize the materials industry while promoting circular bioeconomy principles."}
