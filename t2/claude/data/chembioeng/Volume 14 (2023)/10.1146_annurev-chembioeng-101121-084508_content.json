{"Abstract": "Passive immunization with antibodies offers a powerful approach to combat pathogens, complementing traditional vaccines. However, many pathogens have evolved sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms, challenging the efficacy of conventional antibody therapies. This review explores recent advances in antibody engineering to outsmart these evasive pathogens. We discuss innovative strategies such as Fc engineering to enhance effector functions, bispecific antibodies targeting multiple epitopes simultaneously, and antibody-drug conjugates for precise delivery of therapeutic payloads. These approaches show promise in overcoming immune evasion tactics and improving the potency of passive immunization. Additionally, we examine how these engineered antibodies can be leveraged to develop more effective vaccines. By harnessing the potential of antibody engineering, researchers are paving the way for next-generation therapies capable of outmaneuvering even the most elusive pathogens."}
