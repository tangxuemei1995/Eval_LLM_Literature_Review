{"Abstract": "Genomic data has revolutionized our ability to investigate population relationships and demographic history. This review explores current methods for assessing these aspects using genomic information. We discuss techniques for inferring effective population size, detecting admixture events, and estimating ancestry proportions. The application of molecular clocks to genomic data for dating historical events is also examined. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of various approaches, including coalescent-based methods, principal component analysis, and machine learning algorithms. The integration of multiple lines of evidence, such as archaeological and linguistic data, with genomic analyses is highlighted as a powerful strategy for reconstructing population histories. Finally, we address challenges in interpreting results, including the impact of ascertainment bias and the importance of appropriate reference populations. This review provides a comprehensive overview of genomic methods for unraveling the complex relationships and histories of human populations."}
