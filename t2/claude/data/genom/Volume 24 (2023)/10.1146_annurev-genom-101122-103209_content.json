{"Abstract": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing in genomic research has sparked a paradigm shift in the approach to returning results to study participants. This review explores the evolving landscape of result disclosure, addressing the ethical, legal, and practical challenges associated with communicating primary findings, secondary findings, and incidental discoveries. We examine current practices, guidelines, and policies surrounding the return of results, highlighting the tension between researchers' obligations and participants' rights to information. The paper discusses the complexities of interpreting and validating genomic data, the potential psychological impact on participants, and the resource implications for research institutions. Furthermore, we consider the emerging concept of a 'new normal' in genomic research, where comprehensive result disclosure becomes standard practice. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of informed consent processes, data management strategies, and the development of robust frameworks to support responsible and meaningful communication of genomic findings to research participants."}
