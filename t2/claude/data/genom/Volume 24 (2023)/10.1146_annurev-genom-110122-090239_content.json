{"Abstract": "Meiosis is a critical process in sexual reproduction, involving the formation of haploid gametes. Central to this process is the synaptonemal complex (SC), a protein structure that facilitates chromosome pairing and recombination. This review explores the intricate relationship between meiotic chromosome structure, SC formation, and fertility outcomes. We examine recent advances in understanding SC assembly and its role in maintaining genomic stability during meiosis. Furthermore, we discuss how defects in SC formation and function can lead to various fertility issues, including azoospermia, primary ovarian failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss. By integrating findings from genetic, molecular, and cytological studies, we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying these fertility disorders and potential therapeutic targets. This comprehensive analysis highlights the crucial role of proper meiotic chromosome structure and SC function in ensuring successful gametogenesis and reproductive health."}
