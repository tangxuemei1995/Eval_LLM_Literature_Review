{"Abstract": "Axial length, a critical determinant of refractive error, plays a pivotal role in ocular development and visual acuity. This review explores the genetic factors influencing axial length across the spectrum from microphthalmia to high myopia in childhood. We examine recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions, focusing on key genes and signaling pathways involved in ocular growth regulation. Microphthalmia, characterized by abnormally small eyes, is associated with mutations in genes such as SOX2 and OTX2, which are crucial for early eye development. Conversely, high myopia, marked by excessive axial elongation, involves complex interactions between multiple genetic loci and environmental factors. We discuss the role of genes like MYOC, OPTC, and PAX6 in myopia progression, as well as genome-wide association studies that have identified novel susceptibility loci. Additionally, we explore the potential of gene therapy and targeted interventions in managing these conditions. This comprehensive review provides insights into the genetic architecture of axial length determination, offering valuable perspectives for future research and therapeutic strategies in pediatric ophthalmology."}
