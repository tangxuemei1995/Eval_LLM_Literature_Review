{"Abstract": "Federated analysis has emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving data sharing in genomics research. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of federated analysis techniques, exploring their technical foundations and legal implications. We discuss the key principles of federation, including data decentralization and distributed computation, and examine how these concepts align with privacy protection regulations such as GDPR. The potential applications of federated analysis in genomics are highlighted, demonstrating its ability to facilitate collaborative research while maintaining individual-level data confidentiality. We also address the challenges and limitations of federated approaches, including computational overhead and potential vulnerabilities. By synthesizing technical and legal perspectives, this primer aims to equip researchers and policymakers with a foundational understanding of federated analysis, fostering its responsible implementation in genomics and other sensitive data domains."}
