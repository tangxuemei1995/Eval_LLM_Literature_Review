{"Abstract": "The rapid advancement of genomic technologies has ushered in a new era of personalized medicine, but it has also created a complex legal landscape fraught with potential liabilities. This paper examines the evolving legal challenges in genomics, focusing on key areas such as the duty to warn, data privacy, and informed consent. We analyze recent case law and regulatory frameworks to identify emerging trends and potential legal pitfalls for healthcare providers, researchers, and genetic testing companies. The study highlights the tension between the ethical obligation to disclose clinically significant findings and the legal risks associated with such disclosures. Additionally, we explore the implications of data breaches and the challenges of maintaining genomic privacy in an increasingly interconnected world. Our findings underscore the need for proactive risk management strategies and updated legal guidelines to navigate the intricate intersection of genomics and law."}
