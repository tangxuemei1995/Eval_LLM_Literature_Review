{"Abstract": "The p-arms of human acrocentric chromosomes harbor unique genomic features, including nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) and ribosomal gene clusters. This review explores the distinctive characteristics and functional significance of these chromosomal regions. We discuss the organization of ribosomal genes, their role in nucleolus formation, and the impact of heterochromatin on their regulation. The p-arms exhibit atypical recombination patterns and are prone to Robertsonian translocations, highlighting their genomic instability. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have provided new insights into the structure and composition of these regions, revealing previously uncharacterized sequences and repetitive elements. We examine the evolutionary implications of these findings and their potential relevance to human health and disease. Understanding the unique properties of acrocentric p-arms is crucial for comprehending genome organization, chromosomal stability, and the mechanisms underlying certain genetic disorders."}
