{"Abstract": "Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics research by enabling the detection of complex structural variants and repetitive DNA regions that were previously inaccessible. This review examines recent advances in long-read sequencing platforms, highlighting their applications in identifying pathogenic mutations and characterizing epigenetic modifications. We discuss improvements in read length, accuracy, and throughput, which have expanded the utility of these technologies across various fields, including medical genetics and cancer research. Despite significant progress, challenges remain, such as high error rates, limited scalability, and data analysis complexities. We explore ongoing efforts to address these limitations through improved sequencing chemistries, novel computational algorithms, and integrated multi-omics approaches. As long-read sequencing continues to evolve, it promises to provide unprecedented insights into genome architecture and function, potentially transforming our understanding of human health and disease."}
