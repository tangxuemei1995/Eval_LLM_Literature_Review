{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a crucial role in neural crest cell development and is implicated in various neurocristopathies. This review explores the function of SWI/SNF in neural crest-derived tissues, focusing on its interaction with NF2 and the role of Smarcb1, a core subunit of the complex. We discuss how mutations in SWI/SNF components contribute to the development of rhabdoid tumors and schwannomas. The review also examines the involvement of SWI/SNF in Schwann cell precursor differentiation and maintenance. Recent findings suggest that disruption of SWI/SNF function in these cells may lead to tumor formation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SWI/SNF-mediated regulation of neural crest cell development and differentiation provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for related disorders. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of chromatin remodeling in neural crest biology and its implications for human disease."}
