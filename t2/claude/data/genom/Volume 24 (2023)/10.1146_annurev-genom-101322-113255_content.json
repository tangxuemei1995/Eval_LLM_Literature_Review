{"Abstract": "The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) project aims to create comprehensive reference maps of all human cells, presenting unique challenges in data sharing within the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This study examines the intersection of open science principles and data protection regulations in genomics research, focusing on the HCA as a case study. We analyze the ethical and legal implications of sharing sensitive biomedical data under GDPR constraints, exploring strategies to balance scientific progress with individual privacy rights. The research highlights key lessons learned from the HCA's approach to data governance, including the implementation of robust consent mechanisms, data anonymization techniques, and international collaboration frameworks. Our findings underscore the importance of developing flexible, GDPR-compliant data sharing protocols that foster open science while safeguarding participant privacy. This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on responsible data sharing in the genomics era, offering insights for future large-scale biomedical research initiatives."}
