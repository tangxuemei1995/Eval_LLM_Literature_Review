{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, leading to severe complications. This review explores recent advances in understanding SCD genetics and developing curative approaches. We discuss the role of genetic modifiers in disease severity and progression, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic interventions. The paper examines ongoing gene therapy trials utilizing viral vectors to introduce functional hemoglobin genes, as well as emerging gene editing techniques aimed at correcting the underlying genetic mutation. We assess the efficacy and safety of these approaches, including concerns regarding genotoxicity associated with viral vector integration. Additionally, we evaluate the potential of novel gene editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, in developing more precise and efficient treatments for SCD. Finally, we consider the challenges and future directions in translating these promising curative approaches into clinical practice."}
