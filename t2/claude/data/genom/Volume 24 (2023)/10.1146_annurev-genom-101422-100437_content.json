{"Abstract": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding gene regulation at unprecedented resolution. This review explores the latest methods and insights gained from sc-eQTL studies, highlighting their potential to unravel the complex relationships between genetic variation and gene expression across diverse cell states. We discuss how sc-eQTL analysis has advanced our understanding of cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms and the impact of noncoding variants on gene expression. The integration of sc-eQTL data with other single-cell sequencing modalities is examined, revealing novel insights into cellular heterogeneity and dynamic gene regulation. Furthermore, we address the computational challenges and statistical approaches developed to handle the unique aspects of single-cell data in eQTL mapping. Finally, we consider the future directions of sc-eQTL research and its potential applications in personalized medicine and functional genomics."}
