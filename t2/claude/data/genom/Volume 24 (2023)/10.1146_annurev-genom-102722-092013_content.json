{"Abstract": "Padlock probe-based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) is a powerful spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technique that enables the visualization and quantification of gene expression within intact tissue samples. This method combines the specificity of padlock probes with rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve single-molecule detection and spatial resolution. ISS has emerged as a valuable tool for creating spatial cell atlases and performing in situ cell typing. This review provides an overview of the methodological principles underlying padlock probe-based ISS, highlighting its advantages and limitations. We discuss recent applications in various fields, including developmental biology, neuroscience, and cancer research, and explore future directions for this rapidly evolving technology."}
