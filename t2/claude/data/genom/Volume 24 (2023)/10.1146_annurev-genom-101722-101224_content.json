{"Abstract": "The discovery of extracellular RNA (exRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs has revolutionized our understanding of RNA biology and intercellular communication. This review explores the systems and mechanisms involved in RNA crossing cellular membranes, focusing on the contextualization of exRNA and glycoRNAs. We examine the diverse RNA species found outside cells, their biogenesis, and the pathways facilitating their export and uptake. The role of extracellular vesicles, RNA-binding proteins, and lipoproteins in RNA trafficking is discussed, along with the emerging field of glycoRNAs and their potential functions in cell-cell interactions and signaling. We also highlight the implications of these findings for various biological processes, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic applications. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex landscape of RNA trafficking and its significance in cellular communication and physiology."}
