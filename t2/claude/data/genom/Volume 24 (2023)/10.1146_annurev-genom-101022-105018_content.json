{"Abstract": "This autobiographical account traces the author's scientific journey from studying blood cells to exploring human genetics and back. The narrative begins with investigations into hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency, highlighting the interplay between genetic variations and their phenotypic manifestations. The author then delves into the realm of somatic mutations, focusing on paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria as a model disease. This research path unveils the critical role of Darwinian selection in shaping genetic landscapes within individuals. The journey comes full circle as the author returns to blood cell studies, now armed with advanced genetic knowledge. This perspective allows for a deeper understanding of how genetic alterations influence cellular behavior and disease progression. The abstract emphasizes the interconnectedness of hematology and genetics, showcasing how advancements in one field can significantly impact the other. This scientific odyssey underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in unraveling complex biological phenomena."}
