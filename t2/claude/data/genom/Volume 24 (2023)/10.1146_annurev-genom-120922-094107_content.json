{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate roles of TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways in skeletal dysplasias associated with short and tall stature. These pathways are crucial regulators of bone growth and development, and their dysregulation can lead to a spectrum of skeletal disorders. We examine recent advances in understanding how mutations in TGF-β and BMP pathway components contribute to various forms of skeletal dysplasia, resulting in either stunted growth or excessive height. The review highlights key molecular mechanisms, including ligand-receptor interactions, intracellular signaling cascades, and transcriptional regulation, that underlie these growth abnormalities. Additionally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways for the treatment of skeletal dysplasias. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between TGF-β and BMP signaling in skeletal development and offers new perspectives for future research and clinical interventions."}
