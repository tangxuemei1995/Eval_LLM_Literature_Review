{"Abstract": "This article examines the concept of social reproduction through the lens of legal realism and materialist feminism, exploring how laws shape and perpetuate unpaid domestic work and care. Drawing on law and political economy frameworks, it analyzes the legal structures that govern social reproduction, including labor laws, family policies, and welfare systems. The study highlights the often-invisible role of unpaid work in sustaining economic systems and social order. By investigating the legal mechanisms that reinforce gendered divisions of labor and undervalue care work, the article reveals the interconnections between law, economics, and social reproduction. It argues that recognizing and valuing social reproduction in legal frameworks is crucial for addressing gender inequalities and creating more equitable societies. The findings contribute to ongoing debates about the nature of work, care, and social justice in contemporary legal and economic systems."}
