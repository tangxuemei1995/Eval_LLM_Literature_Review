{"Abstract": "This paper explores the potential of laws and policies as tools for debiasing social cognition and improving intergroup relations. Drawing on research from social psychology, cognitive science, and legal studies, we examine how legislative and policy interventions can shape implicit biases, reduce segregation, and foster more equitable social environments. We review evidence on the effectiveness of various approaches, including affirmative action policies, integration initiatives, and anti-discrimination laws. Our analysis suggests that well-designed legal frameworks can serve as powerful social interventions, influencing cognitive processes and behavioral patterns at both individual and societal levels. However, we also highlight the complexities and potential unintended consequences of such interventions. This interdisciplinary perspective offers insights for policymakers and researchers seeking to leverage legal mechanisms to cultivate more equal minds and promote positive intergroup dynamics in diverse societies."}
