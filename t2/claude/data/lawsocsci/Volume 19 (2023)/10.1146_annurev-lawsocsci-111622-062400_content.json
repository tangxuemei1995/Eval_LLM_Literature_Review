{"Abstract": "This study examines the critical role of race in shaping the experiences of low-wage immigrant workers in the United States. By centering race in our analysis, we illuminate the intersections of racial discrimination, immigration status, and labor exploitation. Drawing on qualitative interviews and ethnographic observations, we explore how racialized perceptions and structural racism impact immigrants' access to employment, working conditions, and ability to assert their rights. Our findings reveal that racial hierarchies within immigrant communities and broader society significantly influence labor market outcomes and workplace dynamics. We argue that addressing racial injustice is crucial for improving the lives of low-wage immigrant workers and achieving equitable labor practices. This research contributes to ongoing discussions on immigration, labor rights, and racial justice, offering insights for policymakers and advocates working towards a more inclusive and fair labor market."}
