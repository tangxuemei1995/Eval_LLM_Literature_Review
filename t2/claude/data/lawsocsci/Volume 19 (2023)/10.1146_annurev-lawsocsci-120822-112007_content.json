{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of mandatory employment arbitration on access to justice and dispute resolution in the workplace. Drawing on extensive legal and empirical research, we analyze the prevalence, effectiveness, and fairness of arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Our findings reveal significant disparities in outcomes between arbitration and litigation, with employees generally faring worse in arbitration proceedings. We also explore the implications of mandatory arbitration on employees' rights, particularly in cases involving discrimination and harassment. The research highlights concerns about the power imbalance between employers and employees in arbitration settings, as well as potential limitations on class actions. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing debate surrounding employment law reform and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, offering insights for policymakers, legal practitioners, and human resource professionals."}
