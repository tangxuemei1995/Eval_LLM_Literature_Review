{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted critical gaps in data governance frameworks worldwide, particularly in the context of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for public health interventions. This paper examines the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid deployment of AI-driven technologies, such as contact tracing apps, during the global health crisis. We analyze the tension between data-driven decision-making and individual privacy concerns, emphasizing the importance of trust and transparency in public health initiatives. The study explores the concept of 'privacy by design' as a potential solution to address data governance shortcomings. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust, adaptable data governance structures that can effectively balance public health imperatives with personal privacy protections in an increasingly data-centric world. We propose recommendations for policymakers and technologists to bridge the data governance gap and enhance preparedness for future pandemics."}
