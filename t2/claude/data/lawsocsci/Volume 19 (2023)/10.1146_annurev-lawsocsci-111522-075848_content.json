{"Abstract": "This article explores the concept of refeudalization in the context of contemporary legal systems, examining the shift from the rule of law to ties of allegiance. Drawing on theories of sovereignty, democracy, and representation, the study investigates how the increasing contractualization of legal relationships mirrors feudal structures. The research analyzes the erosion of traditional democratic institutions and the rise of private power centers that challenge state authority. By examining case studies and legal precedents, the article demonstrates how refeudalization manifests in various aspects of modern governance, including corporate influence on legislation and the privatization of public services. The findings suggest that this trend threatens the foundations of democratic societies and the principle of equality before the law. The article concludes by proposing potential strategies to counteract refeudalization and reinforce the rule of law in contemporary legal systems."}
