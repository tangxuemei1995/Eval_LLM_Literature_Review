{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex role of police officers in the courtroom, both as witnesses and defendants. It explores the challenges of police accountability within the legal system, focusing on issues such as perjury, Brady evidence, and qualified immunity. The research analyzes court cases, legal precedents, and empirical data to assess the frequency and impact of police testimony and the effectiveness of current accountability measures. Findings reveal a significant disparity between the treatment of police officers and civilians in court proceedings, highlighting concerns about systemic bias and the erosion of public trust. The study also investigates the implications of qualified immunity on police misconduct cases and its effect on justice outcomes. Recommendations are provided for improving police accountability, enhancing the integrity of courtroom testimony, and balancing the need for effective law enforcement with the protection of civil liberties."}
