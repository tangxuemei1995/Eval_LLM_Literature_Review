{"Abstract": "This paper examines the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and global governance, exploring the modalities, rationales, and tensions that arise in this rapidly evolving field. As AI technologies become increasingly prevalent in various sectors, their impact on global governance structures and processes demands critical analysis. The study investigates the current landscape of AI regulation, focusing on algorithmic governance and machine learning applications in international decision-making. It identifies key rationales for global AI governance, including ethical considerations, cross-border data flows, and the need for standardized regulatory frameworks. The research also highlights tensions between national sovereignty, technological innovation, and global cooperation in AI governance. By synthesizing existing literature and analyzing emerging trends, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on how to effectively govern AI on a global scale while balancing competing interests and addressing potential risks and benefits."}
