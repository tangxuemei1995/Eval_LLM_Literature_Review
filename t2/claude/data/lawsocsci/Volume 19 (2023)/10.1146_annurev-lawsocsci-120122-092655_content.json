{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving landscape of pretrial detention reform in the United States. It analyzes recent bail reform initiatives, their impact on criminal justice outcomes, and the ongoing debate surrounding these changes. The research draws on empirical data from jurisdictions that have implemented reforms, exploring the effects on pretrial release rates, court appearance rates, and public safety. Additionally, the study considers the legal and ethical implications of pretrial detention practices, addressing concerns about racial disparities and socioeconomic inequities. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on criminal justice reform and offer insights for policymakers seeking to balance public safety with individual rights in the pretrial process."}
