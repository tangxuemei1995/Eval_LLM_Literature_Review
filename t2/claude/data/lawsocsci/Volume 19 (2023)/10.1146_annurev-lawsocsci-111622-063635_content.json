{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China, focusing on the interplay between the rule of law, property rights, and market dynamics. Drawing on the concept of the dual state, we analyze how China's legal system simultaneously supports and constrains economic development. Our research investigates the role of land and labor markets in shaping China's unique form of state capitalism. We argue that while China has made significant strides in establishing a legal framework to support market-oriented reforms, the state retains considerable control over key economic resources and institutions. This tension between legal predictability and state intervention creates a distinctive model of authoritarian legality that underpins China's economic success. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the compatibility of authoritarian governance with market-driven economic growth and offer insights into the future trajectory of China's political economy."}
