{"Abstract": "The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in government operations presents both opportunities and challenges for public administration. This paper examines the complex task of regulating government AI systems, focusing on the sociotechnical aspects of institutional design. Drawing on literature from public administration, AI ethics, and science and technology studies, we analyze the unique regulatory challenges posed by AI in the public sector. Our findings highlight the need for a multifaceted approach that addresses technical, organizational, and societal dimensions. We argue that effective regulation requires not only technical standards and oversight mechanisms but also careful consideration of organizational structures, decision-making processes, and public engagement. The paper proposes a framework for sociotechnical design in government AI regulation, emphasizing adaptability, transparency, and accountability. By integrating insights from various disciplines, this research contributes to the ongoing debate on responsible AI governance and offers practical recommendations for policymakers and public administrators."}
