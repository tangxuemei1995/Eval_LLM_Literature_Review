{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), on law firms and the legal profession. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent literature and case studies, we investigate the extent to which technological advancements are transforming legal practices. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where technology adoption varies significantly across firms, practice areas, and jurisdictions. While AI and other technologies have streamlined certain legal tasks, such as document review and contract analysis, their integration into core legal work remains limited. The concept of organizational complementarity emerges as a crucial factor in successful technology implementation, highlighting the need for firms to adapt their structures and processes alongside technological adoption. This research contributes to the ongoing debate about the future of the legal profession and provides insights for law firms seeking to navigate the evolving technological landscape."}
