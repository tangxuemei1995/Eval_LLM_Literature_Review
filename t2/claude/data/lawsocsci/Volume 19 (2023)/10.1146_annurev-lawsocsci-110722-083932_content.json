{"Abstract": "This paper explores the evolving landscape of medical aid in dying (MAID), examining its intersection with medicine, law, and culture. As assisted suicide and euthanasia gain traction in various jurisdictions, the right-to-die movement continues to challenge traditional notions of death and dying. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and case studies, we analyze the ethical, legal, and social implications of MAID. The study highlights the complex interplay between medical advancements, changing societal attitudes, and legal frameworks. We investigate the role of social movements in shaping public discourse and policy decisions surrounding end-of-life choices. Our findings reveal a growing acceptance of MAID, while also uncovering persistent concerns regarding safeguards, vulnerable populations, and the potential impact on the medical profession. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on end-of-life care and individual autonomy in the face of terminal illness."}
