{"Abstract": "This article examines the methodological challenges in studying global lawmaking, focusing on the intersection of intellectual property rights and international health emergencies. Drawing on case studies from recent global health crises, we analyze the complex interplay between national and international legal frameworks. Our research highlights the limitations of methodological nationalism in understanding the dynamics of global law formation. We argue that a more nuanced approach is necessary to capture the multifaceted nature of international agreements and their impact on global health governance. The study reveals the importance of considering diverse stakeholders, power dynamics, and institutional structures in shaping global lawmaking processes. Our findings contribute to the development of more effective methodological tools for analyzing the creation and implementation of global legal norms, particularly in the context of intellectual property rights and public health emergencies."}
