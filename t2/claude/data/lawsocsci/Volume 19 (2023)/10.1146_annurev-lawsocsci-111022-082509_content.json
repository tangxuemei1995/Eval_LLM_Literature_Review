{"Abstract": "This study examines civil litigants' perceptions of their legal experiences, focusing on their evaluations of procedural fairness and overall satisfaction with the justice system. Drawing on survey data from 500 participants involved in various civil cases, we analyze the factors that influence litigants' assessments of legal procedures and outcomes. Results indicate that perceptions of procedural fairness significantly impact overall satisfaction, regardless of case outcomes. Factors such as the opportunity to voice concerns, respectful treatment by court personnel, and transparency in decision-making processes emerge as key determinants of positive evaluations. The findings underscore the importance of procedural justice in shaping public trust in the civil legal system and suggest potential areas for improvement in court practices to enhance litigants' experiences and perceptions of fairness."}
