{"Abstract": "This article explores the intersection of vaccines, public health, and sociolegal studies through an interdisciplinary lens. Drawing on ethnographic research and science and technology studies, it examines how vaccines are conceptualized beyond their traditional role as legal tools for public health. The study investigates the complex social, cultural, and political dynamics that shape vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and policy implementation. By analyzing diverse stakeholder perspectives, including healthcare providers, policymakers, and community members, the research reveals the multifaceted nature of vaccine discourse and its implications for public health strategies. The findings highlight the importance of considering broader societal factors in vaccine-related decision-making and policy development. This interdisciplinary approach offers valuable insights for enhancing vaccine communication, addressing hesitancy, and developing more effective public health interventions that account for the diverse sociolegal contexts in which vaccines operate."}
