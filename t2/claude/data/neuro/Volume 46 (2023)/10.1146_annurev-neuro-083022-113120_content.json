{"Abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic potential of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) inhibition in converting glial cells to neurons within the brain. Using lineage tracing techniques, we demonstrate that Ptbp1 suppression induces the reprogramming of various glial cell types into functional neurons. Our findings reveal that these newly generated neurons integrate into existing neural circuits and exhibit characteristics of mature neurons. We further explore the capacity of this approach to generate specific neuronal subtypes from pluripotent progenitors, potentially addressing neurodegenerative conditions. Importantly, behavioral assessments in animal models show significant improvements in cognitive and motor functions following PTB inhibition-mediated neuronal reprogramming. This research highlights the promising therapeutic applications of PTB inhibition in treating neurodegenerative disorders and brain injuries by promoting endogenous neuronal regeneration, offering a novel avenue for developing targeted interventions in neurological diseases."}
