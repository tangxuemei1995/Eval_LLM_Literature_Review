{"Abstract": "Circadian rhythms, the internal biological clocks that regulate various physiological processes, have been extensively studied in neurons. However, recent research has shed light on the crucial role of astrocytes in maintaining and modulating these rhythms. This review explores the multifaceted involvement of astrocytes in circadian regulation, highlighting their beneficial (good), detrimental (bad), and complex (ugly) aspects. We discuss how astrocytic calcium signaling and gliotransmitter release contribute to the synchronization of circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. The review also examines the implications of disrupted astrocytic circadian rhythms in neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, we investigate the potential link between circadian dysregulation in astrocytes and the development of gliomas. By synthesizing current knowledge, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between astrocytes and circadian rhythms, emphasizing their significance in both health and disease."}
