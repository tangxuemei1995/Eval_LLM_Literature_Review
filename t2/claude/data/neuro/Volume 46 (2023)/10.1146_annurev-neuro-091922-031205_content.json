{"Abstract": "Astrocyte endfeet, specialized structures that ensheath blood vessels in the brain, play crucial roles in maintaining the blood-brain barrier and regulating cerebral blood flow. Despite their importance, many aspects of astrocyte endfoot function remain poorly understood. This review examines current knowledge and identifies key open questions regarding the role of astrocyte endfeet in brain function and pathology. We discuss their involvement in neurovascular coupling, metabolite transport, and ion homeostasis, as well as their potential contributions to neurological disorders. The complex interplay between astrocyte endfeet, endothelial cells, and neurons in both healthy and diseased states is explored. By highlighting gaps in our understanding, we aim to stimulate further research into these critical cellular structures and their impact on brain physiology and pathophysiology."}
