{"Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, particularly obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. This review examines the current state of psychiatric neurosurgery, focusing on the application of DBS in these conditions. We analyze the neuroanatomical targets, stimulation parameters, and clinical outcomes reported in recent studies. The efficacy of DBS in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life for patients with OCD and depression is evaluated, along with potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, we discuss the ethical considerations and challenges associated with neuromodulation in psychiatric populations. While DBS shows promise as a treatment option for severe, refractory cases of OCD and depression, further research is needed to optimize target selection, refine stimulation protocols, and identify suitable patient populations to maximize therapeutic benefits and minimize risks."}
