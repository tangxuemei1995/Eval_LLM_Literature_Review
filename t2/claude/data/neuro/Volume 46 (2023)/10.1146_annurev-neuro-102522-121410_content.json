{"Abstract": "This review examines the specialized neural networks underlying social cognition in primates, with a focus on the functional organization of the 'social brain.' We synthesize recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies to elucidate the distinct yet interconnected brain regions involved in various aspects of social information processing. Key areas discussed include the fusiform face area for face perception, the superior temporal sulcus for analyzing social interactions, and the medial prefrontal cortex for mentalizing and social knowledge representation. We highlight the dynamic interplay between these specialized networks and their role in integrating multiple social cues. Additionally, we explore how these neural systems support complex social behaviors and decision-making in both human and non-human primates. This research provides insights into the evolution of social cognition and has implications for understanding social deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders."}
