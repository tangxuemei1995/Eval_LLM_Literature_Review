{"Abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that inhibition of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) could induce glia-to-neuron conversion, offering potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. However, this study challenges these findings, demonstrating that PTBP1 inhibition alone does not lead to direct glia-to-neuron reprogramming. We investigated the effects of PTBP1 knockdown in various glial cell types, including astrocytes, MÃ¼ller glia, and retinal ganglion cells. Our results show no significant conversion of glial cells into functional neurons, particularly dopaminergic neurons or retinal ganglion cells, following PTBP1 inhibition. While PTBP1 inhibition may have therapeutic potential through other mechanisms, we conclude that its effects are not attributed to direct glia-to-neuron conversion. These findings highlight the complexity of cellular reprogramming and emphasize the need for further research to elucidate the true mechanisms underlying any observed therapeutic benefits of PTBP1 inhibition in neurodegenerative disorders."}
