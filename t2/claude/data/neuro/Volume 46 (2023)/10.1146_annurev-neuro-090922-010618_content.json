{"Abstract": "The ability to navigate and form spatial memories is crucial for survival across species. This review explores the developmental processes underlying the formation of cognitive maps in the brain, focusing on the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. We examine the emergence of specialized neural circuits and computations that support spatial representation, from early postnatal stages to adulthood. Key topics include the maturation of grid cells, place cells, and other spatially-tuned neurons, as well as the development of synaptic connections and network dynamics. We discuss how genetic factors, environmental experiences, and neural plasticity contribute to the establishment of these complex spatial systems. Understanding the developmental trajectory of cognitive map formation provides insights into both normal brain function and potential interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders affecting spatial cognition and memory."}
