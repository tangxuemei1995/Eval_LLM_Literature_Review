{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic social behaviors, focusing on the developmental trajectory from early life to adulthood. We examine the role of the social behavior network, with particular emphasis on GABA neurons and their interactions with aromatase-expressing cells. Our findings reveal that sex-specific epigenetic modifications during development shape the architecture of neural circuits governing aggression and social play. These modifications persist into adulthood, influencing behavioral outcomes. We demonstrate that aromatase activity plays a crucial role in modulating GABAergic signaling, contributing to the establishment and maintenance of sex-specific behavioral patterns. Furthermore, we identify key molecular pathways involved in the epigenetic regulation of social behavior genes. This research provides novel insights into the complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and hormonal factors in sculpting sexually dimorphic social behaviors, offering potential targets for future therapeutic interventions in social behavior disorders."}
