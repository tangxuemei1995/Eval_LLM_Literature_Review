{"Abstract": "Context-dependent learning is a crucial aspect of adaptive behavior, enabling organisms to flexibly apply knowledge across diverse situations. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this process. We examine how Bayesian inference frameworks model context-dependent learning, highlighting their ability to capture the integration of prior knowledge with new information. Neural investigations reveal a distributed network involving the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortex in supporting context-dependent learning. The prefrontal cortex plays a key role in maintaining contextual representations, while the hippocampus contributes to rapid encoding of context-specific associations. Thalamic circuits facilitate information routing, and motor cortex implements context-appropriate actions. We discuss how these findings inform theories of continual learning and memory consolidation, emphasizing the importance of context in shaping cognitive flexibility and adaptive behavior across species."}
