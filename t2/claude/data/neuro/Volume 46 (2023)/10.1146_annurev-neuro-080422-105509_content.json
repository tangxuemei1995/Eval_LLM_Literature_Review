{"Abstract": "Migraine, a debilitating neurological disorder, has long puzzled researchers due to its complex pathophysiology. Recent advances in understanding meningeal mechanisms have shed light on the intricate relationship between the meninges and migraine pathogenesis. This review explores the role of meningeal afferents, trigeminal nerve activation, and neurogenic inflammation in migraine development. We examine the sensitization of meningeal nociceptors and their contribution to headache progression. Additionally, we discuss the phenomenon of cortical spreading depression and its potential influence on meningeal processes. By integrating current research findings, we propose a comprehensive model linking meningeal mechanisms to various aspects of migraine, including pain perception, associated symptoms, and chronification. This synthesis of knowledge provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and paves the way for novel treatment strategies in migraine management."}
