{"Abstract": "Neural networks play a crucial role in animal navigation, integrating various sensory inputs and computational processes to guide spatial behavior. This review explores the neural mechanisms underlying navigation, focusing on key components such as memory, menotaxis, path integration, and head direction systems. We examine how these processes are interconnected and how they contribute to the formation of cognitive maps. The role of dopamine in modulating navigational behaviors and reinforcing spatial learning is discussed. Additionally, we investigate the neural basis of coordinate transformations, which allow animals to seamlessly switch between egocentric and allocentric reference frames. By synthesizing recent findings from neuroscience and computational modeling, we provide insights into the complex neural computations that enable efficient navigation across diverse environments. This understanding may inform the development of advanced artificial navigation systems and contribute to our knowledge of spatial cognition in both animals and humans."}
