{"Abstract": "The visual system's ability to detect motion is crucial for survival across species. This study investigates how flies, particularly Drosophila, perceive and process motion information. We explore the neural mechanisms underlying direction selectivity in the fly visual system, focusing on the role of multiplicative disinhibition in motion detection. Through a combination of electrophysiological recordings, behavioral experiments, and computational modeling, we uncover the intricate neural computations that enable flies to accurately detect and respond to moving stimuli. Our findings reveal a sophisticated network of direction-selective neurons that utilize multiplicative operations to enhance motion sensitivity and directional tuning. This research not only advances our understanding of insect vision but also provides insights into general principles of neural computation in motion detection, potentially informing the development of bio-inspired artificial vision systems."}
