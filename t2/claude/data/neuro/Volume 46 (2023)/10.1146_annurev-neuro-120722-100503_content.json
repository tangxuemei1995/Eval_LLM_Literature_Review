{"Abstract": "The integration of vestibular and visual information in the cerebral cortex plays a crucial role in spatial navigation, visual processing, and perception of self-motion. This review synthesizes recent findings on the cortical mechanisms underlying multisensory integration of vestibular and visual cues. We examine the neural substrates involved in processing these sensory inputs, focusing on key cortical areas such as the parietal, temporal, and frontal regions. The review highlights the dynamic interplay between vestibular and visual systems in constructing a coherent representation of the environment and guiding navigation. We discuss how this integration contributes to spatial orientation, heading estimation, and the perception of self-motion. Additionally, we explore the implications of vestibular-visual integration for visual stability during head and body movements. Understanding these cortical processes provides insights into the neural basis of spatial cognition and has potential applications in developing interventions for disorders affecting spatial navigation and perception."}
