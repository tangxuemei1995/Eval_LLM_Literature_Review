{"Abstract": "The striatum, a key component of the basal ganglia, plays a crucial role in learning, decision-making, and motor control. This review explores the intricate relationship between striosomes and matrisomes, two distinct compartments within the striatum, and their role in coupling volition and action. We examine recent evidence suggesting that striosomes, rich in mu-opioid receptors, are involved in value-based decision-making and motivation, while matrisomes, abundant in dopamine receptors, are primarily associated with action selection and execution. The dynamic interplay between these compartments is proposed to form a scaffold for integrating cognitive and motor processes. We discuss how dopamine signaling differentially modulates striosome and matrisome activity, influencing learning and behavioral adaptation. Furthermore, we highlight the potential implications of striosome-matrisome interactions in neurological and psychiatric disorders affecting volition and action. This review synthesizes current knowledge and proposes a framework for understanding how the striatal architecture facilitates the seamless transition from intention to action, opening new avenues for research in basal ganglia function and related disorders."}
