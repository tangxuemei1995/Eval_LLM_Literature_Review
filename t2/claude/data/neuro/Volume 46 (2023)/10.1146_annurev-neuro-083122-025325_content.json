{"Abstract": "Spinal interneurons play a crucial role in the complex circuitry underlying motor control and locomotion. This review explores the diverse population of interneurons within the ventral horn of the spinal cord and their contributions to motor function. We examine recent advances in understanding the genetic, molecular, and physiological properties of distinct interneuron subtypes, highlighting their specific roles in locomotor pattern generation and motor output modulation. The intricate connectivity between interneurons and motor neurons is discussed, emphasizing the importance of both excitatory and inhibitory connections in shaping motor behavior. Furthermore, we address the plasticity of spinal interneuron networks and their potential for adaptation following injury or disease. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms of spinal cord function and may inform future therapeutic strategies for motor disorders."}
