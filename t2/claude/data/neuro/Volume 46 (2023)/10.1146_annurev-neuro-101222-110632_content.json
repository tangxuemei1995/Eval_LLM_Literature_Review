{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolutionary exaptation of memory systems, focusing on the hippocampus and its role in both cognitive functions and body regulation. We investigate how sharp-wave ripples, initially evolved for homeostatic and allostatic processes, may have been repurposed for memory consolidation. By examining the interplay between glucose regulation and hippocampal activity, we propose a novel framework for understanding the body-brain partnership in cognition. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus serves as a crucial interface between physiological control and higher-order cognitive processes. This research provides insights into the adaptive nature of neural systems and highlights the importance of considering bodily functions in cognitive neuroscience. The study has implications for understanding memory disorders, metabolic conditions, and the development of targeted interventions that leverage the body-brain connection to enhance cognitive performance."}
