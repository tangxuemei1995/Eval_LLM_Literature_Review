{"Abstract": "Emotion is a fundamental aspect of human experience, yet its neural underpinnings remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes recent advances in circuit neuroscience and affective neuroscience to elucidate the neural circuits underlying emotional states. We focus on the concept of valence, which refers to the positive or negative quality of an emotional experience. By integrating findings from cross-species approaches, including rodent models and human neuroimaging studies, we identify key brain regions and circuits involved in emotional processing. We discuss how these circuits interact to generate and regulate emotional states, emphasizing the role of neurotransmitter systems and neuromodulators. Additionally, we explore how disruptions in these circuits may contribute to affective disorders. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex neural mechanisms underlying emotion and highlights potential targets for therapeutic interventions in emotional disorders."}
