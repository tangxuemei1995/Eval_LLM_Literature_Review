{"Abstract": "Cholesterol metabolism plays a crucial role in aging and age-related neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease. This review explores the intricate relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and the aging brain, focusing on its impact on neurons and microglia. We examine how age-related changes in cholesterol metabolism contribute to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. The role of cholesterol in the formation and clearance of amyloid-Î² plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, is discussed. Additionally, we investigate the potential of targeting cholesterol metabolism as a therapeutic approach for age-related neurological disorders. Recent advances in understanding the interplay between cholesterol, microglia, and neurons in the aging brain are highlighted, providing insights into novel interventions for maintaining cognitive health in older adults and mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases."}
