{"Abstract": "This study explores the development of predictive models for health deterioration using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. By analyzing time series data from digital health pathways, we aim to understand and predict disease trajectories for personalized medicine applications. Our approach integrates diverse data sources, including electronic health records, wearable device data, and genomic information, to create comprehensive patient profiles. We employ advanced machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in disease progression, enabling early detection of health deterioration and personalized intervention strategies. The results demonstrate the potential of these models to significantly improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely and targeted interventions. This research contributes to the growing field of precision medicine by providing a framework for tailoring healthcare decisions and practices to individual patients based on their predicted disease trajectories."}
