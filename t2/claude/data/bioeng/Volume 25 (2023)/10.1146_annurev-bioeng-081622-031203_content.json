{"Abstract": "Hemolysis, the rupture of red blood cells, releases hemoglobin, heme, and iron into the circulation, leading to severe toxicity and organ damage. This review explores recent advancements in engineering therapeutics to detoxify these harmful molecules. We discuss the development of synthetic haptoglobin and hemopexin mimetics, which effectively scavenge free hemoglobin and heme, respectively. Additionally, we examine novel iron chelators designed to mitigate iron-induced oxidative stress. The potential of nanoparticle-based delivery systems to enhance the efficacy and targeted delivery of these therapeutics is also addressed. Furthermore, we highlight emerging gene therapy approaches aimed at upregulating endogenous protective mechanisms. These innovative strategies show promise in mitigating the detrimental effects of hemolysis and may lead to improved treatments for various hemolytic disorders and related complications."}
