{"Abstract": "The Internet of Bodies (IoB) is an emerging paradigm that extends the Internet of Things (IoT) to encompass wearable and implantable biosensors for continuous health monitoring. This paper presents a comprehensive review of bioelectronic sensor nodes for IoB applications, focusing on their key components: sensing, in-sensor analytics, computation, communication, security, and powering. We discuss recent advancements in miniaturized biosensors capable of detecting various physiological parameters and biomarkers. The integration of edge computing and machine learning algorithms for real-time data processing and decision-making is explored. We analyze low-power communication protocols tailored for IoB devices and examine security measures to protect sensitive health data. Additionally, we investigate energy harvesting and wireless power transfer techniques to address the powering challenges of long-term implantable sensors. Finally, we highlight future research directions and potential applications of IoB sensor nodes in personalized healthcare, remote patient monitoring, and early disease detection."}
