{"Abstract": "This study explores the development of engineered compounds to control ice nucleation and recrystallization processes. Inspired by antifreeze (glyco)proteins found in nature, we investigate novel synthetic molecules designed to mimic their ice-binding properties. Our research focuses on the mechanisms of ice nucleation inhibition and thermal hysteresis, as well as the suppression of ice recrystallization. We synthesize and characterize a series of compounds, evaluating their effectiveness in modulating ice formation and growth. The results demonstrate significant improvements in controlling ice behavior compared to existing methods. These engineered compounds show promise for applications in cryopreservation, food science, and materials engineering, offering new strategies to manage ice formation in various industrial and biological contexts."}
