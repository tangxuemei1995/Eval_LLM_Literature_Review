{"Abstract": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for non-invasive assessment of cellular metabolism in living cells and tissues. This review explores recent advances in optical techniques that exploit the autofluorescence of endogenous metabolic coenzymes, primarily NADH and FAD, to probe metabolic states. We discuss the principles of fluorescence lifetime imaging and two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy, which enable high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of metabolic activity. The review highlights how these techniques can distinguish between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, providing insights into cellular energy production pathways. We examine applications in cancer research, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering, where metabolic imaging has revealed critical information about disease progression, cell differentiation, and tissue function. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in the field, including the development of novel image analysis algorithms and the integration of metabolic imaging with other optical modalities for comprehensive cellular analysis."}
