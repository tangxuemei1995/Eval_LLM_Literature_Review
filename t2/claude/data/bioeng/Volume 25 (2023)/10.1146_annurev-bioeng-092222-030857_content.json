{"Abstract": "The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has made significant strides in developing innovative therapies and tissue models. However, the impact of sex as a biological variable has been largely overlooked. This review highlights the importance of considering sexual dimorphism in tissue engineering research and applications. We examine sex differences in stem cell behavior, tissue-specific characteristics, and regenerative potential across various organ systems. The integration of sex-specific factors in tissue models and engineered constructs is crucial for advancing precision medicine and improving therapeutic outcomes. By addressing sex-based disparities, researchers can enhance the relevance and efficacy of tissue-engineered products, ultimately leading to more personalized and effective treatments for both male and female patients."}
