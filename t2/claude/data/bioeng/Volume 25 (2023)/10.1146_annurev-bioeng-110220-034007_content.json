{"Abstract": "Single-cell biochemical assays of lipids have emerged as powerful tools for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. This review explores recent advancements in analytical techniques for lipid analysis at the single-cell level. We discuss the application of mass spectrometry, which offers high sensitivity and molecular specificity, enabling comprehensive lipid profiling. Raman imaging is highlighted for its ability to provide spatial information on lipid distribution within individual cells. The review also covers developments in capillary electrophoresis, which allows for rapid and efficient separation of lipid species. Additionally, we examine the use of thin-layer chromatography for its simplicity and versatility in lipid analysis. These techniques collectively contribute to our understanding of lipid metabolism, signaling, and cellular processes at unprecedented resolution, paving the way for new insights into cell biology and potential biomedical applications."}
