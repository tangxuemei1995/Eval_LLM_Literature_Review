{"Abstract": "Penetrating neural electrodes have revolutionized our understanding of brain function and hold promise for advanced neuroprosthetics. However, current technologies face limitations in scale and long-term stability. This review examines emerging penetrating electrode designs that aim to overcome these challenges. We discuss novel materials and fabrication techniques that enable higher-density arrays and improved biocompatibility. Particular attention is given to flexible polymer-based electrodes and ultrasmall carbon fiber electrodes, which show potential for reduced tissue damage and enhanced longevity. Additionally, we explore innovative strategies for large-scale neural recording, including multiplexed electrode arrays and wireless transmission systems. The integration of these advancements may pave the way for chronic, high-resolution neural interfaces capable of recording from thousands of neurons simultaneously. Such technologies could significantly advance both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications in neural engineering."}
