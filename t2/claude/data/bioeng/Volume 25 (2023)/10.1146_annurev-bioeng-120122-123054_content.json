{"Abstract": "The field of anti-aging research has experienced significant advancements in recent years, with a focus on understanding and manipulating biological clocks and cellular senescence. This review examines current trends in anti-aging strategies, highlighting promising approaches to slow down or potentially reverse the aging process. We explore the latest developments in targeting senescent cells, modulating epigenetic markers, and interventions aimed at rejuvenating aged tissues. Additionally, we discuss the implications of research on progeria, a rare genetic disorder characterized by accelerated aging, for developing novel anti-aging therapies. The emerging role of senolytics, compounds that selectively eliminate senescent cells, is evaluated alongside other potential interventions such as NAD+ boosters and telomere-targeting therapies. While significant challenges remain, these cutting-edge strategies offer hope for extending healthspan and potentially lifespan in the future."}
