{"Abstract": "Photoacoustic imaging has emerged as a promising modality for bone characterization in medical applications. This review explores the principles, current applications, and future prospects of photoacoustic techniques in bone imaging. We discuss the integration of photoacoustic imaging with quantitative ultrasound methods to enhance bone assessment capabilities. The potential of spectral unmixing algorithms in differentiating bone components and identifying pathological conditions is examined. Recent advancements in photoacoustic bone imaging, including in vivo studies and clinical trials, are summarized. Additionally, we address the challenges and limitations of current photoacoustic bone imaging techniques and propose potential solutions. The review concludes by highlighting the future directions of photoacoustic bone imaging, emphasizing its potential impact on osteoporosis diagnosis, fracture risk assessment, and monitoring of bone healing processes."}
