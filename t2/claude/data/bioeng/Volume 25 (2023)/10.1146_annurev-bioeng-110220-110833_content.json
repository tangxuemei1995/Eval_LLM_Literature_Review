{"Abstract": "Brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs) have emerged as powerful tools for restoring sensorimotor function in individuals with neurological impairments. This review explores the neural plasticity underlying successful BMI operation, focusing on the integration of sensory feedback and motor control. We examine how the brain adapts to incorporate artificial sensory inputs and novel motor outputs, highlighting the role of learning and neural circuit reorganization. Recent advances in closed-loop systems that combine sensory and motor elements are discussed, along with their potential to enhance BMI performance and user experience. Understanding these adaptive processes is crucial for developing more intuitive and effective BMI technologies for clinical applications."}
