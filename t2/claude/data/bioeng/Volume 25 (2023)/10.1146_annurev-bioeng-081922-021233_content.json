{"Abstract": "Epitranscriptional regulation, encompassing RNA modifications and their impact on gene expression, has emerged as a crucial field in cardiovascular bioengineering. This review explores the intricate interplay between the epitranscriptome and cardiovascular function, highlighting the role of RNA modifications in heart development, disease progression, and potential therapeutic interventions. We discuss key epitranscriptomic marks, such as m6A, m5C, and pseudouridine, and their regulatory enzymes in the context of cardiac physiology. Furthermore, we examine how dysregulation of these modifications contributes to various cardiovascular disorders, including hypertrophy, fibrosis, and arrhythmias. The potential of targeting epitranscriptomic mechanisms for developing novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular medicine is also addressed, emphasizing the importance of this rapidly evolving field in advancing our understanding of heart health and disease."}
