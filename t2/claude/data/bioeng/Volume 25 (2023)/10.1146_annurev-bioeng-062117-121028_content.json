{"Abstract": "Dehydration remains a significant health concern, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and athletes. This review examines the current state of noninvasive monitoring technologies for detecting dehydration. We evaluate various approaches, including wearable devices, bioimpedance analysis, and novel sensing techniques. While progress has been made in developing user-friendly and accurate hydration monitoring tools, challenges persist in achieving reliable, real-time detection across diverse populations and environmental conditions. The potential of emerging technologies, such as miniaturized sensors and machine learning algorithms, is discussed in the context of improving dehydration detection accuracy. We also address the limitations of existing methods and highlight areas for future research. Although promising advancements have been made, further refinement and validation are necessary before noninvasive dehydration monitoring can be widely implemented in clinical and consumer settings."}
