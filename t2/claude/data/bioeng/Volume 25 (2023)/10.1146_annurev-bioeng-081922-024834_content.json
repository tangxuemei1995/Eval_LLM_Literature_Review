{"Abstract": "As health technologies continue to advance, there is a growing need to ensure their design and implementation are both human-centered and equity-focused. This paper provides an overview of approaches that prioritize these crucial aspects in health technology development. We explore the principles of human-centered design and equity-centered engineering, emphasizing their importance in creating inclusive and effective health solutions. The role of contextual investigation is examined, highlighting how understanding the socio-cultural environment can inform more appropriate and accessible technologies. We discuss the significance of community and stakeholder engagement throughout the design process, ensuring diverse perspectives are incorporated and potential barriers are addressed. By synthesizing current literature and best practices, this review aims to guide researchers, designers, and policymakers in developing health technologies that are not only innovative but also equitable and responsive to the needs of diverse populations."}
