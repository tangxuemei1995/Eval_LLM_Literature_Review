{"Abstract": "Chronic pain affects millions worldwide, prompting the development of innovative neurotechnological approaches for pain management. This review explores cutting-edge interventions targeting the peripheral and central nervous systems to alleviate persistent pain. We examine the efficacy of deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in modulating pain pathways. Recent advancements in these technologies have shown promising results in reducing pain intensity and improving quality of life for patients with various chronic pain conditions. The review also discusses the mechanisms of action, potential side effects, and future directions for research in neurotechnology-based pain management. As our understanding of pain neurobiology evolves, these interventions offer hope for more effective, personalized treatments that could revolutionize chronic pain management and reduce reliance on pharmacological approaches."}
