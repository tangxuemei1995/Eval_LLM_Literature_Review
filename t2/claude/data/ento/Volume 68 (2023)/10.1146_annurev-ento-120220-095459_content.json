{"Abstract": "Vibrational signaling plays a crucial role in insect communication, yet its functional diversity remains underexplored. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biotremology of insects, focusing on substrate-borne communication across various signaling contexts. We examine the evolution of vibrosensory systems and their integration with other sensory modalities in multimodal signaling. The adaptive significance of vibrational signals in different ecological scenarios, including mate selection, predator avoidance, and social organization, is discussed. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of vibration-based communication in pest management strategies. By highlighting the complexity and importance of vibrational signaling in insects, this review aims to stimulate further research in this rapidly evolving field and promote the development of innovative, environmentally-friendly pest control methods."}
