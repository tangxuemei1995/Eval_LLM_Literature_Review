{"Abstract": "The spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula), an invasive planthopper native to Asia, has emerged as a significant threat to agriculture in the United States. This review examines the biology, ecology, and management strategies for this pest, focusing on its invasion potential and impact on viticulture. We discuss the insect's life cycle, host plant preferences, and dispersal mechanisms, highlighting the challenges posed by its broad host range and high reproductive capacity. Current control methods, including chemical, biological, and cultural approaches, are evaluated for their efficacy and environmental impact. Additionally, we explore potential future research directions to enhance our understanding of L. delicatula and develop more effective, sustainable management practices to mitigate its economic and ecological consequences."}
