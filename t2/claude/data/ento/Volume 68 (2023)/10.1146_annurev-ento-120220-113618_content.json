{"Abstract": "This study investigates the postcopulatory behavior of tephritid flies, focusing on the complex interactions between sperm, accessory gland peptides, and female remating patterns. We examined the physiological and behavioral changes in female flies following copulation, with particular emphasis on the role of male-derived substances in influencing female receptivity to subsequent matings. Our findings reveal that accessory gland peptides play a crucial role in modulating female behavior, including reduced receptivity to remating and increased oviposition rates. Additionally, we explored the implications of these postcopulatory mechanisms for the sterile insect technique, a widely used pest management strategy. Our results suggest that understanding and manipulating postcopulatory behaviors could significantly enhance the effectiveness of sterile insect releases in controlling tephritid fly populations. This research provides valuable insights into the reproductive biology of tephritid flies and offers potential avenues for improving pest management strategies."}
