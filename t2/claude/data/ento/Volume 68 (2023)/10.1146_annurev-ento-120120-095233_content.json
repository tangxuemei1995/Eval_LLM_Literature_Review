{"Abstract": "Winter poses significant challenges to organisms, necessitating complex adaptations for survival. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying winter survival strategies in various species. We examine the intricate processes involved in diapause, a state of dormancy that allows organisms to conserve energy and withstand harsh conditions. The review also delves into cold tolerance mechanisms, including the production of antifreeze proteins and cryoprotectants. Acclimation processes, which enable organisms to adjust their physiology in response to changing environmental conditions, are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we investigate the energetic adaptations that facilitate survival during periods of resource scarcity. The molecular basis of stress responses triggered by winter conditions is also explored, highlighting the role of heat shock proteins and other stress-responsive genes. By synthesizing recent research, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular underpinnings of winter survival, offering insights into the remarkable adaptability of life in extreme environments."}
