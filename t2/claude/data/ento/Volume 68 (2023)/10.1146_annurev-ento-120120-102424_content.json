{"Abstract": "Plant-pollinator networks are crucial for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity maintenance. This study investigates the resilience of these mutualistic networks in the face of global environmental change. We analyze network robustness and the potential for ecosystem shifts using a combination of empirical data and theoretical models. Our findings reveal that plant-pollinator networks exhibit varying degrees of resilience, with some networks demonstrating remarkable stability while others show vulnerability to perturbations. We identify key structural properties that contribute to network robustness, including nestedness, modularity, and functional redundancy. Additionally, we explore how different types of environmental stressors, such as habitat loss, climate change, and species invasions, impact network stability. Our results suggest that while some plant-pollinator networks may be able to withstand moderate disturbances, others are at risk of collapse under increasing environmental pressures. This research provides valuable insights for conservation strategies aimed at preserving these essential mutualistic interactions in the face of ongoing global change."}
