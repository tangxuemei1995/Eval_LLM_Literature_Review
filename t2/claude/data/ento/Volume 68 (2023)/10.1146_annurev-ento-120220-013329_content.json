{"Abstract": "Phoresy, a symbiotic relationship where one organism hitchhikes on another for dispersal, is prevalent among mites (Acari). This review explores the complex nature of phoretic relationships in mites, demonstrating that these associations extend beyond mere transportation. We examine how phoresy can evolve into parasitism or mutualism, depending on environmental factors and host-mite interactions. The conditional nature of these relationships is highlighted, showing how mites can shift between commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic modes. We discuss the ecological implications of phoresy for both mites and their hosts, including its role in shaping community dynamics and evolution. Additionally, we explore how phoresy influences mite dispersal patterns and genetic diversity. This synthesis provides insights into the intricate web of interactions within the Acari, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of phoretic relationships in mite ecology and evolution."}
