{"Abstract": "This study investigates the origins and evolution of herbivory on land by examining arthropod and pathogen damage on fossil and modern plants. We analyze damage types and functional feeding groups across continental scales, focusing on three major ecological crises: the Permian-Triassic, Cretaceous-Paleogene, and Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. By comparing fossil evidence with modern plant-herbivore interactions, we aim to elucidate the long-term patterns and drivers of herbivory evolution. Our findings reveal significant shifts in herbivore diversity and feeding strategies following each crisis, with notable increases in specialized feeding modes and novel damage types. The Permian-Triassic boundary shows a dramatic reduction in herbivore diversity, followed by a gradual recovery and diversification. The Cretaceous-Paleogene event demonstrates a rapid reorganization of plant-herbivore interactions, while the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum exhibits accelerated herbivore evolution and increased damage intensity. This research provides crucial insights into the resilience and adaptability of plant-herbivore relationships through deep time, highlighting the importance of understanding past ecological dynamics in predicting future responses to environmental change."}
