{"Abstract": "This review explores the ecology of stingless bees (Meliponini), a diverse group of eusocial insects found predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions. We examine their crucial role in ecosystem functioning, particularly as pollinators of wild and cultivated plants. The paper discusses the unique aspects of stingless bee biology, including their intricate nest structures, foraging behaviors, and the production of honey, pollen, and propolis. We analyze the importance of these bees in traditional and modern bee-keeping practices, highlighting their potential for sustainable honey production and crop pollination. The review also addresses the challenges faced by stingless bee populations due to habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use. Finally, we identify key areas for future research to enhance our understanding of stingless bee ecology and support conservation efforts in the face of environmental changes."}
