{"Abstract": "Diapause, a state of dormancy in insects and other invertebrates, plays a crucial role in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles. This review explores the adaptive significance of diapause in these life cycles, focusing on its function as a bet-hedging strategy and its relationship with circannual rhythms. We examine how diapause contributes to seasonal adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, allowing organisms to synchronize their development with favorable environmental conditions. The phenomenon of prolonged diapause is discussed, highlighting its importance in semivoltine species and its potential as a risk-spreading mechanism. Furthermore, we address the impacts of climate warming on diapause patterns and the potential consequences for species with univoltine and semivoltine life cycles. The review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying diapause induction, maintenance, and termination in these life cycle types. Finally, we identify key research gaps and future directions for understanding the evolution and ecological significance of diapause in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environments."}
