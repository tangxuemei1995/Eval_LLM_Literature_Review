{"Abstract": "Forest insect biosecurity is a critical concern in the face of increasing global trade and climate change. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the processes driving biological invasions of forest insects, patterns of establishment and spread, and predictive models for future invasions. We examine the effectiveness of phytosanitary measures and surveillance strategies in preventing and detecting non-native species introductions. The study highlights the importance of understanding invasion pathways and the role of human-mediated dispersal in facilitating insect spread. We discuss the challenges and successes of eradication efforts, emphasizing the need for rapid response and sustained management. Predictive models incorporating climate change scenarios and trade patterns are evaluated for their utility in informing biosecurity policies. The review also addresses pitfalls in current approaches, including gaps in early detection systems and the limitations of risk assessment tools. We conclude by proposing research priorities and policy recommendations to enhance forest insect biosecurity in an increasingly interconnected world."}
