{"Abstract": "The silkworm (Bombyx mori) is an economically important insect in the sericulture industry, but it is susceptible to various pathogens, particularly the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV). This study investigates the mechanisms of silkworm resistance to BmNPV and explores antiviral breeding strategies. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of virus-host interactions, focusing on the identification and characterization of resistant genes in silkworms. Through genetic analysis of resistance, we mapped the locations of key genes involved in the antiviral response. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between viral proteins and host cellular factors, with several novel resistance-associated genes identified. We observed that resistant silkworm strains exhibit enhanced innate immune responses and altered cellular pathways that impede viral replication and spread. Gene expression profiling and functional studies highlighted the role of specific antimicrobial peptides and RNAi machinery in conferring resistance. Furthermore, we employed advanced breeding techniques to develop silkworm lines with improved resistance to BmNPV. This research provides valuable insights into the molecular basis of silkworm resistance to baculovirus infection and offers promising avenues for the development of more resilient silkworm strains, potentially revolutionizing the sericulture industry by reducing economic losses due to viral outbreaks."}
