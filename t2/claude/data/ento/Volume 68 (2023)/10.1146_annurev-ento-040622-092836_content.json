{"Abstract": "Iron is an essential micronutrient for insects, playing crucial roles in various physiological processes. This review explores the mechanisms of iron homeostasis in insects, focusing on the key proteins involved in iron acquisition, storage, and transport. We discuss the importance of heme as a major source of iron and examine the roles of ferritin and transferrin in iron storage and transport, respectively. The function of metal transporters in facilitating iron movement across cellular membranes is also addressed. Additionally, we highlight the regulatory mechanisms that maintain iron balance and prevent toxicity. Understanding iron homeostasis in insects not only provides insights into their physiology but also has potential implications for pest control strategies and the development of novel insecticides targeting iron-related pathways."}
