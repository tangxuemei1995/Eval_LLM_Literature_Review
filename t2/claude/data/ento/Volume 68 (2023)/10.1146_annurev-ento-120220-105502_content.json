{"Abstract": "This review examines the management of insect pests using Bt crops in the United States, focusing on corn and cotton. Bt crops, genetically engineered to express insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, have been widely adopted to control Lepidopteran and Coleopteran pests. The paper discusses the effectiveness of Bt technology in reducing pesticide use and crop damage, while highlighting the challenges of insect resistance development. The refuge strategy, a key component of insect resistance management, is evaluated for its role in delaying resistance evolution. The review also explores the impact of Bt crops on non-target organisms and the broader agroecosystem. Finally, it addresses the future prospects of Bt technology in pest management, considering the need for integrated approaches and the development of new transgenic traits to maintain long-term efficacy against evolving pest populations."}
