{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate chemical ecology of floral resources and its implications for conservation biological control in agroecosystems. We examine the complex interactions between parasitoids, hyperparasitoids, and their floral food sources, focusing on the role of floral volatiles and nectar-associated microorganisms. The study highlights how these chemical cues influence parasitoid behavior, foraging efficiency, and population dynamics. We discuss the potential of manipulating floral resources to enhance parasitoid performance and suppress pest populations in agricultural settings. Additionally, we investigate the impact of nectar-associated microorganisms on nectar chemistry and parasitoid fitness. The review also addresses the challenges of balancing parasitoid and hyperparasitoid populations through selective floral provisioning. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying research gaps, this work provides valuable insights for developing effective conservation biological control strategies that harness the chemical ecology of floral resources in agroecosystems."}
