{"Abstract": "Terrestrial arthropods face increasing challenges in maintaining water balance due to climate change-induced droughts. This review explores the intricate mechanisms of dehydration dynamics in these organisms, focusing on their ability to sense and respond to environmental humidity changes. We examine the physiological and behavioral adaptations that enable arthropods to cope with water stress, including cuticular modifications, osmoregulation, and water-seeking behaviors. The paper also investigates the impact of dehydration on trophic interactions, highlighting how water scarcity affects predator-prey relationships and ecosystem stability. Furthermore, we discuss the potential long-term consequences of altered water balance on arthropod populations and community structures. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying research gaps, this review provides insights into the complex interplay between arthropod water balance and environmental change, emphasizing the need for further studies to predict and mitigate the effects of increasing aridity on terrestrial ecosystems."}
