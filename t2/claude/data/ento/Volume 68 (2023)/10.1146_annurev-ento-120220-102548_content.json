{"Abstract": "Spodoptera frugiperda, commonly known as the fall armyworm, is a highly invasive pest species causing significant agricultural damage worldwide. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the ecology, evolution, and management of S. frugiperda. We explore its complex taxonomy, population genetics, and host plant utilization patterns, highlighting the existence of distinct strains and their hybridization dynamics. The species' mate attraction mechanisms and their implications for population spread are examined. Additionally, we discuss the evolution of insecticide resistance in S. frugiperda populations and its impact on control strategies. The review also evaluates current management options, including chemical, biological, and cultural control methods, as well as emerging technologies such as gene editing and RNA interference. By integrating ecological and evolutionary perspectives, this comprehensive analysis aims to inform more effective and sustainable management approaches for this economically important pest species."}
