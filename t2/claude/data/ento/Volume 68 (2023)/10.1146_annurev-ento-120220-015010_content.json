{"Abstract": "This review examines the historical and contemporary control strategies for bed bugs (Cimex spp.), focusing on Cimex hemipterus and Cimex lectularius. The global resurgence of bed bug infestations has prompted renewed interest in effective management techniques. We explore the evolution of control methods, from traditional approaches to modern interventions, encompassing both chemical and nonchemical options. Chemical control measures, including the use of various insecticides and their efficacy, are critically evaluated. Nonchemical alternatives, such as heat treatments, cold treatments, and physical barriers, are also assessed for their effectiveness and practicality. The review highlights the challenges posed by insecticide resistance and the importance of integrated pest management strategies. By synthesizing current research and historical perspectives, this study provides valuable insights for pest management professionals, public health officials, and researchers working to combat the persistent threat of bed bug infestations worldwide."}
