{"Abstract": "Optical/infrared interferometry has made significant strides in recent years, revolutionizing our understanding of various astrophysical phenomena. This review summarizes the latest advances in instrumentation and their applications to key areas of astronomical research. We discuss improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution, and spectral capabilities of modern interferometric facilities. These technological developments have enabled groundbreaking observations of the Galactic Center, providing unprecedented insights into the environment surrounding the supermassive black hole. In the field of exoplanets, interferometry has facilitated direct imaging and characterization of planetary atmospheres, contributing to our knowledge of exoplanet formation and evolution. We also explore the impact of interferometric techniques on studies of active galactic nuclei, revealing intricate structures and dynamics of their central regions. Furthermore, we highlight the role of interferometry in investigating young stellar objects, shedding light on the processes of star and planet formation. Finally, we examine how interferometric observations have enhanced our understanding of stellar physics, including stellar surfaces, atmospheres, and circumstellar environments. This review underscores the transformative potential of optical/infrared interferometry in addressing fundamental questions in modern astrophysics."}
