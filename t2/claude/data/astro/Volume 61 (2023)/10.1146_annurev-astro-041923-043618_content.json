{"Abstract": "Hydrodynamical simulations have revolutionized our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. This review examines the enduring successes and persistent challenges in modeling the galaxy population. We discuss how simulations have successfully reproduced key observables, including the galaxy stellar mass function, star formation rates, and gas content. Notable achievements include capturing the complex interplay between galactic outflows and inflows, and the role of feedback in regulating star formation. However, outstanding challenges remain, such as accurately modeling the circumgalactic medium, reconciling simulated and observed galaxy sizes, and reproducing the diversity of galaxy morphologies. We highlight the importance of improved subgrid physics models and increased resolution in addressing these issues. Finally, we explore future directions for hydrodynamical simulations in the era of next-generation observatories and exascale computing."}
