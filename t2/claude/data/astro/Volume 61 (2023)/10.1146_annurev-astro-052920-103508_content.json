{"Abstract": "Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing astronomical time series data, offering a flexible and robust approach to modeling complex temporal patterns in celestial phenomena. This study explores the application of GPR to various astronomical time-domain problems, including variable star light curves, exoplanet transit timing variations, and quasar variability. We demonstrate how GPR can effectively capture non-linear trends, periodic oscillations, and stochastic variations in astronomical time series while accounting for measurement uncertainties and irregular sampling. The method's ability to provide probabilistic predictions and uncertainty quantification makes it particularly valuable for handling the challenges inherent in astronomical observations. We present a comprehensive framework for implementing GPR in astronomical contexts, discussing kernel selection, hyperparameter optimization, and computational considerations for large datasets. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate the advantages of GPR over traditional time series analysis techniques, highlighting its capacity to reveal subtle temporal features and infer underlying physical processes. Our results underscore the potential of GPR as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing time-domain astronomy and enhancing our understanding of dynamic celestial phenomena."}
