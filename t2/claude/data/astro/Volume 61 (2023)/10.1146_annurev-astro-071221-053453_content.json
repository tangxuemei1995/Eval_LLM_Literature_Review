{"Abstract": "The formation of the first stars marks a pivotal moment in cosmic history, initiating the transition from the dark ages to the era of cosmic dawn. This review synthesizes current understanding of Population III stars, their properties, and their far-reaching impact on the early Universe. We explore theoretical models and numerical simulations that predict the formation of these primordial stars in minihalos at redshifts z > 20. The unique chemical composition of the pristine gas, dominated by hydrogen and helium, leads to distinct stellar characteristics, including higher masses and hotter surface temperatures compared to present-day stars. We discuss the nucleosynthetic yields of these first stars and their role in early cosmic metal enrichment, setting the stage for subsequent generations of Population II stars. The review also examines the potential observational signatures of Population III stars, including their contribution to reionization and the possibility of detection through next-generation telescopes. Finally, we consider the legacy of these first stars in shaping galaxy formation and evolution, and their importance in the field of galactic archaeology. This comprehensive overview highlights the interdisciplinary nature of first star research, connecting cosmology, stellar astrophysics, and high-redshift Universe studies."}
