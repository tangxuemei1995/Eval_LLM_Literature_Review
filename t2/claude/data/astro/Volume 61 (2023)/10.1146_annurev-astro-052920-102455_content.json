{"Abstract": "The study of quasars and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of cosmic dawn has emerged as a crucial area of research in modern astrophysics. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of the interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powering quasars and the evolution of galaxies and the IGM during the first billion years of cosmic history. We explore how quasars, as the most luminous non-transient objects in the early universe, serve as probes of the IGM and tracers of large-scale structure formation. The role of SMBHs in driving quasar activity and their rapid growth mechanisms are examined, along with their potential influence on host galaxy evolution through feedback processes. We discuss the latest observations and theoretical models addressing the contribution of quasars to cosmic reionization, including their impact on the thermal and ionization state of the IGM. The review also covers recent discoveries of high-redshift quasars and their implications for understanding early SMBH formation and growth. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges and opportunities presented by next-generation observatories in furthering our knowledge of this critical period in cosmic history. By synthesizing multi-wavelength observations and state-of-the-art simulations, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on quasars and the IGM at cosmic dawn, setting the stage for future investigations in this rapidly evolving field."}
