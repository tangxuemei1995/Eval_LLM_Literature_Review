{"Abstract": "Protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets, are complex chemical laboratories that play a crucial role in shaping the composition of nascent planetary systems. This review explores the intricate interplay between astrochemistry and planet formation processes within these disks. We examine the latest advancements in observational techniques and theoretical models that have revolutionized our understanding of protoplanetary disk chemistry. The paper discusses the spatial and temporal evolution of molecular species, from simple atoms to complex organic molecules, and their implications for the formation of planetary building blocks. We analyze the impact of disk physical properties, such as temperature and density gradients, on chemical reactions and molecular abundances. Furthermore, we investigate the role of dust grains as catalysts for chemical processes and their influence on the disk's chemical inventory. By synthesizing recent findings, this review provides insights into how protoplanetary disk chemistry influences the composition of forming planets and the potential for prebiotic chemistry in young planetary systems."}
