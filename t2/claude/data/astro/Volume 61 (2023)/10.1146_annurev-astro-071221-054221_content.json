{"Abstract": "The discovery of interstellar comets 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov has revolutionized our understanding of small bodies in the universe. This review examines the implications of these interstellar interlopers for our comprehension of protoplanetary disk evolution and planetary system formation. We analyze the physical and chemical properties of these objects, comparing them to Solar System comets and asteroids. The frequency of such interstellar visitors is discussed, along with their potential origins in other star systems. We explore the challenges in detecting and characterizing these objects, as well as the opportunities they present for studying extrasolar planetary systems. Finally, we consider the broader implications of interstellar interlopers for our understanding of the distribution of organic matter and the potential for panspermia in the galaxy."}
