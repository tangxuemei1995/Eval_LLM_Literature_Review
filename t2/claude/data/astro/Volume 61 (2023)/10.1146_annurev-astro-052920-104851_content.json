{"Abstract": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, serving as a fundamental building block for star formation and a tracer of galactic structure. This review examines the distribution and dynamics of Hi in the Milky Way, highlighting its significance in understanding galaxy evolution. We explore recent advancements in Hi observations, including high-resolution surveys and 3D mapping techniques, which have revealed intricate structures within the interstellar medium. The relationship between Hi and other components of the galactic ecosystem, such as molecular clouds and ionized gas, is discussed, emphasizing the role of phase transitions in the galactic matter cycle. We also investigate the influence of magnetic fields on Hi distribution and kinematics, considering their impact on cloud formation and gas dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze how Hi observations contribute to our understanding of the Milky Way's spiral structure, dark matter distribution, and interactions with satellite galaxies. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying open questions, this review underscores the importance of Hi studies in bridging the gap between small-scale interstellar processes and large-scale galactic evolution, paving the way for future research in galactic astronomy."}
