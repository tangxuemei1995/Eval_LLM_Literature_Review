{"Abstract": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution, serving as a reservoir for gas accretion and a repository for galactic outflows. This review synthesizes recent theoretical and observational advances in understanding the key physical processes governing the CGM. We examine the complex interplay between gravitational infall, radiative cooling, thermal instabilities, and feedback mechanisms that shape the multiphase structure of the CGM. Particular attention is given to the role of cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and turbulence in regulating gas dynamics and phase transitions. We discuss how these processes influence the distribution, kinematics, and chemical enrichment of circumgalactic gas, and their implications for galaxy growth and quenching. The review also highlights the importance of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations and sophisticated plasma physics models in capturing the intricate behavior of the CGM. Finally, we outline outstanding questions and future observational prospects, including the potential of next-generation X-ray and UV telescopes to probe the hot and diffuse components of the CGM, providing crucial constraints on theoretical models and advancing our understanding of galaxy-CGM co-evolution in a cosmological context."}
