{"Abstract": "Circumbinary accretion plays a crucial role in various astrophysical systems, ranging from binary stars to massive binary black holes. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of circumbinary accretion processes across these diverse scales. We examine the hydrodynamics of circumbinary disks, focusing on the complex interplay between gravitational torques, accretion streams, and disk dynamics. The review highlights similarities and differences in accretion mechanisms for stellar binaries and supermassive black hole binaries, emphasizing the importance of mass ratio, orbital eccentricity, and disk properties. We discuss the impact of circumbinary accretion on binary evolution, including orbital migration and mass transfer, and its implications for star formation and galaxy evolution. The formation and stability of planets in circumbinary systems are explored, drawing connections between theoretical models and observational constraints from exoplanet surveys. Furthermore, we address the role of circumbinary accretion in resolving the final parsec problem for supermassive black hole mergers and its potential observational signatures in electromagnetic and gravitational wave domains. This comprehensive review aims to bridge the gap between different astrophysical regimes, providing a unified framework for understanding circumbinary accretion across cosmic scales and identifying key areas for future research and observational efforts."}
