{"Abstract": "This review explores the intersection of soft robotics and additive manufacturing, highlighting the transformative potential of 3D and 4D printing technologies in creating advanced soft actuators and robots. We examine recent developments in materials and fabrication techniques that enable the production of compliant, multifunctional structures with integrated actuation and sensing capabilities. The paper discusses various additive manufacturing approaches, including fused deposition modeling, stereolithography, and multi-material printing, and their applications in soft robotics. We analyze the design principles and performance characteristics of 3D-printed soft actuators, such as pneumatic networks, shape memory polymers, and hydrogel-based systems. Additionally, we investigate the emerging field of 4D printing, which introduces time-dependent shape-changing behaviors to printed structures. The review concludes by addressing current challenges and future directions in the additive manufacturing of soft robots, emphasizing the need for improved materials, multi-scale fabrication methods, and standardization."}
