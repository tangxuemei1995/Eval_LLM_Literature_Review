{"Abstract": "Soft robotics has emerged as a rapidly growing field in robotics research, offering novel solutions to challenges in manipulation, locomotion, and human-robot interaction. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of soft robotics, focusing on key aspects such as actuation, design, sensing, and control. We explore various soft actuator technologies, including pneumatic, hydraulic, and smart material-based systems, and discuss their applications in diverse robotic tasks. The paper also examines recent advancements in soft robot design methodologies, emphasizing the importance of bio-inspired approaches and multifunctional materials. Furthermore, we analyze the development of sensing technologies tailored for soft robotic systems and their integration with control strategies. The role of simulation and modeling techniques in soft robotics is highlighted, along with the increasing application of machine learning algorithms for improving performance and adaptability. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges in the field, including the need for standardization and scalability in soft robotic systems."}
