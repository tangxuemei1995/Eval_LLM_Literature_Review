{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted role of information in networked estimation and control systems, with a focus on cyber-physical systems and control under communication constraints. We investigate how various forms of information, including timing, event-triggered data, and decentralized inference, impact system performance and design. The study begins by examining the fundamental trade-offs between communication resources and control performance in networked control systems. We then analyze the potential of timing information and event-triggered mechanisms to enhance system efficiency and reduce communication overhead. The paper also delves into decentralized inference techniques, exploring how distributed agents can collaboratively estimate system states with limited information exchange. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by cyber-physical systems, where the integration of computational and physical processes introduces new complexities in information management. Our findings reveal that a holistic approach to information utilization, encompassing both traditional sensor data and auxiliary information sources, can significantly improve the robustness and efficiency of networked estimation and control systems. This work provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize the design and implementation of complex networked systems in various domains, including industrial automation, smart grids, and autonomous vehicle networks."}
