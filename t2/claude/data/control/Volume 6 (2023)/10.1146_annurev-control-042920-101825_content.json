{"Abstract": "Noise is an inherent feature of biomolecular systems, arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions and the small number of molecules involved. This review explores the modeling, analysis, and control implications of noise in biological systems, with a focus on cybergenetics and synthetic biology applications. We discuss various approaches to modeling stochastic processes in reaction networks, including the chemical master equation, stochastic differential equations, and moment closure methods. The analysis of noise propagation and its effects on system behavior is examined, highlighting the importance of understanding noise-induced phenomena such as bistability, oscillations, and state transitions. We review recent advances in control strategies for managing noise in biomolecular systems, including feedback control, noise-induced stabilization, and robust design principles. The implications of noise for synthetic biology applications are discussed, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities in engineering reliable biological circuits and devices. Furthermore, we explore the emerging field of cybergenetics, which combines control theory with synthetic biology to develop novel approaches for manipulating cellular behavior. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on noise in biomolecular systems and its implications for the design and control of synthetic biological systems, offering insights for researchers in systems biology, synthetic biology, and control engineering."}
