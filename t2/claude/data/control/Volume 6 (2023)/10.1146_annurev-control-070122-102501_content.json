{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of embodied communication in human-robot collaboration, focusing on how physical interaction facilitates effective communication between humans and assistive robots. We investigate the role of tactile feedback, gesture recognition, and force sensing in enhancing the quality and efficiency of human-robot interactions. Through a series of experiments involving 50 participants and various assistive robot prototypes, we analyze the impact of embodied communication on task performance, user satisfaction, and overall collaboration outcomes. Our findings reveal that incorporating embodied communication techniques significantly improves the intuitiveness and naturalness of human-robot interactions, leading to faster task completion times and higher user acceptance rates. Additionally, we identify key design principles for implementing embodied communication in assistive robots, including adaptive force control, context-aware gesture interpretation, and personalized haptic feedback. This research contributes to the growing field of human-robot collaboration by highlighting the importance of physical interaction as a fundamental aspect of effective communication between humans and robots in assistive scenarios."}
