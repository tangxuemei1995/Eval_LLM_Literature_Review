{"Abstract": "The CYBATHLON competition has emerged as a catalyst for innovation in assistive technologies, promoting user-centered design and inclusion for people with disabilities. This review examines the impact of CYBATHLON on advancing assistive devices and their real-world applications. By challenging teams to develop technologies that address daily-life obstacles, the competition has fostered collaboration between engineers, researchers, and individuals with disabilities. The unique format of CYBATHLON, which combines competitive events with practical tasks, has led to significant improvements in prosthetics, exoskeletons, and brain-computer interfaces. Moreover, the competition has raised public awareness about the challenges faced by people with disabilities and the potential of assistive technologies to enhance their quality of life. This paper analyzes the technological advancements stemming from CYBATHLON and discusses their implications for future developments in the field of assistive technology."}
