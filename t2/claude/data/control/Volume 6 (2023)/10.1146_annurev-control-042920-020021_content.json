{"Abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for policy optimization in reinforcement learning, with a focus on synthesizing effective control policies. We address the challenges of sample efficiency and stability in learning complex control tasks by developing a novel approach that combines principles from optimal control theory and modern reinforcement learning algorithms. Our method leverages structured policy representations and gradient-based optimization techniques to efficiently explore high-dimensional action spaces. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence and performance bounds of our proposed algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness in both linear and nonlinear control systems. Extensive empirical evaluations on benchmark control tasks showcase the superior sample efficiency and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for the design of adaptive control systems and highlight potential applications in robotics and autonomous systems. This work contributes to bridging the gap between classical control theory and data-driven reinforcement learning, offering insights into the development of more efficient and reliable learning-based control strategies."}
