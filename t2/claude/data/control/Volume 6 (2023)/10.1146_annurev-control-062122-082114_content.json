{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of spacecraft-mounted robotics for in-orbit servicing missions. We investigate advanced control strategies and trajectory tracking techniques using dual quaternions to represent the combined dynamics and kinematics of the spacecraft-manipulator system. The research focuses on developing robust algorithms for precise manipulation in the challenging space environment, addressing issues such as zero-gravity effects and orbital dynamics. Our findings demonstrate improved performance in trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, contributing to the advancement of autonomous robotic systems for space applications. The proposed methods show promise for enhancing the capabilities of future in-orbit servicing missions."}
