{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, also known as particle filters, for state estimation and system identification in nonlinear state-space models. We provide a unified framework for understanding various SMC algorithms, discussing their theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and practical applications. The review covers key aspects such as particle propagation, resampling techniques, and adaptive methods for improving estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. We also explore recent advancements in SMC, including the integration of machine learning techniques and parallel computing approaches. Furthermore, we address challenges and limitations of SMC methods, offering insights into potential future research directions. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with complex dynamical systems across diverse fields, including signal processing, robotics, and finance."}
