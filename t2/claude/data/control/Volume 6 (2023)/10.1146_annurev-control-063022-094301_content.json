{"Abstract": "This paper explores the critical role of embodiment in autonomous adaptive systems, focusing on the timescales at which intelligent behaviors emerge. We investigate how physical embodiment influences the development of adaptive capabilities across multiple temporal scales, from rapid sensorimotor interactions to long-term learning and evolution. Drawing inspiration from biological systems, we analyze cross-timescale interactions in bioinspired robotics and their impact on system performance. Our findings reveal that the integration of fast and slow processes within embodied agents leads to more robust and flexible behaviors. We propose a framework for designing autonomous systems that leverage these multi-timescale dynamics, highlighting the importance of considering embodiment in the context of temporal adaptation. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied intelligence and offers insights for developing more effective and adaptable autonomous systems."}
