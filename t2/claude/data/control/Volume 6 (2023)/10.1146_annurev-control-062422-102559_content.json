{"Abstract": "This paper explores the innovative use of liquid surface tension in the field of microrobotics, focusing on its potential for precise micromanipulations. Surface tension and capillary forces, which become dominant at the microscale, are harnessed to develop novel microrobotic systems and techniques. We present a comprehensive review of recent advancements in exploiting these phenomena for micromanipulation tasks, including object transport, assembly, and sorting. The study investigates various liquid-mediated microrobotic platforms, such as droplet-based actuators and capillary grippers, highlighting their unique capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of surface tension-driven mechanisms with other microrobotic technologies to enhance functionality and control. The paper also addresses challenges in implementing these systems, including environmental sensitivity and scalability issues. Finally, we propose future research directions and potential applications in fields such as microfluidics, biomedical engineering, and micro-manufacturing. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on utilizing physical phenomena at the microscale for advanced robotic applications."}
