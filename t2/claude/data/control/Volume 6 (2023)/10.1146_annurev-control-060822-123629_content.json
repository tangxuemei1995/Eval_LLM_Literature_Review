{"Abstract": "This study investigates the modeling and control of large-scale multiagent systems, with a focus on crowd dynamics and autonomous vehicle networks. We employ mean-field theory to analyze the collective behavior of interacting agent systems as the number of agents approaches infinity. The research develops a novel framework for describing the macroscopic properties of these systems, incorporating both local interactions and global feedback control mechanisms. We derive analytical expressions for the mean-field limit and propose efficient control strategies that can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as traffic management and crowd control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various settings, including pedestrian flow in urban environments and coordinated movement of autonomous vehicle fleets. The findings contribute to the understanding of complex multiagent systems and offer practical solutions for their control and optimization."}
