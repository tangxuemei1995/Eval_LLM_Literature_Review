{"Abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and power electronic converters in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, posing challenges for grid stability and control. This paper presents a comprehensive review of control strategies for low-inertia power systems, focusing on grid-forming control techniques and dynamic virtual power plant concepts. We analyze the limitations of conventional control methods and explore innovative approaches to maintain system stability and reliability. The study investigates the potential of advanced control algorithms, such as model predictive control and distributed control, to enhance the performance of low-inertia grids. Additionally, we discuss the role of energy storage systems and demand-side management in supporting grid stability. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive and coordinated control strategies in ensuring the resilience of future power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources."}
