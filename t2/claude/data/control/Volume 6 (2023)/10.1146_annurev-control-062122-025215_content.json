{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of grasp learning techniques in robotic manipulation. We examine various models and methods employed in grasp learning, including data-driven approaches, reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms. The study analyzes the performance of these techniques across different object types, environmental conditions, and robotic platforms. We discuss key challenges in grasp learning, such as generalization to novel objects and real-time adaptation. Additionally, we explore recent advancements in sensor fusion, tactile feedback, and multi-modal learning for improved grasping capabilities. Finally, we provide insights into future research directions and potential applications in industrial and service robotics."}
