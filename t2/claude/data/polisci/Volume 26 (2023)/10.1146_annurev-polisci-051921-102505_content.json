{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving political role of business leaders in contemporary society. As corporate influence on policy-making grows, CEOs and executives increasingly engage in civic activities beyond traditional lobbying. We analyze the intersection of business, money, and politics, exploring how corporate social responsibility initiatives and CEO activism shape public discourse and policy outcomes. Drawing on case studies and quantitative data, we investigate the motivations, strategies, and impacts of business leaders' political involvement. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where corporate interests and societal concerns often intersect, challenging traditional notions of the separation between business and politics. We argue that this trend has significant implications for democratic processes, stakeholder relationships, and the broader socio-political landscape. This research contributes to ongoing debates about the appropriate role of business in society and the potential consequences of increased corporate political engagement."}
