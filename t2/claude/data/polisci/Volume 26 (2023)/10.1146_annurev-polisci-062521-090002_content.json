{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex political landscape surrounding reparations for Black Americans, tracing the historical roots of the debate from slavery through the Jim Crow era to present-day social movements. By analyzing key political arguments, public discourse, and policy proposals, the research explores how the concept of reparations has evolved in American political thought. The study investigates the various forms proposed reparations might take, from direct payments to systemic reforms, and evaluates their potential impacts on racial equity and social justice. Additionally, it examines the role of grassroots activism in shaping the reparations debate and influencing policy discussions at local, state, and federal levels. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersections between race, politics, and historical redress in the United States."}
