{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of gender and sexuality with international relations, focusing on their impact on political economy and foreign policy. By analyzing diverse case studies and theoretical frameworks, we explore how gendered power structures shape global politics and economic systems. The research highlights the often-overlooked role of women and LGBTQ+ individuals in diplomatic processes and international decision-making. We argue that incorporating gender perspectives into foreign policy analysis leads to more comprehensive and nuanced understandings of international dynamics. Furthermore, the study investigates how gender norms influence trade policies, development aid, and global labor markets. Our findings suggest that addressing gender inequalities in international relations is crucial for achieving sustainable global peace and economic prosperity. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on feminist approaches to international relations and advocates for more inclusive policymaking processes."}
