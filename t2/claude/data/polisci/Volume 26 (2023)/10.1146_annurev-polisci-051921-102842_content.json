{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between the state and trust in modern societies. Drawing on extensive literature and empirical data, we investigate how state institutions, sanctions, and corruption levels influence public trust. Our findings reveal that effective state mechanisms for enforcing contracts and property rights can enhance societal trust. However, excessive sanctions may erode trust by fostering a climate of fear and suspicion. Corruption emerges as a significant factor undermining trust in state institutions and interpersonal relationships. We argue that a delicate balance between state intervention and individual autonomy is crucial for cultivating trust. The research contributes to ongoing debates about the role of the state in shaping social capital and offers policy implications for governments seeking to build trust-based societies in an increasingly complex global environment."}
