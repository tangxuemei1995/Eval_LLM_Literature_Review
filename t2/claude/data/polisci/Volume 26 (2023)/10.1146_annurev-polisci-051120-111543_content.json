{"Abstract": "This study proposes a multi-level approach to supply chain governance, addressing the complex interplay between structure and context. By examining supply chains as polycentric networks, we explore how governance mechanisms operate across different levels and respond to environmental and labor-related challenges. Our analysis reveals that effective supply chain governance requires a nuanced understanding of contextual factors, including regulatory environments, cultural norms, and stakeholder expectations. We argue that a one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate in managing the complexity of modern supply chains. Instead, we advocate for a flexible, multi-level governance framework that can adapt to diverse contexts while maintaining overall coherence. This research contributes to the literature by integrating insights from network theory, institutional economics, and sustainability studies to develop a more comprehensive understanding of supply chain governance. Our findings have important implications for practitioners and policymakers seeking to enhance the resilience and sustainability of global supply chains in an increasingly complex business environment."}
