{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic backgrounds of politicians across various democratic nations, focusing on the interplay between class, education, and wealth in shaping political representation. Drawing on extensive data from legislative bodies and biographical information, we analyze the socioeconomic profiles of elected officials compared to the general population. Our findings reveal a significant overrepresentation of individuals from affluent backgrounds and those with elite educational credentials in political leadership roles. We explore the implications of this disparity for policy-making and public trust in democratic institutions. Additionally, we investigate temporal trends and cross-national variations in the economic diversity of political elites. This research contributes to ongoing debates about the nature of political representation and the potential consequences of socioeconomic homogeneity among decision-makers in contemporary democracies."}
