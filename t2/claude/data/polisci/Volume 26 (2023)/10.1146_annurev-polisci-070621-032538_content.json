{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving role of Asian Americans in twenty-first-century U.S. politics. Drawing on recent demographic data and voting patterns, we analyze the increasing political participation and civic engagement of this diverse population. The research explores how Asian Americans are shaping policy debates on issues such as immigration, education, and healthcare. We investigate the factors influencing their political affiliations and voting behaviors, including generational differences, socioeconomic status, and cultural values. Our findings suggest that Asian Americans are becoming a significant political force, with the potential to impact election outcomes and policy decisions. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on minority political participation and offers insights into the changing landscape of American politics."}
