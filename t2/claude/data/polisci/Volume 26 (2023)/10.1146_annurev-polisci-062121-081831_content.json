{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between women's political empowerment and socioeconomic development in the developing world. Drawing on comparative political analysis and gender studies, we investigate the factors influencing women's participation in politics and decision-making processes across various cultural contexts. The research explores the impact of state formation, electoral quotas, and intrafamily bargaining on gender equality in political representation. We analyze data from multiple developing countries to identify patterns and variations in women's access to power. Our findings suggest that while electoral quotas have increased women's numerical representation, cultural norms and economic disparities continue to hinder substantive political participation. Furthermore, we observe that improvements in women's education and economic status positively correlate with their political empowerment. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on gender and politics, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities for enhancing women's political power in developing nations."}
