{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of 'agenda democracy,' examining how citizens influence political agendas through various mechanisms in democratic societies. Drawing on literature from political science, sociology, and communication studies, we analyze the interplay between social movements, petitions, and advocacy efforts in shaping policy priorities. The research investigates how these bottom-up processes interact with traditional top-down agenda-setting by political elites and media. Using a mixed-methods approach, including case studies of successful citizen-led agenda changes and quantitative analysis of petition data, we demonstrate the growing importance of public participation in determining political agendas. Our findings suggest that agenda democracy is an emerging form of democratic engagement, facilitated by digital technologies and changing power dynamics. This study contributes to ongoing debates about democratic representation and offers insights into how policymakers can better incorporate citizen input into agenda-setting processes."}
