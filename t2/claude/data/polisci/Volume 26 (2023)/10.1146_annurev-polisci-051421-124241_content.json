{"Abstract": "This paper examines the evolving landscape of international energy politics in the context of climate change and the global transition to clean energy. It explores how traditional power dynamics centered on oil are being reshaped by the imperative to reduce carbon emissions and adopt renewable energy sources. The study analyzes the distributive politics of the energy transition, highlighting the emerging tensions between fossil fuel-dependent nations and those leading in clean technology development. It argues that climate change is fundamentally altering the geopolitical calculus of energy, creating new alliances, rivalries, and vulnerabilities. The research draws on case studies of key players in the global energy market to illustrate how countries are adapting their foreign policies and economic strategies to navigate this shifting terrain. The findings underscore the complex interplay between energy security, economic interests, and environmental imperatives in shaping international relations in the 21st century."}
