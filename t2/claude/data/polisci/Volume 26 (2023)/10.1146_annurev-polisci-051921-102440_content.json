{"Abstract": "Historical political economy has emerged as a vibrant field at the intersection of history, economics, and political science. This article surveys the past, present, and future of this interdisciplinary approach. We trace its origins in economic history and historical institutionalism, highlighting the field's emphasis on long-term legacies and persistence of historical events. We then examine current methodological trends, including the use of natural experiments, archival research, and formal theory to establish causal relationships between historical factors and contemporary outcomes. The article also discusses key substantive areas of inquiry, such as state formation, colonialism, and economic development. Looking ahead, we identify promising avenues for future research, including the integration of micro-level historical data with macro-level outcomes and the application of machine learning techniques to historical sources. We conclude by reflecting on the field's potential to enhance our understanding of contemporary political and economic phenomena."}
