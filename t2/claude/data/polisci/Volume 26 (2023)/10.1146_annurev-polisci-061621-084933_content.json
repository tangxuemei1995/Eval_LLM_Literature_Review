{"Abstract": "This article examines the current state of bureaucratic politics research in political science, highlighting both blind spots and opportunities for future inquiry. We review recent literature on personnel management, political appointments, bureaucratic performance, and oversight mechanisms. Our analysis reveals significant gaps in understanding the complex interplay between bureaucratic structures and political influence, particularly in areas such as lobbying and procurement processes. We argue that these blind spots hinder a comprehensive understanding of how bureaucracies shape policy outcomes and democratic accountability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a research agenda that emphasizes cross-disciplinary approaches, integrating insights from public administration, organizational theory, and political economy. By focusing on these understudied aspects of bureaucratic politics, scholars can develop more nuanced theories of governance and contribute to improving the effectiveness and accountability of public institutions."}
