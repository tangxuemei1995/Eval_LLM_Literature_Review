{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between democracy, policing, and racial dynamics in the United States. By analyzing historical trends and contemporary data, we explore how policing practices have both shaped and been shaped by the evolving nature of American democracy. The research investigates the tension between the ideals of multiracial democracy and the persistence of racial authoritarianism within the criminal justice system. We argue that policing serves as a critical lens through which to understand the broader challenges facing American democracy, particularly in relation to issues of identity and racial equity. Our findings suggest that reform efforts in policing are inextricably linked to the broader project of strengthening democratic institutions and practices. The study contributes to ongoing debates about the role of law enforcement in a diverse society and offers insights into potential pathways for fostering a more inclusive and equitable democracy that extends beyond traditional electoral processes."}
