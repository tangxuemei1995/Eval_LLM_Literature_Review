{"Abstract": "This study examines the causes and consequences of citizenship policies in Western Europe, focusing on naturalization processes and their impact on immigration and integration. By analyzing policy variations across countries and over time, we investigate the factors influencing citizenship acquisition and its effects on immigrants' socioeconomic outcomes. Our findings reveal that more inclusive naturalization policies are associated with higher rates of citizenship acquisition and improved integration outcomes. However, we also observe significant differences in policy implementation and effectiveness across countries, highlighting the complex interplay between citizenship, immigration, and integration in Western European contexts."}
