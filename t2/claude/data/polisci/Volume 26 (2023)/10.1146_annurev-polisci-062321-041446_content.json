{"Abstract": "This study examines the politics of racist dehumanization in the United States, focusing on the historical and contemporary manifestations of this phenomenon. Drawing on extensive literature from sociology, psychology, and political science, we analyze how dehumanizing attitudes and practices have been employed to justify and perpetuate racial inequalities. The research explores the intersections of race, prejudice, and power dynamics, with particular emphasis on the experiences of Black and Indigenous communities. We investigate the role of racial attitudes in shaping public policy and social interactions, as well as the psychological mechanisms underlying dehumanization. Our findings reveal persistent patterns of racist dehumanization across various societal domains, including education, criminal justice, and healthcare. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between racism and dehumanization, offering insights for developing more effective anti-racist strategies and policies."}
