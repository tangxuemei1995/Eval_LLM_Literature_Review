{"Abstract": "This article explores the concept of bureaucratic autonomy, a crucial element in understanding the relationship between political institutions and administrative agencies. Drawing on literature from comparative politics and administrative law, we examine how bureaucratic autonomy is defined, measured, and manifested across different political systems. The study investigates the tension between political control and administrative discretion, analyzing the factors that influence the degree of autonomy granted to bureaucracies. We argue that bureaucratic autonomy is a multidimensional construct, shaped by legal frameworks, institutional design, and informal practices. The research employs a comparative approach to identify patterns and variations in bureaucratic autonomy across countries, highlighting the implications for policy implementation and democratic accountability. Our findings contribute to ongoing debates about delegation, discretion, and the optimal balance between political oversight and bureaucratic independence in modern governance systems."}
