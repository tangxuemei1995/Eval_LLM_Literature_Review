{"Abstract": "This study examines the pivotal role of the South in shaping American political development, focusing on the period from Jim Crow to the New Deal era. It explores how southern politics, characterized by authoritarianism and white supremacy, influenced national policy-making and institutional structures. The research analyzes the complex interplay between southern interests and federal initiatives, highlighting the region's impact on labor laws, civil rights legislation, and social welfare programs. By investigating the mechanisms through which southern politicians wielded disproportionate influence in Congress, this study reveals the enduring legacy of the South in American governance. The findings suggest that understanding the South's historical role is crucial for comprehending contemporary political dynamics and persistent regional disparities. This research contributes to ongoing debates about the nature of American democracy and the long-term consequences of racial inequality in political institutions."}
