{"Abstract": "This study examines the divergent trajectories of growth and welfare regimes across time and space, focusing on the transition from Fordism to financialization and the knowledge-based economy. Employing a comparative political economy approach, we analyze how different countries have adapted their welfare states to changing economic paradigms. Our research reveals that while global trends in economic development have been broadly similar, nations have pursued distinct paths in balancing growth and social protection. We investigate the role of institutional legacies, political coalitions, and policy choices in shaping these diverse outcomes. The findings suggest that despite convergence pressures, significant variations persist in how countries navigate the challenges of globalization, technological change, and demographic shifts. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between economic growth models and welfare state configurations, offering insights into the future of social policy in an era of rapid economic transformation."}
