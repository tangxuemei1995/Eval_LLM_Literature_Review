{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between political inequality and income disparities in affluent democratic nations. By analyzing data on political participation, representation, congruence, and responsiveness, we investigate how economic inequality influences democratic processes. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between income inequality and political inequality, with higher-income groups enjoying disproportionate influence in policy-making. We also explore the role of trade unions in mitigating these disparities, finding that stronger union presence is associated with reduced political inequality. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of cross-national data with qualitative case studies. Our results suggest that addressing income inequality and strengthening labor institutions may be crucial for enhancing democratic equality. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on the quality of democracy in wealthy nations and offers insights for policymakers seeking to promote more equitable political systems."}
