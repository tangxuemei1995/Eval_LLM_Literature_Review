{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between nonviolent resistance movements and the occurrence of violent actions within their broader context. By analyzing historical cases and contemporary examples, we investigate the impact of violent flanks, unarmed collective violence, and riots on the effectiveness and outcomes of nonviolent protests. Our research challenges the traditional dichotomy between violent and nonviolent resistance, exploring how these seemingly contradictory approaches may interact and influence each other. We argue that the presence of violent elements can both hinder and enhance nonviolent movements, depending on various factors such as timing, scale, and public perception. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on the efficacy of nonviolent resistance and provides insights into the nuanced dynamics of social movements, offering valuable implications for activists, policymakers, and scholars in the field of conflict resolution and social change."}
