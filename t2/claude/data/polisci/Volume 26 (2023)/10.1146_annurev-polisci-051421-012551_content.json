{"Abstract": "This article proposes a unified framework for studying environmental effects on political behavior by integrating two distinct research traditions: context and contact theory. While contextual studies focus on how neighborhood characteristics shape political attitudes, contact theory examines the impact of interpersonal interactions. We argue that combining these approaches provides a more comprehensive understanding of environmental influences on politics. Drawing on literature from political science, sociology, and urban studies, we demonstrate how physical and social environments interact to affect political outcomes. Our framework considers factors such as ethnic diversity, economic inequality, and the built environment, highlighting their interconnected roles in shaping political behavior. By bridging the gap between context and contact research, this study offers new insights into the complex relationship between individuals' surroundings and their political attitudes, paving the way for more nuanced analyses of environmental effects on politics."}
