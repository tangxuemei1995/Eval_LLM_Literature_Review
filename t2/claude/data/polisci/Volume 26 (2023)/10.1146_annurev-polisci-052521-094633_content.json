{"Abstract": "This article examines the evolution of global health governance from the era of imperialism to the present day, focusing on the political dynamics that have shaped international health organizations and policies. It traces the development of global health governance through three distinct periods: the imperialist era, the post-World War II 'Golden Age,' and the current 'Great Lockdown' precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study analyzes the shifting power dynamics, ideological influences, and institutional frameworks that have characterized each era, with particular emphasis on the role of the World Health Organization (WHO). By exploring the interplay between geopolitical interests, economic factors, and public health imperatives, the article reveals how global health governance has been continually reshaped by broader political forces. The COVID-19 pandemic is examined as a critical juncture that has exposed longstanding tensions and inequalities within the global health system, prompting a reevaluation of existing governance structures. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these historical and contemporary dynamics for the future of global health governance in a post-pandemic world."}
