{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of political science and public health, emphasizing the critical role of political economy in shaping population health outcomes and health equity. By examining the complex interplay between political institutions, economic systems, and health policies, we demonstrate how political factors influence the social determinants of health and the design of health systems. Our analysis reveals that political ideologies, power dynamics, and governance structures significantly impact resource allocation, healthcare access, and health disparities across populations. We argue that integrating political science perspectives into public health research and practice is essential for developing more comprehensive and effective strategies to address global health challenges. This interdisciplinary approach offers valuable insights for policymakers and researchers seeking to improve health outcomes and reduce inequities in diverse socio-political contexts."}
