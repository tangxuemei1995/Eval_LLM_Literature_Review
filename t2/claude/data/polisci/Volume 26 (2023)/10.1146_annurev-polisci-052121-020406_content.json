{"Abstract": "This article examines the concept of authoritarian power sharing, exploring its mechanisms and strategies within the context of non-democratic regimes. Drawing on literature from authoritarian politics, civil wars, and institutional design, we analyze how autocrats navigate commitment problems and mitigate the risk of coups through power-sharing arrangements. We argue that authoritarian leaders employ various institutional tools and informal practices to distribute power among elite groups, balancing the need for loyalty with the imperative of maintaining control. The study identifies key mechanisms of power sharing, including co-optation, rotation of offices, and selective inclusion in decision-making processes. We also investigate how these strategies vary across different types of authoritarian regimes and their effectiveness in promoting regime stability. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of authoritarian governance and highlight the complex dynamics of power distribution in non-democratic settings."}
