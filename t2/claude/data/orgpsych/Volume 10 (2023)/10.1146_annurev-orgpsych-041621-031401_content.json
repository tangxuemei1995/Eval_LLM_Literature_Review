{"Abstract": "Structural equation modeling (SEM) has become a cornerstone in organizational research, offering powerful tools for analyzing complex relationships among latent variables. This review examines the current state of SEM in organizational science, highlighting its strengths and limitations. We assess common practices in model specification, estimation, and fit evaluation, identifying areas where researchers often struggle or misapply techniques. Particular attention is given to the handling of latent interactions and the interpretation of model fit indices. We propose several recommendations to enhance the rigor and relevance of SEM applications, including improved reporting standards, increased emphasis on theory-driven model development, and greater consideration of alternative models. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in SEM, such as Bayesian approaches and multilevel modeling, and their potential to address longstanding challenges in organizational research. This review aims to guide researchers towards more effective and meaningful use of SEM in advancing organizational theory and practice."}
