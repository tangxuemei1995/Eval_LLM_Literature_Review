{"Abstract": "This paper explores the psychological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, focusing on the interplay between action and process. Drawing from action theory, we examine how entrepreneurs navigate uncertainty and resource constraints through bricolage and effectuation. The study investigates the cognitive processes that drive entrepreneurial decision-making, highlighting the role of heuristics and biases in opportunity recognition and evaluation. Additionally, we delve into the motivational factors that propel individuals to pursue entrepreneurial ventures, considering both intrinsic and extrinsic drivers. The paper also addresses the impact of emotions on entrepreneurial behavior, exploring how affect influences risk perception and resilience. By synthesizing these psychological perspectives, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the entrepreneurial mindset and its implications for successful venture creation and growth."}
