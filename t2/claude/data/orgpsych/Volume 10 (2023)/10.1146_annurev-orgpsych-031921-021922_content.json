{"Abstract": "This comprehensive guide explores the methodological options available for conducting meta-analyses in organizational research. We review key concepts such as validity generalization, effect size estimation, and research synthesis techniques. The paper discusses various approaches to addressing psychometric artifacts and their impact on meta-analytic results. We examine statistical models for combining effect sizes, including fixed-effect and random-effects models, and provide guidance on selecting appropriate methods based on research objectives and data characteristics. Additionally, we address common challenges in meta-analysis, such as publication bias and heterogeneity, offering strategies for mitigation. This guide aims to enhance researchers' understanding of meta-analytic techniques and improve the quality of synthesized evidence in organizational studies."}
