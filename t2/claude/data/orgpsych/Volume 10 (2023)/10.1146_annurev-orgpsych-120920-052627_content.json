{"Abstract": "This review examines the intersection of race and organizational justice in workplace settings, addressing the critical question of whether justice is truly colorblind. By synthesizing existing literature on racial disparities and organizational justice theories, we explore how perceptions of fairness and equity differ across racioethnic groups. The analysis reveals persistent disparities in experiences of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice among minority employees. Factors contributing to these differences include implicit bias, structural inequalities, and cultural variations in justice expectations. The review also highlights the potential of organizational justice frameworks to mitigate workplace discrimination and promote inclusivity. We conclude by identifying gaps in current research and proposing future directions for investigating the complex relationship between race and organizational justice, emphasizing the need for more diverse and culturally sensitive approaches to workplace fairness."}
