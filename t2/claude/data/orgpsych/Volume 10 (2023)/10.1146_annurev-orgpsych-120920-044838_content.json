{"Abstract": "This study explores the critical role of crisis leadership in navigating complex and unpredictable situations. By examining the dynamics of crises and the competencies required for effective leadership during turbulent times, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and developing crisis leadership skills. Through a systematic review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key attributes and strategies that enable leaders to successfully manage crises, including adaptability, communication, decision-making under pressure, and emotional intelligence. Our findings highlight the importance of proactive crisis preparation and the development of specific crisis leadership competencies. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on crisis management and offers practical insights for organizations and leaders seeking to enhance their crisis response capabilities in an increasingly volatile global environment."}
