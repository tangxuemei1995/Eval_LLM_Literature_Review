{"Abstract": "This review examines the evolution of employee voice and silence research over the past decade. We synthesize key findings and theoretical advancements in understanding why employees choose to speak up or remain silent in organizational settings. The paper explores the antecedents, processes, and consequences of voice and silence, highlighting the roles of individual differences, leadership styles, and organizational climate. We discuss emerging trends, including the impact of digital communication technologies and remote work on voice behaviors. The review also addresses methodological developments and identifies critical gaps in the literature. By integrating diverse perspectives, we propose a comprehensive framework for future research on employee voice and silence. This synthesis contributes to our understanding of upward communication, proactive behavior, and information sharing in contemporary workplaces."}
