{"Abstract": "This paper proposes a comprehensive update to the Challenge–Hindrance Stressor Framework, addressing limitations in the original model and incorporating recent advancements in stress research. Drawing on the Transactional Theory of Stress and Conservation of Resources theory, we introduce the Challenge–Hindrance Stressor Framework 2.0. This revised framework emphasizes the role of individual appraisals, acknowledges the impact of negativity bias, and integrates elements from the Job Demands–Resources model. By synthesizing these theoretical perspectives, we offer a more nuanced understanding of how employees perceive and respond to workplace stressors. The updated framework accounts for the dynamic nature of stressor appraisals, the potential for mixed appraisals, and the influence of personal and contextual factors on stress outcomes. This conceptual advancement provides a foundation for future research and practical interventions aimed at optimizing employee well-being and performance in the face of workplace challenges."}
