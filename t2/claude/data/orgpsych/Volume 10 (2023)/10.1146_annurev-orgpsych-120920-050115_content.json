{"Abstract": "As organizations increasingly adopt remote and hybrid work models, the need for effective virtual leadership has become paramount. This study explores the challenges and opportunities associated with leading virtually, focusing on the dynamics of remote teams and dyadic relationships in digital environments. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical research, we examine the key competencies required for successful virtual leadership, including communication strategies, trust-building techniques, and performance management in distributed settings. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting traditional leadership approaches to suit the unique demands of virtual and hybrid work contexts. We also identify best practices for fostering engagement, collaboration, and productivity among geographically dispersed team members. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on virtual leadership and provides practical insights for managers navigating the complexities of leading in the digital age."}
