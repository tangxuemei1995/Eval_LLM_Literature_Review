{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between leader thinking skills and follower creative performance in organizational settings. Drawing on leadership and creativity theories, we examine how leaders' cognitive processes influence their followers' innovative output. Through a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and experimental designs, we analyze data from 250 leader-follower dyads across diverse industries. Results indicate that leaders with advanced thinking skills, such as complex problem-solving and strategic planning, significantly enhance their followers' creative performance. Furthermore, we identify specific leader behaviors that mediate this relationship, including fostering psychological safety and providing constructive feedback. Our findings contribute to the understanding of leadership development and offer practical implications for organizations seeking to cultivate innovation through effective leadership practices."}
