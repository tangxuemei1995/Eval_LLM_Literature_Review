{"Abstract": "This review examines the dynamic interplay between actors (individuals and teams) and their contexts in fostering creativity and innovation. We synthesize recent research on person-context and team-context interactions, highlighting the complex and reciprocal nature of these relationships. Our analysis reveals that contextual factors, such as leadership styles, organizational climate, and resource availability, significantly influence creative outcomes. Simultaneously, individual and team characteristics shape how actors perceive and respond to their environments. We identify key gaps in current understanding and propose future research directions to advance our knowledge of the actor-context dynamics in creativity and innovation processes."}
