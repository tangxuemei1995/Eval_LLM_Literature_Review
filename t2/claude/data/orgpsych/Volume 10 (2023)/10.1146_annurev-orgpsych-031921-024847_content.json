{"Abstract": "This study explores the concepts of decent work and meaningful work, examining their interrelationships and implications for employee well-being and organizational outcomes. Drawing from the psychology of working theory and job design literature, we analyze how work conditions contribute to the perception of decent and meaningful work. Through a comprehensive review of existing research and a meta-analysis of empirical studies, we identify key factors that influence the experience of meaningfulness in the workplace. Our findings suggest that decent work serves as a foundation for meaningful work, with job autonomy, skill variety, and social impact emerging as critical components. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates decent work and meaningful work, highlighting their combined effects on job satisfaction, engagement, and overall life satisfaction. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of work quality and provides practical implications for organizations seeking to enhance employee experiences and productivity."}
