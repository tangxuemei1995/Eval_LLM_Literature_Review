{"Abstract": "This paper reviews the Job Demandsâ€“Resources (JD-R) theory, a decade after its initial conceptualization. The JD-R theory has become one of the most influential frameworks for understanding employee well-being and performance. We examine the theory's evolution, empirical support, and practical applications across various occupational settings. The review highlights how job demands and resources interact to predict burnout and work engagement, and how these processes influence organizational outcomes. Recent developments in the theory, including the incorporation of personal resources and proactive work behavior, are discussed. The paper also addresses criticisms and limitations of the JD-R theory, suggesting future research directions to enhance its explanatory power and practical utility in job design and organizational interventions."}
