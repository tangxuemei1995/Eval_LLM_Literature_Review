{"Abstract": "This study explores the critical role of employee green behavior (EGB) in fostering environmentally sustainable organizations. Drawing from environmental psychology and organizational behavior literature, we examine how individual ecological behaviors contribute to broader organizational sustainability goals. Through a comprehensive review of existing research, we identify key factors influencing EGB, including personal values, organizational culture, and leadership support. Our findings suggest that organizations can significantly enhance their environmental performance by promoting and facilitating EGB among their workforce. We propose a conceptual framework that integrates individual, organizational, and societal factors to explain the emergence and maintenance of EGB. Additionally, we discuss practical implications for managers and policymakers, highlighting strategies to cultivate a pro-environmental organizational culture. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on environmental sustainability in the workplace and provides valuable insights for creating more ecologically responsible organizations."}
