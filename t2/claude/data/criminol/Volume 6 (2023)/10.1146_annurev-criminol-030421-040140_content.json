{"Abstract": "The opioid crisis has reshaped America's approach to drug policy, marking a significant shift from the punitive measures of the 'War on Drugs' to a more compassionate, health-oriented response. This paper examines the stark contrast between the current opioid epidemic, predominantly affecting white communities, and the crack cocaine crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, which disproportionately impacted communities of color. We analyze how race has influenced public perception and policy responses to these drug crises, highlighting the transition from criminalization to medicalization in addressing substance abuse. The study explores the expansion of drug treatment programs, harm reduction strategies, and changes in law enforcement practices in response to the opioid epidemic. Additionally, we investigate the persistence of racial disparities in drug policy implementation and access to treatment. By comparing these two drug crises, this research illuminates the complex interplay between race, public health, and criminal justice in shaping drug policy. The findings suggest that while progress has been made in adopting more humane approaches to drug addiction, significant challenges remain in ensuring equitable treatment and policy application across all communities."}
