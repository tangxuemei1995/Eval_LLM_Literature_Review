{"Abstract": "This comprehensive review examines the critical issue of homicide measurement in cross-national research, addressing the challenges and implications of varying definitions and data collection methods across countries. The study synthesizes existing literature on homicide measurement practices, highlighting discrepancies in legal definitions, reporting procedures, and data quality among nations. It explores how these differences affect the comparability and reliability of homicide statistics in cross-national studies, potentially leading to biased or misleading conclusions. The review identifies key factors contributing to measurement inconsistencies, including cultural variations in defining homicide, disparities in law enforcement practices, and differences in health system reporting. Additionally, it assesses the impact of these measurement issues on prominent cross-national criminological theories and policy recommendations. The analysis reveals that inadequate attention to measurement variability can significantly distort research findings and hinder the development of effective global crime prevention strategies. To address these challenges, the study proposes a standardized framework for homicide measurement in cross-national research, emphasizing the need for improved data collection methods, enhanced international cooperation, and greater transparency in reporting practices. The review concludes by outlining future research directions and policy implications, stressing the importance of addressing measurement issues to advance our understanding of global homicide patterns and improve the efficacy of international crime reduction efforts."}
