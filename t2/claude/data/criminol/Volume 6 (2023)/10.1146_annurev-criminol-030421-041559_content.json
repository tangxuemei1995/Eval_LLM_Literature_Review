{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving trends in women's incarceration rates within US prisons and jails, highlighting the underlying inequalities that contribute to this phenomenon. By analyzing data from the past three decades, we explore the factors driving the disproportionate increase in female imprisonment compared to male incarceration rates. Our findings reveal that women, particularly those from marginalized communities, face unique challenges within the criminal justice system, often stemming from socioeconomic disparities, mental health issues, and histories of abuse. We investigate the far-reaching consequences of women's incarceration on families, communities, and society at large. This research contributes to the broader discourse on mass incarceration and punishment, emphasizing the need for gender-responsive policies and alternatives to imprisonment that address the root causes of women's involvement in the criminal justice system."}
