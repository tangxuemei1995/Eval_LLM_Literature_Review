{"Abstract": "This article examines the complex issue of overcriminalization in modern legal systems through the lens of six critical questions. Overcriminalization, the excessive use of criminal law to address social problems, has become a growing concern among legal scholars and practitioners. The study explores the multifaceted nature of this phenomenon by analyzing its underlying causes, manifestations, and consequences. The six questions addressed include: (1) What constitutes overcriminalization? (2) How does it impact prosecutorial discretion? (3) What role does the harm principle play in justifying criminalization? (4) How does overcriminalization affect the proportionality of punishment? (5) What are the challenges in enforcing an expanding criminal code? and (6) How does overcriminalization influence the balance between offenses and defenses? By examining these questions, the article provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complexities of overcriminalization and its implications for criminal justice systems. The analysis draws on a wide range of legal scholarship, case studies, and empirical evidence to offer insights into potential reforms and policy recommendations. Ultimately, this exploration aims to contribute to the ongoing debate surrounding the appropriate scope and application of criminal law in contemporary society, highlighting the need for a more balanced and judicious approach to criminalization."}
