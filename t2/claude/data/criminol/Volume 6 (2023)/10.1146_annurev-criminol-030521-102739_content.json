{"Abstract": "This study examines the minimum level of community supervision necessary to maintain public safety and reduce recidivism in the context of probation and parole. As mass supervision has become a growing concern in criminal justice systems, there is a pressing need to identify more efficient and less intrusive approaches. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical data from multiple jurisdictions, we investigate the effectiveness of various supervision intensities and strategies. Our findings suggest that a significant reduction in supervision levels can be achieved without compromising public safety or increasing reoffending rates. We propose a model of 'minimal supervision' that focuses on targeted interventions, risk assessment, and community support rather than frequent check-ins and stringent conditions. This approach not only alleviates the burden on probation and parole systems but also promotes successful reintegration of individuals into society. Our research contributes to the ongoing debate on criminal justice reform and offers practical recommendations for policymakers and practitioners."}
