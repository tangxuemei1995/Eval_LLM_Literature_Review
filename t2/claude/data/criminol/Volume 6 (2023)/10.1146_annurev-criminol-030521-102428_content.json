{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving role of victim advocacy in shaping criminal justice reform in England and Wales. Drawing on historical analysis and contemporary case studies, it explores how the women's movement and victim support organizations have influenced policy changes and public discourse surrounding victims' rights. The research highlights the shift from a predominantly offender-focused system to one that increasingly recognizes victims' needs and experiences. Key areas of impact include improved support services, enhanced legal protections, and greater victim participation in criminal proceedings. The study also considers ongoing challenges and future directions for victim advocacy within the criminal justice system, emphasizing the importance of continued collaboration between grassroots movements and policymakers."}
