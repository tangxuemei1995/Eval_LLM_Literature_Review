{"Abstract": "This article explores the resurgence of historical criminology, examining its scope, significance, and potential future directions. By analyzing the intersection of historical time and criminal justice history, we highlight the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding crime and punishment across different temporal contexts. The paper argues that historical criminology offers unique insights into the evolution of criminal behavior, societal responses, and the development of criminal justice systems. We discuss methodological challenges and opportunities in integrating historical perspectives with contemporary criminological theories. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the potential of historical criminology to inform current policy debates and enhance our understanding of long-term trends in crime and justice. By renewing interest in this subfield, we aim to encourage more nuanced and contextually rich analyses of criminological phenomena, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of crime and its control throughout history."}
