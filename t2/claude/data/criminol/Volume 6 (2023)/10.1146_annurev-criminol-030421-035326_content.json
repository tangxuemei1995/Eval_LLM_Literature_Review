{"Abstract": "This article examines the concept of expanded criminal defense lawyering and its potential impact on the criminal justice system. Drawing on the principles of holistic defense and effective assistance of counsel, we explore how a more comprehensive approach to indigent defense can address the complex needs of defendants and contribute to reducing mass incarceration. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, we analyze the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing expanded defense practices within the constraints of the current legal system. Our findings suggest that by addressing clients' underlying social, economic, and psychological issues, expanded defense lawyering can lead to more favorable case outcomes and reduce recidivism rates. We argue that this approach not only upholds the constitutional right to counsel but also offers a promising strategy for mitigating the negative effects of mass incarceration on individuals and communities."}
