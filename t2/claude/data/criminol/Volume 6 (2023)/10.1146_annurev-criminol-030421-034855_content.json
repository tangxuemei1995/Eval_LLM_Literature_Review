{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay between crime, peace, and emerging global challenges. Drawing from autobiographical accounts and empirical data, it examines how traditional notions of peace are being reshaped by cybercrime, environmental crises, and evolving forms of warfare. The research highlights the inadequacy of conventional peacekeeping approaches in addressing these multifaceted threats. By analyzing the shifting landscape of global security, the study proposes a new framework for understanding and fostering peace that goes beyond merely suppressing overt violence, emphasizing the need for adaptive strategies to combat emerging forms of predation in an increasingly interconnected world."}
