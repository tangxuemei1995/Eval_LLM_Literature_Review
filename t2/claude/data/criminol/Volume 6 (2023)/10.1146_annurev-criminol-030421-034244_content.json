{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between police unionism, accountability mechanisms, and instances of misconduct within law enforcement agencies. Drawing on extensive data from police departments across the United States, we analyze the impact of collective bargaining agreements and Law Enforcement Bills of Rights on officer accountability and use of force incidents. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between strong union protections and reduced officer discipline, as well as increased rates of misconduct complaints. We also explore how union-negotiated contract provisions can impede internal investigations and limit public transparency. However, our research also highlights potential benefits of police unions, including improved working conditions and officer safety. This study contributes to the ongoing debate surrounding police reform by providing empirical evidence on the multifaceted role of police unions in shaping departmental policies and officer behavior."}
