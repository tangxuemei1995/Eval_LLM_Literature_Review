{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between trauma, incarceration, and reentry prospects for formerly incarcerated individuals. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and original data from interviews with ex-offenders, we explore how traumatic experiences both before and during incarceration impact behavioral health and recidivism rates. Our findings suggest that unaddressed trauma significantly hinders successful reentry, contributing to higher rates of recidivism and poor mental health outcomes. We argue that trauma-informed approaches to correctional programming and post-release support services are crucial for effective criminal justice reform. By integrating trauma-focused interventions into reentry programs, we propose a model for reducing recidivism and improving overall outcomes for formerly incarcerated individuals. This research underscores the importance of addressing trauma as a key component of comprehensive criminal justice reform efforts."}
