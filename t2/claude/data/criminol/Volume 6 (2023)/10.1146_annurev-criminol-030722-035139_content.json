{"Abstract": "This paper examines the current crisis in American criminal justice through a structural lens, focusing on the interconnected issues of mass incarceration, police killings, and criminal violence. By analyzing these phenomena within the broader context of social control and political economy, we argue that the crisis is deeply rooted in the transformation of the welfare state and the neoliberal turn in governance. Drawing on extensive literature and empirical data, we demonstrate how punitive policies have disproportionately affected marginalized communities, exacerbating social inequalities and perpetuating cycles of violence. The study explores the historical evolution of criminal justice policies, their relationship to economic shifts, and the role of race in shaping these outcomes. We contend that addressing this crisis requires a fundamental reimagining of social control mechanisms and a reorientation of state priorities towards social welfare and community investment. This research contributes to ongoing debates about criminal justice reform and offers insights into potential pathways for systemic change."}
