{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolution of far-right and jihadi terrorism in the United States from September 11, 2001, to January 6, 2021. Through a comprehensive analysis of terrorist incidents, hate crimes, and extremist ideologies, we explore the shifting landscape of domestic terrorism. Our findings reveal a significant increase in far-right extremist activities, particularly in the years leading up to the January 6th Capitol insurrection, while jihadi terrorism has shown a relative decline since its peak following 9/11. We investigate the socio-political factors contributing to these trends, including the role of online radicalization, political polarization, and changing government counterterrorism strategies. The research also highlights the blurred lines between hate crimes and acts of terrorism, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced approach to categorizing and addressing extremist violence. Our analysis underscores the importance of developing tailored prevention and intervention strategies to combat both far-right and jihadi extremism, while acknowledging the distinct challenges posed by each form of terrorism in the contemporary United States."}
