{"Abstract": "This study examines the exceptional lethality of American policing in a comparative context, analyzing police killings across developed nations. Drawing on extensive data from multiple countries, we investigate the factors contributing to the United States' disproportionately high rates of deadly force incidents. Our research explores the role of decentralized policing structures, firearms prevalence, and racial disparities in shaping this phenomenon. We argue that the concept of American exceptionalism extends to law enforcement practices, with significant implications for public safety and police-community relations. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining statistical analysis of police killing data with qualitative examinations of policing policies and cultural factors. Our findings reveal that the United States' unique combination of decentralized policing, widespread gun ownership, and systemic racial biases contribute to its outlier status in police use of deadly force. We conclude by discussing potential policy reforms and accountability measures that could address this critical issue, offering insights for policymakers and law enforcement agencies seeking to reduce fatal police encounters."}
