{"Abstract": "This paper advocates for a revival of ethnographic approaches in studying the relationship between immigration and crime. Drawing inspiration from the Chicago School's pioneering work, we argue that qualitative methods offer unique insights into the complex dynamics of new immigrant communities and their interactions with criminal activities. By immersing researchers in the lived experiences of immigrants, ethnographies can reveal nuanced perspectives often overlooked by quantitative studies. We review recent ethnographic literature on immigration and crime, identifying key themes and methodological innovations. The paper highlights the potential of contemporary ethnographic approaches to shed light on the diverse trajectories of immigrant adaptation, the role of social networks in shaping criminal involvement, and the impact of local contexts on immigrant-crime dynamics. We conclude by proposing a research agenda that combines traditional ethnographic techniques with modern technological tools to enhance our understanding of this critical social issue."}
