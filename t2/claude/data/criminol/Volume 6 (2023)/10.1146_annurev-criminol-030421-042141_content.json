{"Abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of carjacking, a violent crime that combines elements of robbery and auto theft. Utilizing data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System and victimization surveys, we analyze the scope, structure, and process of carjacking incidents in the United States. Our findings reveal significant trends in carjacking patterns, including temporal and geographical variations, offender characteristics, and victim profiles. We explore the decision-making processes of carjackers, considering factors such as opportunity, risk assessment, and potential rewards. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of various prevention strategies, including technological interventions, environmental design, and law enforcement initiatives. Our research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of carjacking as a distinct crime type and offers evidence-based recommendations for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and the public to reduce the incidence and impact of carjacking. This study provides valuable insights into crime trends and informs targeted prevention efforts to enhance public safety."}
