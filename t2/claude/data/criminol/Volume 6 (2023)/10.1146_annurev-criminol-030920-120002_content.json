{"Abstract": "This article explores the intersection of LatCrit theory and criminology to develop a more nuanced understanding of Latino/a/x crime and involvement in the criminal legal system. Drawing on critical race theory and Latino/a critical theory (LatCrit), we argue that traditional criminological approaches have often overlooked the unique experiences and challenges faced by Latino/a/x individuals within the criminal justice context. By integrating LatCrit perspectives into criminological research, we aim to illuminate the complex interplay of race, ethnicity, and systemic factors that contribute to Latino/a/x criminalization and overrepresentation in the criminal legal system. The paper begins by outlining key tenets of LatCrit theory and their relevance to criminological inquiry. We then examine how LatCrit can enhance our understanding of Latino/a/x crime patterns, police interactions, court processes, and incarceration experiences. Through this theoretical lens, we highlight the importance of considering intersectionality, immigration status, language barriers, and cultural factors in analyzing Latino/a/x criminal justice involvement. Additionally, we discuss how LatCrit can inform policy recommendations and interventions aimed at addressing disparities and promoting equity within the criminal legal system. By bridging LatCrit and criminology, this article contributes to a more comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to studying Latino/a/x crime and criminal justice experiences, ultimately advancing both theoretical knowledge and practical applications in the field."}
