{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to carceral systems worldwide, with prisons and jails becoming hotspots for virus transmission. This review examines the incidence of COVID-19 in correctional facilities, evaluates mitigation strategies implemented, and assesses vaccination efforts among incarcerated populations. We analyzed peer-reviewed literature, government reports, and public health data to provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact on carceral systems. Findings reveal disproportionately high infection rates in prisons and jails compared to the general population, highlighting the vulnerability of incarcerated individuals. Mitigation measures, including improved sanitation, reduced population density, and personal protective equipment distribution, showed varying degrees of effectiveness. Vaccination programs faced unique obstacles, including hesitancy and logistical challenges. This review underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions, policy reforms, and increased healthcare resources in carceral settings to better manage current and future public health crises. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of considering incarcerated populations in broader public health strategies to ensure equitable health outcomes."}
