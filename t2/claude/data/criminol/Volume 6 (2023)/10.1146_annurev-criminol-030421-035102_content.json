{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of surveillance technologies and constitutional law, focusing on the implications for the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. As technological advancements enable increasingly sophisticated surveillance methods, questions arise about the balance between crime prevention and individual privacy rights. The research analyzes recent court decisions and legal precedents to evaluate how the judicial system interprets the Fourth Amendment in light of emerging surveillance technologies. Key areas of exploration include GPS tracking, facial recognition systems, and digital data collection. The study also considers the potential long-term effects of expanded surveillance on civil liberties and democratic principles. Findings suggest a need for updated legal frameworks to address the unique challenges posed by modern surveillance capabilities, while preserving constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures."}
