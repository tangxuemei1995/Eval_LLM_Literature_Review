{"Abstract": "This study examines the development of fair risk algorithms in the context of criminal justice, addressing concerns of discrimination in machine learning-based risk assessment tools. We propose a novel approach combining optimal transport theory and conformation prediction to mitigate bias in algorithmic decision-making. Our method ensures fairness across protected groups while maintaining predictive accuracy. We evaluate the algorithm's performance on real-world criminal justice datasets, comparing it to existing fairness-aware methods. Results demonstrate significant improvements in both fairness metrics and predictive power. The proposed framework offers a promising solution for balancing algorithmic fairness and accuracy in high-stakes domains like criminal justice. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on ethical AI and provides practical insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to implement fair risk assessment tools in sensitive applications."}
