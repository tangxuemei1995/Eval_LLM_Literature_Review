{"Abstract": "In the era of open science, data reusability and research transparency have become paramount concerns. This paper explores the critical role of statistics in advancing these objectives. We examine how statistical methods can enhance data quality, facilitate data sharing, and promote reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. Through a comprehensive review of current practices and emerging trends, we identify key statistical approaches that support data reuse across disciplines. Our analysis reveals that robust statistical frameworks not only improve the reliability of shared data but also enable more effective integration of diverse datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how statistical techniques can be leveraged to assess and ensure the transparency of research processes. By highlighting the intersection of statistics with open science principles, this study provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and data managers seeking to maximize the impact and credibility of scientific endeavors in an increasingly data-driven world."}
