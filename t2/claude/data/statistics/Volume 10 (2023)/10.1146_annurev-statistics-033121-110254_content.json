{"Abstract": "This paper reviews recent advancements in approximate methods for Bayesian computation, focusing on techniques that address computational challenges in large-scale inference. We examine Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), Bayesian synthetic likelihood, coresets, divide-and-conquer strategies, and subsampling approaches within Markov chain Monte Carlo frameworks. These methods offer scalable solutions for complex probabilistic models and big data scenarios, balancing computational efficiency with inferential accuracy. We discuss their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and comparative advantages, providing insights into their applicability across various domains in statistical inference and machine learning."}
