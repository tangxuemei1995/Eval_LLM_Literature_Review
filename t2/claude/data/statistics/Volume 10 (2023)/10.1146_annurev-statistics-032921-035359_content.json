{"Abstract": "Surrogate endpoints have become increasingly important in clinical trials, offering potential time and cost savings. This review examines the concept of surrogate markers and their application in medical research. We discuss the Prentice criteria, a fundamental framework for validating surrogate endpoints, and explore more recent developments in causal inference methodologies. The paper addresses the challenges of establishing causal associations between surrogate markers and clinical outcomes, emphasizing the importance of causal effectiveness in surrogate endpoint evaluation. We introduce the concept of principal stratification as a tool for assessing surrogacy and highlight the potential pitfalls, including the surrogate paradox. The review concludes by discussing the implications of these methodologies for clinical trial design and interpretation, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when using surrogate endpoints to guide treatment decisions and regulatory approvals."}
