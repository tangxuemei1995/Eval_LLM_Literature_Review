{"Abstract": "This paper explores models for integer-valued data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models. We review key concepts in discrete probability theory and introduce thinning operators as a fundamental tool for constructing integer-valued processes. The Skellam distribution, a discrete probability distribution of the difference between two independent Poisson random variables, is examined in detail. We discuss its properties, parameter estimation, and applications in various fields. Furthermore, we present several time-series models specifically designed for integer-valued data, including integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) and integer-valued moving average (INMA) models. The paper concludes by highlighting recent developments in the field and suggesting potential areas for future research in modeling integer-valued phenomena."}
