{"Abstract": "High-dimensional survival analysis has emerged as a crucial tool in precision medicine and data science, addressing the challenges of analyzing complex, large-scale datasets with time-to-event outcomes. This review explores cutting-edge methodologies and applications in this rapidly evolving field. We discuss advanced feature screening techniques for identifying relevant predictors in high-dimensional settings, as well as machine learning approaches, including artificial neural networks, for improved prediction accuracy. The integration of statistical inference methods with these novel techniques is examined, highlighting the importance of interpretability and uncertainty quantification. We showcase applications in various domains, such as cancer genomics and clinical trials, demonstrating the potential of high-dimensional survival analysis to enhance personalized treatment strategies and risk prediction. Finally, we outline future research directions and challenges in this interdisciplinary field."}
