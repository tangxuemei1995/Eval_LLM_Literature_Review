{"Abstract": "This study explores bootstrap methods for high-dimensional data analysis, focusing on empirical and multiplier bootstrap techniques. We investigate their applications in multiple testing scenarios and simultaneous inference. The research examines the theoretical foundations of high-dimensional central limit theorems and their implications for bootstrap validity. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in addressing challenges associated with high-dimensional data, particularly in controlling family-wise error rates and constructing confidence regions. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on robust statistical inference in high-dimensional settings, offering insights for practitioners dealing with complex datasets."}
