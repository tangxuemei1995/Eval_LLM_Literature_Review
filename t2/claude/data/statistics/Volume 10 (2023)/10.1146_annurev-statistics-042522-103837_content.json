{"Abstract": "This review examines the concepts of generalizability and transportability in causal inference, addressing their importance in establishing external validity of research findings. We explore the theoretical foundations and methodological approaches for assessing and enhancing the generalizability of treatment effects across diverse populations and settings. The paper discusses the challenges posed by treatment effect heterogeneity and the role of covariate distributions in transportability analysis. We review recent advancements in statistical methods for generalizing causal effects, including techniques for integrating data from multiple sources and leveraging domain expertise. Additionally, we consider the implications of generalizability and transportability for policy decisions and evidence-based practice. The review concludes by identifying key research gaps and future directions for improving the external validity of causal estimates in various fields, including epidemiology, economics, and social sciences."}
