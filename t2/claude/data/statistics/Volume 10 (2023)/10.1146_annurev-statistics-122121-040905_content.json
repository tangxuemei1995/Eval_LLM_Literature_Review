{"Abstract": "This paper presents an overview of simulation-based Bayesian analysis techniques, focusing on recent advancements in computational methods and software tools. We explore the evolution of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including Gibbs sampling and its variants, and discuss their applications in complex graphical models. The study examines the emergence of newer approaches such as Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) and Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs). We compare popular software packages like BUGS, JAGS, and Stan, highlighting their strengths and limitations in various Bayesian inference scenarios. The paper also addresses the challenges of scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional problems, proposing potential directions for future research in simulation-based Bayesian computation."}
