{"Abstract": "Data integration in Bayesian phylogenetics has emerged as a powerful approach for inferring evolutionary relationships and processes across diverse biological scales. This review synthesizes recent advancements in combining multiple data types within a unified Bayesian framework for phylogenetic inference. We explore the integration of molecular sequences, morphological traits, fossil data, and geographical information using sophisticated statistical models. Bayesian networks and continuous-time Markov processes are discussed as key methodological foundations for modeling complex evolutionary scenarios. The application of Gaussian processes in phylogenetic comparative methods is highlighted, enabling the analysis of continuous traits and their correlation with phylogenetic patterns. We examine the role of phylogeography in integrating spatial and temporal information into phylogenetic analyses, providing insights into historical biogeography and species distributions. The review emphasizes the potential of data integration to improve phylogenetic accuracy, resolve contentious relationships, and uncover novel evolutionary patterns. Finally, we discuss computational challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field, including the development of more efficient algorithms and the incorporation of genomic-scale data."}
