{"Abstract": "This paper provides a concise overview of deep learning from a statistical standpoint. We explore the fundamental concepts of neural networks and their applications in pattern recognition tasks. The discussion encompasses key optimization techniques employed in training deep learning models. By examining the statistical underpinnings of these methods, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional statistical approaches and modern deep learning paradigms."}
