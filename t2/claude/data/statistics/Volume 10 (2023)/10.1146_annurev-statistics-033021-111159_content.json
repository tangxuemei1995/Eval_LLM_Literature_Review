{"Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to statistical inference called the Three-Decision Method, which offers a more nuanced alternative to traditional significance testing. By incorporating a third decision option of 'inconclusive' alongside the conventional 'reject' and 'fail to reject' outcomes, this method addresses longstanding criticisms of binary hypothesis testing. The approach is grounded in decision theory and provides a framework for balancing Type I and Type II errors while explicitly acknowledging uncertainty. We demonstrate how this method can be applied to various statistical scenarios, including multiple testing and sensitivity analysis. The Three-Decision Method not only enhances the interpretability of results but also aligns more closely with the realities of scientific research, where conclusive evidence may not always be attainable. This formulation represents a significant advancement in statistical methodology, offering researchers a more flexible and informative tool for drawing inferences from data."}
