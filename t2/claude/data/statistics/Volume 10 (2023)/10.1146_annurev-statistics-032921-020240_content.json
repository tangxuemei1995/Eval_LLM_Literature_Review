{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating and diagnosing quantile regression models, with a focus on forecast performance. We introduce novel diagnostic tools, including calibration tests, coverage plots, and reliability diagrams specifically adapted for quantile forecasts. The study also explores the use of Murphy diagrams to assess the comparative performance of different quantile models. We develop a set of tailored scoring functions that capture the unique characteristics of quantile predictions. Through extensive simulations and real-world case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these diagnostic techniques in identifying model misspecification, assessing forecast reliability, and guiding model selection. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers working with quantile regression models across various fields, including economics, finance, and environmental sciences."}
