{"Abstract": "Detecting exoplanets using radial velocity measurements presents unique challenges in statistical analysis due to the complex nature of the data. This study explores advanced statistical methods for improving exoplanet detection accuracy in the presence of correlated noise, uneven sampling, and model misspecification. We develop a multivariate time series approach that accounts for these issues while incorporating model comparison techniques to evaluate competing hypotheses. Our method addresses the limitations of traditional approaches by explicitly modeling correlated noise structures and handling irregularly sampled data. We apply our framework to both simulated and real radial velocity datasets, demonstrating improved sensitivity and reduced false positive rates compared to existing methods. Our findings highlight the importance of robust statistical techniques in exoplanet detection and provide a foundation for future advancements in the field."}
