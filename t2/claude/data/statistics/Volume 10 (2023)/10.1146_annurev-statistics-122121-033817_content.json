{"Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach for change-point analysis in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data settings. We propose a nonparametric method that leverages graph-based tests and scan statistics to detect structural changes in complex data structures, including network data. Our approach is particularly effective in scenarios where traditional parametric methods fail due to the non-Euclidean nature of the data or high dimensionality. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the tail probability of the proposed test statistic, providing rigorous guarantees for its performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and power of our method across various data types and change-point scenarios. Additionally, we apply our technique to real-world network data, showcasing its practical utility in detecting significant structural shifts. This work contributes to the growing field of nonparametric change-point detection, offering a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data structures."}
