{"Abstract": "This study examines the implementation of confidentiality protection measures in the 2020 US Census of Population and Housing. Focusing on statistical disclosure limitation techniques, particularly differential privacy, we analyze their impact on data accuracy and utility for redistricting purposes. The research explores the balance between maintaining individual privacy and providing reliable demographic information. We evaluate the effectiveness of these measures in safeguarding confidentiality while preserving the census data's integrity and usability. Our findings suggest that while differential privacy offers enhanced protection, it may introduce challenges for certain applications, necessitating careful consideration in future census methodologies to ensure both privacy and data quality."}
