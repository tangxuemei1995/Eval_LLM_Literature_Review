{"Abstract": "Statistical data privacy has emerged as a critical field at the intersection of data science, privacy, and utility. This paper explores the delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and maintaining the usefulness of statistical data. We review key concepts in statistical disclosure control and formal privacy models, with a focus on differential privacy. The study examines various inference techniques used to extract sensitive information from seemingly anonymized datasets, highlighting the challenges faced by privacy-preserving mechanisms. We analyze the trade-offs between privacy guarantees and data utility, discussing how different approaches impact the accuracy and reliability of statistical analyses. The paper also addresses the practical implementation of privacy-preserving techniques in real-world scenarios, considering both technical and policy-related aspects. Our findings emphasize the need for robust, context-aware privacy solutions that can adapt to evolving data landscapes while ensuring meaningful statistical insights."}
