{"Abstract": "Model-based clustering is a powerful statistical approach for identifying underlying structures in complex datasets. This method employs mixture models to represent heterogeneous populations, utilizing the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. By incorporating probabilistic frameworks, model-based clustering offers advantages over traditional clustering techniques, including the ability to handle uncertainty and determine the optimal number of clusters. Bayesian inference further enhances the approach by allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and providing a natural framework for model selection. Recent advancements in software implementations have made model-based clustering more accessible to researchers across various disciplines. This paper reviews the theoretical foundations of model-based clustering, discusses its applications in diverse fields, and explores current challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving area of statistical learning."}
