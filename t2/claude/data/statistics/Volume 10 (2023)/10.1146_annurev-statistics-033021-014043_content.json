{"Abstract": "The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced by Sir David Cox in 1972, has profoundly impacted survival analysis and biostatistics over the past five decades. This review examines the model's evolution, applications, and extensions since its inception. We explore key developments, including the incorporation of time-dependent covariates, competing risks analysis, and recurrent event modeling. The paper discusses the model's theoretical underpinnings, focusing on partial likelihood estimation and the assumption of independent censoring. We highlight the Cox model's versatility in handling complex survival data and its adaptation to various research contexts. The review also addresses challenges and limitations, such as the proportional hazards assumption and the interpretation of results in the presence of competing risks. Furthermore, we examine the model's integration with modern statistical techniques and its role in the era of big data and precision medicine. This comprehensive overview underscores the Cox model's enduring significance and its continued relevance in contemporary biomedical research and beyond."}
