{"Abstract": "This review examines recent advancements in shared frailty methods for analyzing complex survival data. We explore applications in various scenarios, including clustered data, competing events, and recurrent events. The paper discusses extensions to traditional models such as Cox regression and accelerated failure time models, incorporating shared frailty components to account for within-cluster correlations. We also investigate novel approaches like regression trees and random survival forests adapted for frailty modeling. The review highlights the benefits of these methods in capturing heterogeneity and improving prediction accuracy in survival analysis. Furthermore, we address computational challenges and available software implementations. This comprehensive overview provides researchers with valuable insights into the current state of shared frailty methods and their potential for handling intricate survival data structures."}
