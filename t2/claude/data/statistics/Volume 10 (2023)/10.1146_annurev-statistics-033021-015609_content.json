{"Abstract": "This paper examines the critical need for sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa, with a focus on biostatistics. Despite the growing demand for statistical expertise in health-related research, many African countries face significant challenges in developing and retaining skilled biostatisticians. We analyze the current state of biostatistical education and training in Africa, identifying key barriers such as limited resources, brain drain, and inadequate infrastructure. The study proposes a comprehensive framework for sustainable capacity-building, emphasizing the importance of South-North collaborations, investment in human capital, and the establishment of robust consulting services. We argue that a multifaceted approach, combining education, research opportunities, and practical experience, is essential for creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of biostatistical expertise in Africa. By addressing these challenges, African nations can enhance their ability to conduct high-quality health research, inform evidence-based policies, and ultimately improve public health outcomes across the continent."}
