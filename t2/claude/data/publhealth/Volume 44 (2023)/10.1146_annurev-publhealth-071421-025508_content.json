{"Abstract": "Extreme heat events pose significant public health risks, exacerbated by climate change. This study examines the effectiveness of heat action plans in mitigating the impacts of extreme heat on vulnerable populations. A comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies from various urban centers was conducted to identify best practices in public health preparedness. The research highlights the importance of early warning systems, community outreach, and targeted interventions for high-risk groups. Findings indicate that well-implemented heat action plans can significantly reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality. However, challenges remain in addressing socioeconomic disparities and improving urban infrastructure to enhance resilience. The study emphasizes the need for adaptive strategies that integrate climate change projections into long-term disaster risk reduction planning. Recommendations include strengthening cross-sector collaborations and investing in sustainable cooling solutions to better protect public health during extreme heat events."}
