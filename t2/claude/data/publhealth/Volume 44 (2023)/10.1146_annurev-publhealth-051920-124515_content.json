{"Abstract": "Implementation science has traditionally focused on pre-planned strategies to promote evidence-based practices in healthcare settings. However, emerging perspectives highlight the importance of on-the-go adaptation of implementation approaches to address dynamic contextual factors and unforeseen challenges. This review explores the concept of adaptive implementation in health settings, examining how practitioners and researchers modify strategies in real-time to enhance effectiveness and sustainability. We synthesize recent literature on adaptive implementation, identifying key drivers, mechanisms, and outcomes of on-the-go modifications. The review also discusses methodological approaches for studying adaptive implementation processes and their impact on implementation success. Furthermore, we highlight research gaps and opportunities for future studies, including the need for more robust theoretical frameworks, improved measurement tools, and longitudinal investigations of adaptive implementation trajectories. By advancing our understanding of on-the-go adaptation, this review aims to inform more flexible and responsive implementation approaches that can better navigate the complexities of real-world healthcare settings."}
