{"Abstract": "The US public health workforce faces significant challenges in recruitment, retention, and development. This review examines the current state of the public health workforce, highlighting ongoing issues and proposing future directions. Despite efforts to strengthen the workforce, persistent problems include inadequate funding, an aging workforce, and difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled professionals. The lack of comprehensive workforce enumeration data further complicates strategic planning. To address these challenges, the review recommends increased investment in workforce development programs, enhanced collaboration between academic institutions and public health agencies, and the implementation of innovative recruitment strategies. Additionally, the importance of standardized competency-based training and the need for improved data collection and analysis are emphasized. By addressing these critical areas, the US can work towards building a more robust and resilient public health workforce capable of meeting current and future health challenges."}
