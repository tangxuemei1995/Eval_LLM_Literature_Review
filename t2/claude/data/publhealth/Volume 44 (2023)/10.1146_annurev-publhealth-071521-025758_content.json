{"Abstract": "Health care systems face ongoing challenges in improving quality and safety. Traditional research methods often struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. This paper explores the potential of rapid randomized trials as an innovative approach to quality improvement in health care systems. By leveraging the principles of randomized controlled trials within shorter timeframes and more flexible designs, rapid trials can provide timely, actionable evidence to inform system-level changes. We review recent applications of this methodology across various healthcare settings, highlighting its advantages in addressing urgent safety concerns and optimizing resource allocation. Additionally, we discuss the ethical considerations and methodological challenges associated with implementing rapid trials in complex health care environments. Our findings suggest that rapid randomized trials offer a promising avenue for accelerating quality improvement efforts and enhancing patient outcomes in dynamic health care systems."}
