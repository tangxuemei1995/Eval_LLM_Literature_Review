{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the public health implications of drought in the context of climate change. As global temperatures rise, drought events are becoming more frequent and severe, posing significant challenges to human health and well-being. The study synthesizes current literature on drought trends, their impacts on public health, and the vulnerability of different populations. Key findings highlight the direct and indirect health effects of drought, including water scarcity, food insecurity, and increased risk of infectious diseases. The review also explores the complex interplay between drought and socioeconomic factors that exacerbate health disparities. Furthermore, it evaluates existing drought risk management strategies and their effectiveness in mitigating health impacts. The paper concludes by identifying knowledge gaps and proposing recommendations for integrated drought management approaches that prioritize public health in a changing climate."}
