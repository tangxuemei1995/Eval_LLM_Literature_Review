{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersections of health, equity, and economics in early childhood education (ECE). Drawing on a comprehensive review of literature and empirical data, we investigate how ECE programs impact children's health outcomes, address socioeconomic disparities, and yield long-term economic benefits. Our findings reveal that high-quality ECE interventions significantly improve children's physical and mental health, particularly among disadvantaged populations. Moreover, these programs play a crucial role in reducing educational inequities and promoting social mobility. Economic analyses demonstrate substantial returns on investment in ECE, including increased workforce productivity and reduced healthcare costs. However, challenges in access and quality persist, highlighting the need for targeted policies and increased funding. This research underscores the importance of viewing ECE through a multidisciplinary lens, emphasizing its potential to simultaneously address health, equity, and economic concerns in early childhood development."}
