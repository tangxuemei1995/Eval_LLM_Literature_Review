The review examines how various factors at individual, community, and societal levels influence access to and utilization of digital health resources. Findings reveal persistent disparities in digital health adoption and outcomes across socioeconomic, racial, and geographic lines. Key determinants include digital literacy, technological infrastructure, cultural relevance of digital health solutions, and policy frameworks. The synthesis highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to digital health equity that considers social, economic, and technological factors. Recommendations for future research and policy interventions are provided to advance equitable access and outcomes in digital health."}
