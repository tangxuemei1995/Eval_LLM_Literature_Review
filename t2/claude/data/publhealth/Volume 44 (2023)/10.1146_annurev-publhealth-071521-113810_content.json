{"Abstract": "Gentrification, a process of urban transformation, has significant implications for health equity in cities worldwide. This theoretical and methodological guide explores the complex relationship between gentrification, displacement, and urban health outcomes. By synthesizing existing literature and proposing novel approaches, we aim to provide researchers and policymakers with a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing the health impacts of gentrification. The guide examines various methodologies for measuring displacement and health outcomes, discusses the role of urban regeneration in promoting or hindering health equity, and proposes strategies for mitigating negative health effects associated with gentrification. Additionally, we highlight the importance of community engagement and participatory research in developing effective interventions. This guide serves as a valuable resource for interdisciplinary collaboration in urban planning, public health, and social policy to promote health equity in rapidly changing urban environments."}
