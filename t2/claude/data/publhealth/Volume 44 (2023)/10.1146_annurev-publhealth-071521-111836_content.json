{"Abstract": "This review examines the intricate relationship between housing quality and inequalities in health and well-being. The study synthesizes existing literature to explore how various aspects of the indoor environment, including air quality, temperature, lighting, and noise levels, influence occupants' physical and mental health outcomes. The review highlights the disproportionate impact of poor housing conditions on vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing health disparities. It also investigates the potential co-benefits of improving housing quality, such as reduced healthcare costs and enhanced social cohesion. The analysis of current healthy housing guidelines reveals gaps in implementation and enforcement, particularly in low-income areas. The findings underscore the urgent need for evidence-based policies and interventions to address housing-related health inequalities. This review contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the importance of quality housing as a social determinant of health and provides recommendations for future research and policy directions to promote equitable access to healthy living environments."}
