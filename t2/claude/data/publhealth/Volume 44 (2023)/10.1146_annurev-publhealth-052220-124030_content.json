{"Abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive analysis of cancers attributable to modifiable risk factors, offering a road map for prevention strategies. By examining attributable fractions across various risk factors, we identify key areas for targeted interventions in cancer control. Our findings reveal that a significant proportion of cancer cases could be prevented through lifestyle modifications and environmental improvements. We assess the impact of factors such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, diet, physical inactivity, and environmental exposures on cancer incidence. The results highlight the potential for substantial reductions in cancer burden through evidence-based prevention measures. This research emphasizes the importance of public health initiatives and policy changes aimed at addressing modifiable risk factors. By quantifying the avoidable cancer burden, we provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public to guide effective cancer prevention efforts and resource allocation."}
