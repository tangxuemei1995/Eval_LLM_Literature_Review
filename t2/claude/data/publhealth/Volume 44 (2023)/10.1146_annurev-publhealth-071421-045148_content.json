{"Abstract": "This review examines the complex interplay between climatic and environmental change, human migration, and health outcomes. As global temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, populations are increasingly displaced or compelled to relocate. We analyze the direct and indirect impacts of climate-induced migration on physical and mental health, considering both acute and chronic effects. The study explores various forms of mobility, including temporary displacement, planned relocation, and permanent migration, and their differential health implications. We also investigate the unique vulnerabilities of specific populations, such as indigenous communities and low-income groups. Our findings highlight the urgent need for interdisciplinary research, adaptive policies, and strengthened healthcare systems to address the emerging health challenges associated with climate-driven human mobility."}
