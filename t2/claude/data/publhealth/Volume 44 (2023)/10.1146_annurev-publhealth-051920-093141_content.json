{"Abstract": "Public health surveillance systems play a crucial role in detecting and responding to emerging infectious diseases. This review explores recent innovations in surveillance methodologies, focusing on advancements in the national notifiable disease reporting system and their application to emerging infections, particularly COVID-19. We examine the integration of spatial modeling techniques and artificial intelligence in enhancing surveillance capabilities. The review highlights how these technologies improve real-time data collection, analysis, and visualization, enabling more rapid and targeted public health responses. Spatial modeling has significantly enhanced our understanding of disease spread patterns and risk factors, while AI algorithms have demonstrated potential in early outbreak detection and prediction. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption and refinement of these innovative approaches, leading to more robust and adaptable surveillance systems. However, challenges remain in data standardization, privacy concerns, and equitable implementation across diverse healthcare settings. This review underscores the importance of continued investment in and development of advanced surveillance technologies to strengthen global preparedness for future infectious disease threats."}
