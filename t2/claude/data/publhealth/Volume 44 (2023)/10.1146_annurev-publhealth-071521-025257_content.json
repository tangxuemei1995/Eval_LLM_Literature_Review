{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted impacts of paid family and medical leave (PFML) policies on worker health, family well-being, and employer outcomes. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical data from various countries and states with PFML programs, we investigate the effects of such policies on employee physical and mental health, work-life balance, and job satisfaction. Additionally, we explore the implications for family dynamics, child development, and caregiving responsibilities. Our findings suggest that PFML policies generally lead to improved health outcomes for workers, enhanced family well-being, and increased gender equity in the workplace. Furthermore, we assess the economic implications for employers, including potential costs and benefits related to employee retention, productivity, and organizational culture. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the implementation of PFML policies and provides valuable insights for policymakers and business leaders."}
