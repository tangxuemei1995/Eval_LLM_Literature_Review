{"Abstract": "This literature review examines the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes globally, focusing on statistical challenges and data visualization techniques. The study synthesizes evidence from peer-reviewed articles, highlighting the complex interplay between air quality indicators and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. Key findings reveal significant associations between long-term exposure to particulate matter and increased COVID-19 severity across various geographical regions. However, the review also identifies methodological inconsistencies and data limitations that hinder conclusive interpretations. Advanced data visualization methods, including geospatial mapping and interactive dashboards, are explored as tools for effectively communicating complex environmental and epidemiological data. The review emphasizes the need for standardized approaches in air pollution and COVID-19 research, calling for improved data collection and analysis techniques to inform public health policies and interventions."}
