{"Abstract": "This study addresses the critical need for improved methods in assessing food and nutrient intake in population sciences research. We explore innovative approaches to enhance the accuracy and reliability of dietary assessment techniques, focusing on the integration of traditional self-reported measures with objective biomarkers. The research employs regression calibration to correct for measurement error in dietary data, utilizing a combination of 24-hour recalls, food frequency questionnaires, and nutritional biomarkers. Our findings demonstrate that this multifaceted approach significantly reduces bias in estimating diet-disease relationships. Furthermore, we develop and validate a novel statistical model that incorporates both self-reported and biomarker data to provide more precise estimates of true intake. This study contributes to the field of nutritional epidemiology by offering a robust framework for improving the capacity to assess food and nutrient intake, ultimately enhancing the validity of diet-related research outcomes in population health studies."}
