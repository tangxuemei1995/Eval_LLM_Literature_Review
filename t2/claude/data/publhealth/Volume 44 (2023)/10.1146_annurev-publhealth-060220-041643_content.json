Drawing from a multidisciplinary perspective, we examine the integration of digital health tools, wearable sensors, and culturally relevant personalized medicine approaches. Our research synthesizes findings from public health, computer science, and behavioral psychology to develop a comprehensive framework for leveraging mobile technology in health promotion. We analyze the effectiveness of various mobile interventions, including smartphone applications and wearable devices, in encouraging sustained physical activity and positive health behaviors. Additionally, we investigate the role of personalization and cultural relevance in enhancing user engagement and long-term adherence to health promotion programs. Our findings highlight the promising potential of mobile technology in public health promotion and offer insights for developing more effective, user-centered digital health interventions."}
