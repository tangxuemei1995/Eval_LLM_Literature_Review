{"Abstract": "Health misinformation has become a significant public health concern, potentially exacerbating existing health disparities. This review examines the relationship between exposure to health misinformation and its impact on health disparities, with a focus on the role of structural racism and misperceptions in shaping health behaviors. We analyze current literature to identify patterns of misinformation exposure across different demographic groups and explore how these patterns contribute to disparate health outcomes. Our findings suggest that marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by health misinformation, often due to limited access to accurate health information and pre-existing distrust in healthcare systems. We discuss potential interventions to address this issue, including targeted health literacy programs and culturally sensitive communication strategies. By understanding the complex interplay between misinformation and health disparities, policymakers and healthcare professionals can develop more effective approaches to combat health inequities and promote equitable access to accurate health information."}
