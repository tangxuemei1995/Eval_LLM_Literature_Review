{"Abstract": "The era of mass incarceration in the United States has brought unprecedented challenges to public health within correctional facilities. This paper examines the critical intersection of public health and the prison system, highlighting the urgent need for reform in the age of mass incarceration. We analyze the health disparities faced by incarcerated populations, including higher rates of chronic diseases, mental health disorders, and infectious diseases. The overcrowding and substandard living conditions in many prisons exacerbate these health issues, creating a public health crisis that extends beyond prison walls. We argue that addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including improved healthcare services within prisons, better coordination with community health systems, and policies aimed at decarceration. By prioritizing public health in correctional settings, we can not only improve the well-being of incarcerated individuals but also contribute to broader public health goals and reduce recidivism rates. This paper underscores the importance of viewing correctional health as an integral component of public health policy and practice."}
