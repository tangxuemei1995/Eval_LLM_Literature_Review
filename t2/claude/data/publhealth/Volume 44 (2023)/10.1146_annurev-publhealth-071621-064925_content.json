{"Abstract": "Environmental justice has emerged as a critical field addressing the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities. This review examines the historical development of environmental justice, tracing its roots in the civil rights movement and its evolution into a multifaceted discipline. We explore key milestones, including the recognition of environmental racism and its impact on racial health disparities. The paper analyzes the role of structural racism in perpetuating environmental inequities and discusses the intersection of environmental justice with public health, urban planning, and policy-making. Furthermore, we investigate the growing influence of health advocacy and activism in shaping the environmental justice landscape. Looking ahead, we consider potential future directions for the field, including the integration of climate justice, the application of new technologies for monitoring and mitigation, and the expansion of environmental justice principles into global contexts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of environmental justice's past achievements and potential future trajectories."}
