{"Abstract": "This study investigates boson-boson interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), focusing on diboson production and vector boson scattering processes. We analyze data from proton-proton collisions at âˆšs = 13 TeV, collected by the ATLAS and CMS detectors. The research examines various final states, including WW, WZ, and ZZ pairs, as well as same-sign WW production. We present cross-section measurements and compare them with Standard Model predictions, finding good agreement within uncertainties. Additionally, we explore the sensitivity to anomalous triple and quartic gauge couplings, setting new constraints on potential deviations from the electroweak theory. Our results provide crucial insights into the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and test the Standard Model at the highest accessible energies. This work contributes to the ongoing search for new physics phenomena and improves our understanding of fundamental particle interactions at the TeV scale."}
