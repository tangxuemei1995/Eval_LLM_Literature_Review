{"Abstract": "This review explores the interactions of high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos, focusing on their implications for neutrino astrophysics. We examine the theoretical foundations and experimental observations of neutrino interactions across a wide energy spectrum, from GeV to EeV scales. The paper discusses various detection techniques, including underground detectors, ice-based observatories, and radio detection methods. We analyze the challenges in measuring neutrino cross-sections at extreme energies and their potential to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, we consider the role of neutrino interactions in understanding cosmic ray origins and the high-energy universe."}
