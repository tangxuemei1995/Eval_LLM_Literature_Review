{"Abstract": "Low-energy nuclear recoils play a crucial role in dark matter and neutrino scattering experiments. This study presents novel techniques for detecting and calibrating these recoils in the context of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter searches. We employ neutron scattering as a proxy for low-energy nuclear recoils, developing a high-precision calibration method for sub-keV energy depositions. Our approach combines advanced detector technologies with sophisticated data analysis algorithms to achieve unprecedented sensitivity. We demonstrate improved discrimination between nuclear and electronic recoils, crucial for background reduction in rare event searches. The calibration technique is validated across multiple target materials relevant to current and future experiments. Our findings significantly enhance the ability to detect and characterize low-energy nuclear recoils, potentially leading to breakthroughs in dark matter detection and neutrino physics."}
