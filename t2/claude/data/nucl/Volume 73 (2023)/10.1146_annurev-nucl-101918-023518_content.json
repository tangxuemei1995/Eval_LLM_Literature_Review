{"Abstract": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) has made significant strides in neutrino physics by observing coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). This process, predicted by the Standard Model but previously undetected, provides a unique window into neutrino interactions and has implications for supernova neutrino detection and dark matter searches. The experiment utilizes the intense, pulsed neutrino flux from the SNS to study CEvNS across multiple nuclear targets. Results from COHERENT have not only confirmed theoretical predictions but also opened new avenues for probing physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiment's success demonstrates the potential for using CEvNS as a tool for investigating fundamental particle physics and astrophysical phenomena, while also contributing to our understanding of neutrino properties and interactions at low energies."}
