{"Abstract": "Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has emerged as a crucial field for understanding the most extreme astrophysical phenomena in the universe. This review explores recent advancements in detecting and studying gamma rays with energies exceeding 1 PeV, focusing on the search for cosmic PeVatrons and their role in cosmic ray acceleration. We discuss the latest observations from facilities such as the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), which has detected photons above 1 PeV from the Crab Nebula, providing compelling evidence for the existence of Galactic PeVatrons. The paper examines the techniques used in extensive air shower detection and the importance of muon content analysis in distinguishing gamma-ray-induced showers from hadronic backgrounds. We analyze the implications of these discoveries for our understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms in extreme environments and their connection to the origin of high-energy cosmic rays. Furthermore, we explore the challenges and future prospects in ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, including proposed next-generation observatories and their potential to revolutionize our knowledge of the high-energy universe. This review synthesizes current findings and outlines the path forward in this rapidly evolving field of astrophysics."}
