{"Abstract": "This review explores physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) associated with the top quark. We examine the top quark's potential role in addressing fundamental questions in particle physics, including the hierarchy problem, flavor physics, and dark matter. The unique properties of the top quark, such as its large mass and strong coupling to the Higgs boson, make it a prime candidate for probing New Physics scenarios. We discuss various BSM models that predict new particles or interactions involving the top quark, and their implications for current and future experiments. Additionally, we review recent experimental results and their constraints on BSM theories, highlighting the importance of top quark physics in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model."}
