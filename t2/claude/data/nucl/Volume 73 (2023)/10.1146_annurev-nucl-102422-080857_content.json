{"Abstract": "The s-process, responsible for synthesizing about half of the elements heavier than iron, has been a cornerstone of nuclear astrophysics for decades. This review examines recent advancements in our understanding of the s-process and explores its implications beyond traditional models. We discuss new insights from stellar spectroscopy, meteoritic anomalies, and theoretical models of AGB and massive stars. Recent observations have challenged long-held assumptions about neutron sources and nucleosynthesis sites. We highlight the interplay between nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations in refining s-process models. Furthermore, we explore how the s-process connects to other nucleosynthesis mechanisms, providing a more comprehensive picture of elemental production in the universe. This synthesis of current research underscores the continuing importance of s-process studies in unraveling cosmic chemical evolution."}
