{"Abstract": "This study investigates medium response and jet–hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, focusing on the formation and properties of quark–gluon plasma (QGP). We employ state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations coupled with jet energy loss models to explore jet quenching phenomena and jet-induced medium excitation. Our analysis reveals intricate patterns in jet–hadron correlations, providing insights into the QGP's properties and its interaction with high-energy partons. We observe significant modifications to jet structures and hadron distributions compared to proton-proton collisions, indicating strong medium effects. The results demonstrate a complex interplay between jet energy loss, medium response, and collective flow, highlighting the importance of considering these factors in understanding QGP dynamics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to characterize the QGP and improve our understanding of the fundamental properties of matter under extreme conditions, with implications for both nuclear physics and early universe cosmology."}
