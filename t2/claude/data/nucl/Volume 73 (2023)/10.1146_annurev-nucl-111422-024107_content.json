{"Abstract": "The Hubble tension, a discrepancy between local and early Universe measurements of the Hubble constant, has become a significant challenge in modern cosmology. This review explores the potential role of early dark energy (EDE) in resolving this tension. We examine recent observational data from cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments and large-scale structure surveys, comparing them with theoretical predictions from EDE models. Our analysis reveals that EDE scenarios can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the expansion history of the early Universe. However, we find that current EDE models face challenges in simultaneously fitting all observational constraints. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of dark energy, the expansion of the Universe, and the need for new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of upcoming CMB experiments and galaxy surveys in providing more precise measurements to further constrain EDE models and potentially resolve the Hubble tension. This work underscores the interconnectedness of early Universe physics, dark energy, and cosmic expansion in our quest to unravel the mysteries of cosmology."}
