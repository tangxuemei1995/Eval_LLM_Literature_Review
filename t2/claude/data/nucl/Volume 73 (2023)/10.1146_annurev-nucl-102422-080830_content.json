{"Abstract": "The gauge hierarchy problem, a longstanding issue in particle physics, has gained renewed attention following the discovery of the Higgs boson. This paper presents novel approaches to address the problem, focusing on the concept of naturalness and the stability of the electroweak scale. We explore a range of theoretical frameworks, including relaxation mechanisms, that offer potential solutions to the hierarchy problem. Our analysis incorporates recent experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider and examines the implications for beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each proposed solution, considering their compatibility with existing observations and their predictive power for future experiments. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between these new approaches and other fundamental questions in particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter and the origin of neutrino masses. Our findings suggest promising avenues for further research and highlight the importance of continued experimental efforts in probing the electroweak scale."}
