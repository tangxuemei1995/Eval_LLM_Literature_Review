{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive guide for hunting long-lived particles (LLPs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We review current experimental techniques, theoretical motivations, and potential signatures of LLPs. The study covers various detector subsystems and analysis strategies optimized for LLP searches. We discuss challenges in trigger systems, reconstruction algorithms, and background estimation methods specific to LLP scenarios, providing insights for future LHC experiments and upgrades."}
