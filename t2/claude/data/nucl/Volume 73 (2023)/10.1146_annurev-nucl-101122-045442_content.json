{"Abstract": "This review explores recent developments in lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in b and c meson decays. We examine experimental results from the LHCb collaboration and other particle physics experiments, focusing on anomalies that challenge the Standard Model predictions. The observed deviations in rare B meson decays and ratios of semileptonic decay rates are discussed, along with their implications for new physics models. We analyze potential explanations involving leptoquarks, Z' bosons, and other beyond Standard Model scenarios. The interplay between LFV and LFUV is explored, highlighting the importance of these phenomena in probing the fundamental symmetries of particle interactions and uncovering new physics at the TeV scale."}
