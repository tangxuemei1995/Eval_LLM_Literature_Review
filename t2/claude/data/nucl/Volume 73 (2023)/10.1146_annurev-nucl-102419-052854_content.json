{"Abstract": "The top quark, discovered in 1995, remains a focal point of particle physics research due to its unique properties and potential connections to new physics. This review examines the current state of top quark physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and outlines future prospects. We discuss recent advancements in measuring top quark production cross sections, both in strong and electroweak interactions, and their implications for Standard Model precision tests. The top quark's role in Higgs boson physics is explored, highlighting its significance in constraining Yukawa couplings. We also review the search for beyond Standard Model phenomena in the top quark sector, including rare decays and potential new particles. The paper emphasizes the importance of improved theoretical predictions and experimental techniques in pushing the boundaries of top quark physics. Finally, we present an outlook on the exciting possibilities that future LHC runs and proposed colliders may offer in unraveling the mysteries surrounding the top quark."}
