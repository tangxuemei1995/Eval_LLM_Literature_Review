{"Abstract": "This review summarizes recent advancements in the study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons. We discuss the latest experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, focusing on lattice quantum chromodynamics results for decay constants and form factors. The impact of these findings on the determination of Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix elements is examined. We highlight the role of charm physics in probing lepton flavor universality and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The review also addresses current challenges and future prospects in this field, emphasizing the importance of synergy between experimental and theoretical efforts to further our understanding of charm physics."}
