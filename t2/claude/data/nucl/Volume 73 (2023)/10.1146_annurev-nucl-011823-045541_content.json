{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in accelerator mass spectrometry have enabled the detection of trace radioisotopes in deep-sea sediments and lunar samples, providing compelling evidence for nearby astrophysical explosions. This review examines the latest findings on supernova-produced isotopes and their implications for understanding nucleosynthesis processes. We focus on the r-process elements found in these samples, which offer unique insights into the frequency and proximity of recent supernovae events. The presence of specific radioisotopes in both terrestrial and lunar materials suggests a common origin from stellar explosions within the past few million years. These discoveries not only shed light on the history of our cosmic neighborhood but also contribute to our understanding of element formation in the universe."}
