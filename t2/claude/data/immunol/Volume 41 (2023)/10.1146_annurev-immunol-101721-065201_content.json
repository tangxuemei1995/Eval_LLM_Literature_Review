{"Abstract": "The study of infectious diseases and immunodeficiency has long relied on both mouse models and human genetic studies. This review explores the convergence of mouse and human immunology through the lens of genetics, focusing on genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases and inborn errors of immunity. We examine how advances in genetic technologies have enabled the identification of key immune pathways and susceptibility factors in both species. By comparing and contrasting findings from mouse models and human genetic studies, we highlight the complementary nature of these approaches in elucidating the complex interplay between host genetics and pathogen interactions. We discuss the challenges and limitations of translating mouse immunology findings to human disease, as well as the potential of reverse genetics to validate human discoveries in mouse models. Finally, we propose strategies for integrating mouse and human genetic data to accelerate the development of targeted therapies for infectious diseases and immunodeficiencies, emphasizing the importance of a unified approach in advancing our understanding of immune system function and dysfunction."}
