{"Abstract": "This study investigates T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the context of COVID-19 infection and vaccination. We examined T cell reactivity against various viral epitopes in patients with different disease severities and vaccinated individuals. Our findings reveal that T cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and are largely preserved across multiple variants. We observed that individuals with severe COVID-19 exhibited impaired T cell functionality compared to those with mild disease. Vaccination induced robust and durable T cell responses, which were effective against emerging variants. Additionally, we identified key epitopes that elicit strong T cell responses, providing valuable insights for future vaccine development. Our results highlight the importance of T cell immunity in COVID-19 and suggest that current vaccines offer protection against severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants through T cell-mediated mechanisms."}
