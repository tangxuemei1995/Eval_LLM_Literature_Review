{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study investigates the critical role of type I interferons (IFNs) in COVID-19 pneumonia. We examined genetic and immunological factors in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on inborn errors of type I IFN immunity and neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFNs. Our findings reveal that a significant proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 have impaired type I IFN responses due to genetic defects or autoantibodies. These deficiencies in type I IFN immunity correlate with increased viral replication and exaggerated inflammatory responses. This research provides crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying critical COVID-19 pneumonia and suggests potential therapeutic strategies targeting the type I IFN pathway. Our results underscore the importance of early identification of patients with compromised type I IFN responses to guide personalized treatment approaches and improve clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 cases."}
