{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of highly differentiated T cell subsets in age-related tissue deterioration. As the immune system ages, a process known as immunosenescence occurs, characterized by thymic involution and accumulation of senescent T cells. We examined the phenotypic and functional changes in T cell populations across different age groups and tissues. Our findings reveal an increase in terminally differentiated T cells with age, particularly in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. These cells exhibit reduced proliferative capacity, altered cytokine profiles, and enhanced pro-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the accumulation of these T cell subsets and markers of tissue inflammation and dysfunction. Our results suggest that extremely differentiated T cells contribute significantly to the chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging, potentially driving tissue deterioration and age-related pathologies."}
