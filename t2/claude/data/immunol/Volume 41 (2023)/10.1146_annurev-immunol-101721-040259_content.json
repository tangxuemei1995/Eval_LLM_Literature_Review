{"Abstract": "The field of biomaterials-mediated immune engineering has emerged as a promising approach to enhance immunotherapy and vaccine efficacy. This review explores recent advancements in the design and application of biomaterials for modulating immune responses. We discuss the role of nanoparticles as vaccine adjuvants, highlighting their ability to improve antigen delivery and presentation. The review also examines the use of biomaterials in creating artificial lymphoid organs and engineering the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-cancer immune responses. Furthermore, we analyze the potential of biomaterials in developing personalized immunotherapies and overcoming immune tolerance. The integration of biomaterials with emerging technologies, such as gene editing and artificial intelligence, is explored as a means to further advance the field. Finally, we address the challenges and future directions in translating biomaterials-based immunoengineering strategies from bench to bedside."}
