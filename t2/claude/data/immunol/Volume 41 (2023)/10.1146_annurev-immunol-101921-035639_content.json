{"Abstract": "The complement system, traditionally associated with innate immunity, has emerged as a crucial player in brain function and pathology. This review explores the multifaceted roles of complement proteins, particularly C1q, in the central nervous system. We discuss their involvement in neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation, highlighting the complex interplay between complement components and microglia. The review examines the critical role of complement in synaptic pruning during development and its potential dysregulation in neurodegenerative disorders, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease. We analyze recent findings that shed light on the dual nature of complement activation in the brain, emphasizing its importance in maintaining homeostasis and its potential contribution to neuroinflammatory processes. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the intricate balance of complement function in the brain and its implications for therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders."}
