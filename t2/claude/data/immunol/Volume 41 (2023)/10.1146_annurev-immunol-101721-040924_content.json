{"Abstract": "T cell fate determination is a complex process crucial for immune system function. This study presents a comprehensive mathematical model to elucidate the mechanisms governing T cell differentiation and lineage commitment. By integrating key molecular pathways and environmental factors, we developed a dynamic system that predicts T cell fate outcomes under various conditions. Our model incorporates transcription factor networks, cytokine signaling, and epigenetic modifications to simulate the decision-making process of naive T cells. Validation against experimental data demonstrates the model's accuracy in predicting lineage-specific gene expression patterns and cellular phenotypes. This work provides a valuable tool for understanding T cell biology and may inform strategies for immunotherapy and vaccine development."}
