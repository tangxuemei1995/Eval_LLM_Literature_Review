{"Abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) plays a crucial role in regulating various T cell subsets, including CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), and γδ T cells. This review explores the multifaceted effects of TGF-β on T cell quiescence, activation, differentiation, and function. We discuss how TGF-β influences the balance between effector and regulatory T cell populations, modulates the development and maintenance of tissue-resident T cells, and impacts the innate-like functions of ILCs and γδ T cells. Furthermore, we examine the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-β signaling in different T cell subsets and its implications for immune homeostasis and disease. Understanding the complex interplay between TGF-β and T cells provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune disorders, cancer immunotherapy, and infectious diseases."}
