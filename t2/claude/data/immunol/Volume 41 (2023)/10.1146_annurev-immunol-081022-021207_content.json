{"Abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system, playing a key role in the inflammatory response. This review explores the structural mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical studies have provided unprecedented insights into the intricate molecular interactions involved in this process. We discuss the conformational changes of NLRP3 upon activation, the formation of ASC filaments, and the recruitment and activation of caspase-1. The review highlights the importance of protein-protein interactions, oligomerization, and structural rearrangements in the formation of the active inflammasome complex. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies for inflammatory disorders and may provide new avenues for modulating innate immune responses. We also address the remaining questions and future directions in elucidating the complete structural basis of NLRP3 inflammasome function."}
