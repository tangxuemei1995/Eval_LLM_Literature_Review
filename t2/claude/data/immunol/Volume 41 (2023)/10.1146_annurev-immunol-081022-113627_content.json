{"Abstract": "Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) are crucial precursors of myeloid cells, including monocytes and neutrophils. This review explores the origin, heterogeneity, and tissue-specific adaptations of GMP-derived myeloid cells. We examine recent fate-mapping studies that have shed light on the developmental trajectories of these cells, from their bone marrow origins to their diverse tissue-resident forms. The role of niche-specific factors in shaping myeloid cell phenotypes and functions is discussed, highlighting the remarkable plasticity of these cells. We also address the concept of tissue reprogramming, where local environmental cues can dramatically alter the characteristics of infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils. Understanding these processes is essential for unraveling the complexities of tissue-specific immune responses and developing targeted therapeutic strategies for various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders."}
