{"Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in oncology, with T cells and natural killer (NK) cells playing crucial roles in tumor elimination. This review explores innovative strategies for designing immunotherapies that effectively engage both T cells and NK cells to enhance anti-tumor responses. We discuss recent advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and NK cell-based treatments, highlighting their synergistic potential. The review examines novel approaches to overcome immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and improve cell persistence and functionality. Additionally, we analyze combination therapies that leverage the distinct mechanisms of T cells and NK cells to achieve more robust and durable clinical outcomes. By integrating these cell types, researchers aim to develop more potent and versatile cancer immunotherapies, potentially revolutionizing treatment options for various malignancies."}
