{"Abstract": "This review explores the structural and functional aspects of immunoglobulin E (IgE), its receptors FcεRI and CD23, and anti-IgE biologics in the context of allergic responses. We examine the unique structural features of IgE that contribute to its high-affinity binding to FcεRI and the lower-affinity interaction with CD23. The allosteric mechanisms governing these interactions are discussed, highlighting their role in modulating IgE-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, we analyze the protein structures and mechanisms of action of anti-IgE biologics, such as omalizumab, which have revolutionized the treatment of allergic diseases. By inhibiting IgE binding to its receptors, these therapeutics effectively suppress allergic cascades. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the molecular basis of IgE-mediated allergic reactions and the rational design of novel anti-allergy treatments targeting the IgE-receptor axis."}
