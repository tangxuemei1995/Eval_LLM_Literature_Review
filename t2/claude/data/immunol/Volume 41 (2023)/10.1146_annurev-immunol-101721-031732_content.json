{"Abstract": "Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is a crucial component of plant innate immunity, representing a sophisticated defense mechanism against pathogenic invaders. This review explores the intricate interplay between ETI and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the context of plant-pathogen interactions. We discuss how ETI evolved as a secondary line of defense, complementing PAMP-triggered immunity, and its role in recognizing pathogen virulence factors. The concept of guard immunity is examined, highlighting how plants monitor the integrity of their own cellular components to detect pathogen interference. We also delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying ETI activation, including the recognition of effectors by plant resistance proteins and the subsequent signaling cascades. Furthermore, we address the evolutionary arms race between plants and pathogens, emphasizing the dynamic nature of ETI and its implications for crop protection strategies. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex world of plant immunity and its potential applications in agriculture."}
