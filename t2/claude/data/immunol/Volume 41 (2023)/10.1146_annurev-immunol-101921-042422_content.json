{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens. While interferon (IFN) signaling has long been recognized as a central player in SLE pathogenesis, recent research has uncovered additional mechanisms contributing to disease progression. This review explores the multifaceted nature of SLE pathogenesis, focusing on the interplay between interferon signaling, aberrant cell death processes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extrafollicular B cell responses. We discuss how dysregulated cell death, particularly in the context of impaired clearance of apoptotic debris, leads to the accumulation of nuclear antigens and subsequent autoantibody production. Furthermore, we examine the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in promoting oxidative stress and inflammation, exacerbating the autoimmune response. The review also highlights the importance of extrafollicular B cell activation in the rapid production of pathogenic autoantibodies. By integrating these diverse pathways, we provide a comprehensive overview of SLE pathogenesis, emphasizing the need for targeted therapeutic approaches that address multiple aspects of the disease process beyond interferon signaling alone."}
