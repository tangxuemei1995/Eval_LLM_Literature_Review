{"Abstract": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key cytokines in type 2 immune responses, playing crucial roles in wound repair and tissue regeneration. This review explores the multifaceted functions of IL-4 and IL-13 in regulating inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and tissue repair processes. We discuss their involvement in the orchestration of immune responses to tissue injury and helminth infections, highlighting the evolutionary significance of these pathways. The review examines the cellular sources of IL-4 and IL-13, their signaling mechanisms, and downstream effects on various cell types involved in wound healing. Additionally, we analyze the potential therapeutic applications of modulating IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in chronic wounds, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions characterized by dysregulated tissue repair. Understanding the intricate roles of these cytokines in wound repair may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for promoting optimal tissue regeneration and preventing excessive scarring."}
