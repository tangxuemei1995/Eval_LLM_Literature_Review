{"Abstract": "Inflammatory anemia is a complex condition characterized by reduced erythrocyte production and increased destruction, often associated with chronic diseases. This review explores the immune mechanisms underlying various forms of inflammatory anemia, focusing on hemophagocytosis, malaria-induced anemia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We examine the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, macrophage activation, and dysregulated iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Additionally, we discuss the unique immune-mediated complications in sickle cell anemia, which exacerbate anemia severity. Recent advances in understanding the interplay between inflammation and erythropoiesis are highlighted, along with potential therapeutic targets for managing inflammatory anemia. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the intricate immune processes involved in these disorders and paves the way for novel treatment strategies."}
