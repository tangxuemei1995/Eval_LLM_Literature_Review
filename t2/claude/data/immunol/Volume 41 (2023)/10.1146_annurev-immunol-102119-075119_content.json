{"Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial component of the innate immune system, playing a significant role in reproductive processes within the human uterine mucosa. This review explores the unique characteristics and functions of uterine NK (uNK) cells, focusing on their interactions with trophoblasts and their presence in the decidua during pregnancy. uNK cells exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional properties compared to peripheral blood NK cells, contributing to successful implantation, placentation, and fetal development. We examine the mechanisms by which uNK cells regulate trophoblast invasion, spiral artery remodeling, and immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface. Additionally, we discuss the potential implications of uNK cell dysfunction in reproductive disorders and pregnancy complications. Understanding the complex interplay between uNK cells and other cellular components of the uterine microenvironment is essential for advancing our knowledge of reproductive immunology and developing targeted therapies for fertility-related issues."}
