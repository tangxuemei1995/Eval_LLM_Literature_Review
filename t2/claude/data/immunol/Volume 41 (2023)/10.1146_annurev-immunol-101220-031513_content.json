{"Abstract": "Systems immunology approaches have revolutionized our understanding of the complex interplay between the immune system and metabolism. This review explores the integration of computational biology, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metabolic imaging techniques to unravel the intricacies of immunometabolism. We discuss how these cutting-edge methodologies have enabled researchers to map metabolic networks, identify key regulatory pathways, and elucidate the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells during various physiological and pathological states. The application of machine learning algorithms and multi-omics data integration has provided unprecedented insights into the metabolic signatures of immune cell subsets and their functional states. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of these systems-level approaches in developing novel therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated diseases and cancer immunotherapy. This comprehensive overview underscores the transformative impact of systems immunology on our understanding of metabolic regulation in immune responses."}
