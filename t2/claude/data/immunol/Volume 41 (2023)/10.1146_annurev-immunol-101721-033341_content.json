{"Abstract": "Endogenous retroelements, including endogenous retroviruses, represent a significant portion of the human genome and pose a unique challenge to the immune system. This review explores the complex interplay between these ancient viral remnants and host immunity. We examine how endogenous retroelements can trigger innate immune responses, particularly through interferon signaling pathways, while simultaneously evading complete elimination. The role of adaptive immunity in controlling retroelement expression is discussed, highlighting the delicate balance between tolerance and autoimmunity. Recent findings suggest that some endogenous retroelements may have been co-opted for beneficial functions in host defense. Understanding these intricate relationships is crucial for unraveling the evolutionary history of the human genome and may provide insights into autoimmune disorders, cancer, and novel therapeutic approaches. This review synthesizes current knowledge and identifies key areas for future research in this rapidly evolving field."}
