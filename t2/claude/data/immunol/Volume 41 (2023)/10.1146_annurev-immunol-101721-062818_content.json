{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between the immune system and epithelial tissues plays a crucial role in tissue regeneration and repair. This review explores the complex mechanisms underlying immune-epithelial cross talk and its implications for inflammatory diseases and tissue homeostasis. We examine how various immune cell populations, including macrophages, T cells, and innate lymphoid cells, interact with epithelial stem cells to orchestrate regenerative processes. The role of cytokines, growth factors, and other signaling molecules in mediating this communication is discussed. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the local microenvironment and extracellular matrix in shaping immune responses and epithelial cell behavior. Understanding these interactions provides valuable insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for enhancing tissue repair and treating inflammatory disorders. This review synthesizes recent advances in the field and identifies key areas for future research to further elucidate the complex relationship between immunity and epithelial regeneration."}
