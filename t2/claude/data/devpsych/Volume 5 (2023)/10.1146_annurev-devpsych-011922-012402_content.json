{"Abstract": "This review examines the current state of research on the impact of poverty on brain development and mental health outcomes. We synthesize findings from neuroimaging studies and developmental psychopathology research to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms through which early-life adversity influences cognitive and emotional functioning. The paper highlights significant progress in understanding the neural correlates of poverty-related stress and their associations with psychopathology. However, we also address critical challenges in the field, including issues of replicability and reproducibility in neuroimaging studies. We discuss methodological limitations and propose strategies to enhance the robustness and generalizability of findings. Finally, we outline promising avenues for future research and interventions, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and translational efforts to mitigate the detrimental effects of poverty on brain development and mental health across the lifespan."}
