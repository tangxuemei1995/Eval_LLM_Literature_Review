{"Abstract": "This review integrates research on cognitive mechanisms and socialization processes underlying children's racial learning. We examine how children develop racial awareness, attitudes, and categorization abilities from early childhood through adolescence. Key cognitive factors include perceptual differentiation, essentialism, and in-group preferences. Socialization influences encompass parental ethnic-racial socialization practices, peer interactions, media exposure, and broader cultural messages. We highlight the interplay between cognitive development and social experiences in shaping racial cognition. Additionally, we consider how contextual factors like neighborhood demographics and school diversity impact racial learning trajectories. Gaps in current understanding and promising directions for future research are identified, including the need for more longitudinal studies and research on intersectionality. This integrative approach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex, multifaceted nature of children's racial learning across development."}
