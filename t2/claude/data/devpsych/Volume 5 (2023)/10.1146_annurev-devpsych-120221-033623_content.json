{"Abstract": "The fields of life-course epidemiology and causal inference have developed largely in parallel, leading to tensions in methodological approaches and interpretation of findings. This paper aims to bridge the divide between these two disciplines, highlighting their complementary strengths and potential for synergy. We review key concepts from both fields, including the importance of temporal ordering in life-course epidemiology and the emphasis on clearly defined interventions in causal inference. We propose a framework for integrating these approaches, leveraging natural experiments and advanced quantitative methods to strengthen causal claims in life-course research. The paper discusses challenges in harmonizing these perspectives, such as balancing long-term trajectories with point interventions, and offers solutions for researchers. By fostering collaboration between life-course epidemiologists and causal inference experts, we can enhance our understanding of complex health phenomena across the lifespan and inform more effective interventions and policies."}
