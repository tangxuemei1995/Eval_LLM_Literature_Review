{"Abstract": "This study investigates the developmental origins of anxiety through a two-hit model of behavioral inhibition. We hypothesized that early behavioral inhibition in infancy, combined with later environmental stressors during adolescence, significantly increases the risk of anxiety disorders. Longitudinal data from 500 participants were collected from infancy through adolescence, assessing behavioral inhibition, environmental factors, and anxiety symptoms. Results revealed that individuals exhibiting high behavioral inhibition in infancy were more susceptible to anxiety when exposed to significant stressors during adolescence. This two-hit model explained 35% of the variance in anxiety outcomes, surpassing single-factor models. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both early temperamental traits and later environmental influences in understanding the etiology of anxiety disorders, potentially informing targeted interventions for at-risk individuals."}
