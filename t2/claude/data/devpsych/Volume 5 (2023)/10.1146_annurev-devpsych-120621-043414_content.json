{"Abstract": "Prenatal substance exposure represents a significant form of early adversity that can profoundly impact developmental outcomes. This review synthesizes current research on the effects of maternal substance use during pregnancy on fetal development and long-term child outcomes. We examine a range of substances, including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and opioids, and their differential impacts on cognitive, behavioral, and physiological development. The complex interplay between prenatal substance exposure and other forms of prenatal adversity is explored, highlighting the cumulative risks faced by exposed children. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in isolating the effects of specific substances due to polysubstance use and confounding environmental factors. The review emphasizes the need for early intervention strategies and supportive environments to mitigate the potential negative consequences of prenatal substance exposure and promote resilience in affected children."}
