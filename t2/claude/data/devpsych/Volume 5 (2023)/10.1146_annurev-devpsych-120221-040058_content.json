{"Abstract": "This paper presents a rational account of cognitive control development in childhood, integrating theories of competence, maturation, and expected value. We propose that cognitive control abilities emerge through a dynamic interplay between neural maturation and experience-dependent learning, guided by the principle of maximizing expected value. Our model suggests that children's cognitive control improves as they learn to accurately predict the outcomes of their actions and optimize their behavior accordingly. We review evidence from neuroimaging and behavioral studies supporting this account, demonstrating age-related changes in prefrontal cortex activation and performance on cognitive control tasks. The framework explains developmental trajectories across various domains, including inhibitory control, task switching, and working memory. By considering cognitive control development as a rational process, we provide a unifying explanation for both gradual improvements and apparent discontinuities in children's executive functioning. This approach offers new insights into individual differences in cognitive control development and potential interventions to support children's executive skills."}
