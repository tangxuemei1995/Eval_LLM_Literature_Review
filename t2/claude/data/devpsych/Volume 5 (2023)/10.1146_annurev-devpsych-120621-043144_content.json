{"Abstract": "This review examines the current understanding of the functioning of offspring of depressed parents, highlighting unresolved issues and future research directions. We synthesize findings from psychobiological studies, neuroimaging research on brain structure, and recent investigations into the impact of COVID-19 on this vulnerable population. The literature consistently demonstrates that children of depressed parents face increased risks for various psychological and developmental challenges. However, gaps remain in our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and long-term outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests alterations in brain structure and function may play a crucial role in intergenerational transmission of depression. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the landscape, potentially exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies, gene-environment interactions, and targeted interventions to mitigate risks and promote resilience in offspring of depressed parents."}
