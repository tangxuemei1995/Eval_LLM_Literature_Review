{"Abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics of emotion regulation in romantic couples across different stages of adulthood. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined how emotion regulation strategies evolve and impact relationship satisfaction as couples age. Participants included 150 heterosexual couples, divided into three age groups: young (25-40), middle-aged (41-60), and older adults (61+). Data were collected through self-report questionnaires, daily diaries, and laboratory-based interaction tasks. Results revealed that older couples demonstrated more effective emotion regulation strategies, characterized by increased use of cognitive reappraisal and decreased reliance on suppression. Additionally, emotion co-regulation between partners became more synchronized with age, contributing to higher relationship satisfaction. These findings highlight the importance of considering developmental factors in understanding emotion regulation within romantic relationships and suggest potential avenues for interventions aimed at enhancing couple well-being across the lifespan."}
