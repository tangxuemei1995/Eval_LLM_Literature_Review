{"Abstract": "This review explores the intersection of developmental social neuroscience and infant autism interventions, offering a novel perspective on early detection and treatment strategies. By integrating recent advances in neuroimaging techniques with behavioral observations, researchers have gained unprecedented insights into the developing autistic brain. This paper synthesizes findings from longitudinal studies tracking neural and behavioral changes in high-risk infants, highlighting potential biomarkers for early autism diagnosis. We discuss how these neuroscientific insights inform the design and implementation of targeted interventions, emphasizing the importance of timing and specificity in treatment approaches. The review also examines the role of neuroplasticity in early intervention outcomes, suggesting that capitalizing on critical periods of brain development may enhance the efficacy of autism treatments. By adopting a developmental social neuroscience framework, this paper aims to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical practice, paving the way for more effective, personalized interventions for infants at risk for autism spectrum disorders."}
