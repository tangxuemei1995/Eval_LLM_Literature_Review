{"Abstract": "This paper presents a neuroecosocial perspective on adolescent development, integrating neuroscience, ecological systems theory, and social determinants of health. We explore how youth-led methods can enhance our understanding of adolescent mental health in the context of social inequalities, urbanicity, and the climate crisis. Drawing on recent literature, we examine the complex interplay between neurobiological changes, environmental factors, and societal challenges that shape adolescent well-being. Our analysis reveals that urbanization and climate-related stressors significantly impact youth mental health, particularly among marginalized populations. We argue that incorporating youth voices and participatory approaches in research and policy-making is crucial for developing effective interventions. This interdisciplinary framework offers new insights into the multifaceted nature of adolescent development and provides a foundation for addressing the unique challenges faced by today's youth in an increasingly complex world."}
