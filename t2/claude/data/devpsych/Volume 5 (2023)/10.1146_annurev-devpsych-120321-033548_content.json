{"Abstract": "This study investigates how infants perceive and interpret third-party helping interactions, shedding light on the development of social cognition in early childhood. Through a series of experiments involving 6- to 18-month-old infants, we examined their ability to attribute goals to agents engaged in helping behaviors and their expectations regarding prosocial actions. Using eye-tracking technology and looking time paradigms, we presented infants with various scenarios depicting helping interactions between animated characters. Results indicate that infants as young as 6 months can distinguish between helping and hindering actions, showing a preference for helpers. By 12 months, infants demonstrate more sophisticated understanding, expecting agents to act consistently with previously observed helping behaviors. Furthermore, 18-month-olds exhibited signs of goal attribution to both helpers and helpees, suggesting a more nuanced comprehension of the social dynamics involved in helping interactions. These findings contribute to our understanding of the early emergence of social cognition and prosocial expectations in infants, highlighting the importance of third-party observations in shaping infants' understanding of social relationships and moral behavior. The study has implications for theories of social cognitive development and may inform interventions aimed at fostering prosocial behavior in early childhood."}
