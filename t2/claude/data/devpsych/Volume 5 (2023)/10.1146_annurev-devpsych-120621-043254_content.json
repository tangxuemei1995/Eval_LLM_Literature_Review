{"Abstract": "This review examines the efficacy of early socioemotional interventions targeting the parent-infant relationship. We analyze a range of interventions designed to enhance parental sensitivity and promote secure attachment in infants. The literature reveals that interventions implemented during the first year of life can significantly improve parent-infant interactions and infant socioemotional outcomes. Effective programs typically involve video feedback, psychoeducation, and guided parent-infant activities. Short-term interventions show promise in enhancing parental sensitivity, while longer-term programs demonstrate more robust effects on infant attachment security. Notably, interventions tailored to high-risk populations, such as mothers with postpartum depression or families facing socioeconomic adversity, yield particularly encouraging results. This review underscores the importance of early intervention in shaping the foundation of socioemotional development and highlights the potential for preventive approaches in promoting healthy parent-infant relationships and long-term child well-being."}
