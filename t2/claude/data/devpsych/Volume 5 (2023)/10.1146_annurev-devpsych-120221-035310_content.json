{"Abstract": "Cognitive flexibility, a crucial component of executive function, undergoes significant development throughout childhood and adolescence. This review synthesizes recent neuroimaging findings on the neurodevelopmental trajectory of cognitive flexibility, focusing on task-based functional MRI studies. We examine how brain activation patterns and connectivity change with age during cognitive flexibility tasks, highlighting the roles of prefrontal, parietal, and subcortical regions. The review also explores individual differences in cognitive flexibility development and their neural correlates. Additionally, we discuss methodological advances in developmental neuroimaging and their implications for understanding cognitive flexibility. Finally, we outline future research directions, including the need for longitudinal studies, investigation of environmental influences, and integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities. This comprehensive update provides insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility development and offers a roadmap for future research in this dynamic field."}
