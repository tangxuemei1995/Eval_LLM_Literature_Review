{"Abstract": "This review explores the neurodevelopmental processes underlying attention, learning, and memory systems during infancy. We examine the rapid changes in brain structure and function that occur in the first years of life, focusing on the maturation of neural networks crucial for cognitive development. The paper synthesizes recent findings from neuroimaging studies, behavioral assessments, and longitudinal research to provide a comprehensive overview of infant neurodevelopment. We discuss the emergence of selective attention, the development of working memory capacity, and the formation of early learning mechanisms. Additionally, we explore the interplay between these cognitive domains and their impact on later cognitive outcomes. The review highlights the importance of early experiences in shaping neural circuits and emphasizes the plasticity of the infant brain. Understanding these developmental trajectories may inform early interventions and contribute to optimizing cognitive outcomes in children."}
