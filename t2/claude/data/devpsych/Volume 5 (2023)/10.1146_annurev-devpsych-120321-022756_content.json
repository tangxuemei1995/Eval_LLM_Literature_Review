{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay between social identities and intersectionality in youth development, employing a mixed-methods approach and drawing from interdisciplinary perspectives. Grounded in critical race theory, the research investigates how multiple, intersecting identities shape young people's experiences and developmental trajectories. The study combines quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews and focus groups, involving a diverse sample of adolescents aged 13-18. Findings reveal the dynamic nature of identity formation, highlighting the importance of considering intersectionality in understanding youth development. Results demonstrate how factors such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, and sexuality interact to influence young people's self-perception, social relationships, and future aspirations. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on intersectionality and youth development, offering insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners working with diverse youth populations. By bridging theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches, this research advances our understanding of the 'what' and 'how' of identity development in an increasingly complex social landscape."}
