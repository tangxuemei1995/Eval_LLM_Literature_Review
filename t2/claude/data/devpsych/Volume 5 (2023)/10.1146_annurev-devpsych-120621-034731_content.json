{"Abstract": "This study explores the developmental trajectory of children's acquisition and application of social norms. Drawing on research in norm psychology and social-cognitive development, we investigate how young children internalize, understand, and enforce normative behaviors. Through a series of experiments with children aged 3-7, we examine their ability to distinguish between moral and conventional norms, their propensity to enforce norms on others, and their flexibility in applying norms across different contexts. Results indicate that children as young as 3 demonstrate a basic understanding of norms, with increasing sophistication in norm application and enforcement as they age. Our findings suggest that norm acquisition is a fundamental aspect of early social-cognitive development, playing a crucial role in children's moral reasoning and social interactions. This research contributes to our understanding of the origins of human normativity and has implications for theories of moral development and social learning."}
