{"Abstract": "The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has emerged as a fascinating model organism for studying healthy aging and longevity. This eusocial rodent exhibits exceptional resistance to cancer, remarkable longevity, and unique adaptations to its subterranean habitat. This review explores the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the naked mole-rat's extraordinary traits, including its enhanced DNA repair mechanisms, hypoxia tolerance, and social structure. We examine how these adaptations contribute to the species' extended healthspan and potential implications for human aging research. Furthermore, we discuss the role of genomic stability, oxidative stress resistance, and proteostasis in the naked mole-rat's cancer resistance and longevity. By understanding the unique biology of this species, researchers aim to uncover novel insights into the aging process and potential therapeutic targets for age-related diseases in humans."}
