{"Abstract": "Understanding the maintenance of recessive lethal variation in natural populations remains a fundamental challenge in evolutionary genetics. This study investigates the relative contributions of mutation–selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in preserving lethal alleles. We employ a combination of theoretical modeling and empirical data analysis from diverse species to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this genetic paradox. Our findings suggest that while mutation–selection balance plays a significant role, it alone cannot fully explain observed lethal allele frequencies. We demonstrate that heterozygote advantage, particularly in the context of supergenes, and associative overdominance due to linked selection contribute substantially to the persistence of lethal variants. Furthermore, we explore how population structure and demographic history influence these processes. This integrative approach provides new insights into the complex interplay of evolutionary forces shaping genetic diversity and has important implications for conservation genetics and the management of genetic load in populations."}
