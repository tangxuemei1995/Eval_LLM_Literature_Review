{"Abstract": "This review explores the critical role of domestic animals as potential reservoirs for zoonotic viral diseases, encompassing both emerging and endemic pathogens. The increasing frequency of zoonotic outbreaks and their potential to escalate into pandemics underscore the importance of understanding the complex interactions between humans, animals, and their shared environments. We examine various domestic species, including livestock and companion animals, as reservoir hosts for viral pathogens capable of crossing species barriers. The review highlights the significance of surveillance, early detection, and intervention strategies within the One Health framework to mitigate the risks associated with zoonotic transmission. By elucidating the mechanisms of viral persistence and adaptation in domestic animal populations, this study aims to inform evidence-based policies and practices for preventing and controlling zoonotic threats, ultimately safeguarding both animal and human health."}
