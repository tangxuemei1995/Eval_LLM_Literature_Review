{"Abstract": "Insect populations worldwide are experiencing alarming declines, prompting urgent conservation efforts. This review explores the application of population genomics in insect conservation, highlighting its potential to revolutionize our understanding of genetic adaptation and species vulnerability. We discuss recent advances in genome assembly techniques that have made genomic studies more accessible for non-model insect species. These tools enable researchers to investigate genetic diversity, local adaptation, and the accumulation of deleterious mutations in declining populations. We examine how genomic data can inform conservation strategies by identifying populations at risk, guiding captive breeding programs, and predicting species' responses to environmental changes. The review also addresses challenges in applying genomic approaches to insect conservation, including limited reference genomes and difficulties in sampling rare species. Finally, we propose future directions for integrating population genomics with other disciplines to enhance insect conservation efforts. By leveraging the power of genomics, conservationists can develop more effective, targeted interventions to mitigate insect declines and preserve biodiversity in the face of global environmental change."}
