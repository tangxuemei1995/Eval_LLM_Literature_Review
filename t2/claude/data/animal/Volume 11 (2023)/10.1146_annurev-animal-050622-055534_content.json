{"Abstract": "This study investigates genetic risk factors associated with monogenic and complex diseases in Canis lupus familiaris, aiming to advance veterinary medicine and contribute to the One Health approach. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing and genome-wide association studies, we identified novel genetic variants linked to various canine disorders. Our findings provide insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, enhancing precision medicine for dogs. Moreover, the study highlights the value of canine models in understanding analogous human diseases, supporting translational research efforts. By elucidating the genetic basis of canine diseases, this research contributes to improved diagnostic tools, targeted treatments, and breeding strategies, ultimately benefiting both animal and human health within the One Health framework."}
