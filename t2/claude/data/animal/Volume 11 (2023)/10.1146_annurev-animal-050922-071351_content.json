{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors, focusing on non-osteichthyan genomes, particularly those of cartilaginous fishes and cyclostomes. By analyzing genomic data from these ancient lineages, we gain valuable insights into the origins and diversification of key hormonal systems, including leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin. Our findings reveal unexpected patterns of conservation and innovation in hormone-receptor pairs across vertebrate evolution. We identify several instances of lineage-specific gene duplications and losses, shedding light on the adaptive significance of these hormonal systems in different vertebrate groups. Furthermore, our results suggest that some hormone-receptor interactions may have emerged earlier in vertebrate evolution than previously thought. This research contributes to our understanding of the molecular basis of endocrine function and provides a framework for future comparative studies of vertebrate hormonal systems."}
