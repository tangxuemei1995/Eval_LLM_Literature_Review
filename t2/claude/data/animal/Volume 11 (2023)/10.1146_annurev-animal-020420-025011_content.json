{"Abstract": "The emergence of novel human-infecting coronaviruses poses significant global health challenges. This review explores the critical role of animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission in understanding and mitigating the threat of emerging coronaviruses. We examine the latest research on animal models used to study coronavirus pathogenesis and evaluate potential therapeutics. The importance of identifying and monitoring zoonotic reservoirs is highlighted, emphasizing the need for comprehensive surveillance programs in wildlife populations. We analyze the mechanisms of cross-species transmission, including genetic recombination events that facilitate viral adaptation to new hosts. The review also discusses the significance of bat and rodent species as primary reservoirs for coronaviruses and their potential for future spillover events. By synthesizing current knowledge on these interconnected aspects, we provide insights into the complex dynamics of coronavirus emergence and propose strategies for improved preparedness and response to future outbreaks."}
