{"Abstract": "Biologging and biotelemetry have revolutionized our understanding of marine animal behavior and ecology. These technologies enable researchers to remotely collect high-resolution data on animal movements, physiology, and environmental conditions. This review synthesizes recent advances in biologging and biotelemetry applications for studying marine animals. We explore how these tools have enhanced our knowledge of movement ecology, field physiology, predator-prey interactions, and social behaviors in various marine species. Additionally, we discuss the role of biologging in assessing the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on marine ecosystems. The integration of biologging data with other research methods, such as environmental monitoring and genomics, is highlighted as a promising approach for comprehensive ecosystem studies. We conclude by addressing current challenges and future directions in biologging research, emphasizing the need for standardized data sharing and ethical considerations in device deployment."}
