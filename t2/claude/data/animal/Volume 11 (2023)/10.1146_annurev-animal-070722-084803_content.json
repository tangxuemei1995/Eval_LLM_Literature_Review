{"Abstract": "Wildlife crime poses a significant threat to global biodiversity, yet prosecuting poachers remains challenging due to limited forensic evidence. This study examines the role of animal victims in courtroom proceedings, focusing on the admissibility and effectiveness of DNA evidence in wildlife crime cases. Through a comprehensive analysis of legal precedents and forensic techniques, we explore how advances in DNA analysis have improved the ability to link suspects to poached animals. Our findings reveal that while DNA evidence has become increasingly accepted in courts, challenges persist in chain of custody and sample contamination. We also identify best practices for collecting and presenting animal-based evidence, highlighting the importance of standardized protocols. This research contributes to the growing field of wildlife forensics and offers practical recommendations for strengthening legal cases against poachers."}
