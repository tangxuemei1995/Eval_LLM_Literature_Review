{"Abstract": "Deleterious mutations pose a significant threat to the long-term survival of natural populations, particularly those of conservation concern. This study investigates the accumulation and impact of deleterious variation in small and fragmented populations, utilizing advanced genomic techniques and simulation models. We examine the interplay between genetic drift, selection, and inbreeding depression across various demographic scenarios. Our findings reveal that the genetic load increases more rapidly in populations with reduced effective size, potentially accelerating extinction risk. Furthermore, we demonstrate that purging of deleterious alleles is less efficient in small populations, exacerbating the effects of inbreeding depression. These results have important implications for conservation genetics, highlighting the need for management strategies that maintain genetic diversity and minimize the accumulation of harmful mutations in endangered species."}
