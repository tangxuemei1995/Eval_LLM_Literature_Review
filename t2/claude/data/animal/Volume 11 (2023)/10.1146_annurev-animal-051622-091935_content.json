{"Abstract": "This review explores the integration of Indigenous perspectives in animal biosciences, focusing on American Indian and Native American knowledge systems. The study examines the potential contributions of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to modern animal sciences and the One Health approach. By analyzing existing literature and case studies, we highlight the unique insights Indigenous communities offer in understanding animal behavior, ecology, and sustainable management practices. The review also addresses the historical marginalization of Indigenous knowledge in scientific discourse and proposes strategies for more inclusive research methodologies. Our findings suggest that incorporating Indigenous perspectives can enhance animal welfare, conservation efforts, and human-animal relationships. This interdisciplinary approach has implications for improving animal health, ecosystem management, and community well-being, ultimately contributing to a more holistic and culturally sensitive framework in animal biosciences."}
