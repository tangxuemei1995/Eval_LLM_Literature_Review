{"Abstract": "This review examines the scientific validation of cannabidiol (CBD) for managing various diseases in dogs and cats. We analyze recent studies on CBD's pharmacokinetics, anxiolytic effects, anti-inflammatory properties, and potential applications in veterinary medicine. The research highlights CBD's promising role in treating epilepsy and anxiety-related disorders in companion animals. However, the regulatory landscape surrounding CBD use in veterinary practice remains complex and evolving. While preliminary findings suggest CBD's efficacy in reducing inflammation and seizure frequency, more extensive clinical trials are needed to establish optimal dosing regimens and long-term safety profiles. This review also addresses the challenges in standardizing CBD products for veterinary use and the importance of veterinarian education on cannabinoid therapies. Overall, the growing body of evidence supports CBD's potential as a therapeutic agent in veterinary medicine, warranting further investigation and regulatory consideration."}
