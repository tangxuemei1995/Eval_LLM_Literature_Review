{"Abstract": "Cephalopods, including octopuses and squid, exhibit remarkable cognitive abilities and complex behaviors, despite their evolutionary divergence from vertebrates. This study investigates the extensive recoding of the neural proteome in cephalopods through RNA editing, a process mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. We demonstrate that cephalopods possess an unprecedented level of RNA editing, particularly in neural tissues, affecting a wide range of proteins involved in neuronal function and synaptic transmission. This extensive recoding allows for increased protein diversity and functional plasticity, potentially contributing to the advanced cognitive capabilities observed in these organisms. Our findings suggest that RNA editing may serve as a unique adaptive mechanism in cephalopods, enabling rapid neuronal responses to environmental changes and facilitating complex behaviors. This research provides new insights into the molecular basis of cephalopod intelligence and highlights the importance of post-transcriptional modifications in evolution."}
