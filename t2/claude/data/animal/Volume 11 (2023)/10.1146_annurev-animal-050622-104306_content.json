{"Abstract": "Zoos and aquariums play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, environmental education, and scientific research in an era of rapid global change. This review examines the evolving functions of these institutions, focusing on their contributions to captive breeding programs, species reintroduction efforts, and public awareness of environmental issues. We analyze the effectiveness of zoos and aquariums in promoting conservation messages and inspiring pro-environmental behaviors among visitors. Additionally, we explore the ethical considerations surrounding animal welfare in captive settings and the balance between entertainment and conservation objectives. Our findings suggest that while zoos and aquariums face challenges, they remain vital centers for ex situ conservation, research, and public engagement. We propose strategies for enhancing their impact on biodiversity preservation and environmental stewardship in the face of ongoing global environmental changes."}
