{"Abstract": "This study examines the contrasting conceptualizations of race through essentialist and constructivist perspectives. Essentialist views posit race as a fixed, biological reality, while constructivist approaches frame race as a socially constructed phenomenon. Through a comprehensive literature review and analysis of contemporary racial discourse, we explore how these divergent beliefs shape individual and societal understandings of race. Our findings reveal that essentialist beliefs often correlate with increased racial prejudice and support for discriminatory practices, whereas constructivist views tend to promote more inclusive attitudes. The study also highlights the persistence of essentialist thinking in popular culture and public policy, despite scientific evidence supporting the constructivist paradigm. We argue that a shift towards constructivist conceptualizations of race is crucial for addressing racial inequalities and fostering more equitable societies. This research contributes to ongoing debates on racial identity, social justice, and the nature of human diversity."}
