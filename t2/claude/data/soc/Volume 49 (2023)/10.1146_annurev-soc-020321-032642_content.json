{"Abstract": "This study examines the concept of 'diverging destinies' in the context of East Asian societies, focusing on how family dynamics, children's outcomes, and gender roles intersect with growing inequality. Drawing on extensive demographic data and sociological research from Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan, we analyze trends in family formation, parental investment, and intergenerational mobility. Our findings reveal that while East Asian countries share some similarities with Western nations in terms of educational disparities and delayed marriage, unique cultural and policy contexts shape distinct patterns of divergence. We observe that gender norms, work-family balance policies, and rapid economic development contribute to widening gaps in children's life chances across socioeconomic strata. This research contributes to the broader understanding of how global trends in inequality manifest in East Asian family structures and suggests policy implications for addressing these emerging disparities."}
