{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersections of cultural sociology, African institutions, religious sociology, and women's movements through a biographical lens. By examining autobiographical accounts, it investigates how individual experiences shape and are shaped by broader societal structures. The research highlights the complex interplay between personal narratives and institutional forces in African contexts, particularly focusing on women's roles and religious influences."}
