{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving perception of scientific legitimacy in contemporary society, focusing on the interplay between scientific knowledge, public policy, and cultural polarization. As science increasingly informs critical decision-making processes, its authority faces unprecedented scrutiny and challenges. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent literature and empirical data, we investigate the factors contributing to the erosion of scientific legitimacy and its implications for policy formulation and societal progress. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where cultural values, political ideologies, and media narratives significantly influence public trust in scientific expertise. We argue that addressing this legitimacy crisis requires a multifaceted approach, including improved science communication, enhanced scientific literacy, and more transparent research practices. This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the role of science in society and offers insights for rebuilding public confidence in scientific knowledge amidst growing polarization and skepticism."}
