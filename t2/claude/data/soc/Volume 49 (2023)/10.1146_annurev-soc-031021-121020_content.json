{"Abstract": "This study examines the social construction of age and its implications for conceptualization and measurement in social research. Drawing on theories of aging, life course, and intersectionality, we explore how age is understood and operationalized across various disciplines. Our analysis reveals that age is not merely a chronological marker but a complex social construct influenced by cultural, historical, and individual factors. We argue that current methodological approaches often fail to capture the multidimensional nature of age, leading to potential biases in research outcomes. By integrating perspectives from stratification and demography, we propose a more nuanced framework for measuring age that accounts for its intersections with other social categories. This approach has significant implications for understanding age-related inequalities and developing more accurate research designs in fields such as sociology, psychology, and public health."}
