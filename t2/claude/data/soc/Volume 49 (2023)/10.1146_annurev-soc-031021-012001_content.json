{"Abstract": "Social isolation has emerged as a significant public health concern, with far-reaching consequences for individual and community well-being. This review examines the unequal distribution of social isolation across various demographic groups, considering factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. By adopting a life course perspective, we explore how social isolation manifests and evolves throughout different stages of life. Our analysis reveals stark disparities in the prevalence and impact of social isolation, with marginalized populations often bearing a disproportionate burden. We discuss the complex interplay between social determinants of health and isolation, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and policies. This comprehensive examination of social isolation as an unequally distributed health hazard underscores the importance of addressing this issue through an intersectional lens to promote health equity and social justice."}
