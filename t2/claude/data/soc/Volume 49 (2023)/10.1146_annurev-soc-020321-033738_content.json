{"Abstract": "Ethnomethodology, a sociological approach pioneered by Harold Garfinkel in the 1960s, has left an indelible mark on social sciences and continues to influence contemporary research. This paper examines the enduring legacies of ethnomethodology and explores its future prospects across various domains. We trace the development of ethnomethodology's core principles, including the focus on everyday practices, the emphasis on members' methods, and the commitment to naturalistic observation. The paper highlights how ethnomethodology has shaped related fields such as conversation analysis, studies of science, and workplace studies. We analyze its contributions to understanding social order, interaction, and the production of knowledge in organizational settings. The concept of instructed action and the role of rules in shaping social behavior are critically examined, revealing ethnomethodology's unique insights into the constitution of social reality. Despite facing critiques and challenges, ethnomethodology has demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability. The paper argues that its future lies in its capacity to engage with emerging technologies, evolving social practices, and interdisciplinary collaborations. We conclude by proposing new directions for ethnomethodological research, emphasizing its potential to illuminate contemporary social phenomena and contribute to theoretical debates in sociology and beyond."}
