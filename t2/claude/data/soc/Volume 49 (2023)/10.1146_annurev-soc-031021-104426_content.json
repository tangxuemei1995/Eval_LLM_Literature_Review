{"Abstract": "This autobiographical reflection traces a 60-year intellectual journey through the field of comparative political economy. Beginning with the concept of embedded autonomy, which explored the synergistic relationship between state and society in fostering economic development, the narrative evolves to encompass broader themes of dependent development and the role of developmental states. The author's research trajectory then shifts towards examining counter-hegemonic globalization and transnational advocacy networks, highlighting the dynamic interplay between local and global forces in shaping economic and political outcomes. Throughout this academic odyssey, the author's work has consistently challenged conventional wisdom, offering nuanced perspectives on state-society relations, development strategies, and global power dynamics. This retrospective not only provides insights into the author's scholarly contributions but also illuminates the evolving landscape of comparative political economy over the past six decades."}
