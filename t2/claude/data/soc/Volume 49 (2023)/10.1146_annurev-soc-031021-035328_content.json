{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate relationships between space, place, policing, and punishment within the criminal legal system. Employing spatial-contextual analyses, we investigate how geographical factors influence law enforcement practices, judicial decision-making, and the distribution of punitive measures across diverse communities. Our research draws upon a comprehensive dataset of arrest records, court proceedings, and incarceration statistics, combined with socio-economic indicators and demographic data. Findings reveal significant spatial disparities in policing intensity, sentencing outcomes, and the allocation of correctional resources. We argue that these disparities reflect and reinforce existing social inequalities, contributing to the perpetuation of systemic biases within the criminal legal system. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on spatial criminology and offers valuable insights for policymakers seeking to address issues of equity and justice in law enforcement and criminal justice administration."}
