{"Abstract": "This study examines the social impacts of supply-side decarbonization strategies in the context of climate change mitigation. As nations worldwide pursue aggressive emissions reduction targets, the transition away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy sources has significant implications for communities and workers in carbon-intensive industries. Through a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, we analyze the challenges and opportunities presented by supply-side decarbonization policies. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing just transition frameworks to address potential job losses, economic disruptions, and social inequalities. We identify key policy interventions, including workforce retraining programs, community reinvestment initiatives, and targeted social support measures, that can help mitigate negative impacts and promote equitable outcomes. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on socially responsible climate action and provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders engaged in energy transition planning."}
