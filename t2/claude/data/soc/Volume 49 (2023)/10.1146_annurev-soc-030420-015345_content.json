{"Abstract": "This paper reviews recent advancements in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning. We explore how machine learning techniques are being leveraged to address key challenges in causal inference, including the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects, mediation analysis, and the extrapolation of causal effects across different populations. The integration of these fields has led to novel approaches for handling high-dimensional data, uncovering complex causal structures, and improving the external validity of causal estimates. We discuss the theoretical foundations of these methods, their practical implementations, and their applications in various domains such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. Additionally, we highlight ongoing challenges and future research directions, including the development of more robust methods for causal discovery in non-experimental settings and the incorporation of causal reasoning into artificial intelligence systems. This review aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the current state and potential future trajectories of this rapidly evolving field."}
