{"Abstract": "This study investigates the factors that contribute to the strength of weak ties in social networks. Building on Granovetter's seminal work, we explore how structural properties and individual agency interact to enhance the effectiveness of bridging ties. Using computational social science methods, we analyze large-scale network data to identify key characteristics that make weak ties particularly influential in information diffusion processes. Our findings suggest that the strength of weak ties is not solely determined by network structure, but also by the active role individuals play in leveraging these connections. We propose a novel framework that integrates structural and agency-based perspectives, offering a more comprehensive understanding of weak tie dynamics. This research has implications for social network theory, organizational behavior, and the design of interventions aimed at enhancing information flow across diverse communities."}
