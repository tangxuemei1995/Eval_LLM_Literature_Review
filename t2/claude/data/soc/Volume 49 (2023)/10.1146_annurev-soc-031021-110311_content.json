{"Abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach to examining the interplay between neighborhood and school contexts in shaping social outcomes. By conceptualizing neighborhood-school structures as interconnected systems, we move beyond traditional methods that treat these contexts separately. Using data from a large urban area, we employ network analysis techniques to map the complex relationships between residential patterns and school attendance boundaries. Our findings reveal distinct neighborhood-school structures that vary in their levels of segregation, resource distribution, and social connectivity. These structures are associated with differential outcomes in academic achievement, social mobility, and community cohesion. The results highlight the importance of considering the joint effects of neighborhoods and schools in understanding social inequality and designing effective interventions. This approach offers new insights for policymakers and researchers seeking to address educational disparities and promote social equity in urban environments."}
