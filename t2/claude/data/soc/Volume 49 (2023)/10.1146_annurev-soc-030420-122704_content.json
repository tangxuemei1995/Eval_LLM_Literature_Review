{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex issue of land inequalities in the United States, focusing on the disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as their economic and environmental implications. Through an analysis of property ownership patterns, economic indicators, and environmental data, we investigate the root causes and consequences of land distribution imbalances. Our findings reveal significant disparities in land access and ownership, with urban areas experiencing high concentration and rural regions facing challenges of consolidation and absentee ownership. These inequalities have far-reaching effects on local economies, social structures, and environmental sustainability. We also explore the legal framework surrounding land ownership and its role in perpetuating or mitigating these disparities. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on land reform and provides insights for policymakers seeking to address the multifaceted challenges posed by land inequalities in the United States."}
