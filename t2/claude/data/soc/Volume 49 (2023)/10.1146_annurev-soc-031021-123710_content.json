{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and the concept of white privilege, examining how CRT challenges and reframes traditional understandings of racial dynamics. Through a comprehensive literature review and qualitative analysis, we investigate the ways in which whiteness operates as a system of power and privilege in contemporary society. The research highlights how CRT provides a framework for confronting and deconstructing white privilege, emphasizing the importance of centering marginalized voices and experiences. Our findings reveal the pervasive nature of white privilege across various social institutions and the need for critical self-reflection among white individuals. This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on racial equity by offering insights into the mechanisms of white privilege and proposing strategies for dismantling systemic racism through the lens of Critical Race Theory."}
