{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between food systems and social inequality, exploring how disparities in food access, production, and distribution intersect with broader socioeconomic and political structures. Drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives, including agriculture, food justice, and food sovereignty frameworks, the research investigates how systemic inequalities manifest in food-related issues across diverse communities. The study employs an intersectional approach to analyze how factors such as race, class, gender, and geography influence food access and security. Findings reveal that food inequality is deeply rooted in historical and contemporary power dynamics, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage. The research highlights the importance of community-led initiatives and policy interventions that address food justice and sovereignty to combat these inequalities. By synthesizing existing literature and presenting new empirical evidence, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of food inequality and proposes pathways for creating more equitable and sustainable food systems."}
