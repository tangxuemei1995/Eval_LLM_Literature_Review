{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex dynamics of cross-border politics, focusing on diasporic mobilization and state responses in an increasingly interconnected world. Drawing on theories of transnationalism and geopolitics, we analyze how diasporic communities engage in homeland politics and influence international relations. The research explores the multifaceted nature of emigrant political activities, ranging from grassroots movements to formal diplomatic channels. We investigate how nation-states adapt their policies to address the challenges and opportunities presented by politically active diasporas. Through case studies and comparative analysis, this study reveals the intricate interplay between diaspora groups, home countries, and host nations. The findings highlight the significant role of nationalism in shaping diasporic identities and political engagement. This research contributes to our understanding of the evolving nature of citizenship, sovereignty, and political participation in a globalized context."}
