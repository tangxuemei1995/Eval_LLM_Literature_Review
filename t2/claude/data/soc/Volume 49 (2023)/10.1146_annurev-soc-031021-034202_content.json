{"Abstract": "This study examines the persistent social inequalities within the high-tech industry, focusing on how gender, race, and ethnicity shape the structure and dynamics of one of the world's most influential sectors. Drawing on extensive data from Silicon Valley and other major tech hubs, we analyze patterns of workplace inequality, organizational hierarchies, and access to venture capital. Our findings reveal significant disparities in representation, advancement opportunities, and funding allocation across different demographic groups. We identify key mechanisms perpetuating these inequalities, including biased hiring practices, exclusionary workplace cultures, and homogeneous investor networks. The research highlights the intersectionality of gender, race, and ethnicity in compounding disadvantages for certain groups. By illuminating these systemic issues, this study contributes to ongoing discussions on diversity and inclusion in the tech industry and offers recommendations for fostering a more equitable and innovative sector."}
