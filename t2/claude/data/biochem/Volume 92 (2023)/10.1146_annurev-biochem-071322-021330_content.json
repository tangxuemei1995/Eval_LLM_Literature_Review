{"Abstract": "Polyamines, essential molecules for cellular function, play a complex role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. This review explores the dual nature of polyamines in PD, examining their potential for both neurotoxicity and neuroprotection. We discuss the interactions between polyamines and key cellular components, including endo/lysosomes, mitochondria, and Î±-synuclein, which are implicated in PD progression. The review also highlights the role of astrocytes in polyamine metabolism and their impact on neuronal health. Recent findings suggest that while polyamine dysregulation can contribute to cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration, controlled polyamine supplementation may offer neuroprotective benefits. Understanding the delicate balance of polyamine function in PD could lead to novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating polyamine levels or their interactions with cellular targets to slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes."}
