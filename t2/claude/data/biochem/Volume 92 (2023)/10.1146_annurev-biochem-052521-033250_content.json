{"Abstract": "The insulin receptor plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis and cellular metabolism. This review examines recent structural insights into the activation mechanism of the insulin receptor, focusing on advances made through cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies. We discuss the conformational changes that occur upon insulin binding, highlighting the importance of insulin-binding sites 1 and 2 in receptor activation. The review explores how insulin binding triggers a series of structural rearrangements, leading to the activation of the receptor's tyrosine kinase domain. We also address the allosteric communication between the extracellular and intracellular domains, which is essential for signal transduction. Understanding these molecular mechanisms provides valuable insights into insulin receptor function and may guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches for diabetes and other metabolic disorders."}
