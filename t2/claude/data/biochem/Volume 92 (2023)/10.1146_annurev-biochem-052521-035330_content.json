{"Abstract": "The epitranscriptome, encompassing diverse RNA modifications, has emerged as a crucial regulator of gene expression. This review focuses on the proteins involved in mRNA modification, particularly m6A (N6-methyladenosine), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNAs. We discuss the 'writers' (methyltransferases), 'readers' (binding proteins), and 'erasers' (demethylases) of m6A modifications. Writers, such as METTL3-METTL14 complex, catalyze m6A deposition, while readers, including YTH domain-containing proteins, recognize and bind to m6A-modified transcripts. Erasers, like FTO and ALKBH5, remove m6A marks, enabling dynamic regulation. We explore the structural features, mechanisms, and biological functions of these proteins, highlighting their roles in mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. Understanding these key players in the epitranscriptome provides insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and potential therapeutic targets for various diseases."}
