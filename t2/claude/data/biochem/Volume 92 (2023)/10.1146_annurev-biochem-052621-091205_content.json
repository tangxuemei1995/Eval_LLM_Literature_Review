{"Abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces DNA damage that can disrupt cellular processes, including transcription. This review explores the intricate relationship between transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage. We discuss how RNA polymerase II stalling at DNA lesions triggers TC-NER, a specialized repair pathway that preferentially removes damage from actively transcribed genes. The interplay between TC-NER and global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) is examined, highlighting their complementary roles in maintaining genomic integrity. We also delve into the transcriptional changes that occur in response to UV damage, including the activation of stress response genes and the modulation of repair-related gene expression. Furthermore, we address the implications of defective TC-NER in Cockayne syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by UV sensitivity and developmental abnormalities. Understanding these mechanisms provides crucial insights into cellular responses to DNA damage and potential therapeutic targets for UV-related disorders."}
