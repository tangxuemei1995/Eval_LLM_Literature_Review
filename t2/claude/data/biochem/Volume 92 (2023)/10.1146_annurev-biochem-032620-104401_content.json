{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has emerged as a crucial player in innate immune signaling, bridging cellular stress and inflammatory responses. This review explores the mechanisms of mtDNA release and its role in activating innate immune pathways. We discuss how mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cellular damage can trigger the release of mtDNA through various pores and channels. Once in the cytosol or extracellular space, mtDNA acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), engaging multiple DNA sensing pathways, including cGAS-STING and TLR9. The subsequent activation of inflammatory cascades contributes to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions. Understanding the intricate relationship between mtDNA release and innate immune signaling provides new insights into the molecular basis of inflammation and offers potential therapeutic targets for modulating immune responses in diverse pathological contexts."}
