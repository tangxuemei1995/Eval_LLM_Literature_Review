{"Abstract": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is a crucial enzyme in the Calvin cycle, responsible for carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. This review explores the function, evolution, and engineering of Rubisco, highlighting its central role in global carbon cycling. We examine the enzyme's complex catalytic mechanism, its dual carboxylase and oxygenase activities, and the evolutionary trade-offs that have shaped its performance across diverse photosynthetic lineages. Recent advances in structural biology and biochemistry have provided new insights into Rubisco's catalytic limitations and potential strategies for improvement. We discuss various approaches to engineering Rubisco, including directed evolution, rational design, and the exploration of natural variation. Additionally, we consider the challenges and opportunities in transferring engineered Rubisco variants into plants and the potential impact on crop productivity and climate change mitigation. This review synthesizes current knowledge on Rubisco and outlines future directions for research and biotechnological applications."}
