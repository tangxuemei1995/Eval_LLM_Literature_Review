{"Abstract": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, involving a complex interplay of machinery and regulatory mechanisms. This review explores the intricate process of pre-mRNA processing, focusing on the endonucleolytic cleavage and subsequent polyadenylation that generate the mature 3′ end. We examine the key components of the processing machinery, including the endonuclease responsible for cleavage and the poly(A) polymerase that synthesizes the poly(A) tail. The regulatory factors that modulate this process and their impact on transcription and overall gene expression are discussed. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in understanding the coupling between 3′-end processing and other stages of mRNA biogenesis, such as transcription termination. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of 3′-end processing in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions."}
