{"Abstract": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair that efficiently removes DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. This study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying TCR, focusing on the roles of transcription-repair coupling factors such as Mfd in prokaryotes and CSB in eukaryotes. We investigate how these factors recognize stalled RNA polymerases and recruit repair machinery to damaged sites. Our findings reveal novel insights into the interplay between TCR and mutagenesis, highlighting the importance of this pathway in maintaining genomic stability. Additionally, we uncover a previously unrecognized connection between TCR and the circadian clock, suggesting a potential role for this repair mechanism in regulating cellular rhythms. These results expand our understanding of TCR and its broader implications in cellular processes, opening new avenues for future research in DNA repair and genome maintenance."}
