{"Abstract": "The radical SAM enzyme superfamily plays a crucial role in numerous biochemical processes through the generation of highly reactive radical species. This review explores the mechanism of radical initiation in these enzymes, focusing on the unique organometallic chemistry involving S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and iron-sulfur clusters. We discuss the formation of the 5â€²-deoxyadenosyl radical, a key intermediate in the catalytic cycle, and its subsequent reactions. Recent structural and spectroscopic studies have provided insights into the precise positioning of SAM relative to the iron-sulfur cluster, elucidating the electron transfer process that initiates radical formation. Additionally, we examine the diversity of radical SAM enzymes and their substrate specificity, highlighting the adaptability of this mechanism across various biological systems. Understanding these fundamental processes contributes to our knowledge of enzyme catalysis and may inform future applications in biotechnology and medicine."}
