{"Abstract": "Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes play a crucial role in genome organization through their ability to extrude DNA loops. This review explores recent advances in our understanding of SMC complexes, focusing on their mechanism of action and impact on genome architecture. We discuss insights gained from single-molecule studies that have revealed the dynamic nature of loop extrusion and the factors influencing this process. The review also examines the diverse functions of different SMC complexes, including cohesin and condensin, in chromosome organization and gene regulation. Furthermore, we highlight the implications of SMC-mediated loop extrusion in various cellular processes, such as DNA repair and transcription. Finally, we consider future directions for research in this rapidly evolving field and potential therapeutic applications targeting SMC complexes."}
