{"Abstract": "RNA modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, play a crucial role in regulating mRNA metabolism and posttranscriptional gene expression. This review explores the diverse landscape of RNA modifications and their impact on mRNA regulation. We discuss the most prevalent modifications, including m6A, m5C, and pseudouridine, and their respective writers, readers, and erasers. The dynamic nature of these modifications and their influence on mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and localization are examined. Furthermore, we highlight the emerging roles of RNA modifications in various biological processes, such as development, stress response, and disease progression. Understanding the intricate interplay between RNA modifications and mRNA regulation provides valuable insights into the complexity of gene expression control and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions."}
