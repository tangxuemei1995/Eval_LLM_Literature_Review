{"Abstract": "DNA-editing enzymes have emerged as powerful tools for precise genome modification, with base editors representing a significant advancement in this field. This review explores the design principles and applications of various base editors, including deaminases, methyltransferases, demethylases, and glycosylases. We discuss the protein engineering strategies employed to enhance the specificity, efficiency, and versatility of these enzymes. The development of novel base editors through rational design and directed evolution is examined, along with their potential for treating genetic disorders and improving crop traits. We also address the challenges and limitations of current base editing technologies, such as off-target effects and delivery methods. Finally, we highlight emerging trends and future directions in the field, including the integration of base editors with other genome engineering tools and their potential impact on personalized medicine and biotechnology."}
