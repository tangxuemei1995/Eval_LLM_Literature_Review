{"Abstract": "Thiolase enzymes play a crucial role in diverse metabolic pathways by catalyzing the reversible formation and cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds using coenzyme A-thioester chemistry. This review explores the versatility of thiolases, focusing on their unique structural features and catalytic mechanisms. We examine the intricate hydrogen-bond network and proton wire system that facilitate proton transfer during catalysis, as well as the oxyanion hole that stabilizes reaction intermediates. The review highlights the importance of coenzyme A in thiolase-mediated reactions, particularly in Claisen condensation-like processes. We discuss how thiolases employ thioester chemistry to achieve efficient C-C bond formation and cleavage, emphasizing their significance in both biosynthetic and degradative pathways. Furthermore, we explore recent advances in understanding thiolase structure-function relationships and their potential applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology. This comprehensive analysis underscores the fundamental importance of thiolases in cellular metabolism and their potential as biocatalysts for industrial applications."}
