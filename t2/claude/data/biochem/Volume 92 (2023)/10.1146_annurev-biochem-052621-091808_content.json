{"Abstract": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between codon optimality, translation elongation, and mRNA stability control. We explore how codon usage patterns influence tRNA availability and translation efficiency, ultimately affecting mRNA decay rates. Through a combination of computational analyses and experimental approaches, we demonstrate that optimal codons promote faster translation elongation and increased mRNA stability, while non-optimal codons tend to slow translation and accelerate mRNA decay. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between codon optimality, tRNA abundance, and mRNA stability, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that fine-tunes gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. We also identify key factors involved in sensing codon optimality and mediating mRNA decay. This research provides new insights into the role of codon usage in translation dynamics and mRNA turnover, with implications for understanding gene regulation and developing strategies for optimizing protein expression in biotechnological applications."}
