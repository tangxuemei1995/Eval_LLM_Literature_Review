{"Abstract": "Muscle contraction is a complex process involving the intricate interplay of various proteins and molecular structures. This review explores recent advancements in our understanding of the structural biochemistry underlying muscle contraction, focusing on key players such as actin, myosin, ryanodine receptors, and troponin. We examine the latest findings obtained through cutting-edge techniques like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), which have revolutionized our ability to visualize and analyze these molecular structures at unprecedented resolutions. The review highlights the dynamic conformational changes and interactions between these proteins during the contraction cycle, providing insights into the mechanistic details of force generation and regulation. Furthermore, we discuss how these structural insights contribute to our understanding of muscle-related diseases and potential therapeutic interventions. This comprehensive overview synthesizes current knowledge and identifies future research directions in the field of muscle contraction biochemistry."}
