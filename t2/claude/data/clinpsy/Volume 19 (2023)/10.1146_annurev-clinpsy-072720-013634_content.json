{"Abstract": "This study examines the developmental consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) on children, from prenatal exposure to adolescence. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that IPV exposure significantly impacts various aspects of child development, including cognitive, emotional, and social domains. Prenatal stress resulting from maternal IPV exposure is associated with adverse birth outcomes and altered neurodevelopment. Infants and young children exposed to IPV demonstrate disrupted attachment patterns and increased risk for behavioral problems. School-aged children exhibit academic difficulties, emotional dysregulation, and social challenges. Adolescents show higher rates of mental health issues, substance abuse, and intergenerational transmission of violence. The study highlights the need for early intervention strategies, trauma-informed care, and support systems to mitigate the long-term effects of IPV on child development. Future research directions and policy implications are discussed to address this critical public health concern."}
