{"Abstract": "This review examines the prevalence, mechanisms, and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among refugee populations. Refugees, who have experienced forced displacement and often traumatic events, are at heightened risk for developing PTSD. We synthesize current literature on the neurobiological and psychosocial factors contributing to PTSD in refugees, highlighting the complex interplay between pre-migration trauma, displacement stressors, and post-migration challenges. The review explores evidence-based interventions, including trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy and culturally adapted treatments, emphasizing the importance of culturally sensitive approaches in mental health care for refugees. Additionally, we discuss the barriers to accessing mental health services and the role of social support in mitigating PTSD symptoms. Our findings underscore the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches to address PTSD in refugee populations, integrating mental health care with broader resettlement support to promote long-term well-being and successful integration into host societies."}
