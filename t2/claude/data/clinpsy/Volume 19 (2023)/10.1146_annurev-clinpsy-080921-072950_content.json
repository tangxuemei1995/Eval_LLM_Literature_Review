{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of evidence-based practice (EBP) and alter-Native psy-ence in community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The research explores the challenges of implementing Western-based EBPs within Indigenous communities and the potential of Indigenized therapies to address postcolonial anomie. Through a comprehensive literature review and qualitative interviews with mental health practitioners, the study identifies key barriers to culturally appropriate care and proposes strategies for integrating traditional healing practices with contemporary psychological approaches. Findings suggest that a hybrid model, incorporating both EBP and alter-Native psy-ence, may be most effective in addressing the unique mental health needs of AI/AN populations. The study emphasizes the importance of cultural competence, community engagement, and the recognition of historical trauma in developing and implementing mental health interventions. Recommendations are provided for policymakers and practitioners to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of community mental health services for AI/AN individuals."}
