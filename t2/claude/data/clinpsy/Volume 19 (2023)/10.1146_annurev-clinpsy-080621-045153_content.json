{"Abstract": "Psychoneuroimmunology, an emerging interdisciplinary field, explores the intricate connections between the immune system, nervous system, and psychological processes. This review introduces the fundamental concepts of immune-to-brain communication and its relevance to clinical psychology. We examine the bidirectional relationship between psychosocial stress and inflammation, highlighting how chronic stress can dysregulate immune function and contribute to various psychological disorders. The role of inflammation in sickness behavior and its potential implications for understanding depression are discussed. Furthermore, we explore the translational aspects of psychoneuroimmunology research, emphasizing its potential to inform novel therapeutic approaches in clinical psychology. By elucidating the complex interplay between immune function, neural processes, and psychological well-being, this field offers promising avenues for developing integrated interventions that address both physical and mental health concerns."}
