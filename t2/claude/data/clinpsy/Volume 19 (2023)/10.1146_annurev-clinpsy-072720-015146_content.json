{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors in promoting mental health among African American youth. Drawing from a comprehensive review of existing literature, we investigate the impact of racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity, spirituality, family dynamics, and parenting practices on psychological well-being. Our findings suggest that these factors serve as protective mechanisms against the detrimental effects of racism and discrimination on mental health outcomes. Strong racial identity and positive ethnic-racial socialization were found to be particularly influential in fostering resilience. Additionally, religiosity and spirituality emerged as significant coping resources, while supportive family environments and culturally-informed parenting strategies contributed to enhanced psychological adjustment. This research highlights the importance of culturally-specific protective factors in promoting resilience and positive mental health outcomes among African American youth facing systemic racism and discrimination."}
