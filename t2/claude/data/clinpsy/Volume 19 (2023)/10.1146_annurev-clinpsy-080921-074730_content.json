{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex relationship between racism and the social determinants of psychosis, focusing on how racial discrimination and structural racism contribute to the development and exacerbation of psychotic experiences. Drawing from a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the impact of various neighborhood factors, socioeconomic disparities, and experiences of discrimination on the onset and progression of psychosis among marginalized racial groups. Our findings suggest that exposure to chronic racial stress and systemic inequalities significantly increases the risk of developing psychotic symptoms, particularly in early psychosis stages. Furthermore, we investigate how structural racism embedded in healthcare systems, education, and criminal justice may perpetuate disparities in psychosis outcomes. This research highlights the urgent need for culturally sensitive interventions, policy reforms, and community-based approaches to address the social determinants of psychosis and mitigate the harmful effects of racism on mental health outcomes."}
