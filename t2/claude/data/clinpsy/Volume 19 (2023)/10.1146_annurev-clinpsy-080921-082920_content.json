{"Abstract": "This comprehensive review examines the impact of four decades of meta-analytic research on youth psychotherapy and the evolution of research synthesis methodologies. Drawing from a vast body of literature, we analyze the progression of meta-analytic techniques and their contributions to understanding the efficacy of various therapeutic approaches for children and adolescents. The review highlights key findings from randomized controlled trials, exploring effect sizes across different treatment modalities and presenting conditions. We discuss the emergence of evidence-based psychotherapy practices and their influence on clinical decision-making. Additionally, we critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of meta-analysis in assessing treatment benefits for youth populations. The paper also addresses methodological advancements in research synthesis, including improved statistical techniques and reporting standards. Finally, we offer insights into future directions for meta-analytic research in youth psychotherapy and its potential to further enhance clinical practice and policy-making in child and adolescent mental health."}
