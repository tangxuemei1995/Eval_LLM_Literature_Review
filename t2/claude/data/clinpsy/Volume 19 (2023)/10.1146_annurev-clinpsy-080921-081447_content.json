{"Abstract": "This review critically examines the literature on risk and resilience among children with incarcerated parents, offering a nuanced perspective on their experiences. Drawing from an intersectional framework, we analyze how factors such as race, class, and gender intersect with parental incarceration to shape outcomes. The review challenges deficit-based approaches, highlighting the importance of recognizing children's agency and strengths. We explore various protective factors and resilience-promoting interventions, emphasizing the need for culturally responsive and trauma-informed practices. Additionally, we address the systemic barriers and social inequities that contribute to parental incarceration and its intergenerational impacts. By reframing the narrative around these children, we advocate for a social justice-oriented approach that considers broader societal contexts and promotes equitable support systems. This review concludes with recommendations for future research, policy, and practice to better serve and empower children with incarcerated parents."}
