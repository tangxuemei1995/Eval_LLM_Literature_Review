{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between acculturation processes and psychopathology, focusing on both proximal and remote acculturation in the context of globalization. Drawing on a comprehensive review of literature, we examine how acculturation experiences impact mental health outcomes among immigrants and refugees across different developmental stages. The research investigates the role of resilience factors in mitigating psychopathological risks associated with acculturation stress. Our findings suggest that while acculturation challenges can contribute to increased vulnerability to mental health issues, they also present opportunities for adaptive growth and resilience. The study highlights the importance of considering both proximal and remote acculturation influences in understanding and addressing psychopathology in diverse populations. These insights have significant implications for developing culturally sensitive interventions and policies to support the mental well-being of acculturating individuals in an increasingly interconnected world."}
