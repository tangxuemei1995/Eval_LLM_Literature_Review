{"Abstract": "This review examines the efficacy of behavioral interventions for tic disorders in children and adults. Focusing on evidence-based approaches, including habit reversal training and Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT), we analyze their impact on tic severity and associated symptoms. The literature suggests that these interventions can significantly reduce tic frequency and intensity, improve quality of life, and enhance social functioning. Exposure-based techniques are also explored as a promising adjunct to traditional behavioral therapies. While pharmacological treatments remain important, behavioral interventions offer a non-invasive alternative with fewer side effects. This review highlights the need for further research to optimize treatment protocols and investigate long-term outcomes, particularly in adult populations with chronic tic disorders."}
