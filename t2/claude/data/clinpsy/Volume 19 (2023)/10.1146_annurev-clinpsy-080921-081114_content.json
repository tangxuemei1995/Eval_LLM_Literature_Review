{"Abstract": "This study explores the prevalence and psychological underpinnings of supernatural attributions in explaining life events. Drawing from a diverse sample of 1,500 participants across various cultural and religious backgrounds, we investigate how individuals attribute causality to supernatural entities such as God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma. Using a mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and experimental manipulations, we examine the relationship between supernatural attributions and factors including religious affiliation, spiritual experiences, and cognitive biases. Results indicate that supernatural attributions are common across cultures, with significant variations in the specific entities invoked. We find that such attributions are positively correlated with spiritual struggles and anomalous experiences, and negatively associated with analytical thinking styles. This research contributes to our understanding of how supernatural beliefs shape individuals' interpretations of events and highlights the complex interplay between cognitive processes, cultural context, and spiritual experiences in forming causal attributions."}
