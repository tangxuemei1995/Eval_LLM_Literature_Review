{"Abstract": "This comprehensive review examines the current state of knowledge regarding eating disorders in boys and men, an often overlooked population in eating disorder research. The study explores epidemiological trends, highlighting the increasing prevalence of eating disorders among males. It investigates unique risk factors, clinical presentations, and diagnostic challenges specific to this demographic. The review also evaluates existing intervention strategies and their effectiveness in treating male patients. Furthermore, it assesses long-term outcomes and potential barriers to seeking treatment faced by boys and men with eating disorders. By synthesizing recent findings and identifying gaps in the literature, this review aims to inform future research directions and improve clinical practices for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders in male populations."}
