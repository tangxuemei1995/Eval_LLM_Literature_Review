{"Abstract": "This study explores the implementation and effectiveness of culturally responsive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for ethnically diverse populations. Despite the proven efficacy of CBT, mental health disparities persist among minority groups, highlighting the need for culturally adapted interventions. The research examines the impact of culturally responsive CBT on treatment outcomes, client engagement, and therapeutic alliance. A systematic review of existing literature and a mixed-methods approach, including randomized controlled trials and qualitative interviews, were employed. Results indicate that culturally adapted CBT significantly improves treatment outcomes and reduces dropout rates among ethnic minority clients. Key elements of successful adaptation include incorporating cultural values, addressing language barriers, and enhancing clinician cultural competence through specialized training. The findings underscore the importance of cultural responsiveness in mental health interventions and provide valuable insights for clinicians and policymakers working to address mental health disparities among diverse populations."}
