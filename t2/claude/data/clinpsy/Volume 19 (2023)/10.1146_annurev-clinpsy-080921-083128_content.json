{"Abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Experience Sampling Method (ESM) have become increasingly popular in psychological and behavioral research. However, several pressing issues remain unaddressed in the field. This review critically evaluates key challenges in EMA implementation, including content validity, the establishment of gold standards, participant training, missingness, reliability, and selection bias. We examine current practices and propose potential solutions to enhance the robustness of EMA studies. Additionally, we explore the need for standardized comparison methods to facilitate cross-study analyses. Our findings highlight the importance of developing comprehensive guidelines for EMA design and execution, as well as the need for more rigorous validation processes. We conclude by outlining future research directions to address these challenges and improve the overall quality and reliability of EMA-based studies across various disciplines."}
