{"Abstract": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act (GLSMA) represents a significant federal initiative aimed at addressing youth suicide in the United States. This paper provides a comprehensive description and review of the GLSMA's suicide prevention efforts since its inception in 2004. We examine the act's key components, including grantmaking to states, tribes, and campuses for implementing evidence-based prevention strategies. The evaluation of GLSMA-funded programs reveals promising outcomes, such as increased awareness, improved screening practices, and enhanced community partnerships. However, challenges in program sustainability and reaching high-risk populations persist. Our analysis highlights the importance of continued funding, rigorous evaluation, and adaptation of interventions to diverse cultural contexts. The GLSMA's impact on reducing youth suicide rates and its role in shaping national suicide prevention policy are discussed, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and refinement of prevention strategies."}
