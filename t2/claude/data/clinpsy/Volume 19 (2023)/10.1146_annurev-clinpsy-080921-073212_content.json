{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of machine learning and digital phenotyping in measuring psychological health. We investigate how advanced algorithms can analyze digital biomarkers collected from smartphones and wearable devices to assess mental well-being. Our research demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to identify patterns in user behavior, social interactions, and physiological data that correlate with various psychological states. We discuss the implications of these findings for early detection and intervention in mental health disorders, as well as the ethical considerations surrounding the use of digital psychometrics in clinical practice."}
