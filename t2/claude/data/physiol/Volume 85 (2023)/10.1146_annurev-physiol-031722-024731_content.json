{"Abstract": "Flexible decision-making is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this ability remain poorly understood. This review explores the distributed neural networks involved in flexible perceptual decisions, focusing on how the brain rapidly adjusts stimulus-action mappings and decision policies during task switches. We examine recent findings from neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies that reveal the dynamic interplay between sensory, cognitive, and motor areas during flexible sensory-guided behavior. Key neural substrates, including the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and basal ganglia, are discussed in terms of their roles in updating task rules, modulating sensory processing, and implementing adaptive decision strategies. We propose a framework for understanding how these distributed networks coordinate to enable rapid adjustments in perceptual decision-making, highlighting potential targets for future research and clinical interventions in disorders characterized by inflexible behavior."}
