{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate relationship between infectious and inflammatory processes and cough, a common respiratory symptom. We examine how respiratory tract infections trigger cough through various pathways, including direct pathogen-induced damage and host immune responses. The role of sensory neurons in detecting irritants and initiating the cough reflex is discussed, highlighting their involvement in both acute and chronic cough. Additionally, we investigate the mechanisms of disease transmission through cough and the potential for targeted interventions. Understanding these complex interactions may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for managing cough in infectious and inflammatory respiratory conditions."}
