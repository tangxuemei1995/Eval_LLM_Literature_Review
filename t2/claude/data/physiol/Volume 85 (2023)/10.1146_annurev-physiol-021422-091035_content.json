{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes in brain tissue, focusing on the recruitment of energy substrates during neural activity. We examine the roles of glucose, lactate, and oxygen in supporting neuronal function, with particular emphasis on the interplay between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings reveal a dynamic metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes, where astrocytes preferentially utilize glycolysis to produce lactate, which is then shuttled to neurons as an additional energy source. Neurons, in turn, exhibit a higher reliance on oxidative metabolism. We also observe that the metabolic recruitment patterns vary depending on the intensity and duration of neural activity. These results provide new insights into the metabolic flexibility of brain tissue and have implications for understanding neurodegenerative disorders and developing targeted therapeutic approaches."}
