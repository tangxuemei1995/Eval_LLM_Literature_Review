{"Abstract": "Protein trafficking and quality control mechanisms play crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the kidney. This review explores the intricate processes involved in protein transport through the secretory pathway, from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and beyond. We focus on the TMED family of proteins, which are essential for cargo selection and vesicle formation. The review also examines the proteome of various cellular compartments involved in trafficking and discusses how disruptions in these pathways contribute to kidney disease. Furthermore, we investigate the quality control mechanisms that ensure proper protein folding and degradation, including the role of lysosomes in maintaining cellular health. By elucidating these mechanisms, we aim to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for kidney disorders and other diseases associated with protein trafficking defects."}
