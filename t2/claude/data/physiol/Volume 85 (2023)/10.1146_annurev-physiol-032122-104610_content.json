{"Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulumâ€“plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions are specialized membrane contact sites that play a crucial role in Ca2+ signaling in excitable cells. This review explores the structure and function of ER-PM junctions in various cell types, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, as well as neurons. We discuss how these junctions serve as platforms for the localization and interaction of ion channels and second messenger systems, facilitating rapid and efficient Ca2+ signaling in response to depolarization. The review highlights the molecular components involved in ER-PM junction formation and maintenance, as well as the specific mechanisms by which these structures contribute to Ca2+ homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling. Furthermore, we examine the physiological significance of ER-PM junctions in cellular processes and their potential implications in pathological conditions. Understanding the intricate dynamics of ER-PM junctions provides valuable insights into the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in excitable cells and may inform future therapeutic strategies."}
