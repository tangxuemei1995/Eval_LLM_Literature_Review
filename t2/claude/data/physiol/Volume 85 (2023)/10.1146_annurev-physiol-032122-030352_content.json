{"Abstract": "Fatty acid transport and signaling play crucial roles in various physiological processes. This review explores the mechanisms and implications of fatty acid transport and signaling, focusing on key proteins such as CD36, FFAR1, FFAR4, and caveolin. We discuss the intricate pathways involved in fatty acid uptake, intracellular trafficking, and signaling cascades. The review highlights the importance of these processes in energy metabolism, particularly Î²-oxidation, and their impact on tissue repair and regeneration. Furthermore, we examine the role of fatty acid signaling in modulating cellular responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic disorders. By integrating recent findings, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of fatty acid transport and signaling, emphasizing their significance in maintaining physiological homeostasis and their potential for clinical applications."}
