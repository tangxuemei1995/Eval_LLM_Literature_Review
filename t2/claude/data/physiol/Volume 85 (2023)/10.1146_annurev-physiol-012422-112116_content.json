{"Abstract": "Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), is a member of the transforming growth factor-Î² superfamily that acts as a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. This review explores the role of myostatin as a skeletal muscle chalone, a tissue-specific growth inhibitor that helps maintain optimal tissue size. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying myostatin's function, including its synthesis, secretion, and activation from a latent complex. The review also examines myostatin's interactions with its receptors and the subsequent signaling cascades that lead to the inhibition of muscle growth. Furthermore, we highlight the potential therapeutic applications of myostatin manipulation in treating muscle wasting disorders and enhancing muscle growth in livestock. Understanding myostatin's function as a chalone provides valuable insights into the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and offers promising avenues for future research and clinical interventions."}
