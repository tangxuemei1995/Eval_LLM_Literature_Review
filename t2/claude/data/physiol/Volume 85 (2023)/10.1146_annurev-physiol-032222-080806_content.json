{"Abstract": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a complex biological process wherein endothelial cells lose their distinctive characteristics and acquire mesenchymal-like properties. This review explores the role of EndMT in both physiological and pathological contexts, with a particular focus on cardiovascular health and disease. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT, including key signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators. The physiological importance of EndMT during embryonic development and wound healing is examined, alongside its pathological implications in various cardiovascular disorders, such as fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and valve calcification. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in understanding the potential of targeting EndMT for therapeutic interventions. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the multifaceted nature of EndMT and its significance in cardiovascular biology, paving the way for future research and potential clinical applications."}
