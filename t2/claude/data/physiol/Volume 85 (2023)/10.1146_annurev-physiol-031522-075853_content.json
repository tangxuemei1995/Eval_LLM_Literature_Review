{"Abstract": "Salt taste perception plays a crucial role in regulating sodium intake and maintaining electrolyte balance in organisms. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying salt taste, focusing on the primary taste receptors involved in detecting sodium ions. We discuss the pivotal role of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in mediating attractive salt taste responses, as well as the involvement of other ion channels and receptors in salt perception. The review examines the signal transduction pathways activated by salt stimuli and the neural coding of salt taste information. Additionally, we investigate the modulation of salt taste sensitivity by various factors, including hormones and dietary experiences. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing strategies to address salt-related health issues and for creating salt alternatives in the food industry. Finally, we highlight recent advances in the field and identify areas for future research."}
