{"Abstract": "Pericytes, contractile cells surrounding capillaries, play a crucial role in regulating blood flow in the brain and heart. This review explores the mechanisms by which pericytes control microcirculation in these metabolically demanding organs. We examine the interplay between pericytes and neurovascular coupling in the brain, highlighting their involvement in matching blood flow to neuronal activity. The role of electro-metabolic signaling in pericyte function is discussed, emphasizing the importance of ion channels, particularly those mediating calcium and potassium fluxes. In the heart, we investigate how pericytes contribute to coronary blood flow regulation and cardiac metabolism. The review also compares and contrasts pericyte function in the brain and heart, revealing organ-specific adaptations. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. We conclude by identifying key areas for future research, including the potential for pericyte-based interventions in improving tissue perfusion and organ function."}
