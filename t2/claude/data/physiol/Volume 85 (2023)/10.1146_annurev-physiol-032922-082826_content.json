{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of lung biology in health and disease. This review explores the development of comprehensive lung cell atlases, focusing on their applications in pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We discuss how these atlases provide unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, disease-specific cell populations, and molecular mechanisms underlying lung pathologies. The integration of single-cell data with spatial transcriptomics and proteomics has further enhanced our ability to map cellular interactions and identify potential therapeutic targets. We highlight the challenges in data interpretation and integration across studies, as well as the future directions for leveraging lung cell atlases in personalized medicine and drug discovery for respiratory diseases."}
