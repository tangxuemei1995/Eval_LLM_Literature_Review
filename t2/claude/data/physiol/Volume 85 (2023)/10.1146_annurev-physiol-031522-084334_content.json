{"Abstract": "Polycystin channel complexes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common inherited disorder characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. These complexes, composed of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, belong to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and are localized to primary cilia. Recent structural and functional studies have provided insights into the gating mechanisms of polycystin channels and their interactions with other proteins. Mutations in polycystin genes disrupt channel function, leading to ciliary defects and aberrant cellular signaling. Understanding the molecular basis of polycystin channel regulation and its involvement in ciliopathies may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches in ADPKD and related disorders. This review summarizes current knowledge on polycystin channel complexes and their implications in kidney disease pathophysiology."}
