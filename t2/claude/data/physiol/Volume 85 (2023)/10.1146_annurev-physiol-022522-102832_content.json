{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate relationship between iron metabolism and diabetes pathophysiology. Emerging evidence suggests that iron overload plays a significant role in the development and progression of diabetes mellitus. We examine the mechanisms by which excess iron affects insulin sensitivity and secretion, focusing on its impact on pancreatic beta cells and adipocytes. The role of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, is discussed in the context of diabetes. Additionally, we investigate the connection between hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder of iron overload, and diabetes risk. The review also highlights recent findings on iron's influence on adipocyte function and its implications for insulin resistance. Understanding these complex interactions may provide new insights into diabetes prevention and management strategies, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches targeting iron metabolism in diabetic patients."}
