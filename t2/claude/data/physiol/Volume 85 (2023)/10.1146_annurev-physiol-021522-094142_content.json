{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in molecular tools have revolutionized our understanding of breathing control mechanisms. This review focuses on key areas transformed by these techniques, including the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), lung sensory pathways, and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Genetic manipulations and optogenetic approaches have elucidated the critical role of the preBötC in respiratory rhythm generation. Similarly, molecular studies have refined our comprehension of lung sensory mechanisms, particularly the Hering-Breuer reflex, revealing intricate neural circuits involved in breath-by-breath regulation. The NTS, a crucial relay center for respiratory sensory information, has been further characterized through targeted molecular interventions. Additionally, the review highlights the evolving understanding of serotonin's multifaceted role in respiratory control. These molecular insights have not only deepened our knowledge of breathing physiology but also opened new avenues for therapeutic interventions in respiratory disorders."}
