{"Abstract": "Insulin clearance plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the development of metabolic disorders. This review examines the complex interplay between insulin clearance, insulin action, and insulin resistance across various health conditions and populations. We explore the mechanisms underlying altered insulin clearance in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its contribution to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Additionally, we investigate how age and ethnicity influence insulin clearance rates and their potential impact on metabolic health disparities. Understanding the factors affecting insulin clearance provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for managing metabolic disorders and improving overall health outcomes."}
