{"Abstract": "Proprioception, the sense of body position and movement, is crucial for motor control and spatial awareness. Recent advancements in genetic and bionic strategies have opened new avenues for understanding and manipulating proprioceptive systems. This review explores cutting-edge research on proprioceptive sensory neurons, muscle spindles, and Golgi tendon organs, as well as their integration in the dorsal column nuclei and somatosensory cortex. We discuss the potential of kinesthetic illusions in enhancing proprioceptive feedback and examine the development of neural machine interfaces for prosthetic limbs. These emerging technologies promise to revolutionize our approach to proprioception, offering hope for improved rehabilitation strategies and more intuitive control of artificial limbs."}
