{"Abstract": "The mammalian liver exhibits remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity, enabling it to maintain homeostasis and regenerate following injury. This review explores the multiple facets of liver zonation, cellular heterogeneity, and regenerative capacity in both homeostatic and injury conditions. We discuss the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation and how this spatial organization contributes to organ function. The review examines the liver's response to acute and chronic injuries, highlighting the diverse cellular plasticity observed during regeneration. We analyze the roles of hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and liver progenitor cells in maintaining tissue integrity and initiating repair processes. Furthermore, we explore recent advances in understanding the signaling pathways and transcriptional networks that regulate liver regeneration. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex interplay between cellular homeostasis and regeneration in the mammalian liver, with implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for liver diseases."}
