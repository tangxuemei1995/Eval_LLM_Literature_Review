{"Abstract": "Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels are crucial ion channels involved in various physiological processes, including pain sensation and temperature perception. This review explores the molecular physiology of TRPV channels, focusing on their structure-function relationships and their roles in nociception. We discuss recent advances in structural biology that have provided insights into the gating mechanisms and ligand interactions of these channels. Additionally, we address ongoing controversies in the field, such as the precise mechanisms of temperature sensing and the potential for TRPV channels as therapeutic targets. Finally, we highlight future challenges in TRPV channel research, including the need for more selective pharmacological tools and a better understanding of their tissue-specific functions. This comprehensive overview aims to guide future research directions in the rapidly evolving field of TRPV channel physiology."}
