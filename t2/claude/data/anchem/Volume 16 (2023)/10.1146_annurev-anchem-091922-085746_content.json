{"Abstract": "This review examines the current state of in situ sensors for coastal and ocean monitoring, highlighting recent advancements and challenges in the field. We discuss various sensor types and their applications in oceanography, including physical, chemical, and biological parameters. The integration of these sensors into networked systems for comprehensive environmental monitoring is explored, emphasizing the importance of real-time data collection and analysis. Particular attention is given to the issue of biofouling, a significant obstacle in long-term deployments, and emerging strategies to mitigate its effects. The review also addresses the growing role of autonomous platforms and the potential for machine learning in data interpretation. Finally, we identify key areas for future research and development, such as improving sensor durability, enhancing data quality, and expanding the range of measurable parameters to better understand complex coastal and ocean ecosystems."}
