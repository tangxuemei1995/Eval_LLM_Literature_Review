{"Abstract": "This study introduces an advanced multiplexing technology for high-throughput proteomics, termed 'hyperplexing'. By combining innovative sample preparation techniques, automated liquid handling systems, and state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, we have significantly increased the number of samples that can be analyzed simultaneously. Our approach enables the quantification of thousands of proteins across hundreds of samples in a single experiment, dramatically improving throughput and reducing experimental variability. We demonstrate the utility of hyperplexing in large-scale clinical studies, drug discovery pipelines, and systems biology investigations. The enhanced multiplexing capacity not only accelerates proteome-wide analyses but also facilitates the detection of subtle protein abundance changes across complex biological systems. This technology represents a significant advancement in proteomics research, offering new possibilities for understanding cellular processes and disease mechanisms at unprecedented scale and depth."}
