{"Abstract": "This review explores the emerging field of data-enabled sensing using photoluminescent probes, focusing on multidimensional fluorescence and phosphorescence techniques. We discuss recent advancements in multivariate analysis and image processing methods that have revolutionized the interpretation of complex luminescence data. The integration of N-way analysis with photoluminescent probes has enabled the extraction of valuable information from high-dimensional datasets, enhancing sensitivity and selectivity in various sensing applications. We highlight the synergistic relationship between probe design and data analysis techniques, emphasizing how this approach has led to breakthroughs in environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and materials characterization. Furthermore, we examine the challenges and future prospects of data-enabled sensing, including the development of machine learning algorithms for real-time analysis and the potential for creating adaptive, intelligent sensing systems."}
