{"Abstract": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose significant health challenges in resource-limited settings. This review explores the development of low-cost microfluidic systems for the detection of NTDs, focusing on paper-based microfluidics and lateral flow assays. We examine recent advancements in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests adapted for point-of-care testing. These innovative platforms offer rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic capabilities while minimizing costs and infrastructure requirements. We discuss the integration of smartphone-based detection systems and the potential for multiplexed assays to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, we address the challenges of implementing these technologies in remote areas, including sample preparation, reagent stability, and result interpretation. The review highlights the promising role of low-cost microfluidic systems in improving clinical diagnosis and disease management for NTDs, ultimately contributing to global health equity."}
