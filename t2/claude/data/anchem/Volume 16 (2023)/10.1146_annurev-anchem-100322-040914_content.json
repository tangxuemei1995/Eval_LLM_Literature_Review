{"Abstract": "In an increasingly interconnected world, biosensors play a crucial role in bridging the gap between biological systems and digital technologies. This paper explores the potential of biosensors to provide system-level support across various domains, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, and industrial processes. We examine how biosensors can enhance decision support systems by providing real-time, accurate data for meaningful use in critical applications. The integration of biosensors into knowledge networks is discussed, highlighting their ability to contribute to the creation and dissemination of valuable insights. Furthermore, we analyze the quality of service considerations in biosensor-based systems, addressing challenges such as reliability, scalability, and data security. By synthesizing current research and identifying future directions, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the transformative potential of biosensors in creating a more connected and responsive world."}
