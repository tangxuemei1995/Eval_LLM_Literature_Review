{"Abstract": "This review explores efficient validation strategies for environmental analytical methods focusing on organic micropollutants in water samples. The increasing complexity of environmental matrices and the need for accurate, sensitive, and reliable analytical methods necessitate robust validation procedures. We discuss key aspects of method validation, including selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and limits of detection and quantification, with a specific emphasis on liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Quality assurance and quality control measures are examined, highlighting their importance in ensuring data reliability. The review also addresses challenges associated with emerging contaminants and matrix effects in water samples. By presenting current best practices and innovative approaches, this work aims to guide researchers and analytical chemists in developing and implementing efficient validation strategies for the analysis of organic micropollutants in aqueous environments, ultimately contributing to improved environmental monitoring and risk assessment."}
