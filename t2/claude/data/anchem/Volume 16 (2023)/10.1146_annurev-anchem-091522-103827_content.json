{"Abstract": "Microfluidic systems have emerged as powerful tools for studying biofilms, offering precise control over flow dynamics and shear stress. This review explores recent advancements in microfluidic platforms for biofilm research, highlighting their applications in in situ visualization, antifouling strategies, and antimicrobial resistance studies. We discuss the integration of microfluidics with organ-on-chip models and biosensors, enabling more accurate representations of physiological conditions and real-time monitoring of biofilm formation. The miniaturized nature of these systems allows for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial agents and novel antifouling materials. Furthermore, we examine how microfluidics facilitates the investigation of biofilm-host interactions and the development of personalized treatment strategies. This review underscores the potential of microfluidic technologies in advancing our understanding of biofilm biology and combating biofilm-related challenges."}
