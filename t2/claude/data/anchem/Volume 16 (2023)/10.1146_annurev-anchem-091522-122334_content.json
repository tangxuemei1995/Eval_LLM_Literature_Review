{"Abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive introduction to micro- and nanoscale electrochemical additive manufacturing techniques for beginners. We explore various approaches, including meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED), FluidFM, scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), and electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP). These methods leverage electrodeposition principles to achieve high-resolution 3D printing at the micro- and nanoscale. We discuss the fundamental concepts, experimental setups, and key parameters governing each technique. Additionally, we highlight recent advancements, applications, and future prospects in fields such as microelectronics, sensors, and tissue engineering. This guide aims to equip newcomers with essential knowledge and insights into this rapidly evolving field, fostering innovation and interdisciplinary research in micro- and nanoscale fabrication."}
