{"Abstract": "This review explores label-free electrochemical methods for disease detection, highlighting recent advancements in biosensing and diagnostics. We discuss various electrochemical techniques that enable rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective detection of disease biomarkers without the need for labeling agents. The principles of label-free electrochemical sensing are examined, along with their applications in detecting a wide range of diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. We also address the challenges and limitations of these methods, as well as potential future developments in the field. This comprehensive overview demonstrates the significant potential of label-free electrochemical approaches in revolutionizing disease diagnostics and improving patient outcomes through early and accurate detection."}
