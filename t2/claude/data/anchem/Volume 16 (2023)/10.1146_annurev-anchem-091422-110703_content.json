{"Abstract": "Electrochemical imaging techniques have emerged as powerful tools for investigating interfaces in energy storage systems, particularly in batteries. This review focuses on scanning probe methods, including scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), highlighting their applications in energy storage research. We discuss recent advancements in these techniques, emphasizing their ability to provide high-resolution spatial and temporal information on interfacial processes. The integration of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with electrochemical imaging is explored, showcasing enhanced capabilities for correlating topographical and electrochemical data. Furthermore, we examine the growing role of automation and deep learning in data acquisition and analysis, which are revolutionizing the field. Finally, we present future prospects and challenges for electrochemical imaging in energy storage research, emphasizing its potential to drive innovations in battery technology and other energy storage devices."}
