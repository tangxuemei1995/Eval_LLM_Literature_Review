{"Abstract": "This review explores recent advancements in direct mass spectrometry technologies for tissue analysis and their emerging medical applications. We focus on mass spectrometry imaging techniques and ambient ionization methods, highlighting their potential in clinical diagnostics. The development of handheld mass spectrometry-based devices is discussed, emphasizing their role in point-of-care testing and intraoperative decision-making. We examine the integration of these technologies with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. The review also addresses current challenges, including standardization of protocols, data interpretation, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, we present future perspectives on the integration of direct mass spectrometry technologies into routine clinical practice, potentially revolutionizing disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and personalized medicine approaches."}
