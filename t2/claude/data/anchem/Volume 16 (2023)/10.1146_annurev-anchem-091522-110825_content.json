{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 highlighted the need for advanced analytical techniques to characterize petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine environments. This review examines emerging chemical methods for analyzing these complex mixtures, focusing on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), black carbon analysis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. ICP-MS offers high sensitivity for trace element detection in oil and DOM, while black carbon analysis provides insights into the fate of recalcitrant hydrocarbons. Fluorescence techniques enable rapid, non-destructive characterization of DOM composition and source. These methods, combined with traditional approaches, enhance our understanding of oil spill impacts on marine ecosystems and improve monitoring and remediation strategies. The integration of these techniques promises to advance our ability to track the transformation and persistence of petrogenic DOM in aquatic environments following oil spills."}
