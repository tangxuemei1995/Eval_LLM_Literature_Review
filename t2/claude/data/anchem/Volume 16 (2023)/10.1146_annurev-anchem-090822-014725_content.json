{"Abstract": "CRISPR-based biosensing strategies have emerged as powerful tools for detecting nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity. This review explores the technical developments and application prospects of CRISPR-based biosensors. We discuss the fundamental principles of CRISPR systems and their adaptation for biosensing applications, focusing on Cas9, Cas12, and Cas13 enzymes. Recent advancements in signal amplification, multiplexing, and readout methods are examined, highlighting their potential to enhance detection limits and broaden the range of detectable targets. We also address the challenges and limitations of current CRISPR-based biosensors and propose potential solutions. Finally, we explore the diverse applications of these biosensors in fields such as medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize point-of-care testing and rapid detection systems."}
