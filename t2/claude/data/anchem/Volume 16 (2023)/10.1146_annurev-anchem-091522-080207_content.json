{"Abstract": "This review explores the pivotal role of gels in microscale electrophoresis, focusing on capillary and microfluidic platforms. We examine the evolution of sieving matrices and their impact on separating biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans. The article discusses recent advancements in gel formulations, including novel polymer blends and stimuli-responsive materials, which have significantly enhanced separation efficiency and resolution. We also address the challenges and opportunities in gel-based microscale electrophoresis, such as improving reproducibility, reducing analysis time, and expanding the range of analyzable molecules. Furthermore, we highlight emerging applications in fields like genomics, proteomics, and glycomics, emphasizing the technique's potential for high-throughput analysis and integration with other analytical methods. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the current state and future directions of gel-based microscale electrophoresis."}
