{"Abstract": "Single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques have revolutionized our understanding of molecular dynamics in biological systems. This review highlights recent advances in this rapidly evolving field. We discuss improvements in feedback-control tracking systems, which enable prolonged observation of individual molecules with enhanced spatiotemporal resolution. Point-spread-function engineering has expanded the capabilities of 3D tracking, allowing for precise localization of molecules in complex cellular environments. Multiple plane microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for simultaneous imaging of molecules across different focal planes. We also examine progress in trajectory analysis methods, including novel algorithms for extracting meaningful information from large datasets. Additionally, we explore advancements in clustering analysis techniques, which provide insights into molecular interactions and spatial organization. These developments collectively contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of molecular behavior in living cells, opening new avenues for research in cell biology, biophysics, and drug discovery."}
