{"Abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a powerful tool for nondestructive 3D pathology, offering unprecedented insights into tissue architecture and cellular interactions. This review explores the application of LSFM in translational research and clinical assays, highlighting its potential to revolutionize precision medicine. We discuss the integration of LSFM with computational and digital pathology techniques, enabling high-resolution spatial biology analyses. The optical-sectioning capabilities of LSFM allow for rapid, large-scale imaging of intact specimens, preserving spatial context and reducing artifacts associated with traditional histological methods. We examine recent advancements in LSFM technology, including improved clearing techniques and multi-view imaging, which enhance its utility in diverse biomedical applications. Finally, we address the challenges and opportunities for implementing LSFM in clinical settings, emphasizing its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide personalized treatment strategies."}
