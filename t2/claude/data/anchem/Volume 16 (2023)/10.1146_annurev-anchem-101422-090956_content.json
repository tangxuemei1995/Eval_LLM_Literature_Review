{"Abstract": "Digital histopathology using infrared spectroscopic imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for disease diagnosis and tissue characterization. This technique combines the chemical specificity of infrared spectroscopy with high-resolution imaging capabilities, enabling the visualization and analysis of tissue samples at the molecular level. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms, researchers can extract valuable information from spectral data, leading to improved accuracy in tissue classification and disease detection. This review explores recent advancements in infrared spectroscopic imaging for digital histopathology, highlighting its potential to revolutionize pathology workflows and enhance diagnostic precision. We discuss the principles of chemical imaging, data processing techniques, and the integration of artificial intelligence for automated tissue analysis. Furthermore, we examine the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing this technology in clinical settings, emphasizing its potential to complement traditional histopathology methods and contribute to personalized medicine."}
