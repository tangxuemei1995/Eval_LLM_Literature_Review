{"Abstract": "The Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TORC2) is a crucial protein kinase complex involved in various cellular processes in yeast. This study investigates the regulation of TORC2 function and localization, focusing on its subunits, plasma membrane (PM) association, and interactions with phosphoinositides and endosomes. We demonstrate that specific subunits play key roles in TORC2 localization to the PM, while phosphoinositides contribute to its membrane recruitment. Our findings reveal a dynamic interplay between TORC2 and endosomes, suggesting a potential mechanism for spatiotemporal regulation of its activity. Furthermore, we identify novel phosphorylation sites on TORC2 subunits that modulate its function and localization. This research provides insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms governing TORC2 activity and highlights the importance of subcellular localization in its signaling pathways, advancing our understanding of this essential protein kinase complex in yeast cellular processes."}
