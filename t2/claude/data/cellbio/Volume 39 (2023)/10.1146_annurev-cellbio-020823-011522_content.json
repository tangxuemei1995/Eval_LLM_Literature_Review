{"Abstract": "Morphogens play a crucial role in tissue development during embryogenesis by establishing concentration gradients that regulate gene expression patterns. This review explores the mechanisms by which morphogens control tissue development through their interactions with gene regulatory networks. We examine the diffusion-based models of morphogen gradient formation and discuss recent advances in understanding how these gradients are interpreted by cells to generate precise spatial patterns. The review also highlights the importance of feedback loops and cross-talk between different morphogen pathways in fine-tuning developmental processes. Finally, we consider the implications of morphogen-mediated tissue development for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications."}
