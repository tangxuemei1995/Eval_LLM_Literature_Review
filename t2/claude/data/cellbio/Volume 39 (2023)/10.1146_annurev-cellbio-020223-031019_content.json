{"Abstract": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process involving dynamic interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). This review explores the crucial roles of cell adhesion molecules, particularly integrins and cadherins, in mediating these interactions and driving tissue formation. We examine how interfacial tension, generated by differential adhesion and cortical contractility, influences cell behavior and tissue architecture. The ECM, especially the basement membrane, is discussed as a key regulator of cellular organization and differentiation. We highlight recent advances in understanding the bidirectional communication between cells and the matrix, including mechanotransduction pathways and matrix remodeling. Furthermore, we address how these cell-matrix interactions contribute to the emergence of tissue-scale properties and pattern formation during development. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying tissue morphogenesis and their implications for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering."}
