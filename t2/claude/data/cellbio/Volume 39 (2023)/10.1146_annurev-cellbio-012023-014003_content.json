{"Abstract": "The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a powerful model system in cell and developmental biology, offering unique insights into evolutionary processes. This species exists in two distinct morphs: a surface-dwelling form and multiple cave-dwelling populations. The cave-dwelling morphs have undergone remarkable adaptations, including eye degeneration and pigment loss, in response to their dark, nutrient-poor environment. This review explores the significance of A. mexicanus in evo-devo research, highlighting its contributions to our understanding of developmental plasticity, genetic basis of trait evolution, and the interplay between genetics and environment. We discuss key studies that have utilized this species to investigate eye development, pigmentation, and metabolic adaptations. The Mexican tetra's ability to produce viable hybrids between surface and cave morphs further enhances its value as a model organism. This review underscores the importance of A. mexicanus in advancing our knowledge of evolutionary developmental biology and its potential for future discoveries."}
