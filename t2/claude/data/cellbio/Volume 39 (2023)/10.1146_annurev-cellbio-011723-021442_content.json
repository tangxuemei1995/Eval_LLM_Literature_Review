{"Abstract": "The endometrium exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity, undergoing cyclical remodeling during menstruation and extensive tissue repair following pregnancy and parturition. This review explores the mechanisms underlying endometrial regeneration and fibrosis, with a focus on stem cell populations and their role in tissue homeostasis. We examine the interplay between various cellular and molecular factors that contribute to successful endometrial repair and discuss how dysregulation of these processes can lead to pathological conditions such as Asherman syndrome and intrauterine adhesions. Recent advances in understanding the role of endometrial stem cells in regeneration are highlighted, along with potential therapeutic approaches for treating endometrial disorders. Additionally, we consider the implications of these findings for improving reproductive outcomes and developing novel strategies for endometrial regeneration in clinical settings."}
