{"Abstract": "The tubulin code, a complex system of tubulin isoforms and posttranslational modifications, plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule function and dynamics. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the tubulin code and its implications for health and disease. We discuss the diverse array of tubulin isoforms and their tissue-specific expression patterns, as well as the various posttranslational modifications, including detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation. These modifications collectively contribute to the functional diversity of microtubules, influencing cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal development. Furthermore, we examine how dysregulation of the tubulin code can lead to various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Understanding the intricate interplay between tubulin isoforms, posttranslational modifications, and microtubule-associated proteins provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for treating microtubule-related diseases."}
