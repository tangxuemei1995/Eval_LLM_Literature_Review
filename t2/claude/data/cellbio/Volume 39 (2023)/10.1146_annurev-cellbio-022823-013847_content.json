{"Abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in gene regulation, yet their dynamic behavior within living cells remains poorly understood. Recent advances in single-molecule tracking techniques have revolutionized our ability to observe TF dynamics in real-time, providing unprecedented insights into their search mechanisms, binding kinetics, and interactions with chromatin. This review synthesizes the latest findings on TF dynamics at the single-molecule level, highlighting their implications for transcriptional bursting and genome organization. We discuss how TFs navigate the complex nuclear environment, engage with target sites, and contribute to the formation of transcriptional hubs. Furthermore, we explore the interplay between TF dynamics and chromatin structure, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation. By integrating these single-molecule observations with broader genomic and cellular contexts, we present a comprehensive view of TF function and its impact on gene regulation."}
