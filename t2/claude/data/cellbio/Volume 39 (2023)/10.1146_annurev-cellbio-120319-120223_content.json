{"Abstract": "The Toll signaling pathway, originally identified for its role in insect immunity, has undergone neofunctionalization in various insect lineages to regulate dorsoventral patterning during embryogenesis. This study investigates the evolutionary trajectory of Toll signaling across diverse insect orders, including Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus, as well as non-insect hexapods. We examine the pathway's involvement in embryonic patterning, germ layer formation, and the development of extraembryonic tissues. Our findings reveal a complex pattern of functional diversification, with Toll signaling playing crucial roles in mesoderm specification, serosa formation, and the production of serosal and blastodermal cuticles. This research provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of embryonic patterning and highlights the plasticity of signaling pathways in adapting to new developmental functions across insect lineages."}
