{"Abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a crucial role in protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have revealed that dysregulation of tRNA metabolism is implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. This review explores the multifaceted involvement of tRNAs in neurological diseases, focusing on aberrations in tRNA biogenesis, modifications, and aminoacylation. We discuss the impact of mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, tRNA splicing defects, and alterations in tRNA-modifying enzymes on neuronal function. Additionally, we examine the role of angiogenin-mediated tRNA cleavage and its connection to the integrated stress response in neurodegenerative processes. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the pathogenesis of neurological disorders and opens avenues for potential therapeutic interventions targeting tRNA-related pathways. This comprehensive analysis highlights the emerging significance of tRNA dysregulation in neurological diseases and its implications for future research and treatment strategies."}
