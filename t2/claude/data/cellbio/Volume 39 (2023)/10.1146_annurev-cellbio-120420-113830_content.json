{"Abstract": "The traditional paradigm of tissue biology, centered on cell types as fundamental units, is being challenged by emerging evidence. This review explores a new perspective that emphasizes the importance of cell relations and tissue modules in understanding tissue organization. We examine how cells dynamically interact within their microenvironment, forming functional units that transcend rigid cell type classifications. The concept of tissue modules is introduced as a more flexible framework for comprehending tissue structure and function. We discuss how this paradigm shift impacts our understanding of tissue evolution, development, and self-organization. By integrating insights from various disciplines, including molecular biology, systems biology, and evolutionary developmental biology, we propose a more holistic approach to tissue biology. This new paradigm has significant implications for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and our overall understanding of biological complexity."}
