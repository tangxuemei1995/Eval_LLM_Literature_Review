{"Abstract": "This study employs advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques to track the complete lifecycle of mRNAs in individual cells. We investigate the dynamic processes of transcription, splicing, RNA localization, translation, and mRNA decay at single-molecule resolution. Our findings reveal intricate spatiotemporal patterns in mRNA behavior, providing insights into gene expression regulation at the cellular level. This comprehensive approach allows for a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between various stages of mRNA processing and their impact on cellular function, offering new perspectives on post-transcriptional gene regulation mechanisms."}
