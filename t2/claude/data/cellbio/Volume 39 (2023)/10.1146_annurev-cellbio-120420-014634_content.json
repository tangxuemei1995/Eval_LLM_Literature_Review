{"Abstract": "RBG motif Bridge-Like Lipid Transport Proteins (BLTPs) are a recently discovered family of proteins that play crucial roles in intracellular lipid transport and membrane dynamics. This review focuses on the structural and functional aspects of key BLTP members, including VPS13, ATG2, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164. These proteins share a conserved RBG motif and exhibit elongated structures that facilitate lipid transfer between organelles. We discuss the latest findings on their molecular mechanisms, subcellular localizations, and physiological functions in various cellular processes, such as autophagy, lipid droplet formation, and synaptic vesicle recycling. Additionally, we highlight the emerging connections between BLTP dysfunction and human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Finally, we address open questions and future research directions in the field, emphasizing the potential of BLTPs as therapeutic targets for lipid-related pathologies."}
