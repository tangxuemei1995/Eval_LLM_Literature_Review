{"Abstract": "The vertebrate retina, a complex neural tissue responsible for vision, undergoes a remarkable transformation during embryonic development. This review provides a comprehensive overview of retinal morphogenesis, from the initial formation of the optic cup to the establishment of the mature, laminated structure. We examine the key molecular and cellular mechanisms driving retinal shape and growth, including the roles of extracellular matrix components, cell adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The process of neuronal migration is explored in detail, highlighting the importance of both intrinsic genetic programs and extrinsic environmental cues in guiding retinal progenitor cells to their final destinations within the developing tissue. Recent advances in live imaging techniques and genetic manipulation tools have provided unprecedented insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of retinal morphogenesis. We discuss how these findings have enhanced our understanding of normal retinal development and shed light on the etiology of congenital eye disorders. Finally, we consider the implications of this knowledge for regenerative medicine approaches aimed at treating retinal degenerative diseases."}
