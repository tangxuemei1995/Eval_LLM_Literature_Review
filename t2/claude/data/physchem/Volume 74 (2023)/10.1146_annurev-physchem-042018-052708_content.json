{"Abstract": "This study investigates the formation of stable glasses through surface-mediated equilibration during physical vapor deposition. We demonstrate that enhanced surface mobility facilitates the creation of glasses with exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability. By carefully controlling deposition parameters, we produce glasses with structural anisotropy and properties far surpassing those of conventional glasses formed by cooling liquids. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between deposition temperature and the resulting glass stability, with optimal conditions occurring at approximately 85% of the glass transition temperature. We observe significant reductions in enthalpy and improved resistance to crystallization in these vapor-deposited glasses. This research provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms of stable glass formation and opens new avenues for designing materials with tailored properties for various applications in optoelectronics, pharmaceuticals, and advanced materials science."}
