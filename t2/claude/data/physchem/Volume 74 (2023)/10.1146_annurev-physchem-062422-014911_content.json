{"Abstract": "This study investigates the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, focusing on the steady-state behavior of metallic nanoparticles under illumination. We explore the interplay between nonthermal carriers, hot electrons, and thermal effects using advanced Raman thermometry techniques. Our findings reveal that the steady-state temperature distribution around plasmonic nanoparticles is governed by a complex balance of energy transfer processes. We demonstrate that hot electron generation and relaxation play a crucial role in determining the local temperature profile and overall photocatalytic activity. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes underlying plasmonic heating and offer new avenues for optimizing the design of nanostructures for applications in photocatalysis and photothermal therapy."}
