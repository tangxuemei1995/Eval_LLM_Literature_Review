{"Abstract": "This study investigates the adsorption behavior of ions at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces within nanopores. We employ advanced surface complexation modeling techniques to elucidate the impact of nanoconfinement on ion speciation and adsorption mechanisms. Our results reveal significant deviations from bulk adsorption behavior in nanoporous environments, attributed to the enhanced surface-to-volume ratio and altered electrostatic interactions. We observe a pronounced effect of pore size on adsorption capacity and selectivity, with smaller pores exhibiting unique adsorption characteristics. The study also highlights the importance of considering nanoconfinement effects in predicting and interpreting adsorption phenomena in nanoporous materials. These findings have important implications for various applications, including water purification, energy storage, and environmental remediation. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of interfacial chemistry in nanoconfined spaces and provides valuable insights for the design and optimization of nanoporous adsorbents."}
