{"Abstract": "This study investigates the optical signatures of stochastic processes in many-body exciton scattering, focusing on excitation-induced dephasing and its impact on coherent nonlinear spectroscopy. We employ quantum stochastic calculus to model the complex interactions between excitons in semiconductor nanostructures, revealing how many-body effects influence quantum dynamics. Our theoretical framework combines advanced spectroscopic techniques with sophisticated mathematical tools to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of exciton-exciton interactions. We demonstrate that stochastic fluctuations in the local environment significantly affect the coherence and relaxation dynamics of excitons, leading to distinct spectral features in nonlinear optical measurements. These findings provide crucial insights into the fundamental nature of many-body phenomena in quantum systems and offer new avenues for interpreting and manipulating exciton dynamics in advanced optoelectronic devices."}
