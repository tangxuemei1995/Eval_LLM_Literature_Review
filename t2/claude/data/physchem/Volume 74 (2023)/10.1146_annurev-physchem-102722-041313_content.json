{"Abstract": "We present a novel in situ transient absorption spectroscopy technique for real-time monitoring of excited-state dynamics during organic thin film deposition and processing. This method employs a single-shot approach, enabling high-speed data acquisition with microsecond time resolution. We demonstrate the capabilities of this instrument by studying the evolution of excited-state dynamics during vacuum thermal evaporation of small molecule organic semiconductors and subsequent thermal annealing. The results reveal rapid changes in exciton dynamics as molecular aggregation occurs during film growth and morphological reorganization. This technique provides unprecedented insight into the formation of intermolecular interactions and their impact on photophysical properties. The ability to probe excited-state dynamics in situ during film fabrication and processing opens new avenues for understanding and optimizing organic semiconductor materials for optoelectronic applications."}
