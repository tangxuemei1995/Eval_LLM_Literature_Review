{"Abstract": "Isotope effects play a crucial role in understanding atmospheric processes and climate dynamics. This review explores the significance of mass-independent fractionation (MIF) in atmospheric chemistry, with a focus on ozone and the 17O anomaly. MIF, a departure from traditional mass-dependent isotope fractionation, has revolutionized our understanding of atmospheric reactions and trace gas cycling. The unique isotopic signature of ozone, characterized by enrichment in heavy isotopes, serves as a valuable tracer for atmospheric oxidation processes. We examine the mechanisms underlying MIF in ozone formation and its implications for atmospheric chemistry. The 17O anomaly, a consequence of MIF, provides insights into the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and the global oxygen cycle. This review highlights the importance of isotope effects in unraveling complex atmospheric interactions and their potential applications in climate research and paleoclimate reconstructions."}
