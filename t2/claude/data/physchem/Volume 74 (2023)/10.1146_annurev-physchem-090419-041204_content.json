{"Abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach to investigate local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder using site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy. By incorporating fluorescent dimer probes at specific locations along the DNA backbone, we employ 2D spectroscopy to analyze the exciton coupling between adjacent fluorophores. This method enables high-resolution mapping of DNA structural dynamics, including backbone flexibility and conformational changes associated with protein-DNA interactions and DNA replication. Our findings reveal previously unobserved local conformational fluctuations and provide insights into DNA breathing phenomena. The site-specific fluorescence labeling technique allows for precise examination of DNA structural variations in different sequence contexts and under various physiological conditions. This innovative approach offers a powerful tool for elucidating the intricate relationship between DNA structure, dynamics, and biological function, with potential applications in understanding DNA-protein recognition and replication mechanisms."}
