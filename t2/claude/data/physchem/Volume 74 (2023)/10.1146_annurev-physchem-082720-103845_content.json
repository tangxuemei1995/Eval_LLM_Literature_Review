{"Abstract": "This review explores the challenges and advancements in gas-phase computational spectroscopy for studying the molecular bricks of life. We focus on the complexities of predicting rotational and vibrational spectra for these biologically relevant molecules, which often exhibit significant flexibility and anharmonicity. The paper discusses state-of-the-art computational methods and their limitations in accurately modeling the spectroscopic properties of amino acids, nucleobases, and other fundamental biomolecules. We highlight the importance of considering conformational landscapes and anharmonic effects to improve spectral predictions. Additionally, we examine recent progress in addressing these challenges, including the development of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approaches and machine learning techniques. The review concludes by identifying future research directions and emphasizing the critical role of computational spectroscopy in understanding the molecular basis of life."}
