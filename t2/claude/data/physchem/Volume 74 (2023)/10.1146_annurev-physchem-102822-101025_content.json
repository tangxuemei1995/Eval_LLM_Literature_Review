{"Abstract": "The artificial force induced reaction (AFIR) method has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring potential energy surfaces and discovering reaction pathways in complex chemical systems. This review examines recent advancements in the AFIR method and its applications to ab initio reaction discovery. We discuss the theoretical foundations of AFIR, including its integration with quantum chemical calculations and its ability to generate comprehensive reaction path networks. The method's effectiveness in predicting novel reaction mechanisms and intermediates is highlighted through case studies in organic synthesis. We also explore the coupling of AFIR-generated reaction networks with kinetic simulations to provide insights into reaction dynamics and selectivity. Furthermore, we address current challenges and limitations of the AFIR method, such as computational cost and the treatment of solvent effects. Finally, we outline future directions for improving the AFIR methodology and expanding its applicability to a broader range of chemical problems."}
