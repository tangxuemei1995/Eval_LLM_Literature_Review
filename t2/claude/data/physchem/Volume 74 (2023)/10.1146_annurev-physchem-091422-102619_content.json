{"Abstract": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) has revolutionized biological imaging, yet its photoacid dynamics remain incompletely understood. This study employs ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, including stimulated Raman spectroscopy, to investigate the proton transfer mechanism in GFP. We observe coherent oscillations in the fluorescence signal, indicating quantum coherence effects in the proton transfer process. Our results suggest that proton tunneling plays a significant role in the excited-state dynamics of GFP. We propose a model incorporating both classical and quantum mechanical aspects of proton transfer, reconciling previous conflicting observations. These findings not only enhance our understanding of GFP's photophysics but also have implications for the design of novel fluorescent proteins and optogenetic tools. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the fundamental nature of proton transfer in biological systems."}
