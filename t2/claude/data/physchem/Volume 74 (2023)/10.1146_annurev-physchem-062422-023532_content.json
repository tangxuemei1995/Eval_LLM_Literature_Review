{"Abstract": "Understanding many-body effects in aqueous systems is crucial for accurate molecular simulations and force field development. This study explores the synergies between advanced interaction analysis techniques and polarizable force field development for aqueous systems. We employ a combination of ab initio calculations, many-body expansion methods, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the complex interplay of intermolecular interactions in water clusters and bulk water. Our results reveal significant contributions from three-body and higher-order terms, highlighting the limitations of pairwise additive models. We demonstrate how incorporating these many-body effects into polarizable force fields leads to improved accuracy in predicting structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties of water. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach for systematically refining force field parameters based on the analysis of many-body interactions. This work provides valuable insights into the nature of aqueous interactions and offers a framework for developing more accurate and transferable force fields for molecular simulations of complex aqueous systems."}
