{"Abstract": "Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) have garnered significant attention due to their unique optical properties and potential applications in various fields. This review explores the phenomena of photodarkening and photobrightening in UCNPs, with a focus on the role of color centers in emerging applications. We discuss the mechanisms underlying these photoinduced effects and their impact on UCNP performance. The review highlights recent advancements in exploiting color centers for novel applications, including photon avalanching, photoswitching, X-ray detection, and optical patterning. We examine the challenges and opportunities associated with controlling and manipulating color centers in UCNPs, as well as their potential for enhancing the functionality and efficiency of lanthanide-based materials in cutting-edge technologies. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the future directions of UCNP research and development."}
