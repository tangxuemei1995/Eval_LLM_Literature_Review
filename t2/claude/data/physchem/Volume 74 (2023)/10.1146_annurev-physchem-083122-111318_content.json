{"Abstract": "Photosynthetic light harvesting is a fundamental process that enables organisms to capture and utilize solar energy. This review explores the ultrafast dynamics of light harvesting across diverse photosynthetic organisms, focusing on the strategies employed for acclimation to varying environmental conditions. We examine recent advances in understanding energy transfer mechanisms, including coherent and incoherent processes, and their role in optimizing light capture efficiency. The paper discusses how different organisms, from cyanobacteria to higher plants, have evolved unique adaptations in their light-harvesting complexes to maintain photosynthetic performance under fluctuating light conditions. We highlight the importance of structural flexibility, photoprotective mechanisms, and regulatory pathways in achieving rapid acclimation. Finally, we consider the implications of these findings for the design of artificial photosynthetic systems and the development of more resilient crops in the face of climate change."}
