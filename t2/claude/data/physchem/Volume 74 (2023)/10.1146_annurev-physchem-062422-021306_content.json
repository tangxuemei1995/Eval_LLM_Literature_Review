{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of anharmonic effects on the vibrational spectra of high-frequency modes in molecular systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that incorporates mode mixing, anharmonicities, and resonances to accurately model these complex vibrational phenomena. Our approach combines ab initio calculations with perturbation theory to account for the coupling between different vibrational modes and the anharmonic nature of potential energy surfaces. We demonstrate the significance of these effects in predicting spectral features, including frequency shifts, intensity changes, and the emergence of combination bands. The model is applied to a series of benchmark molecules, revealing substantial improvements in spectral predictions compared to traditional harmonic approximations. Our findings highlight the importance of considering anharmonic effects for a more accurate interpretation of high-resolution vibrational spectra, particularly in systems with strong inter-mode couplings or large-amplitude motions. This work provides valuable insights for spectroscopists and computational chemists seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations in vibrational spectroscopy."}
