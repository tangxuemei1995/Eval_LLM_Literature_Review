{"Abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) has become a cornerstone in electronic structure calculations, yet the quest for more accurate and efficient functionals continues. This study explores the synergistic effect of incorporating exact constraints and appropriate norms in the development of density functionals. We demonstrate that by carefully selecting and implementing exact constraints derived from known physical principles, combined with the use of appropriate norms for assessing functional performance, significant improvements in the predictive power of DFT can be achieved. Our results show enhanced accuracy in calculating exchange-correlation energies across a diverse set of molecular systems and solid-state materials. Furthermore, we propose a systematic approach for identifying and prioritizing constraints and norms that yield the most substantial improvements in functional performance. This work provides valuable insights into the fundamental nature of electron correlation and offers a promising direction for the next generation of density functionals with increased predictive capabilities."}
