{"Abstract": "This study investigates the spectroscopic properties of clusters relevant to atmospheric aerosols and new particle formation, with implications for climate research. Various spectroscopic techniques, including infrared, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopy, were employed to characterize the structure, composition, and dynamics of molecular clusters formed from common atmospheric constituents. The research focused on clusters involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, amines, and water, which play crucial roles in aerosol nucleation and growth. Results revealed distinct spectral signatures for different cluster sizes and compositions, providing insights into their formation mechanisms and stability. Additionally, the study explored the effects of temperature and relative humidity on cluster properties. These findings contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric new particle formation processes and their potential impacts on cloud formation and climate, enhancing the accuracy of global climate models."}
