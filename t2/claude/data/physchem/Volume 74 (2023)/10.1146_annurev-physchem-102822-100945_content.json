{"Abstract": "This review explores the modeling of excited states in molecular organic aggregates, crucial for understanding optoelectronic phenomena. We discuss various theoretical approaches, including exciton models and ab initio methods, to describe excited-state dynamics in these systems. The interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom is examined, focusing on radiative and nonradiative decay processes. Special attention is given to conical intersections, which play a pivotal role in ultrafast relaxation mechanisms. We also address singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation, two important processes in organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. The review highlights recent advances in computational techniques and their applications to predict and interpret spectroscopic observables. Finally, we outline challenges and future directions in modeling excited states of molecular aggregates for improved optoelectronic device design."}
