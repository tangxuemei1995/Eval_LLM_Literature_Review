{"Abstract": "Ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for probing elementary molecular events with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. This review explores the application of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) to investigate fundamental photochemical processes, focusing on conical intersections and their role in molecular dynamics. We discuss recent advancements in XFEL technology that enable the observation of electronic and structural changes on femtosecond timescales. The review highlights key experiments that have provided insights into excited-state dynamics, bond breaking, and formation processes. We examine how ultrafast X-ray probes have enhanced our understanding of energy transfer mechanisms and non-adiabatic transitions in complex molecular systems. Finally, we consider future prospects and challenges in the field, emphasizing the potential for ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy to revolutionize our comprehension of photochemical reactions and molecular behavior."}
