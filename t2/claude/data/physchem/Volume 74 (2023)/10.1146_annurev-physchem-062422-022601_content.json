{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging of microgels, enabling unprecedented insights into their complex internal structures. By combining advanced nanoscopy techniques with innovative fluorescence labeling strategies, we achieve high-resolution 3D visualization of polymer networks within adaptive microgel materials. Our method allows for precise 3D tracking of structural changes in response to external stimuli, revealing intricate details of microgel behavior at the nanoscale. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique through correlative microscopy, integrating super-resolution data with other imaging modalities. This powerful imaging approach provides a comprehensive understanding of microgel architecture and dynamics, paving the way for rational design of smart materials with tailored properties. Our findings have significant implications for various applications, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and responsive coatings."}
