{"Abstract": "This study investigates the magneto-optical properties of noble metal nanostructures, focusing on their unique plasmonic and superatomic characteristics. We explore the interplay between localized surface plasmon resonances and spin-polarized emission in these nanostructures, revealing novel magneto-optical phenomena. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including magnetic circular photoluminescence and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, we demonstrate the plasmon-mediated enhancement of magneto-optical effects in noble metal nanoparticles and clusters. Our findings highlight the role of superatomic electronic structures in modulating the spin-dependent optical responses of these systems. The observed magneto-optical properties are analyzed in the context of potential applications in nanophotonics, spintronics, and quantum information processing. This work provides new insights into the fundamental physics of noble metal nanostructures and paves the way for the development of advanced magneto-plasmonic devices."}
