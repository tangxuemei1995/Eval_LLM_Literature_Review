{"Abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role in protein quality control, ensuring proper folding and degradation of proteins. This study investigates the coordinated action of Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90 chaperones in maintaining ER proteostasis. Using a combination of biochemical and structural approaches, we elucidate the mechanisms by which these molecular chaperones cooperate to facilitate protein folding and target misfolded proteins for degradation. Our findings reveal a hierarchical chaperone network, where Hsp40 acts as a substrate recruiter, Hsp70 functions as a central folding mediator, and Hsp90 provides additional folding assistance for specific client proteins. We also demonstrate that this chaperone system is tightly regulated by co-chaperones and post-translational modifications, allowing for dynamic responses to cellular stress. This research provides new insights into the intricate protein quality control mechanisms in the ER and may have implications for understanding and treating protein folding disorders."}
