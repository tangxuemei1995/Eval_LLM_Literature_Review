{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling the determination of 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes at near-atomic resolution. This review explores the recent advancements and current limitations of high-resolution single-particle cryo-EM. We discuss the technological improvements in electron detectors, sample preparation techniques, and image processing algorithms that have propelled cryo-EM to achieve atomic resolution. The potential of cryo-EM to elucidate the structures of challenging targets, such as membrane proteins and dynamic complexes, is highlighted. However, we also address the remaining challenges, including beam-induced damage, optical aberrations, and heterogeneity in sample populations. Finally, we consider future prospects for overcoming these limitations and further expanding the capabilities of cryo-EM in structural biology research."}
