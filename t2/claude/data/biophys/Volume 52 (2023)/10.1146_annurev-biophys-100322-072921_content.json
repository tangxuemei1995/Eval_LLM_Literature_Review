{"Abstract": "Ball-and-chain inactivation is a crucial mechanism regulating the function of various ion channels, particularly voltage-gated K+ channels and Ca2+-activated K+ channels. This rapid inactivation process involves an N-terminal domain that acts as a tethered blocker, occluding the channel pore. Recent structural and functional studies have provided insights into the molecular basis of this mechanism, revealing similarities and differences across channel types. In voltage-gated K+ channels, the ball domain interacts with specific residues in the pore region, while in Ca2+-activated K+ channels, the process is modulated by intracellular Ca2+ levels. Interestingly, analogous mechanisms have been observed in Na+ channels, suggesting evolutionary conservation. Understanding the intricacies of ball-and-chain inactivation is essential for elucidating channel gating dynamics and developing targeted therapeutic interventions for channelopathies."}
