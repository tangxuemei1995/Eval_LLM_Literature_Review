{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods to investigate energy transduction mechanisms in biomolecular machines. We focus on key processes such as proton transfers, electron transfers, and nucleotide hydrolysis, which are fundamental to the function of these molecular systems. By combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical calculations for critical regions with the computational efficiency of molecular mechanics for the surrounding environment, our approach provides detailed insights into the complex interplay between electronic structure and conformational dynamics. Our results demonstrate the power of QM/MM techniques in elucidating the atomic-level mechanisms of energy conversion in various biomolecular machines, offering new perspectives on their function and potential applications in biotechnology and medicine."}
