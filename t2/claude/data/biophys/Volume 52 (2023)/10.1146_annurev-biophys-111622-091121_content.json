{"Abstract": "This review explores the application of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials in biomolecule sensing. We discuss the unique properties of these materials, including their high specific surface area (SSA) and tunable density of states (DOS), which make them ideal for sensing applications. The focus is on field-effect transistor (FET) based sensors and impedance models for detecting various biomolecules. We examine the role of defects in enhancing sensing performance and the challenges in standardizing 2D material-based sensors. The review also covers recent advancements in fabrication techniques and surface functionalization strategies to improve selectivity and sensitivity. Furthermore, we address the current limitations and future prospects of these materials in developing next-generation biosensors for healthcare, environmental monitoring, and food safety applications."}
