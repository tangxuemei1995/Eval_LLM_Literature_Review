{"Abstract": "The origin of the universal genetic code remains a fundamental question in molecular biology. This review explores the stereochemical hypothesis, which proposes that the code emerged from direct physicochemical interactions between amino acids and their cognate codons or anticodons. We examine recent experimental and computational evidence supporting this theory, focusing on noncovalent interactions between amino acids, tRNAs, and aminoacyl tRNA-synthetases. Additionally, we discuss the mRNAâ€“protein complementarity hypothesis, which suggests that coding sequences may have evolved to optimize interactions with their encoded proteins. By synthesizing findings from structural biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics, we evaluate the extent to which molecular recognition events in modern translation systems may reflect primordial coding mechanisms. This integrative approach provides new insights into the chemical logic underlying the genetic code and its potential evolutionary origins."}
