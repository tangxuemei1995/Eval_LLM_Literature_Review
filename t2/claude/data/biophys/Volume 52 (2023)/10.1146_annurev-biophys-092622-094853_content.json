{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial ion channels play a crucial role in cellular energy production and homeostasis. This review explores the diverse array of ion channels present in mitochondrial membranes, focusing on calcium channels, the mitochondrial megachannel, potassium channels, chloride channels, and porin. These channels regulate ion fluxes across mitochondrial membranes, influencing various cellular processes such as ATP synthesis, apoptosis, and calcium signaling. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter and the permeability transition pore are highlighted for their significance in calcium homeostasis and cell death pathways. Potassium channels, including ATP-sensitive and calcium-activated variants, are discussed in relation to their impact on mitochondrial function and cytoprotection. The role of chloride channels in volume regulation and the multifaceted functions of porin in metabolite transport are also examined. Understanding these ion channels provides valuable insights into mitochondrial physiology and potential therapeutic targets for mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases."}
