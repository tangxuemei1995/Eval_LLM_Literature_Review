{"Abstract": "The central dogma of molecular biology has been a cornerstone of our understanding of genetic information flow. However, recent advancements in synthetic biology have expanded this paradigm, introducing novel concepts such as genome resynthesis, orthogonal biosystems, and synthetic genetics. This review explores the cutting-edge developments in these fields, focusing on the creation of synthetic genomes, the incorporation of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) and xenonucleic acids (XNAs), and the design of orthogonal biological systems. We discuss the potential applications of these technologies in biotechnology, medicine, and fundamental research, as well as the challenges and ethical considerations associated with engineering life at its most basic level. The expanded central dogma represents a new frontier in biology, offering unprecedented opportunities to reprogram and create novel forms of life."}
