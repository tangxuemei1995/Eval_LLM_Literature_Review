{"Abstract": "The ribosome, a complex molecular machine, plays a crucial role in decoding and recoding mRNA sequences during protein synthesis. This review explores the intricate mechanisms of translation, focusing on the interplay between tRNA, EF-Tu, and EF-G in maintaining reading frame fidelity. We examine the kinetics of codon recognition and tRNA selection, highlighting the factors that contribute to translational accuracy. Additionally, we discuss programmed frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, two recoding events that allow for the production of alternative protein products. Recent advances in structural biology and single-molecule techniques have provided unprecedented insights into these processes, revealing the dynamic nature of ribosome-mRNA interactions. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for comprehending the regulation of gene expression and the evolution of protein diversity, with implications for both basic research and therapeutic applications."}
