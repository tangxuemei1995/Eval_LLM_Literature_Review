{"Abstract": "Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins play crucial roles in innate immunity across various organisms. This review explores the assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes, focusing on their structural and functional aspects. We discuss the mechanisms of NLR autoinhibition, ligand recognition, and activation, highlighting the similarities and differences between plant resistosomes and animal inflammasomes. The formation of higher-order complexes, including the NADase holoenzyme and resistosome channel, is examined in detail. Recent structural studies have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular basis of NLR-mediated immune responses, revealing intricate conformational changes and oligomerization processes. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting NLR-related diseases and enhancing plant immunity against pathogens."}
