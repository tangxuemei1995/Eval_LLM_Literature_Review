{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has revolutionized structural biology, enabling unprecedented insights into viral structures and host-pathogen interactions. Recent advancements in cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling have dramatically improved resolution and sample preparation, allowing for in situ visualization of viruses within their cellular context. This review highlights the latest technological developments in cryo-ET and their applications in virology, showcasing groundbreaking discoveries in viral entry, replication, and assembly processes. We discuss the potential of cryo-ET to unravel complex virus-host interactions and its implications for antiviral drug development and vaccine design, emphasizing the technique's growing importance in combating viral infections."}
