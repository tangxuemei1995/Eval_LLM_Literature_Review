{"Abstract": "Protein diffusion along biopolymer lattices plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription regulation, and microtubule dynamics. This study investigates the impact of electrostatics and disordered regions on protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and experimental techniques, we examine the diffusion coefficients of proteins with varying charge distributions and intrinsically disordered regions. Our results reveal that electrostatic interactions significantly influence the sliding behavior of proteins along DNA, with positively charged residues facilitating faster diffusion. Additionally, we demonstrate that disordered regions in proteins contribute to enhanced diffusion along microtubules by reducing friction and increasing conformational flexibility. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying protein search processes on biopolymer lattices and have implications for understanding cellular functions and developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting protein-lattice interactions."}
