{"Abstract": "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized our ability to visualize cellular structures at the nanoscale. However, extracting quantitative information from SMLM data remains challenging. This review explores recent advancements in quantitative SMLM, focusing on methods for accurate molecule counting, protein stoichiometry determination, and spatial distribution analysis. We discuss innovative approaches for overcoming technical limitations, such as fluorophore blinking and labeling efficiency variations. Additionally, we examine the integration of machine learning algorithms to enhance data interpretation and automate complex analyses. The combination of SMLM with complementary techniques, including correlative light and electron microscopy, is also addressed. By highlighting these developments, we emphasize the growing potential of SMLM as a powerful tool for quantitative cell biology research."}
