{"Abstract": "Rhodopsin, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crucial for vision, undergoes a complex activation process upon light stimulation. This review explores the structural and mechanistic aspects of rhodopsin activation, integrating recent advances in crystallography, spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss the conformational changes triggered by photon absorption, including the isomerization of the retinal chromophore and subsequent rearrangements in the transmembrane helices. The role of conserved motifs and key residues in signal transduction is examined, along with the interactions between rhodopsin and its G protein partner, transducin. Understanding these molecular events provides insights into GPCR function and may guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches for visual disorders."}
