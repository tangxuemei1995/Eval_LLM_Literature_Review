{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in time-resolved X-ray diffraction techniques have revolutionized our understanding of protein dynamics and mechanics. This review explores the cutting-edge approaches in serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography and time-resolved X-ray crystallography, highlighting their applications in studying protein excited states and conformational changes. We discuss the integration of electric field stimulation with these techniques, enabling the investigation of field-induced protein dynamics at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions. The synergy between these methods has provided invaluable insights into the structural basis of protein function, revealing transient intermediates and subtle conformational shifts previously inaccessible to traditional crystallographic approaches. Furthermore, we examine the challenges and future prospects of these emerging methodologies, including their potential to elucidate complex protein-ligand interactions and allosteric mechanisms. This review underscores the transformative impact of time-resolved X-ray diffraction on our comprehension of protein mechanics and its implications for drug discovery and protein engineering."}
