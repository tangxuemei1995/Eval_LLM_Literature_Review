{"Abstract": "Cooperative receptors play a crucial role in biological systems, enabling sensitive and specific responses to environmental stimuli. This review explores the rational design of cooperative receptors, focusing on the principles of allosterism, aptamer technology, and binding-induced folding. We discuss how these concepts can be harnessed in bioengineering and synthetic biology to create novel biosensors with enhanced performance. The population shift model is examined as a framework for understanding receptor behavior and guiding design strategies. We highlight recent advances in the field, including the development of aptamer-based cooperative receptors and their applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. By integrating insights from molecular biology, biophysics, and engineering, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and future directions in the rational design of cooperative receptors, with implications for advancing biosensor technology and synthetic biology applications."}
