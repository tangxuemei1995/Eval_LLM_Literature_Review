{"Abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are essential membrane proteins that play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including drug extrusion and lipid homeostasis. Dysfunction of these transporters is implicated in numerous human diseases, making them important targets for therapeutic interventions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure and mechanism of human ABC transporters, focusing on recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques. We discuss the conserved structural features of ABC transporters, including the transmembrane domains and nucleotide-binding domains, and their role in substrate translocation. The review also examines the conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis, which drive the transport cycle. Furthermore, we explore the substrate specificity and regulatory mechanisms of different ABC transporter subfamilies, highlighting their relevance in drug resistance and lipid trafficking. Understanding the structure-function relationships of human ABC transporters is crucial for developing targeted therapies and overcoming multidrug resistance in various diseases."}
