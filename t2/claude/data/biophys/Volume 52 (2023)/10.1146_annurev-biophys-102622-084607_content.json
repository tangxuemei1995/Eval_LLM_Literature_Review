{"Abstract": "This review critically examines the current state of protein structure prediction methods, focusing on the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) competitions. We analyze recent advancements in artificial intelligence-driven approaches, particularly deep learning techniques, that have revolutionized the field. The paper evaluates the performance of various algorithms in predicting both individual protein structures and protein-protein interactions. We discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, highlighting areas where significant progress has been made and identifying persistent challenges. The impact of improved prediction accuracy on biological research and drug discovery is explored. Additionally, we consider the future directions of the field, including the integration of multiple data sources and the potential for real-time structure prediction. This comprehensive assessment provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in structural biology, bioinformatics, and related disciplines."}
