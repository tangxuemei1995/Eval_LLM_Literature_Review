{"Abstract": "Multienzyme organization and encapsulation have emerged as powerful strategies in metabolic engineering to enhance pathway efficiency and product yield. This review explores the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these approaches, focusing on protein scaffolds and bacterial microcompartments. We discuss how spatial organization of enzymes can overcome diffusion limitations, reduce intermediate loss, and improve flux through metabolic pathways. The design principles and recent advances in synthetic protein scaffolds are examined, highlighting their potential to create artificial metabolons. Additionally, we analyze the structure, function, and engineering of bacterial microcompartments as natural protein-based organelles for enzyme encapsulation. The challenges and opportunities in applying these strategies to various biotechnological processes are addressed, providing insights into the future directions of multienzyme engineering for improved cellular factories and biocatalysts."}
