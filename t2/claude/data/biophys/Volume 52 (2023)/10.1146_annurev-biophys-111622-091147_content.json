{"Abstract": "This study explores the challenges and advancements in simulating complex biomolecular systems, focusing on the ribosome as a prime example. We review recent progress in computer simulations and molecular dynamics techniques applied to ribosomal structures, highlighting their integration with high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. The research examines how these computational approaches have enhanced our understanding of ribosomal function during translation and antibiotic interactions. We discuss the limitations of current simulation methods and propose strategies to overcome them, including improved force fields and enhanced sampling techniques. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining computational simulations with experimental data to unravel the intricate mechanisms of large biomolecular complexes, paving the way for more accurate predictions of drug-target interactions and the development of novel antibiotics."}
