{"Abstract": "Bacteriophages have long been a significant challenge in the dairy industry, particularly in cheese and yogurt production. This review examines recent advances in understanding phage-host interactions and the development of phage resistance strategies in lactic acid bacteria used in food fermentations. We discuss the evolution of phage defense mechanisms, including CRISPR-Cas systems and cell surface modifications, and their impact on bacterial survival in dairy environments. The role of conjugation in horizontal gene transfer of phage resistance traits is explored, highlighting its potential for improving starter culture robustness. While considerable progress has been made in mitigating phage-related issues, we argue that complete eradication remains elusive. Instead, a holistic approach combining improved starter culture design, process optimization, and phage monitoring is proposed as the most effective strategy for managing bacteriophages in dairy fermentations."}
