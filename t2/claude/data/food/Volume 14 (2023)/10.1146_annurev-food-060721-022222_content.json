{"Abstract": "This review explores the application of bioinformatic approaches in characterizing the molecular structure and function of food proteins. The integration of computational biology, protein modeling, and data science techniques has revolutionized our understanding of protein functionality in food systems. Advanced bioinformatic tools enable researchers to predict protein structures, analyze sequence-function relationships, and simulate protein-protein interactions. These methods provide valuable insights into the behavior of food proteins under various processing conditions and their impact on food quality. By leveraging large-scale genomic and proteomic data, researchers can identify novel functional properties and potential applications of food proteins. This review highlights recent advancements in bioinformatic approaches for food protein characterization and discusses their implications for food science and technology, emphasizing the potential for developing innovative food products with enhanced nutritional and functional properties."}
