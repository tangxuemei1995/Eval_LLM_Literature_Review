{"Abstract": "Ergothioneine, a unique dietary antioxidant, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potent cytoprotective properties. This review explores the distinctive characteristics of ergothioneine, focusing on its biosynthesis, absorption, and distribution in the human body. We discuss the role of the OCTN1 transporter in facilitating ergothioneine's cellular uptake and accumulation, particularly in mitochondria-rich tissues. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of ergothioneine are examined, highlighting its potential in mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation-related disorders. Furthermore, we analyze the growing body of evidence supporting ergothioneine's neuroprotective and cardioprotective functions. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of ergothioneine as a promising dietary compound with far-reaching implications for human health and disease prevention, warranting further investigation into its therapeutic potential."}
