{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential of mild fractionation techniques for producing sustainable food ingredients from plant sources. We investigate dry fractionation and mild wet separation methods to extract plant proteins while maintaining their functionality and minimizing resource use. The research compares these approaches to conventional protein isolation processes, focusing on their impact on protein yield, quality, and environmental footprint. Results demonstrate that mild fractionation techniques can effectively separate protein-rich fractions while preserving native protein structures and functional properties. Moreover, these methods significantly reduce water and energy consumption compared to traditional extraction processes. The study also examines the applicability of mildly fractionated ingredients in various food products, highlighting their potential to meet growing consumer demand for sustainable plant-based alternatives. Our findings suggest that mild fractionation offers a promising pathway for developing more environmentally friendly and functionally superior plant protein ingredients for the food industry."}
