{"Abstract": "This review explores strategies for targeting the interfacial location of phenolic antioxidants in emulsions to enhance their effectiveness in preventing lipid oxidation. The oil-water interface is a critical site for oxidation reactions in emulsion systems, making it an ideal target for antioxidant placement. We discuss various approaches to achieve interfacial localization, including the use of phenolipids and the creation of antioxidant reservoirs. The benefits of these strategies are examined, highlighting improved oxidative stability and extended shelf life of emulsion-based products. Additionally, we analyze the impact of antioxidant structure, emulsion composition, and environmental factors on interfacial behavior. This review provides insights into the design of more efficient antioxidant systems for emulsions, with potential applications in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Future research directions and challenges in optimizing interfacial antioxidant performance are also addressed."}
