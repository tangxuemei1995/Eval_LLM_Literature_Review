{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing food safety across the global supply chain. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, computer vision technologies, and predictive analytics, AI offers promising solutions to address critical challenges in food safety management. The research examines how AI can be applied to detect contaminants, predict potential outbreaks, and optimize supply chain processes. Key areas of focus include real-time monitoring of food production environments, automated quality control systems, and early warning mechanisms for foodborne illnesses. The study also investigates the integration of AI with existing food safety protocols and its impact on public health outcomes. Findings suggest that AI-driven approaches can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of food safety measures, potentially reducing the incidence of foodborne diseases and enhancing overall public health."}
