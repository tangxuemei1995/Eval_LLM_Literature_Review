{"Abstract": "Mechano-bactericidal surfaces have emerged as a promising solution for combating bacterial contamination in food processing and packaging. This review explores the mechanisms underlying the bactericidal properties of nanostructured surfaces and discusses various nanofabrication techniques used to create these surfaces. The potential applications of mechano-bactericidal surfaces in food-contact materials, processing equipment, and packaging are examined, highlighting their advantages over traditional antimicrobial approaches. Additionally, the challenges and future prospects for implementing these surfaces in the food industry are addressed, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize their performance and ensure their safety for food applications."}
