{"Abstract": "Microbubbles are emerging as a promising technology in the food industry, offering innovative solutions to address sustainability, food safety, and food security challenges. This review explores the applications of microbubbles in various aspects of food technology, including processing, preservation, and packaging. The unique properties of microbubbles, such as their high surface area-to-volume ratio and ability to generate localized physical and chemical effects, make them valuable tools for enhancing food quality and extending shelf life. Furthermore, microbubbles show potential in developing novel foods with improved nutritional profiles and sensory attributes. This paper examines recent advancements in microbubble technology, its impact on food production efficiency, and its role in promoting sustainable practices within the food industry. The integration of microbubbles in food technology presents opportunities for addressing global food security concerns while ensuring product safety and quality."}
