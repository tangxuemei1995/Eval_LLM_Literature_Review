{"Abstract": "The future of food lipids is poised for transformation through biotechnological advancements. This review explores the opportunities and challenges in utilizing microbial lipids and metabolic engineering to produce novel and sustainable lipid sources. We examine the potential of enzymatic modification techniques to create tailored structural lipids with enhanced nutritional and functional properties. The role of phospholipids in improving food quality and stability is also discussed. While these biotechnological approaches offer promising solutions to address global food security and nutrition challenges, several hurdles remain. These include scaling up production processes, ensuring cost-effectiveness, and addressing regulatory and consumer acceptance issues. Despite these challenges, the integration of biotechnology in food lipid production presents exciting possibilities for developing healthier, more sustainable, and functional food products. This review provides insights into the current state of research and future directions in this rapidly evolving field."}
