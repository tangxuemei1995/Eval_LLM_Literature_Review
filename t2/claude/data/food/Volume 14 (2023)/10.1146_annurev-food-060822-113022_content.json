{"Abstract": "Genebank collections represent a vast repository of plant genetic diversity, yet their potential as a source of health-promoting phytonutrients remains largely unexplored. This review examines the untapped potential of genebank collections in identifying metabolic signatures that could benefit human health. By leveraging natural variance within these collections and employing advanced plant metabolomics techniques, researchers can uncover novel phytonutrients and their associated health benefits. We discuss how integrating genomic, metabolomic, and nutritional data from diverse plant accessions can lead to the discovery of new bioactive compounds and inform crop improvement strategies. Furthermore, we explore the challenges and opportunities in translating these findings into practical applications for enhancing human nutrition and health. This approach not only maximizes the value of existing genebank resources but also opens new avenues for addressing global health challenges through targeted exploitation of plant metabolic diversity."}
