{"Abstract": "This review explores the emerging field of novel colloidal food ingredients, focusing on protein complexes and conjugates. The interactions between proteins and polysaccharides or polyphenols are examined, highlighting their potential to create innovative functional ingredients. These complexes and conjugates offer enhanced stability, improved emulsification properties, and increased bioavailability of bioactive compounds. The review discusses various methods of forming these colloidal structures, including electrostatic interactions, covalent bonding, and Maillard reactions. The impact of these novel ingredients on food texture, flavor, and nutritional value is evaluated. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities in scaling up production and incorporating these ingredients into food systems are addressed. This research provides valuable insights for food scientists and manufacturers seeking to develop healthier, more functional food products using advanced colloidal ingredients."}
