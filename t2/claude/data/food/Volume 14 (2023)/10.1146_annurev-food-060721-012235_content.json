{"Abstract": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has emerged as a valuable tool for simulating human gastrointestinal processes and evaluating food behavior during digestion. This review examines the applications of the INFOGEST model to various food systems, highlighting its utility in assessing nutrient bioavailability and bioaccessibility. We explore how the model has been employed to study the digestibility of macronutrients, release of bioactive compounds, and interactions between food components. The review also discusses the model's role in developing functional foods and nutraceuticals, as well as its potential for predicting the fate of food additives and contaminants. Furthermore, we address the limitations and challenges associated with the INFOGEST model, including the need for standardization and validation against in vivo data. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of the INFOGEST model in advancing our understanding of food digestion and its implications for human nutrition and health."}
