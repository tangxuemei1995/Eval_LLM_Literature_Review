{"Abstract": "This review examines the molecular changes occurring in meat proteins during various processing methods and their effects on quality and nutritional value. The study explores how thermal treatments, curing, fermentation, and other processing techniques alter protein structures and functionalities. These modifications can impact meat texture, flavor, and shelf-life, while also affecting digestibility and bioavailability of essential amino acids. The research highlights both positive and negative consequences of protein alterations, including potential health risks associated with certain processing methods. Understanding these molecular changes is crucial for optimizing meat processing techniques to enhance quality, maximize nutritional benefits, and minimize health concerns in processed meat products."}
