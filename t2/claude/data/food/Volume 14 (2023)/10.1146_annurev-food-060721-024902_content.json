{"Abstract": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous protein found in both animals and plants, exhibits a remarkable dual functionality that has garnered significant attention in recent research. This study explores the distinct roles of ferritin's holo and apo forms, focusing on their potential applications in iron supplementation and drug delivery systems, respectively. The holo form of ferritin, with its iron-rich core, demonstrates promising capabilities as an efficient and bioavailable source of iron supplementation, addressing widespread iron deficiency issues. Conversely, the apo form of ferritin, devoid of iron, presents a unique opportunity for developing targeted drug delivery systems due to its hollow cage-like structure. This review synthesizes current findings on ferritin's dual nature, highlighting its potential to revolutionize both nutritional interventions and pharmaceutical delivery strategies, while also discussing challenges and future directions in harnessing these properties for practical applications."}
