{"Abstract": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables, has garnered significant attention for its potential health benefits. This review explores the occurrence of I3C in various food sources and its conversion to the bioactive metabolite 3,3â€²-diindolylmethane (DIM). We examine the growing body of evidence supporting I3C's role in cancer prevention, immune modulation, and hormonal balance. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed, including I3C's ability to modulate key signaling pathways, influence gene expression, and regulate cell cycle progression. Additionally, we evaluate the bioavailability and safety of I3C supplementation, highlighting potential therapeutic applications. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the multifaceted health-promoting properties of I3C and its metabolites, emphasizing the importance of further research to fully elucidate its potential in disease prevention and treatment."}
