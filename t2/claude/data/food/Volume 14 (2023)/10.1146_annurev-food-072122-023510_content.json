{"Abstract": "This review explores enzymatic approaches for structuring starch to enhance its functionality in various applications. Starch, a versatile biopolymer, plays a crucial role in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial sectors. However, its native form often lacks desired properties for specific uses. Enzymatic modification offers a promising strategy to tailor starch's molecular structure and improve its functionality. This paper examines recent advancements in enzymatic techniques for starch structuring, focusing on the relationship between molecular alterations and resulting functional properties. We discuss the use of different enzymes, such as amylases, transglucosidases, and branching enzymes, to manipulate starch's chain length, branching patterns, and crystallinity. The impact of these modifications on starch's physicochemical characteristics, including gelatinization, retrogradation, and rheological properties, is analyzed. Furthermore, we highlight the potential applications of enzymatically structured starches in food texturing, controlled drug delivery systems, and biodegradable materials. This review provides insights into the current state of enzymatic starch modification and identifies future research directions for optimizing starch functionality across diverse industries."}
