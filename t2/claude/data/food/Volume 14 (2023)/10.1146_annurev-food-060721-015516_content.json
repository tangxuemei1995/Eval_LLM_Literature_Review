{"Abstract": "Dietary fiber interventions have shown promise in modulating the gut microbiome and improving health outcomes. However, individual responses to these interventions vary significantly, highlighting the need for personalized approaches. This review explores the potential of predicting personalized responses to dietary fiber interventions by leveraging advanced technologies and understanding the complex interactions between diet, gut microbiome, and host metabolism. We discuss the role of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in fiber metabolism and their potential as biomarkers for personalized nutrition strategies. The review also examines the opportunities for precision nutrition in tailoring dietary fiber interventions to individual microbiome profiles and metabolic responses. By integrating multi-omics data, machine learning algorithms, and mechanistic insights into fiber-microbiome interactions, we propose a framework for developing personalized prebiotic interventions that optimize health outcomes and address the challenges of inter-individual variability in dietary responses."}
