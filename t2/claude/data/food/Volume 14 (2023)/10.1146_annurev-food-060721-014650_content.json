{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the potential applications of bovine colostrum in veterinary and human health. Bovine colostrum, rich in immunoglobulins and bioactive proteins, has garnered attention as a functional food with diverse health benefits. The review synthesizes current research on its efficacy in supporting immune function, gastrointestinal health, and athletic performance in both animals and humans. It explores the mechanisms of action of key components, such as lactoferrin and growth factors, and evaluates the evidence for their therapeutic potential. Additionally, the review addresses challenges in colostrum processing, standardization, and regulatory considerations. Finally, it identifies gaps in current knowledge and suggests directions for future research to fully realize the potential of bovine colostrum in health applications."}
