{"Abstract": "This review explores the enzymatic production and food applications of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides for promoting intestinal health. These prebiotic compounds, resistant to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, serve as selective substrates for beneficial gut microbiota. We discuss various enzymatic methods for synthesizing functional oligosaccharides, including transgalactosylation, transglycosylation, and hydrolysis reactions. The prebiotic effects of these compounds on gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acid production, and immune modulation are examined. Additionally, we highlight the incorporation of functional oligosaccharides in diverse food products, such as dairy, bakery, and beverages, to enhance their nutritional value and health benefits. The review also addresses challenges in large-scale production, stability during food processing, and regulatory considerations. Overall, this comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of functional oligosaccharides as valuable ingredients for improving intestinal health through dietary interventions."}
