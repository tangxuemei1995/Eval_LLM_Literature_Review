{"Abstract": "This review explores recent advancements in metabolic engineering of edible plant oils to enhance their nutritional value. We discuss strategies for developing high oleic acid content, increasing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), and enriching plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E in seed oils. The application of gene editing techniques, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has revolutionized the field, enabling precise modifications of key metabolic pathways. We highlight successful examples of engineered oilseed crops with improved nutritional profiles and address challenges in commercialization and consumer acceptance. The potential impact of these innovations on human health and sustainable agriculture is also examined, emphasizing the importance of continued research in this rapidly evolving field."}
