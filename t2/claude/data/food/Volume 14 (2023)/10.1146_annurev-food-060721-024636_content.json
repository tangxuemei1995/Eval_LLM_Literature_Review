{"Abstract": "Microgreens have gained significant attention in recent years due to their high nutritional value and potential applications in various farming contexts. This comprehensive review explores the latest developments in microgreen cultivation for home, commercial, and space farming applications. We examine the nutritional profiles of different microgreen varieties and their potential contributions to food security. The paper also discusses advancements in microgreen production systems, including hydroponic and aeroponic techniques, as well as the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for optimized growth monitoring and management. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of microgreens in space farming, addressing challenges and opportunities for sustainable food production in extraterrestrial environments. This update provides valuable insights for researchers, farmers, and policymakers interested in leveraging microgreens to enhance nutrition, food security, and sustainable agriculture across diverse settings."}
