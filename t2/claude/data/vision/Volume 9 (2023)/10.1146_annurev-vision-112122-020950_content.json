{"Abstract": "The aging retina undergoes significant structural and functional changes that contribute to visual decline in older individuals. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular and cellular alterations associated with retinal aging. We examine age-related changes in retinal neurons, synapses, and supporting cells, highlighting the progressive loss of photoreceptors, alterations in synaptic connectivity, and modifications in neurotransmitter release. The review also explores the molecular landscapes of the aging retina, including changes in gene expression, protein homeostasis, and mitochondrial function. We discuss the accumulation of oxidative stress and inflammation, which play crucial roles in age-related retinal degeneration. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of these changes on visual processing and perception. Understanding the complex interplay of factors contributing to retinal aging is essential for developing targeted interventions to preserve vision and improve quality of life in the elderly population."}
