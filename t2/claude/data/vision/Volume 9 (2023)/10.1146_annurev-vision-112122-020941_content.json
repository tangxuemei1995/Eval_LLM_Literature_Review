{"Abstract": "This study explores the relationship between efficient coding and predictive processing in visual perception. We propose that these two fundamental principles of neural computation are intrinsically linked, representing two sides of the same coin. Using an information bottleneck framework, we demonstrate how neural networks can simultaneously optimize for both efficiency and prediction. Our experiments on natural image datasets reveal that networks trained to efficiently encode visual information also exhibit improved predictive capabilities. Conversely, networks optimized for prediction show enhanced coding efficiency. We analyze the emergent representations and find that they capture both low-level statistical regularities and high-level semantic features of visual scenes. These findings suggest a unified theoretical framework for understanding neural coding in the visual system, with implications for both biological and artificial vision systems. Our results provide new insights into the computational principles underlying visual perception and may inform the development of more efficient and robust computer vision algorithms."}
