{"Abstract": "The superior colliculus (SC) plays a crucial role in primate visual function and orienting behavior. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the SC's involvement in visual processing, eye movements, and active vision in primates. We examine the SC's layered structure and its diverse neuronal populations, which contribute to both sensory and motor functions. The SC's role in saccade generation, smooth pursuit, and fixation is discussed, along with its interactions with cortical and subcortical areas. We explore the SC's contribution to covert attention and its involvement in multisensory integration. Recent findings on the SC's role in active vision, including its participation in visual search and object recognition, are highlighted. Finally, we consider the evolutionary significance of the SC in primate visual behavior and discuss future research directions that may further elucidate its complex functions in visual cognition and motor control."}
