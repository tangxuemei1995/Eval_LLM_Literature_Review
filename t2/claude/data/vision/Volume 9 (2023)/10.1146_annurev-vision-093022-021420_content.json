{"Abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a complex disorder affecting premature infants, characterized by abnormal retinal vascularization. This review explores the pathophysiology of ROP, focusing on oxygen-induced retinopathy and its impact on angiogenesis. We examine the role of maternal-fetal interactions in ROP development and discuss key growth factors and cell signaling pathways involved in retinal vascularization. The two-phase model of ROP progression is analyzed, highlighting the initial vessel loss followed by pathological neovascularization. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in the premature retina. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving outcomes for infants at risk of ROP."}
