{"Abstract": "Visual fixations play a crucial role in human perception and cognition, yet accurately predicting where people look remains a challenging task. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art fixation prediction models, employing a novel unifying framework and taxonomy to compare their performance. We leverage information theory and transfer learning techniques to develop a more robust benchmarking methodology, addressing limitations in existing evaluation metrics. Our approach integrates saliency-based and cognitive models, considering both bottom-up and top-down factors influencing eye movements. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in capturing the complex nature of visual attention. Results reveal significant improvements in prediction accuracy and generalizability across different visual contexts. Furthermore, we identify key factors contributing to model success and propose guidelines for future research in fixation prediction. This work provides valuable insights into human visual behavior and offers a standardized approach for evaluating and developing more accurate fixation prediction models."}
