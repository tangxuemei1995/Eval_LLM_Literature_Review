{"Abstract": "Ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized our understanding of human visual cognition by providing unprecedented spatial resolution. This review explores the latest advancements in 7T and higher field strength imaging, focusing on their applications in studying cortical layers, columnar organization, and subcortical structures involved in visual processing. We discuss how these techniques have enabled researchers to investigate the fine-grained functional architecture of the visual system, revealing layer-specific activations and columnar-level representations. Additionally, we examine the challenges and limitations of ultra-high field imaging, including increased susceptibility artifacts and safety considerations. Finally, we highlight future directions and potential clinical applications of this cutting-edge technology in understanding visual cognition and related disorders."}
