{"Abstract": "Photoreceptor degenerative disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, are leading causes of blindness worldwide. As photoreceptors die, the retina undergoes extensive remodeling, further compromising visual function. This study investigates the potential of suppressing retinal remodeling to mitigate vision loss in these disorders. We employed a combination of in vivo imaging, electrophysiology, and molecular techniques to examine the effects of targeted interventions on synaptic plasticity and retinal circuit preservation in animal models. Our findings reveal that inhibiting specific signaling pathways involved in retinal remodeling can significantly slow the progression of vision loss and maintain retinal structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that early intervention is crucial for maximizing therapeutic efficacy. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of retinal degeneration and offer promising avenues for developing novel treatments to preserve vision in patients with photoreceptor degenerative disorders."}
