{"Abstract": "The rapid advancement of mobile technology has led to the development of numerous applications designed to assist individuals with visual impairments. This study examines the impact of mobile apps as assistive devices for visually impaired persons, focusing on their role in vision rehabilitation and enhancing accessibility. A comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical studies was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various apps across different domains of daily living. The research highlights the potential of mobile apps to significantly improve the quality of life for visually impaired individuals by providing tools for navigation, object recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and social interaction. However, the study also identifies challenges in app usability, user adoption, and the need for standardization in app development. Additionally, the research explores the integration of these apps with other assistive technologies and their potential to complement traditional vision rehabilitation methods. The findings suggest that while mobile apps show promise as cost-effective and readily available assistive devices, there is a need for further research to optimize their design and implementation. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on technological interventions for visual impairments and provides insights for developers, rehabilitation specialists, and policymakers to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of mobile apps for visually impaired users."}
