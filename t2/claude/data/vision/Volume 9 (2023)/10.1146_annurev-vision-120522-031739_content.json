{"Abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, leading to questions about their adequacy as models of human visual perception. This review examines the current state of research comparing deep neural networks to human visual processing, focusing on object recognition and related psychophysical phenomena. We analyze studies that evaluate the similarities and differences between human and machine vision, considering aspects such as generalization, robustness to visual perturbations, and sensitivity to contextual information. While deep neural networks show some alignment with human visual perception in certain tasks, significant discrepancies are observed in others. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding human vision and developing more biologically plausible computational models. Finally, we highlight promising directions for future research that may bridge the gap between artificial and biological visual systems, potentially leading to more comprehensive models of human visual perception."}
