{"Abstract": "This review examines the interplay between perception and memory processes in the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe, with a focus on the perirhinal cortex. Recent evidence challenges the traditional view of a clear distinction between perceptual and mnemonic functions in these brain regions. We synthesize findings from neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and lesion studies to propose an integrated model of perceptual-mnemonic processing along the ventral visual pathway. The perirhinal cortex emerges as a critical node, supporting both high-level object perception and recognition memory. We discuss how this region may resolve feature ambiguity in complex visual discriminations and contribute to familiarity-based recognition. Additionally, we explore the implications of this perceptual-mnemonic continuum for understanding cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative disorders affecting the medial temporal lobe. This integrated perspective offers new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual object processing and memory formation."}
