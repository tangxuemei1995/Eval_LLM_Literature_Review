{"Abstract": "This study investigates the cerebral cortex's role in visual search using natural scenes as stimuli. Rhesus monkeys were trained to perform visual search tasks while their neural activity was recorded from the visual cortex and frontal eye field. The use of natural scenes, as opposed to artificial stimuli, provided a more ecologically valid context for understanding visual processing. Results revealed distinct patterns of neural activity in both regions during search, with the visual cortex primarily encoding low-level features and the frontal eye field integrating this information to guide saccades. These findings enhance our understanding of how the brain processes complex visual environments and offer insights into the neural mechanisms underlying efficient visual search in natural settings."}
