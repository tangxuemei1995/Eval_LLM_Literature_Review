{"Abstract": "Recent advances in photobiology have revealed an expanding role for nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing physiology. These photosensitive proteins, distinct from classical visual opsins, are expressed in various tissues throughout the body and contribute to a range of light-dependent processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diverse functions of nonvisual opsins, focusing on their involvement in circadian rhythm regulation, metabolism, and other physiological processes. We explore the molecular mechanisms underlying extraocular photoreception and discuss how these light-sensing systems integrate environmental cues to modulate organismal physiology. The emerging picture suggests a complex network of light-responsive pathways that extend far beyond the visual system, with implications for human health, chronobiology, and potential therapeutic interventions. This expanding field highlights the pervasive influence of light on biological systems and opens new avenues for research in photobiology and chronophysiology."}
