{"Abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) technology has rapidly advanced in recent years, offering new possibilities for enhancing human perception and interaction with the environment. This review examines the perceptual science underlying AR display systems and their impact on visual perception. We explore key challenges in AR design, including depth perception, field of view limitations, and visual-vestibular conflicts. The paper discusses how AR systems can leverage human perceptual mechanisms to create more immersive and effective experiences. Additionally, we analyze the potential cognitive and perceptual benefits of AR in various applications, such as education, healthcare, and industrial settings. By synthesizing current research in visual perception and AR technology, this review provides insights for future developments in perceptually-optimized AR systems."}
