{"Abstract": "Three-dimensional vision is crucial for nonhuman primates' survival and interaction with their environment. This review synthesizes recent findings on neuronal representations underlying 3D vision in primates. We examine the integration of binocular disparity, perspective cues, and motion parallax in cortical areas involved in visual processing. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies reveal specialized neuronal populations in the visual cortex that respond selectively to depth, orientation, and motion in three-dimensional space. The dorsal visual stream, particularly areas MT and MST, plays a key role in processing motion-based depth cues. Meanwhile, the ventral stream, including V4 and IT cortex, contributes to object recognition in 3D environments. We discuss how these neuronal representations interact to form a coherent perception of the three-dimensional world and highlight potential implications for understanding human 3D vision and developing advanced computer vision systems."}
