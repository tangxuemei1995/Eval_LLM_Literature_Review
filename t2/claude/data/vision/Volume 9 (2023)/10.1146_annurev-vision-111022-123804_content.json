{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of basal ganglia structures in visual perceptual decision-making. Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral techniques, we examined the contributions of the striatum and pallidum during a saccade-based choice task. Participants made rapid decisions about visual stimuli while their neural activity and reaction times were recorded. We applied sequential analysis and signal detection theory to model the decision-making process. Results revealed that basal ganglia activation correlated with both choice accuracy and reaction time, suggesting a crucial role in evidence accumulation and decision threshold modulation. Our findings highlight the importance of these subcortical structures in integrating sensory information and motor output during perceptual decisions, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual cognition and action selection."}
