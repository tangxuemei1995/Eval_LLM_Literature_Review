{"Abstract": "Retinal degeneration, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, has prompted extensive research into stem cell-based regenerative therapies. This review examines the key factors influencing the success of such approaches, focusing on the restoration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, and ganglion cells. We explore the potential of pluripotent stem cells in generating these crucial retinal components and discuss the challenges in their integration and functionality. The immune microenvironment of the retina emerges as a critical factor, impacting both the survival and efficacy of transplanted cells. Additionally, we analyze the role of the extracellular matrix and growth factors in supporting cell survival and differentiation. Understanding these multifaceted influences is essential for developing effective stem cell-based treatments for retinal degeneration, potentially offering hope to millions affected by vision loss."}
