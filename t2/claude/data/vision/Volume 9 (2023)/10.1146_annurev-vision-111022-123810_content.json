{"Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that can lead to significant visual dysfunction, primarily due to its effects on the retina. This review examines the current understanding of diabetic retinopathy in both human and rodent models, focusing on the impact of diabetes on retinal neurons and their physiological functions. We explore the similarities and differences between human, mouse, and rat retinal responses to diabetes, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each model. The paper discusses the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotransmitter imbalances. Additionally, we evaluate potential therapeutic targets and interventions aimed at preserving retinal function in diabetic patients. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between diabetes and visual impairment, paving the way for improved diagnostic and treatment strategies."}
