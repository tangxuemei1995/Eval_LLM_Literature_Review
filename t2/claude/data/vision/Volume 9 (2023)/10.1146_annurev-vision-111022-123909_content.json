{"Abstract": "The preferred retinal locus (PRL) is a crucial adaptation mechanism in individuals with central vision loss, particularly those affected by macular degeneration. This review explores the concept of PRL, its development, and its role in maintaining visual function. We discuss the factors influencing PRL formation, including eccentricity, fixation stability, and visual field characteristics. The importance of binocular viewing and its impact on PRL selection is examined. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between PRL and functional vision outcomes, highlighting its significance in rehabilitation strategies. Understanding the complexities of PRL can inform clinical interventions and improve quality of life for patients with central vision impairment."}
