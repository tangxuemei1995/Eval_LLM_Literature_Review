{"Abstract": "Eye morphogenesis in vertebrates is a complex and highly regulated process that results in the formation of a functional visual system. This review examines the key stages of eye development, focusing on the formation of the optic cup, retina, lens, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We discuss the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that drive the initial evagination of the optic vesicle, its subsequent invagination to form the bilayered optic cup, and the differentiation of the neural retina and RPE. The crucial role of lens placode induction and its influence on surrounding tissues is also explored. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in understanding the genetic networks and cellular interactions that coordinate these developmental events. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the intricate processes underlying vertebrate eye morphogenesis and their implications for visual system disorders."}
