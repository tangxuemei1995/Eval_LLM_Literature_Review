{"Abstract": "This paper explores the potential of agroecology as a transformative approach to achieve sustainable agriculture and food systems. We examine the principles and practices of agroecology across multiple scales, from local initiatives to large-scale adoption. The study emphasizes the importance of multiactor approaches in implementing agroecological solutions, involving farmers, researchers, policymakers, and consumers. We analyze the role of agricultural and food policies in supporting agroecological transitions and discuss the challenges and opportunities for integrating agroecology into existing farming systems. The paper also investigates the synergies between agroecology and emerging technologies, such as precision agriculture and digital tools, in enhancing sustainability and resilience. Our findings suggest that agroecology offers a holistic framework for agricultural transformation, addressing environmental, social, and economic dimensions of food production. We conclude by proposing policy recommendations and research priorities to facilitate the widespread adoption of agroecological practices and their integration into sustainable food systems."}
