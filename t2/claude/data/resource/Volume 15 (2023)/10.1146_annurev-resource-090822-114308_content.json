{"Abstract": "This study investigates whether various estimation methods yield significantly different results in measuring the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. We compare four prominent approaches: MIMIC estimation, micro survey, survey technique, and consumption-income gap. Analyzing data from multiple countries over a 20-year period, we find substantial discrepancies in shadow economy estimates across methods. The MIMIC approach consistently produces higher estimates compared to survey-based techniques, while the consumption-income gap method yields intermediate results. These differences persist even after controlling for country-specific factors and time trends. Our findings suggest that the choice of estimation method significantly influences the perceived size of shadow economies, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting and comparing results across studies. We conclude that a multi-method approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding of shadow economic activities."}
