{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic implications of nutrient pollution from agricultural practices, focusing on the widespread issue of fertilizer overapplication and its environmental consequences. Nonpoint-source pollution from agriculture poses significant challenges for policymakers and researchers due to its diffuse nature and complex interactions with ecosystems. We analyze the economic drivers behind excessive fertilizer use, including risk aversion, information asymmetry, and market failures. The research synthesizes existing literature on environmental externalities associated with nutrient runoff, such as eutrophication, habitat degradation, and reduced biodiversity. We develop a theoretical framework to assess the social costs of nutrient pollution and evaluate the effectiveness of various policy instruments, including taxes, subsidies, and regulations. Our findings suggest that a combination of economic incentives and targeted education programs may be most effective in mitigating nutrient pollution while maintaining agricultural productivity. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on sustainable agriculture and provides valuable insights for policymakers seeking to balance economic growth with environmental protection in the agricultural sector."}
