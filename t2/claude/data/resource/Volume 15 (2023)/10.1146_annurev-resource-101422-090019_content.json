{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic and environmental implications of crop residue management practices, with a focus on smallholder farmers in developing countries. We analyze the drivers behind residue burning and its impacts on climate change, air quality, and soil health. The research explores alternative management strategies, including incorporation, mulching, and bioenergy production, assessing their economic viability and potential for technology adoption. Our findings reveal that while residue burning offers short-term economic benefits, it leads to significant long-term environmental costs. We identify barriers to adopting sustainable practices, such as limited access to machinery and knowledge gaps. The study proposes policy interventions and incentive mechanisms to promote environmentally friendly residue management, highlighting the need for context-specific solutions that balance economic feasibility with ecological sustainability for smallholder farmers."}
