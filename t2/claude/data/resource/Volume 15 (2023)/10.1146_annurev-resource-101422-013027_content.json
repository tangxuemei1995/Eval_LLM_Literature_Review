{"Abstract": "Food fraud, encompassing adulteration and mislabeling, poses significant risks to consumer health and market integrity. This paper examines the causes, consequences, and deterrence strategies of food fraud in the context of asymmetric information and credence goods. We analyze how information asymmetry between producers and consumers creates opportunities for fraudulent practices. The study explores the economic and health impacts of food fraud, highlighting the challenges in detection and enforcement. We evaluate various deterrence strategies, including certification schemes and regulatory measures, considering their effectiveness and limitations. Our findings emphasize the need for a multi-faceted approach combining improved detection technologies, stricter penalties, and enhanced consumer awareness to combat food fraud effectively."}
