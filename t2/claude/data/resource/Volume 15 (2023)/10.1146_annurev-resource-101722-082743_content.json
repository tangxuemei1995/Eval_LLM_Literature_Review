{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, and environmental values to better understand individual decision-making processes regarding common pool resources. By integrating insights from cognitive neuroscience and economic theory, we investigate how neural mechanisms and cognitive biases influence environmental value judgments and subsequent behaviors. Our research employs a combination of neuroimaging techniques and experimental economic games to examine the neural correlates of environmental decision-making. Results reveal that specific brain regions associated with reward processing and social cognition play crucial roles in shaping environmental values. Furthermore, we identify key cognitive biases that impact resource allocation decisions and propose potential interventions to promote more sustainable behaviors. These findings have important implications for environmental policy design, suggesting that incorporating behavioral and neurological factors can lead to more effective and targeted conservation strategies."}
