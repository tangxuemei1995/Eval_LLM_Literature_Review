{"Abstract": "This review examines recent advances in causal inference methodologies applied to the study of air pollution's health impacts. We explore how natural experiments, quasi-experimental designs, and novel statistical approaches have enhanced our understanding of the causal relationships between air pollutants and various health outcomes. The integration of these methods with traditional epidemiological approaches and the incorporation of findings into integrated science assessments are discussed. We highlight key studies that have leveraged these techniques to address confounding and strengthen causal claims. The review also considers the challenges and limitations of these methods, as well as their potential to inform evidence-based policy decisions aimed at mitigating the health effects of air pollution."}
