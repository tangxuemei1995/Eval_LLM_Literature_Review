{"Abstract": "This study examines food insecurity in the United States, focusing on measurement techniques, economic modeling, and the effectiveness of food assistance programs. We analyze the complex interplay between food security and nutrition security, emphasizing the importance of both quantity and quality in dietary intake. The research evaluates four major food assistance initiatives: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. Using a mixed-methods approach, we combine quantitative data analysis with qualitative assessments to provide a comprehensive understanding of these programs' impacts on vulnerable populations. Our findings reveal significant variations in program effectiveness across different demographic groups and geographical regions. We identify key factors contributing to food insecurity and propose evidence-based policy recommendations to enhance the efficiency and reach of existing food assistance programs. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on food security and offers valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners working to address this critical issue in the United States."}
