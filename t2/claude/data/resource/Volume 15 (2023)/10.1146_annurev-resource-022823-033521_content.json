{"Abstract": "This study investigates the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy across developed and developing countries. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning 195 countries from 1990 to 2020, we employ panel data analysis and machine learning techniques to examine the complex relationship between obesity rates and life expectancy. Our findings reveal significant disparities in the impact of obesity on longevity between high-income and low-income nations. While obesity consistently negatively affects life expectancy in developed countries, its influence in developing nations is more nuanced, often interacting with other socioeconomic and health factors. We observe that the obesity-mortality link is moderated by healthcare quality, nutritional transitions, and economic development stages. These results highlight the need for tailored public health interventions that consider the varying contexts of obesity's impact on life expectancy across different global regions. Our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the global obesity epidemic and its implications for population health and longevity."}
