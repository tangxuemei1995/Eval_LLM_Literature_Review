{"Abstract": "This paper examines the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, exploring how antitrust frameworks can accommodate and promote green initiatives. We analyze the potential for sustainability agreements among firms and their impact on market competition. The study investigates the role of firm green preferences in shaping industrial organization and competitive dynamics. We develop a theoretical model that incorporates environmental considerations into traditional competition analysis, highlighting the trade-offs between economic efficiency and sustainability goals. Our findings suggest that current antitrust policies may need to be adapted to encourage cooperative environmental efforts without compromising market competition. We propose policy recommendations to balance these objectives, emphasizing the importance of clear guidelines for sustainability agreements and the integration of environmental factors into competition assessments."}
