{"Abstract": "The international agricultural research community is experiencing a paradigm shift in impact assessment, driven by demands for more rigorous evidence of research outcomes. This paper examines the emerging 'rigor revolution' in agricultural research for development, focusing on new standards for measurement, causality, and scale in impact evaluations. We analyze the drivers behind this shift, including increased donor scrutiny and the influence of methodological advances from other disciplines. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by these new standards, such as balancing scientific rigor with practical constraints in developing country contexts. We explore innovative approaches to impact assessment, including mixed-methods designs and novel data collection techniques. Finally, we consider the implications of this revolution for research organizations, policymakers, and practitioners, emphasizing the need for capacity building and adaptive learning to meet evolving expectations for evidence-based decision-making in agricultural development."}
