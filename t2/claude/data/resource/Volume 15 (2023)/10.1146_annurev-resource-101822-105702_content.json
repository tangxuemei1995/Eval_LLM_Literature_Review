{"Abstract": "This review examines the multifaceted impacts of climate change-related risks on the financial sector, focusing on banking, insurance, and financial markets. As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase due to climate change, the financial industry faces unprecedented challenges in risk assessment, pricing, and management. The banking sector is exposed to both physical risks from extreme weather events and transition risks as economies shift towards low-carbon models. Insurance companies grapple with rising claims and the need to reassess traditional actuarial models. Financial markets are increasingly factoring in climate risks, leading to potential asset repricing and volatility. This paper synthesizes current research on these topics, highlighting the interconnectedness of climate change and financial stability. It also explores emerging strategies for climate risk mitigation in the financial sector, including stress testing, scenario analysis, and the development of green financial products. The findings underscore the urgent need for adaptive measures and policy frameworks to enhance the resilience of the financial system in the face of escalating climate-related risks."}
