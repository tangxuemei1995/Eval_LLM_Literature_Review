{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of social protection programs, particularly cash transfers, in driving rural transformation across Africa. Through a comprehensive analysis of impact evaluations and longitudinal data, we investigate how these interventions affect income, production, and agricultural practices in rural communities. Our findings reveal that well-designed cash transfer programs can significantly contribute to rural transformation by increasing household income, stimulating local economic activity, and promoting diversification in agricultural production. We observe that beneficiaries often invest in productive assets and adopt improved farming techniques, leading to enhanced agricultural productivity. However, the study also highlights the importance of complementary interventions, such as skills training and market access improvements, to maximize the transformative potential of social protection programs. By providing evidence on the multifaceted impacts of cash transfers, this research offers valuable insights for policymakers seeking to promote sustainable rural development and poverty reduction in Africa."}
