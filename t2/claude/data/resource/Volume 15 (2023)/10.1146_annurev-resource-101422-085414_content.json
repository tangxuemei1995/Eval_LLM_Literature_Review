{"Abstract": "This study explores the economics of ecosystem restoration, examining the complex interplay between ecological recovery, biodiversity conservation, and socioeconomic impacts. By analyzing case studies and synthesizing existing literature, we investigate the costs and benefits associated with various restoration strategies across different ecosystems. Our findings reveal that successful restoration projects not only enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services but also generate significant economic returns through improved natural resource management and increased tourism opportunities. However, the study also highlights the challenges in implementing effective environmental policies and securing long-term funding for restoration initiatives. We propose a framework for integrating ecosystem restoration into broader sustainable development goals, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement and adaptive management approaches. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the economic viability of large-scale ecosystem restoration efforts."}
