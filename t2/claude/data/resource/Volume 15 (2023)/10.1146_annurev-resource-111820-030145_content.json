{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) in the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). We analyze the MSR's effectiveness in addressing allowance surplus and price volatility, considering its interaction with overlapping climate policies. Our findings suggest that while the MSR has improved market stability, challenges remain in balancing short-term price signals with long-term emissions reduction goals. We propose potential refinements to enhance the MSR's performance and overall EU ETS efficiency."}
