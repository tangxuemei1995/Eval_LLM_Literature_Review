{"Abstract": "Mathematical programming has emerged as a powerful tool in analyzing complex issues related to agriculture, natural resources, and climate change. This paper reviews the diverse applications of mathematical programming techniques in these interconnected domains. We explore how these methods are utilized to optimize resource allocation, assess climate change impacts, and develop adaptation and mitigation strategies. The review highlights the versatility of mathematical programming in addressing multifaceted challenges, from crop production planning to ecosystem management. Furthermore, we examine its role in evaluating policy interventions and economic implications of climate change. The paper also discusses recent advancements in integrating mathematical programming with other modeling approaches, enhancing its predictive capabilities. By synthesizing current research, this review underscores the critical role of mathematical programming in informing decision-making processes and policy formulation in the face of evolving environmental and climatic conditions."}
