{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex relationship between temperature and labor productivity across various sectors and regions. We analyze the impacts of temperature fluctuations on both physical and mental productivity, considering factors such as adaptation mechanisms and early-life exposure to different climates. Our findings reveal significant distributional effects, with certain populations and industries more vulnerable to temperature-induced productivity losses. The research also explores potential mitigation strategies and policy implications to address the challenges posed by changing temperature patterns on workforce efficiency and economic output."}
