{"Abstract": "This study examines the differences in research and development (R&D) lag models between the agricultural and industrial sectors. By analyzing knowledge stocks and flows, we investigate how R&D investments translate into technological change and innovation across these two distinct economic domains. Our findings reveal that agricultural R&D typically experiences longer lag times compared to industrial R&D, due to factors such as biological constraints, environmental variability, and complex adoption processes. We develop a comparative framework to assess the dynamics of knowledge creation, diffusion, and implementation in both sectors. The results highlight the importance of tailoring R&D strategies and policies to sector-specific characteristics, as well as the need for sustained long-term investment in agricultural research to ensure food security and sustainable development. This research contributes to a better understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities in fostering innovation within agricultural and industrial contexts."}
