{"Abstract": "Food losses in agrifood systems pose a significant challenge to global food security and sustainability. This review synthesizes current knowledge on food losses across value chains, from production to consumption. We examine the complexities of measuring food losses and waste, highlighting methodological challenges and recent advancements. The determinants of food losses are explored, considering factors such as infrastructure, technology, market dynamics, and consumer behavior. We analyze interventions aimed at reducing food losses, evaluating their effectiveness and potential for scalability. The review also addresses the interconnections between food losses, food security, and environmental sustainability. Our findings reveal significant knowledge gaps, particularly in developing countries, and emphasize the need for standardized measurement approaches. We conclude by identifying priority areas for future research and policy interventions to mitigate food losses and enhance the efficiency of agrifood systems globally."}
