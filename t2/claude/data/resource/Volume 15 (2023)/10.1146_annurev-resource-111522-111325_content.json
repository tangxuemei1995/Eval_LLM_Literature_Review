{"Abstract": "The global rise in chronic noncommunicable diseases, particularly obesity, has prompted policymakers to implement sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes as a public health intervention. This review examines the effectiveness of recent SSB tax policies in meeting their intended goals of reducing consumption and improving population health outcomes. We analyze data from various jurisdictions that have implemented such taxes, evaluating their impact on beverage sales, consumer behavior, and health indicators. While evidence suggests that SSB taxes generally lead to decreased consumption, the magnitude of these effects varies across different populations and contexts. Furthermore, we explore potential improvements to existing tax structures, including graduated tax rates based on sugar content, earmarking revenues for health initiatives, and combining fiscal measures with other policy interventions. Our findings indicate that while SSB taxes show promise as a tool for promoting healthier diets, their optimal design and implementation require careful consideration of local factors and potential unintended consequences. This review provides valuable insights for policymakers seeking to refine and enhance the effectiveness of SSB tax policies in combating obesity and related health issues."}
