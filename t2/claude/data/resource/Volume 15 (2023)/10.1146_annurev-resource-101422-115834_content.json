{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the relationship between environmental regulation and labor demand, synthesizing evidence from empirical studies across various industries and countries. We review econometric analyses, case studies, and meta-analyses to assess the impact of environmental policies on employment levels and job creation. Our findings suggest a nuanced relationship, with effects varying by sector, regulation type, and timeframe. While some industries experience short-term job losses, others see employment gains through innovation and the creation of 'green jobs'. Overall, the net impact on aggregate employment appears modest, with potential for positive long-term effects through improved environmental quality and public health. We discuss policy implications and areas for future research to better understand this complex relationship."}
