{"Abstract": "Conspiracy theories have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, yet a clear consensus on their definition remains elusive. This paper proposes a comprehensive definitional approach to conspiracy theories, examining their key characteristics, correlates, consequences, and modes of communication. By synthesizing existing literature and empirical evidence, we identify common elements that distinguish conspiracy theories from other forms of belief. We explore psychological, social, and political factors that predict conspiracy belief, as well as the potential consequences for individuals and society. Additionally, we analyze the role of various communication channels, including social media and traditional news outlets, in the spread and reinforcement of conspiracy theories. This integrative approach aims to provide a foundation for future research and interventions addressing the complex phenomenon of conspiracy theories in contemporary discourse."}
