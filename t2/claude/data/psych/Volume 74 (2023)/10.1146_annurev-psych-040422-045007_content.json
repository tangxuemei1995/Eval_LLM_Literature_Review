{"Abstract": "Careless responding in survey data poses significant challenges to researchers, potentially compromising the validity and reliability of their findings. This paper examines the issue of careless responding, also known as insufficient effort responding or random responding, and provides a comprehensive overview of prevention strategies, identification methods, and best practices for dealing with this problem. We review existing literature on survey methodology and discuss various techniques for detecting careless responses, including attention checks, response time analysis, and consistency measures. Additionally, we explore preventive measures that can be implemented during survey design and administration to minimize the occurrence of careless responding. The paper concludes with recommendations for researchers on how to effectively handle careless responses in their data analysis and reporting, ensuring more robust and reliable research outcomes."}
