{"Abstract": "Self-compassion, a construct rooted in Buddhist psychology, has gained significant attention in psychological research and clinical practice. This comprehensive review explores the theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, empirical findings, and interventional applications of self-compassion. Drawing from a diverse body of literature, we examine the three core components of self-compassion: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. The review synthesizes quantitative and qualitative research methodologies employed in studying self-compassion and its relationship to various psychological outcomes. Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates the positive associations between self-compassion and well-being, resilience, and adaptive coping strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the development and efficacy of self-compassion-based interventions across different populations and clinical settings. This review highlights the potential of self-compassion as a valuable tool for enhancing psychological health and offers directions for future research and practical applications in therapeutic contexts."}
