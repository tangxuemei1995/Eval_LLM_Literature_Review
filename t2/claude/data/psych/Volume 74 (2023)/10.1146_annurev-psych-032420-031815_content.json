{"Abstract": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) has been a central topic in attitude research for decades. This review examines the historical development, current state, and future directions of EC research. We discuss the shift from associative to propositional accounts of EC and the ongoing debate surrounding underlying mechanisms. The paper highlights key findings on moderators and boundary conditions of EC effects, including attention, awareness, and individual differences. We critically evaluate methodological advances and challenges in EC research, emphasizing the need for improved measurement techniques and increased external validity. Recent developments in applied settings, such as advertising and health behavior, are explored. Finally, we identify promising avenues for future research, including investigations of EC in real-world contexts, integration with neuroscientific approaches, and potential applications in interventions for attitude change. This comprehensive review provides a foundation for understanding the complexities of EC and its significance in attitude formation and change."}
