{"Abstract": "Cancer patients and survivors face numerous stressors that can significantly impact their psychological and physiological well-being. This review examines the efficacy of stress management interventions in facilitating adaptation and improving health outcomes among cancer populations. We synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating various stress management techniques, with a focus on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches. Results indicate that structured stress management interventions, particularly those incorporating CBT principles, can effectively reduce cancer-related distress, improve coping skills, and enhance overall quality of life. Additionally, these interventions demonstrate potential in modulating physiological responses, including immune function and neuroendocrine regulation. The review highlights the importance of tailoring interventions to address specific cancer-related stressors and individual patient needs. Future research directions and implications for clinical practice in oncology settings are discussed, emphasizing the integration of stress management strategies into comprehensive cancer care."}
