{"Abstract": "This paper explores the pivotal role of pride in social rank attainment, examining its influence on both prestige-based and dominance-based status hierarchies. Drawing on extensive research in social psychology and evolutionary biology, we propose that pride serves as a fundamental emotional mechanism facilitating the acquisition and maintenance of social status. Our analysis reveals that authentic pride promotes behaviors associated with prestige, such as skill development and prosociality, while hubristic pride drives dominance-seeking behaviors. We argue that pride's dual nature allows individuals to navigate complex social environments and adapt their status-seeking strategies accordingly. Furthermore, we discuss how cultural factors shape the expression and perception of pride in different societies. This integrative review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding pride's function in human social hierarchies and offers implications for future research on status dynamics and self-conscious emotions."}
