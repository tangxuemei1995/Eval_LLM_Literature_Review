{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex mechanisms underlying human object vision by examining the relationship between object representations in the visual cortex and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). We analyze behavioral data and neural activity patterns to compare human object recognition with DCNN performance. Our findings reveal striking similarities between hierarchical representations in the human visual system and those in DCNNs, suggesting shared computational principles. However, we also identify key differences, particularly in the processing of complex scenes and atypical viewpoints. These insights contribute to our understanding of how the brain processes visual information and may inform the development of more human-like artificial vision systems. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging DCNNs as models for studying human object recognition and visual perception."}
