{"Abstract": "This study explores the psychological factors influencing individuals' attitudes and behaviors towards climate change. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and original empirical research, we investigate the complex interplay between personal values, beliefs about climate change, and support for climate action. Our findings reveal that acceptance of climate change science is strongly correlated with pro-environmental values and a willingness to engage in climate-friendly behaviors. However, we also identify a significant gap between climate change awareness and actual behavioral change. The study further examines the role of social norms, political ideologies, and perceptions of system-level changes in shaping climate-related attitudes. Our results suggest that effective climate communication strategies should address both individual-level factors and broader societal transformations. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the psychological barriers to climate action and offers insights for policymakers and educators seeking to promote sustainable behaviors and support for climate policies."}
