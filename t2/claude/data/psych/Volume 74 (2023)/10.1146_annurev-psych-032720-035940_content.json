{"Abstract": "This paper reviews the current state of research on emotion in organizational settings, synthesizing theoretical frameworks and empirical findings. We examine the role of emotions in workplace dynamics, exploring their impact on decision-making, leadership, and interpersonal relationships. The social function of emotions in organizational contexts is discussed, highlighting their influence on team cohesion, conflict resolution, and organizational culture. We also investigate the concept of emotional intelligence and its relevance to workplace performance and well-being. The review identifies key gaps in the literature and proposes future research directions, including the need for more longitudinal studies and cross-cultural comparisons. By integrating diverse perspectives on emotion in organizations, this paper contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of affective processes in the workplace and their implications for organizational behavior and management practices."}
