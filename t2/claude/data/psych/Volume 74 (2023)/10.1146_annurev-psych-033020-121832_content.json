{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex interplay of factors influencing social cognitive aging, focusing on the determinants of resilience and risk. We examine how social resources, contextual factors, motivation, and cognitive effort contribute to individual differences in social cognitive outcomes among older adults. Using a multi-method approach combining laboratory tasks and ecologically valid assessments, we explore the relative importance of these factors in predicting social cognitive performance across various real-world scenarios. Results reveal that social resources and motivation play crucial roles in maintaining social cognitive abilities, while contextual factors moderate their effects. Cognitive effort emerges as a key mediator between motivation and performance. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple determinants in understanding social cognitive aging and suggest potential interventions to promote resilience and mitigate risk factors in later life."}
