Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in conflict resolution techniques and their applications in various contexts. Our analysis reveals the importance of integrating diverse theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches to advance our understanding of negotiation dynamics. We conclude by identifying key areas for future research and discussing implications for practitioners in enhancing negotiation outcomes across different domains."}
