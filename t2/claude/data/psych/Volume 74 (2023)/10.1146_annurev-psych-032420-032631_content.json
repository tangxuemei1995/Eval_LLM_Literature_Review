{"Abstract": "This paper proposes a comprehensive socioecological-genetic framework to elucidate the intricate relationships between culture and personality. By integrating insights from cultural psychology, behavioral genetics, and evolutionary biology, we explore the roots, trends, and interplay of cultural and personality factors. Our framework posits that both culture and personality are shaped by complex interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental influences, including socioecological factors. We examine how cultural change and personality change are interconnected, influenced by both genetic and environmental forces. The nature-nurture debate is revisited through the lens of gene-environment interactions, highlighting the dynamic interplay between genetic factors and cultural contexts in shaping individual differences. This integrative approach offers new perspectives on the co-evolution of culture and personality, providing a foundation for future interdisciplinary research in this field."}
