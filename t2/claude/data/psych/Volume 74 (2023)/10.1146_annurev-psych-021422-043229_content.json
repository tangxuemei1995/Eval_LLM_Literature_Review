{"Abstract": "This paper challenges traditional views on the relationship between vision and action, proposing a novel framework that integrates consciousness and attention. We argue that visual perception and motor control are more deeply intertwined than previously thought, with attention serving as a crucial mediator. Through a comprehensive review of recent neuroimaging and behavioral studies, we demonstrate how conscious visual awareness influences action planning and execution. Our findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between vision and action, where motor intentions can shape visual processing. This integrated model has significant implications for understanding human cognition, decision-making, and the development of artificial intelligence systems. We conclude by outlining future research directions to further elucidate the complex interplay between vision, action, consciousness, and attention."}
