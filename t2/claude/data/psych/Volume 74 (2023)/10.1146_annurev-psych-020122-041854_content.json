{"Abstract": "This paper proposes an affect-regulation framework for understanding psychological resilience. Drawing on extensive literature from stress and coping, emotion regulation, and psychological health domains, we argue that resilience is fundamentally rooted in an individual's capacity to regulate affect in the face of adversity. The framework integrates key findings on adaptive emotion regulation strategies, stress reactivity, and positive affect maintenance. We posit that resilient individuals exhibit flexible deployment of regulation strategies, efficient down-regulation of negative affect, and preservation of positive emotional states during challenging circumstances. The model also considers the role of individual differences, contextual factors, and developmental processes in shaping resilience. By conceptualizing resilience through the lens of affect regulation, this framework offers new insights for interventions aimed at enhancing psychological health and adaptability in the face of life's inevitable stressors."}
