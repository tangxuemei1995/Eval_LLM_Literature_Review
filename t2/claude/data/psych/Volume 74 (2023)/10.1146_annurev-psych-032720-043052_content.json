{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex interplay between gender inclusion and person-environment fit in STEM fields. Drawing on social identity theory and stereotype threat research, we investigate how gender stereotypes and organizational culture impact women's sense of belonging and career outcomes in science and technology. Through a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and interviews with 500 STEM professionals across various industries, we explore the factors that contribute to or hinder gender inclusion. Our findings reveal that organizational policies, mentorship programs, and inclusive leadership practices significantly influence women's perceptions of fit and career advancement opportunities. Moreover, we identify key strategies for fostering a more inclusive STEM environment, such as addressing unconscious bias, promoting role models, and implementing family-friendly policies. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on diversity and inclusion in STEM, offering practical implications for organizations seeking to enhance gender equity and maximize talent retention in scientific and technological fields."}
