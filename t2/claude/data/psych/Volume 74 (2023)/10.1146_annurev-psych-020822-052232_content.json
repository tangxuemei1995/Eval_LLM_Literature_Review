{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of systemic racism and psychological resilience among African Americans through an autobiographical lens. Drawing on personal narratives and existing literature, we examine the multifaceted ways in which Black individuals navigate and overcome racial discrimination in various aspects of life. The research highlights the cultural and historical factors that contribute to the development of resilience within the African American community. By analyzing individual experiences, we identify key coping mechanisms and adaptive strategies employed to maintain mental well-being in the face of persistent racial adversity. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the unique challenges faced by Black Americans and the strength derived from their cultural heritage. This study contributes to the growing body of research on race-related stress and resilience, offering insights for mental health professionals and policymakers working to address systemic racism and promote psychological well-being among marginalized communities."}
