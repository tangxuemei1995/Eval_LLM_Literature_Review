{"Abstract": "Sleep plays a crucial role in cognitive function, yet its importance is often underestimated. This review examines the relationship between sleep and cognition, focusing on memory consolidation and attention. We explore the structure of sleep, including its various stages and their specific contributions to cognitive processes. The effects of age on sleep patterns and subsequent cognitive performance are also discussed. Additionally, we investigate strategies for sleep optimization to enhance cognitive abilities across different age groups. Our findings suggest that adequate sleep duration and quality are essential for optimal cognitive function, with particular emphasis on memory formation and attentional processes. Furthermore, age-related changes in sleep architecture may contribute to cognitive decline in older adults. We conclude by proposing evidence-based recommendations for improving sleep habits to support cognitive health throughout the lifespan."}
