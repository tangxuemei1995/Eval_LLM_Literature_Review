{"Abstract": "Self-continuity, the perception of oneself as persisting through time, plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes, behavior, and psychological health. This review synthesizes recent findings on self-continuity across diverse cultural contexts, emphasizing its impact on individual and collective selves. Research indicates that a strong sense of self-continuity is associated with enhanced well-being, more consistent decision-making, and greater resilience in the face of adversity. However, cultural variations in the conceptualization and expression of self-continuity have been observed, with some societies placing greater emphasis on collective continuity. The interplay between personal and collective self-continuity is explored, revealing complex dynamics that influence social identity and group behavior. This review also highlights the potential applications of self-continuity research in clinical psychology, organizational behavior, and cultural studies, offering insights for future investigations and practical interventions aimed at promoting psychological health and social cohesion."}
