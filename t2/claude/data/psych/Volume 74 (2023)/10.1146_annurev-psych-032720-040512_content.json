{"Abstract": "This review examines the development of color perception and cognition from infancy through childhood. We explore how the ability to discriminate and categorize colors emerges and evolves, integrating findings from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science. The paper traces the maturation of color vision mechanisms in infants, highlighting key milestones in perceptual development. We then discuss the acquisition of color concepts and language, examining how children learn to associate color terms with perceptual experiences. The role of cultural and linguistic factors in shaping color cognition is also addressed. Additionally, we review studies on the impact of color on cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and learning throughout development. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex interplay between perceptual, cognitive, and environmental factors in the ontogeny of color processing, offering implications for educational practices and developmental theories."}
