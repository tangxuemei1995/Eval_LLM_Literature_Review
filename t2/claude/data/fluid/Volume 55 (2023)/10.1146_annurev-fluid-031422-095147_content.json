{"Abstract": "Submesoscale dynamics play a crucial role in the upper ocean, influencing energy transfer, nutrient distribution, and climate processes. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding submesoscale phenomena, focusing on turbulence, eddies, and fronts. High-resolution observations and numerical simulations reveal the complex interactions between submesoscale features and larger-scale ocean circulation. We examine the mechanisms driving submesoscale instabilities, their impact on vertical mixing, and their contribution to restratification processes. The paper highlights the significance of submesoscale dynamics in modulating air-sea interactions, biogeochemical cycling, and heat transport. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges in parameterizing submesoscale processes in climate models and their potential implications for improving climate predictions. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of submesoscale dynamics in shaping the upper ocean's physical and biogeochemical properties, emphasizing the need for continued research in this rapidly evolving field."}
