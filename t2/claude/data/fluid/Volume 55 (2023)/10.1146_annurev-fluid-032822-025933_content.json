{"Abstract": "Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) is a unique flow regime observed in viscoelastic fluids, characterized by the complex interplay between elastic and inertial forces. This study investigates the fundamental mechanisms underlying EIT, focusing on its role in polymer drag reduction and the formation of coherent structures in transitional flows. Through advanced numerical simulations employing viscoelastic models, we explore the emergence of elastic instabilities and their contribution to the onset of turbulence. Our findings reveal that EIT exhibits distinct features from both Newtonian turbulence and purely elastic turbulence, with significant implications for flow control and energy efficiency in various industrial applications. We demonstrate that the interaction between polymer dynamics and flow structures leads to the formation of unique coherent patterns, which play a crucial role in the drag reduction phenomenon. This research provides new insights into the nature of EIT and its potential for optimizing fluid transport processes in diverse fields, from microfluidics to large-scale engineering systems."}
