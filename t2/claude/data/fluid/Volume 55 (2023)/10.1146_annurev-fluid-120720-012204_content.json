{"Abstract": "This study investigates the self-propulsion mechanism of chemically active droplets, a class of microswimmers with potential applications in targeted drug delivery and environmental remediation. We explore the interplay between Marangoni flows, advection-diffusion processes, and viscous forces that govern droplet motion. Using a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental observations, we demonstrate that symmetry-breaking in the chemical concentration field surrounding the droplet is crucial for sustained self-propulsion. Our results reveal a critical threshold in droplet size and chemical activity for the onset of motion, as well as the influence of fluid viscosity on propulsion speed. We also identify distinct regimes of droplet behavior, ranging from stationary to erratic motion, depending on system parameters. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of active droplet dynamics and provide insights for designing controllable microswimmers with tailored properties."}
