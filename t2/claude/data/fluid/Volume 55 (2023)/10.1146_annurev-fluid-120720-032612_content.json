{"Abstract": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) have garnered significant attention as a promising technology for pressure gain combustion. However, the practical implementation of RDEs faces numerous challenges due to nonidealities that deviate from theoretical models. This study investigates the key nonideal phenomena in RDEs, including unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, deflagration losses, and the presence of multiple competing waves. Through a combination of experimental observations and numerical simulations, we analyze the impact of these nonidealities on engine performance and stability. Results indicate that unsteady mixing significantly affects detonation wave propagation, while secondary combustion and deflagration losses contribute to reduced pressure gain. The occurrence of multiple competing waves and secondary waves further complicates the combustion dynamics, leading to potential instabilities and reduced efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing these nonidealities in RDE design and optimization, paving the way for more robust and efficient pressure gain combustion systems in future propulsion and power generation applications."}
