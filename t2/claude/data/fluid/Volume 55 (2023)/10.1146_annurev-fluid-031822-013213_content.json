{"Abstract": "This study investigates the evaporation dynamics of sessile droplets, focusing on mathematical models and diffusion-limited processes. We explore various evaporation modes and their impact on droplet lifetimes, as well as the deposition patterns resulting from evaporation. The research extends to the behavior of multiple droplets, examining their interactions and collective evaporation characteristics. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of droplet evaporation phenomena, with potential applications in fields such as microfluidics, printing technologies, and surface coating processes."}
