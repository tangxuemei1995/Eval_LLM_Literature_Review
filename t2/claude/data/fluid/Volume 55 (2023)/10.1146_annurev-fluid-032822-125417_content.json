{"Abstract": "This review explores the multiscale nature of gas-liquid foam dynamics, bridging the gap between microscopic structural elements and macroscopic continuum descriptions. We examine the fundamental physics of foam interfaces, including surface tension, elasticity, and thin film stability. The rheological properties of foams are discussed, emphasizing their complex viscoelastic behavior and yield stress characteristics. We analyze the fluid mechanics of foam flow, considering both bulk and confined geometries. The interplay between foam structure and dynamics is investigated, highlighting the role of bubble size distribution, liquid fraction, and topological rearrangements. Recent advances in experimental techniques and theoretical models are presented, providing insights into foam behavior across different length and time scales. This comprehensive review aims to synthesize current understanding and identify future research directions in the field of gas-liquid foam dynamics, with implications for various industrial and technological applications."}
