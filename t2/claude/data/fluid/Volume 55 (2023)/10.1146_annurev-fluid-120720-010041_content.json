{"Abstract": "This study examines the development of fluid mechanics in France during the first half of the twentieth century, a period marked by significant advancements in aeronautics and scientific understanding. The research explores the contributions of French scientists and engineers to the field, highlighting their theoretical and experimental work. It investigates the influence of major historical events, such as World Wars I and II, on the progression of fluid mechanics research and its applications. The study also analyzes the establishment of key institutions and research centers dedicated to fluid dynamics and aeronautics in France during this era. Furthermore, it examines the international collaborations and knowledge exchange that shaped the French approach to fluid mechanics. By tracing the evolution of fluid mechanics in France from 1900 to 1950, this research provides insights into the country's role in advancing the field and its impact on the global scientific community, particularly in the context of the rapidly developing aviation industry."}
