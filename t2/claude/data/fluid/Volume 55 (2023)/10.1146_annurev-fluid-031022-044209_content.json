{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of mathematical methods from quantum mechanics to linear flow analysis. We investigate how concepts such as symmetries, degeneracies, and perturbations can provide novel insights into fluid dynamics. The research focuses on the spectral analysis of linear operators, examining eigenvalue behavior and stability characteristics. Particular attention is given to exceptional points, where eigenvalues coalesce, and their implications for flow stability. By leveraging quantum mechanical techniques, we develop a framework for analyzing complex flow phenomena, including bifurcations and transitions. The approach offers a fresh perspective on classical fluid dynamics problems, potentially leading to improved predictive models and control strategies. Our findings demonstrate the power of interdisciplinary approaches in advancing our understanding of linear flow systems and highlight promising avenues for future research in this emerging field."}
