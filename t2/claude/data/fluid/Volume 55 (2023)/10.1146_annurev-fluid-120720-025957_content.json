{"Abstract": "This study investigates the transition to turbulence in pipe flow, a classic problem in fluid dynamics. We examine the complex interplay between shear flow, transient growth, and the emergence of turbulent structures. Our research focuses on the formation and evolution of turbulent puffs and slugs, which are characteristic features of transitional pipe flow. We explore the role of intermittency and transient chaos in the transition process, revealing the underlying mechanisms that drive the flow from laminar to turbulent states. Using advanced numerical simulations and experimental techniques, we demonstrate that the transition exhibits properties consistent with directed percolation, a universality class in non-equilibrium statistical physics. These findings provide new insights into the nature of turbulence onset in shear flows and contribute to our understanding of fluid behavior in pipe systems."}
