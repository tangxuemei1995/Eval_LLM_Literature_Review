{"Abstract": "This review examines recent advancements in theories of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence. We discuss novel quasi-linear approaches and statistical methods that have improved our understanding of complex turbulent flows. The paper highlights key findings in modeling spatial variations and directional dependencies in turbulent systems, emphasizing their implications for practical applications. We also explore emerging computational techniques and experimental validations that have contributed to refining these theories, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field."}
