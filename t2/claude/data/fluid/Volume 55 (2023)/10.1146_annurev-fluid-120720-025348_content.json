{"Abstract": "This study explores innovative approaches to advancing access to cutting-edge tabletop experiments, particularly in resource-constrained environments and Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). We investigate the impact of these experiments on scientific career professional development and graduate education. Through a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and case studies, we analyze the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing tabletop experiments in diverse research settings. Our findings reveal that access to such experiments significantly enhances research capabilities, fosters collaboration, and promotes skill development among early-career scientists. We propose a framework for integrating tabletop experiments into graduate curricula and research programs, emphasizing cost-effective solutions and knowledge sharing. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on democratizing science and reducing disparities in scientific infrastructure across global research communities."}
