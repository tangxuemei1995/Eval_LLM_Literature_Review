{"Abstract": "Deep-sea mining operations have the potential to significantly impact marine ecosystems through the generation of sediment plumes. This study investigates the fluid mechanics governing sediment transport and plume dynamics in the context of deep-sea mining activities. We examine the interplay between physical oceanographic processes, turbidity currents, and particle settling behavior. Particular attention is given to the role of flocculation in altering sediment transport characteristics. Using a combination of field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling, we quantify the spatial and temporal evolution of mining-induced sediment plumes. Our findings reveal complex interactions between ambient currents, stratification, and particle properties that influence plume dispersion and settling rates. These results provide crucial insights for predicting and mitigating the environmental impacts of deep-sea mining operations, informing both regulatory frameworks and engineering design considerations for future mining endeavors."}
