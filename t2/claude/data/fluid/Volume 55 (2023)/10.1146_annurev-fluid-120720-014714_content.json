{"Abstract": "This study presents advanced sharp interface methods for simulating and analyzing free surface flows with singularities, focusing on breakup and coalescence phenomena. The research addresses critical challenges in modeling complex fluid dynamics encountered in applications such as ink jet printing, microfluidics, and spray systems. By employing finite element techniques, we develop a robust framework capable of accurately capturing the evolution of drops, jets, and filaments during pinch-off and merger events. The proposed methodology effectively handles topological changes and resolves the multi-scale nature of these processes, particularly near singularities. We demonstrate the method's efficacy through a series of numerical experiments, validating results against experimental data and theoretical predictions. Our approach provides new insights into the physics of free surface flows, enabling improved predictions of droplet formation, breakup dynamics, and coalescence behavior. The findings have significant implications for optimizing industrial processes and advancing fundamental understanding in fluid mechanics, particularly in the realm of interfacial phenomena and singularity-driven flows."}
