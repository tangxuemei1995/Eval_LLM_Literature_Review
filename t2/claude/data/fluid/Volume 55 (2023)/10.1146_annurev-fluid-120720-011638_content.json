{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the central nervous system, focusing on its role in the glymphatic system and its implications for neurological health. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques and computational fluid dynamics, we analyze the viscous flow properties of CSF and its interactions with brain tissue. Our findings reveal intricate patterns of CSF circulation, influenced by factors such as sleep-wake cycles, body posture, and age. We demonstrate the significance of CSF flow in waste clearance, nutrient distribution, and maintenance of intracranial pressure. Furthermore, we explore potential links between altered CSF dynamics and neurodegenerative diseases. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of biological fluid mechanics within the brain and may inform future therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders."}
