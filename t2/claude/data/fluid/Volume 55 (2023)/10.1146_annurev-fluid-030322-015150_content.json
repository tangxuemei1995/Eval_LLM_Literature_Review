{"Abstract": "This review explores the fascinating world of particle rafts and armored droplets, focusing on the self-assembly and unique properties of particle-laden interfaces. We examine the intricate interplay between buoyancy, capillarity, and interfacial rheology that governs the behavior of these systems. The study delves into the mechanisms driving particle self-assembly at fluid-fluid interfaces, highlighting the role of surface tension and particle interactions. We discuss the mechanical properties of particle rafts, including their elasticity and resistance to deformation, and how these characteristics can be tuned through particle size, shape, and surface chemistry. The review also covers the formation and stability of armored droplets, emphasizing their potential applications in diverse fields such as materials science, drug delivery, and oil recovery. Furthermore, we analyze recent advances in experimental techniques and theoretical models that have enhanced our understanding of these complex systems. This comprehensive overview provides valuable insights into the fundamental physics and practical applications of particle rafts and armored droplets, paving the way for future innovations in interfacial science and engineering."}
