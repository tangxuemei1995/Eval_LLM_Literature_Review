{"Abstract": "This study investigates the fluid dynamics of polar vortices on Earth, Mars, and Titan, employing a comparative planetology approach. We analyze the atmospheric circulation patterns and vortex dynamics in these diverse planetary environments, focusing on the role of potential vorticity and Rossby waves in shaping polar vortex behavior. Using a combination of observational data and numerical simulations, we examine the similarities and differences in vortex structure, stability, and evolution across the three celestial bodies. Our findings reveal that despite variations in atmospheric composition and planetary parameters, common dynamical processes govern polar vortex formation and maintenance. We identify key factors influencing vortex strength and persistence, including planetary rotation rate, atmospheric stratification, and radiative forcing. This research enhances our understanding of atmospheric dynamics on different planets and provides insights into the fundamental principles of vortex behavior in planetary atmospheres."}
