{"Abstract": "This study presents novel findings on turbulent spots, localized regions of turbulence within transitional flows. We investigate their formation, growth, and interaction in various flow configurations, including boundary layers, pipe flows, channel flows, plane Couette flows, turbomachinery flows, and hypersonic flows. Advanced experimental techniques and high-fidelity numerical simulations are employed to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of turbulent spots. Our results reveal previously unknown mechanisms governing spot propagation and coalescence, shedding light on the complex dynamics of transition to turbulence. We identify key parameters influencing spot behavior across different flow regimes and propose a unified framework for predicting spot development. These insights enhance our understanding of transitional flows and have significant implications for flow control strategies in engineering applications, particularly in turbomachinery and hypersonic vehicle design."}
