{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented attention to the use of face masks as a critical tool in preventing respiratory infections. This study examines the flow physics of face masks to better understand their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne pathogens. Using advanced computational fluid dynamics simulations and experimental techniques, we investigate the complex interactions between exhaled respiratory droplets, mask materials, and ambient air currents. Our findings reveal that mask efficacy is highly dependent on factors such as material porosity, fit, and wear time. We demonstrate that properly fitted masks can significantly reduce the dispersion of potentially infectious aerosols, thereby decreasing the risk of airborne transmission. Additionally, we explore the impact of various environmental conditions on mask performance, including humidity, temperature, and air flow patterns. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms by which face masks impede viral spread and offers evidence-based recommendations for optimizing mask design and usage in the context of respiratory infection control."}
