{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of turbulent rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection, a fundamental problem in fluid dynamics with significant implications for geophysical and astrophysical flows. We present a comprehensive analysis combining theoretical modeling, experimental measurements, and direct numerical simulations to elucidate the interplay between turbulence, buoyancy, and rotation in this canonical system. Our results reveal distinct regimes of heat transport and flow structures as a function of Rayleigh number, rotation rate, and Prandtl number. We observe a transition from rotation-dominated to buoyancy-dominated convection, characterized by changes in heat transfer efficiency and the formation of coherent structures such as thermal plumes and columnar vortices. The study provides new insights into the scaling laws governing heat transport and the mechanisms of angular momentum transfer in rotating convective systems. These findings contribute to our understanding of turbulent convection in rotating environments and have potential applications in climate modeling, oceanography, and planetary science."}
