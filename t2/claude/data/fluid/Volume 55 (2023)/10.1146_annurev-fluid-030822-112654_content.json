{"Abstract": "This paper explores the pioneering contributions of Irmgard Flügge-Lotz (1903-1974) to flow computation and aerodynamics control theory. As one of the first women to make significant advancements in fluid mechanics, Flügge-Lotz's work on compressible boundary layers and numerical methods for flow calculations laid the foundation for modern computational fluid dynamics. Her research at Göttingen and later at Stanford University revolutionized the field of aerodynamics and control systems. This biographical study examines her groundbreaking publications, innovative teaching methods, and the challenges she faced as a woman in a male-dominated field. By analyzing her scientific legacy and personal journey, we gain insights into the evolution of flow computation techniques and the often-overlooked role of women in shaping 20th-century fluid mechanics. Flügge-Lotz's life and work serve as an inspiration for future generations of researchers in aerodynamics and related fields."}
