{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (SWBLI) in compressible flows. Using advanced numerical simulations and experimental techniques, we explore the intricate interplay between shock waves, turbulent boundary layers, and flow separation in three-dimensional configurations. The research focuses on characterizing the unsteady nature of these interactions, including the formation and evolution of shear layers, flow instabilities, and large-scale coherent structures. We examine the impact of various geometric and flow parameters on the SWBLI behavior, such as incoming boundary layer properties, shock strength, and surface curvature. Additionally, we analyze the fluid-structure interaction effects and evaluate potential flow control strategies to mitigate adverse consequences of SWBLI, such as increased drag and heat transfer. Our findings provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing three-dimensional SWBLI, contributing to improved predictive capabilities for high-speed vehicle design and performance optimization in aerospace applications."}
