{"Abstract": "Immersed boundary methods have emerged as powerful numerical techniques for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems. This review provides a historical perspective on the development of immersed boundary methods, tracing their evolution from early formulations to current state-of-the-art implementations. We discuss key milestones, including the introduction of cut-cell approaches, ghost-cell methods, and adaptive mesh refinement strategies. The paper highlights the advantages of immersed boundary methods in handling moving boundaries, fluid-structure interactions, and multiphase flows. We examine recent advancements in wall modeling techniques and their integration with immersed boundary frameworks to improve near-wall resolution and accuracy. The review also explores the application of these methods to multiphysics problems, such as heat transfer and electrokinetic phenomena. Finally, we present a future outlook, discussing emerging trends and challenges in the field, including the potential for machine learning-enhanced immersed boundary methods and their integration with high-performance computing architectures for large-scale simulations of complex engineering systems."}
