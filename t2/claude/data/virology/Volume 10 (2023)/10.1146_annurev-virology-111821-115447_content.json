{"Abstract": "Influenza viruses pose a significant global health threat due to their ability to spread rapidly through airborne transmission. This review examines various strategies to impede the spread of influenza viruses, focusing on both established and emerging interventions. We explore the efficacy of traditional approaches such as vaccines and antivirals, as well as non-pharmaceutical measures including mask-wearing and improved ventilation systems. The role of environmental factors, such as UV light exposure and virus persistence in mucus, is also discussed. Additionally, we evaluate the potential of novel technologies and interventions in blocking respiratory transmission. By synthesizing current research, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the barriers to influenza virus transmission and inform future public health strategies to mitigate the impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks."}
