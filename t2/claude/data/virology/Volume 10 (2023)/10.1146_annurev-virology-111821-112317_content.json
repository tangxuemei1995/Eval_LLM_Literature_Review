{"Abstract": "Enteric viruses, key components of the human virome, play a crucial role in modulating host immune responses within the intestinal environment. This review explores the complex interactions between enteric viruses, particularly norovirus, and the host immune system. We examine the mechanisms by which these viruses evade immune detection, manipulate innate and adaptive immune responses, and establish persistent infections. The impact of enteric viruses on intestinal homeostasis and their potential contribution to gastrointestinal disorders are discussed. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in understanding the immunomodulatory effects of the enteric virome as a whole, emphasizing its influence on both local and systemic immunity. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the intricate relationship between enteric viruses and host immunity, offering potential avenues for therapeutic interventions and vaccine development strategies against these prevalent pathogens."}
