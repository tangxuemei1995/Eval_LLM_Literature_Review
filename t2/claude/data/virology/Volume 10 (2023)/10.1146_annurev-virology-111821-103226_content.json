{"Abstract": "Biomolecular condensates have emerged as crucial players in cellular organization and function. This review explores the intersection of viral biology and phase transitions, focusing on how viruses exploit and manipulate condensates during their life cycles. We examine the formation of viral factories and viroplasms, with particular emphasis on segmented RNA viruses like rotaviruses. These structures serve as hubs for viral replication and assembly, highlighting the importance of phase separation in viral propagation. By analyzing the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-induced condensate formation, we gain insights into both viral strategies and fundamental principles of biomolecular condensation. This understanding not only advances our knowledge of virus-host interactions but also opens new avenues for antiviral therapies targeting phase transition processes."}
