{"Abstract": "The resurrection of the 1918 influenza virus through reverse genetics has provided unprecedented insights into the deadliest pandemic in modern history. This groundbreaking research has revealed key factors contributing to the virus's exceptional virulence and transmission capabilities. By comparing the reconstructed 1918 virus with contemporary strains, scientists have identified specific genetic mutations responsible for its heightened pathogenicity. These findings have enhanced our understanding of influenza virus evolution and host adaptation mechanisms. Furthermore, the study of the resurrected virus has informed the development of improved surveillance systems, antiviral therapies, and vaccine strategies. While ethical concerns surrounding such research persist, the knowledge gained has significantly bolstered our preparedness for future pandemics. This review synthesizes the major discoveries stemming from the 1918 influenza virus resurrection and discusses their implications for public health and pandemic mitigation efforts."}
