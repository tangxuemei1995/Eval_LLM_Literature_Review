{"Abstract": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses pose significant threats to human health, with influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) being notable examples. This review explores the genetic systems of these viruses and highlights the development and applications of reporter strains. Fluorescent and bioluminescent strains have revolutionized our understanding of viral replication, pathogenesis, and host-pathogen interactions. These engineered viruses enable real-time tracking of infection dynamics, assessment of antiviral efficacy, and high-throughput screening for novel therapeutics. We discuss the challenges and strategies in generating stable reporter strains while maintaining viral fitness. Additionally, we examine how these tools have advanced our knowledge of virus-host interactions and their potential in vaccine development. This review underscores the importance of reporter strains in advancing both basic and translational research on segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses."}
