{"Abstract": "The viral protein U (Vpu) is a small but multifunctional accessory protein encoded by HIV-1 that plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis and immune evasion. This review explores the diverse functions of Vpu, highlighting its significance in HIV-1 infection. Vpu facilitates viral release by antagonizing the host restriction factor tetherin and promotes CD4 degradation, enhancing viral particle production and preventing superinfection. Additionally, Vpu modulates host immune responses by interfering with NF-ÎºB signaling and suppressing antiviral gene expression. Recent studies have uncovered a novel role for Vpu in DNA damage repair, further expanding its repertoire of functions. The versatility of Vpu in manipulating host cellular processes makes it an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on Vpu's structure, interactions, and functions, emphasizing its importance in HIV-1 pathogenesis and potential as a drug target. Understanding the multifaceted nature of Vpu provides valuable insights into viral-host interactions and may guide the development of novel antiviral strategies."}
