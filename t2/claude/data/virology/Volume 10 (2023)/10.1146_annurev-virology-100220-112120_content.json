{"Abstract": "Viral evolution is a complex process influenced by various host factors, including proteostasis networks. This review explores how host protein folding biophysics, stress responses, and quality control mechanisms shape viral adaptation. We examine the role of chaperones in facilitating viral protein folding and assembly, as well as their impact on viral replication and pathogenesis. The interplay between viral proteins and host proteostasis machinery is discussed, highlighting how viruses manipulate these systems to promote their survival and propagation. Additionally, we investigate how proteostasis networks contribute to viral resistance against drugs and immune responses. Understanding these interactions provides insights into viral evolution and adaptation strategies, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches. By elucidating the intricate relationship between viral evolution and host proteostasis, this review aims to advance our comprehension of viral pathogenesis and inform future antiviral strategies."}
