{"Abstract": "O-linked glycosylation plays a crucial role in the structure and function of viral envelope proteins. This review explores the significance of mucin-like domains and their interactions with host cell receptors, focusing on heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. We examine how O-linked glycans contribute to viral attachment, entry, and egress processes. The structural characteristics of these glycans and their impact on virion stability and immune evasion are discussed. Furthermore, we analyze the potential of O-linked glycans as targets for vaccine development and antiviral therapies. Recent advances in glycobiology techniques have provided new insights into the complex interplay between viral glycoproteins and host cell factors. Understanding the structure and role of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins is essential for developing effective strategies to combat viral infections and improve vaccine design."}
