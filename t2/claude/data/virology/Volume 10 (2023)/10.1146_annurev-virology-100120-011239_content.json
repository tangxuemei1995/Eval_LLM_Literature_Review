{"Abstract": "Microviruses, exemplified by the well-studied phiX174, represent a diverse group of single-stranded DNA phages within the Microviridae family. This review explores the expanding world of microviruses beyond phiX174, highlighting recent advances in their taxonomy, evolution, and ecological significance. Metagenomic studies have revealed an unexpected abundance and diversity of microviruses across various environments, challenging our understanding of their distribution and host range. We discuss the evolutionary mechanisms driving microvirus diversification and their potential roles in shaping microbial communities. Furthermore, we examine the impact of high-throughput sequencing technologies on uncovering novel microvirus lineages and their contributions to viral dark matter. This comprehensive overview provides insights into the complex interactions between microviruses and their hosts, emphasizing their importance in microbial ecology and potential applications in biotechnology and phage therapy."}
