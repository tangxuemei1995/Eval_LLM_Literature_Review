{"Abstract": "Viral membrane fusion is a critical step in the infection process of enveloped viruses. This review explores the intricate interplay between viral fusion proteins and host cell membranes, focusing on the three classes of viral fusion proteins: I, II, and III. We examine the structural and functional characteristics of these proteins, their conformational changes during fusion, and the formation of trimers-of-hairpins. The energetics of the fusion process is discussed, highlighting the role of fusion peptides and loops in initiating membrane destabilization. We also investigate the dynamics of lipid rearrangement during fusion and the impact of fusion restriction factors on viral entry. Understanding these molecular mechanisms provides valuable insights into viral pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for antiviral interventions."}
