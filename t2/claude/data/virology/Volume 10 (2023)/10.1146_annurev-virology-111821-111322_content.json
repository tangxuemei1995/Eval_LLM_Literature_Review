{"Abstract": "Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, are ubiquitous in the environment and play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities. However, their interactions with mammalian cells remain poorly understood. This review explores the intricate processes by which mammalian cells internalize, traffic, and respond to bacteriophages. We examine the mechanisms of phage endocytosis, intracellular trafficking pathways, and the potential impacts on cellular functions. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of phage-mammalian cell interactions on innate immunity and inflammation, highlighting the emerging concept of the 'virome' in human health. Understanding these processes is essential for elucidating the complex relationships between bacteriophages, their bacterial hosts, and mammalian cells in various physiological and pathological contexts. This knowledge may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches and shed light on the broader ecological significance of bacteriophages in mammalian biology."}
