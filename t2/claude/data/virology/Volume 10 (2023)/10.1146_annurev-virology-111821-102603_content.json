{"Abstract": "This review explores the structural and mechanistic aspects of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) from nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses within the order Mononegavirales. We focus on recent advancements in understanding the RdRps of paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, pneumoviruses, and rhabdoviruses. Through comparative analysis of high-resolution structures and biochemical studies, we elucidate the conserved and unique features of these viral polymerases. The review highlights the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying RNA synthesis, including initiation, elongation, and termination processes. We also discuss the interactions between RdRps and other viral proteins, as well as host factors that modulate polymerase activity. Understanding these structures and mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted antiviral therapies and provides insights into the evolutionary relationships among Mononegavirales. This comprehensive overview serves as a foundation for future research on negative-strand RNA virus polymerases and their potential as therapeutic targets."}
