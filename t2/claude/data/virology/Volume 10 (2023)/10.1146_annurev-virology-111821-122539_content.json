{"Abstract": "This study investigates the intriguing phenomenon of cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses, exploring their potential for extracellular transfer and biocontrol applications. We examine the mechanisms of virus transmission across plant and fungal hosts, focusing on the molecular and cellular factors that facilitate these interactions. Our research reveals novel pathways for virus-virus interactions and identifies key proteins involved in cross-kingdom infection. We demonstrate that certain plant viruses can successfully infect fungal species, and vice versa, challenging traditional host-specificity paradigms. These findings have significant implications for understanding virus evolution, ecological dynamics, and the development of innovative biocontrol strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the potential risks and benefits of harnessing these cross-kingdom interactions for agricultural and biotechnological applications, providing a comprehensive framework for future research in this emerging field."}
