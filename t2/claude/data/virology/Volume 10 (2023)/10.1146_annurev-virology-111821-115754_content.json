{"Abstract": "The complex interplay between the human microbiota and viral infections has emerged as a critical area of research in recent years. This review explores the multifaceted impact of the microbiota on viral pathogenesis, immune responses, and disease outcomes. We examine how commensal bacteria and their metabolites modulate host antiviral defenses, particularly through the regulation of interferon signaling pathways. Additionally, we discuss the role of the virome in shaping the broader microbiome and its implications for human health. The review highlights recent advances in understanding how alterations in microbial communities can influence susceptibility to viral infections and the severity of associated diseases. Furthermore, we explore potential therapeutic strategies that leverage microbiota manipulation to enhance antiviral immunity and improve clinical outcomes. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of considering the microbiota in the context of viral infections and opens new avenues for innovative treatment approaches."}
