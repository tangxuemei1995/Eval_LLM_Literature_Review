{"Abstract": "Tobamoviruses, exemplified by the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), continue to challenge plant immunity systems worldwide. This review explores the intricate interplay between tobamoviruses and plant defense mechanisms, focusing on pattern-triggered immunity, resistance genes, RNA silencing, and salicylic acid-mediated responses. We examine how these viruses evolve to overcome host defenses and discuss the latest breakthroughs in understanding plant-tobamovirus interactions. Special attention is given to the emerging threat of ToBRFV and its impact on global agriculture. By synthesizing recent findings, we highlight potential strategies for developing durable resistance against tobamoviruses in economically important crops. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the ongoing arms race between tobamoviruses and plant immunity, paving the way for innovative approaches in crop protection and viral disease management."}
