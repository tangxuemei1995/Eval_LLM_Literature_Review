{"Abstract": "Paleovirology, the study of ancient viral genomes, has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding human history and past epidemics. This review explores the latest advancements in ancient DNA (aDNA) extraction and sequencing techniques, which have enabled researchers to recover and analyze viral genetic material from archaeological remains. By examining ancient viruses preserved in human tissues, bones, and dental calculus, scientists can reconstruct historical epidemics, track viral evolution, and gain insights into past human-pathogen interactions. The integration of paleogenomics with historical records and archaeological evidence provides a multidisciplinary approach to unraveling the complex relationship between viruses and human populations throughout history. This research not only sheds light on past epidemics but also offers valuable insights into the long-term coevolution of viruses and humans, potentially informing our understanding of modern viral diseases and their impact on human societies."}
