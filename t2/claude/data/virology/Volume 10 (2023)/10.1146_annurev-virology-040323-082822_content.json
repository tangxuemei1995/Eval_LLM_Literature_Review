{"Abstract": "The human microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating immune homeostasis and inflammation, with potential implications for HIV persistence. This review explores the intricate relationships between the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and their impact on immune function and viral persistence in HIV-infected individuals. We examine how dysbiosis in the gut microbiome contributes to chronic immune activation and inflammation, which are hallmarks of HIV infection. The production of SCFAs by commensal bacteria is discussed, highlighting their immunomodulatory effects and potential to mitigate HIV-associated inflammation. Additionally, we investigate the role of bile acids in shaping the microbiome and influencing immune responses. The review also addresses how alterations in microbial metabolites may contribute to HIV persistence by affecting T cell function and viral reservoir dynamics. Understanding these complex interactions provides insights into novel therapeutic approaches for managing HIV-related immune dysfunction and reducing viral persistence. By targeting the microbiome, SCFAs, and bile acid metabolism, future interventions may offer promising strategies to improve immune function, reduce inflammation, and potentially impact HIV cure efforts."}
