{"Abstract": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a crucial mechanism employed by many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, to regulate gene expression and maximize their coding capacity. This review synthesizes recent structural and functional insights into viral PRF, focusing on the interplay between ribosomes, mRNA secondary structures, and trans-acting factors. High-resolution cryo-EM structures have revealed the intricate molecular interactions that occur during frameshifting, particularly the role of RNA pseudoknots in creating mechanical tension on the mRNA. We discuss how these structures, combined with single-molecule studies, have enhanced our understanding of the kinetics and energetics of the frameshifting process. Additionally, we explore the potential of targeting PRF as an antiviral strategy, highlighting recent advances in small molecule inhibitors and RNA-based therapeutics. The conservation of PRF across diverse viral families underscores its importance as a regulatory mechanism and its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral target. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on viral PRF and outlines future research directions in this rapidly evolving field."}
