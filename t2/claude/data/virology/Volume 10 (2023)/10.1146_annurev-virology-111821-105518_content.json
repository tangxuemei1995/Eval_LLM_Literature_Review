{"Abstract": "Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies virus, employ a unique nuclear egress mechanism to escape the host cell nucleus. This process involves the formation of a nuclear egress complex (NEC) and the generation of primary enveloped virions (PEVs). While significant progress has been made in understanding this intricate process, many aspects remain elusive. This review synthesizes current knowledge on herpesvirus nuclear egress, focusing on the structure and function of the NEC, the mechanisms of PEV formation, and the subsequent nuclear membrane fusion events. We highlight recent advances in structural biology and live-cell imaging techniques that have provided unprecedented insights into these processes. Additionally, we discuss the remaining gaps in our understanding, including the precise molecular mechanisms of membrane deformation and scission, as well as the regulation of NEC assembly and disassembly. Elucidating these unknowns will be crucial for developing novel antiviral strategies targeting herpesvirus nuclear egress."}
