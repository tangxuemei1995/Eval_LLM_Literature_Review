{"Abstract": "The discovery of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream effector stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has revolutionized our understanding of innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA. This review explores the evolutionary origins and mechanistic similarities between the eukaryotic cGAS-STING pathway and its prokaryotic counterpart, the cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS). We examine the structural and functional conservation of key components, including cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) and nucleotide second messengers, across diverse organisms. The comparative analysis reveals striking parallels in the detection of foreign nucleic acids, signal transduction, and effector activation between these ancient and modern immune systems. By tracing the evolutionary trajectory from CBASS to cGAS-STING, we gain insights into the fundamental principles governing nucleotide-based immune signaling and its critical role in antiviral defense. This comprehensive overview highlights the remarkable conservation of innate immune strategies and their potential implications for developing novel therapeutic approaches against viral infections."}
