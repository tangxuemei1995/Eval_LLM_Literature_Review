{"Abstract": "This paper introduces the ARFE theme on the social discount rate, a crucial concept in government valuation and public investment decision-making. The social discount rate plays a pivotal role in assessing long-term projects, particularly those with intergenerational impacts such as climate change mitigation. We explore the theoretical foundations and practical applications of the social discount rate, highlighting its significance in determining the cost of carbon and evaluating intergenerational trade-offs. The paper examines various approaches to estimating the social discount rate, including the social opportunity cost and social time preference methods. Additionally, we discuss the ethical considerations and challenges associated with choosing an appropriate discount rate for public policy analysis. This introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the social discount rate's implications for sustainable development and intergenerational equity in public investment decisions."}
