{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household behavior, focusing on consumption patterns, credit utilization, and investment decisions. Using a comprehensive dataset of household financial transactions, we analyze how government stimulus measures and lockdown policies influenced spending habits and financial decision-making. Our findings reveal significant shifts in consumption, with increased expenditure on essential goods and reduced spending on services and discretionary items. We observe a notable rise in household savings and debt repayment, alongside a surge in retail investing activities. The research also highlights the heterogeneous effects of the pandemic across different income groups and demographics. These insights contribute to our understanding of household financial resilience during economic crises and inform policy recommendations for future pandemic preparedness."}
