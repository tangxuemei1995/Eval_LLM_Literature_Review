{"Abstract": "This study examines recent trends in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, focusing on the evolving landscape of corporate restructuring. Analyzing data from the past decade, we investigate the increasing prevalence of 363 sales, the growing influence of private equity firms, and changes in creditor rights. Our findings reveal a shift towards faster, more efficient bankruptcy processes, with higher recovery rates for secured creditors. We also explore the impact of leveraged loans on bankruptcy outcomes and the role of distressed debt investors. This research provides valuable insights for practitioners, policymakers, and scholars seeking to understand the changing dynamics of corporate bankruptcy in the modern financial era."}
