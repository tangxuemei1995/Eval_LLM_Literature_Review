{"Abstract": "This paper examines the effectiveness of swing pricing as a tool for managing liquidity risks in mutual funds. We develop a theoretical model that captures the trade-offs between protecting existing shareholders and maintaining fund attractiveness. Using a comprehensive dataset of European mutual funds, we empirically test the model's predictions. Our findings suggest that swing pricing significantly reduces the likelihood of fire sales during periods of market stress and mitigates the first-mover advantage in redemptions. We observe that funds employing swing pricing exhibit lower flow-performance sensitivity and experience less severe outflows during market downturns. Additionally, we find evidence of improved fund performance and reduced liquidity-driven trading costs. Our results contribute to the ongoing debate on mutual fund liquidity management and provide valuable insights for regulators and fund managers considering the implementation of swing pricing mechanisms."}
