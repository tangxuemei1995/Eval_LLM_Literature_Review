{"Abstract": "This paper examines fiscal capacity through an asset pricing lens, offering novel insights into the relationship between fiscal policy, term structure, and debt maturity. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates the concept of convenience yield into the analysis of government debt management. Our model demonstrates how fiscal capacity influences the term structure of interest rates and optimal debt maturity choices. Empirical evidence from a panel of advanced economies supports our theoretical predictions, showing that countries with higher fiscal capacity exhibit lower term premia and tend to issue longer-term debt. These findings have important implications for policymakers, highlighting the role of fiscal strength in shaping debt management strategies and market perceptions of sovereign risk."}
