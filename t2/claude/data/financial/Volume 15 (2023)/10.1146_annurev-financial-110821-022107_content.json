{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to global macro-financial stability, particularly in emerging markets. This paper examines the multifaceted impact of the crisis on monetary policy and financial stability, drawing insights from recent experiences. We analyze the effectiveness of various policy responses implemented by central banks and financial regulators to mitigate the economic fallout. The study highlights the importance of maintaining a delicate balance between supporting economic recovery and preserving financial stability. Our findings suggest that unconventional monetary policies and targeted financial sector interventions have played crucial roles in stabilizing markets and supporting credit flow. However, we also identify potential risks associated with prolonged accommodative policies, including asset price inflation and increased financial vulnerabilities. The paper concludes by proposing policy recommendations for enhancing macro-financial resilience in the face of future crises, emphasizing the need for flexible and coordinated approaches tailored to emerging market contexts."}
