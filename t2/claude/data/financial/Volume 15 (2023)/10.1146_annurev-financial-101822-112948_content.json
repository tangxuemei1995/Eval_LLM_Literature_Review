{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of missing participants and markets on the social discount rate, focusing on borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates these factors into a comprehensive model of social discounting. Our analysis reveals that incomplete markets and the exclusion of future generations from current decision-making processes significantly affect the appropriate social discount rate. We find that altruistic motives and the desire to leave a legacy partially mitigate the effects of missing markets, but borrowing constraints continue to play a crucial role. The study demonstrates that accounting for these factors leads to a lower social discount rate than traditionally assumed, with important implications for long-term policy decisions, particularly in areas such as climate change mitigation and infrastructure investment."}
