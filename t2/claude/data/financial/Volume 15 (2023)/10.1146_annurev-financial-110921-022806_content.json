{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi), examining their transformative impact on the financial landscape. We analyze the core components of DeFi, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and protocols for loanable funds (PLFs), highlighting their reliance on smart contracts and blockchain technology. The study investigates the role of tokens, particularly within the Ethereum ecosystem, in facilitating various DeFi applications. We discuss the potential benefits of DeFi, such as increased accessibility and transparency, as well as the associated risks and challenges. Our findings suggest that smart contracts and DeFi have the potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems, while emphasizing the need for further research and regulatory considerations."}
