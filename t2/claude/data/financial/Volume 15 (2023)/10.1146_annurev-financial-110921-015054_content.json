{"Abstract": "The transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) has ushered in a new era of short-term rate benchmarks, fundamentally reshaping global financial markets. This paper examines the post-LIBOR landscape, focusing on the adoption of alternative reference rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the United States and the reformed Euribor in Europe. We analyze the characteristics of these new benchmarks, comparing risk-free rates with credit-sensitive alternatives like Ameribor, Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), and AXI. The study investigates the implications of this transition for various financial instruments, particularly interest rate derivatives. Our findings suggest that while SOFR has emerged as the dominant LIBOR replacement, market participants are exploring a diverse range of benchmarks to suit specific needs. The paper concludes by discussing the challenges and opportunities presented by this new regime, including potential impacts on market liquidity, risk management practices, and the overall stability of the global financial system."}
