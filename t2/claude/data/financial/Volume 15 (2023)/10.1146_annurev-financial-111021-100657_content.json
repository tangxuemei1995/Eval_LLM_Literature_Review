{"Abstract": "This study examines recent developments in initial public offerings (IPOs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) as alternative paths to going public. We analyze trends in unicorn valuations, confidential filing practices, and the rise of direct listings. The research explores the increasing popularity of SPACs as a means for private companies to access public markets, highlighting their advantages and potential risks. Additionally, we investigate the prevalence of dual-class share structures in recent IPOs and their impact on corporate governance. Our findings reveal shifting preferences among companies and investors, regulatory changes affecting the IPO landscape, and the evolving dynamics between traditional IPOs and emerging alternatives. This study contributes to the understanding of contemporary capital markets and provides insights for companies considering various options for going public."}
