{"Abstract": "This study examines banking crises from a historical perspective, analyzing their causes, consequences, and policy responses across different time periods and economic contexts. By synthesizing data from multiple countries and centuries, we identify recurring patterns in financial intermediation, leverage, and regulatory frameworks that contribute to systemic instability. The research highlights the evolving role of central banks as lenders of last resort and their impact on crisis mitigation. We explore how historical lessons have shaped modern approaches to financial stability, including the development of macroprudential policies and international cooperation. Our findings suggest that while the specific triggers of banking crises may vary, underlying vulnerabilities in the financial system persist, emphasizing the importance of continued vigilance and adaptive regulatory measures to safeguard against future crises."}
