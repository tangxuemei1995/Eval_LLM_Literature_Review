{"Abstract": "This paper explores the complex puzzles surrounding sovereign debt and default. We examine the paradoxical nature of sovereign lending, where countries continue to borrow despite the absence of formal enforcement mechanisms. Our analysis delves into the economic and political factors that influence sovereign debt dynamics, including reputation effects, domestic costs of default, and international sanctions. We investigate the determinants of debt sustainability and the conditions under which countries choose to default. Additionally, we consider the role of debt restructuring and international financial institutions in mitigating sovereign debt crises. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on optimal debt management strategies and policy implications for both debtor nations and international creditors."}
