{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of robo-advice on household financial decision-making, bridging the gap between FinTech innovations and behavioral finance. We analyze how automated financial guidance transforms households into more rational economic agents, focusing on consumption patterns, debt management, and investment strategies. Using a large-scale dataset of household financial transactions and robo-advisor interactions, we employ machine learning techniques to identify changes in financial behavior. Our findings reveal that robo-advice significantly improves household financial outcomes, reducing behavioral biases and promoting more optimal resource allocation. However, we also uncover limitations in the current robo-advice models, particularly in addressing complex, context-dependent financial situations. This research contributes to the growing literature on FinTech's role in shaping household finance and offers insights for policymakers and financial institutions."}
