{"Abstract": "This study revisits pari-mutuel betting markets, focusing on racetracks and lotteries. We examine the efficiency of racetrack betting markets and explore the persistent favorite-longshot bias. Using stochastic programming optimization models, we analyze betting strategies and their implications for market efficiency. Our research extends to lottery markets, investigating similarities and differences with racetrack betting. We find that while both markets exhibit some inefficiencies, they differ in their underlying mechanisms and participant behaviors. The study contributes to the understanding of decision-making under uncertainty in these unique financial markets and provides insights into potential arbitrage opportunities. Our findings have implications for regulators, market participants, and researchers in the field of behavioral finance."}
