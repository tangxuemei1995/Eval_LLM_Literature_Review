{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving landscape of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the context of sustainable finance and corporate decarbonization efforts. We analyze the impact of externalities on corporate decision-making and the emergence of responsible shareholder mandates. The research investigates the growing phenomenon of 'greeniums' - premium valuations for environmentally responsible companies - and their influence on corporate behavior. Our findings suggest that CSR initiatives, particularly those focused on decarbonization, are increasingly driven by market forces and shareholder expectations. We observe a shift towards more sustainable business practices, with companies internalizing previously overlooked externalities. This study contributes to the understanding of how CSR is reshaping corporate strategies and financial markets, highlighting the complex interplay between environmental concerns, shareholder activism, and corporate performance in the era of sustainable finance."}
