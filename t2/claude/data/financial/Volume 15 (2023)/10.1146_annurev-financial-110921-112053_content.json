{"Abstract": "This paper develops a macro-finance model incorporating nonlinear dynamics to better capture the complex interactions between the financial sector and the real economy. We extend traditional DSGE models by introducing endogenous jump risk and financial constraints, allowing for more realistic representations of systemic risk and liquidity dynamics. Our framework incorporates nonlinear feedback loops between asset prices, credit conditions, and economic activity, generating amplification mechanisms that can explain the sudden and severe downturns observed during financial crises. The model's simulations demonstrate improved performance in replicating key empirical features of financial markets and macroeconomic variables, particularly during periods of heightened market stress. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating nonlinear dynamics in macro-finance models for more accurate risk assessment and policy analysis."}
