{"Abstract": "This paper examines the legal and philosophical foundations of the social discount rate, a crucial parameter in benefit-cost analysis for long-term public projects and policies. We explore the intertemporal and intergenerational implications of discounting, analyzing how different discount rates affect the valuation of future costs and benefits. The study reviews key legal precedents and philosophical arguments surrounding the choice of an appropriate social rate of discount, considering ethical concerns about intergenerational equity and the time preferences of society. We investigate the tension between economic efficiency and moral obligations to future generations, discussing various approaches to reconciling these competing interests. The paper also evaluates the practical challenges of implementing different discounting methodologies in policy-making and judicial contexts. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced and context-specific approach to social discounting, one that balances economic considerations with ethical imperatives and accounts for the unique characteristics of long-term public investments and environmental policies."}
