{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the current state of public discounting systems and proposes reforms to enhance their effectiveness in policy decision-making. We analyze the shortcomings of existing approaches to discounting, risk adjustment, and carbon pricing in cost-benefit analysis. Our research synthesizes insights from economics, environmental science, and public policy to develop a more robust framework for evaluating long-term public investments. We argue that current discounting practices often undervalue future benefits and risks, particularly in the context of climate change mitigation. The paper presents a novel approach that integrates dynamic risk assessment and adaptive carbon pricing mechanisms into traditional discounting models. Our findings suggest that adopting this refined methodology could significantly improve the accuracy and fairness of public project evaluations, leading to more sustainable and equitable policy outcomes across generations."}
