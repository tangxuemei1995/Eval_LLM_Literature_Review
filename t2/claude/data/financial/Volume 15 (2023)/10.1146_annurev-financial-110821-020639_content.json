{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role of epidemiological models in understanding and predicting disease spread. This review examines various epidemiological models and forecasting techniques employed during the pandemic. We analyze compartmental models, such as SIR and SEIR, as well as more complex agent-based models and machine learning approaches. The study evaluates the strengths and limitations of these models in capturing the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, considering factors like social distancing measures and vaccination rates. Additionally, we explore the challenges faced in epidemiological forecasting, including data quality issues and the impact of human behavior. Our findings emphasize the importance of model diversity and continuous refinement in improving the accuracy and reliability of epidemiological predictions for informed decision-making during public health crises."}
