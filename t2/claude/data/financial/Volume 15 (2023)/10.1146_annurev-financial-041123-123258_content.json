{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the application of financial economics principles to the determination of the social discount rate used in government decision-making. While financial economics provides valuable insights into market valuation and risk assessment, its direct application to social discounting faces significant limitations. We argue that the unique nature of government investments, intergenerational considerations, and the presence of market imperfections necessitate a more nuanced approach. The paper explores the tensions between fair value accounting and budgetary accounting in the public sector, highlighting the challenges in reconciling these perspectives with social welfare maximization. Furthermore, we analyze the concept of government cost of capital and its relationship to the social discount rate, emphasizing the need to consider broader societal impacts and long-term consequences. Our findings suggest that while financial economics offers important tools and frameworks, policymakers must exercise caution in their application and supplement them with ethical considerations and social welfare analysis when determining appropriate social discount rates for public projects."}
