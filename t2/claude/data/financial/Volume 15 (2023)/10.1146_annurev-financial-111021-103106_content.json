{"Abstract": "This paper explores the utilization of microdata in macro-finance research, addressing the challenges of identification and aggregation. We demonstrate how granular, individual-level data can enhance our understanding of macroeconomic phenomena and financial markets. By leveraging microdata, researchers can overcome limitations associated with aggregate statistics and uncover heterogeneous effects that are often masked in macro-level analyses. We discuss various methodological approaches for integrating microdata into macro-finance models, including bottom-up aggregation techniques and micro-founded structural models. The paper also examines the potential pitfalls and biases that may arise when extrapolating micro-level findings to macro-scale implications. Furthermore, we explore how microdata can be used to validate and refine existing macro-finance theories, as well as to develop new hypotheses. Our findings suggest that the strategic use of microdata can significantly improve the precision and robustness of macro-finance research, leading to more accurate policy recommendations and financial market insights."}
