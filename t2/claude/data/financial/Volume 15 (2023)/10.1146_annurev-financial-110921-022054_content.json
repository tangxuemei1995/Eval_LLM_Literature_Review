{"Abstract": "This study examines recent trends in state and local pension funds across the United States, focusing on their financial health, policy changes, and implications for government budgets. Analyzing data from 2010 to 2020, we investigate the evolving landscape of public pensions, including funding ratios, investment strategies, and reform efforts. Our findings reveal a mixed picture, with some jurisdictions making progress in addressing unfunded liabilities while others continue to struggle. We observe a shift towards more conservative investment assumptions and increased employee contributions in many systems. Additionally, we explore the impact of demographic changes and economic factors on pension costs and government debt. This research highlights the ongoing challenges faced by state and local governments in balancing retirement promises with fiscal sustainability, and offers insights into potential policy solutions for the future of public pension systems."}
