{"Abstract": "This study examines the unprecedented disruption in fixed income markets during the COVID-19 crisis. We analyze the factors contributing to market instability, including liquidity constraints, investor panic, and policy responses. Using high-frequency data from various fixed income sectors, we document the rapid deterioration of market functioning and the subsequent recovery following central bank interventions. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the impact across different fixed income instruments and highlight the crucial role of monetary policy in stabilizing markets. We also explore the long-term implications of these events for market structure and regulatory frameworks. This research contributes to the understanding of financial market dynamics during extreme stress events and informs future policy decisions."}
