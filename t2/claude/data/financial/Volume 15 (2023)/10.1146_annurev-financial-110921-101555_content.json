{"Abstract": "Climate change poses significant risks to financial stability and the global economy. This study introduces a comprehensive framework for climate stress testing to assess the resilience of financial institutions and systems to climate-related shocks. We develop a multi-scenario approach that incorporates both physical and transition risks associated with climate change. Using a combination of macroeconomic models, climate projections, and financial data, we simulate the potential impacts of various climate scenarios on asset valuations, credit risk, and market dynamics. Our analysis reveals that climate risks can lead to substantial losses and increased volatility in financial markets, with particularly severe consequences for carbon-intensive sectors. We find that the magnitude of these impacts varies significantly across different climate policy scenarios and time horizons. The results underscore the importance of proactive risk management and the integration of climate considerations into financial decision-making processes. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions in developing effective strategies to mitigate climate-related systemic risks and enhance financial stability in the face of ongoing climate change."}
