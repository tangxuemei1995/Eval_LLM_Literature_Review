{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between inflation and asset returns across various economic environments. We analyze historical data to investigate how inflation impacts risk premia and bond return predictability. Our findings reveal that during periods of stagflation, traditional asset allocation strategies may underperform, necessitating a reevaluation of investment approaches. We also explore the role of monetary policy in shaping inflation expectations and its subsequent effects on asset prices. Our results suggest that incorporating inflation dynamics into investment decision-making processes can potentially enhance portfolio performance and risk management strategies. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on the optimal asset allocation in inflationary environments and provides insights for both academics and practitioners."}
