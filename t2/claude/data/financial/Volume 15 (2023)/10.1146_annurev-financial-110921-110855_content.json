{"Abstract": "This paper examines the pricing and hedging of inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework. We develop a comprehensive model for the term structure of interest rates and break-even inflation rates, incorporating both nominal and real yield curves. Our analysis focuses on the dynamics of inflation-indexed securities and their relationship to conventional fixed-income instruments. We derive closed-form solutions for various inflation derivatives and explore the implications for risk management and portfolio optimization. The model is calibrated using market data, and its performance is evaluated through empirical tests. Our findings contribute to the understanding of inflation-linked financial products and provide practical insights for investors and policymakers in managing inflation risk."}
