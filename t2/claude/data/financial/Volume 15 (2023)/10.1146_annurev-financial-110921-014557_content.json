{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving landscape of default and bankruptcy resolution in China, focusing on the interplay between bankruptcy law, nonperforming loans, and shadow banking. We analyze the impact of recent reforms on bond markets and restructuring processes, highlighting the challenges faced by Chinese financial institutions. Our findings reveal significant progress in addressing corporate defaults, but also underscore persistent obstacles in implementing effective bankruptcy procedures. We discuss the implications for investor protection, market stability, and the broader Chinese economy, offering insights for policymakers and market participants navigating this complex terrain."}
