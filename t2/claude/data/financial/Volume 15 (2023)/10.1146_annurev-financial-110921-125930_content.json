{"Abstract": "This study explores the critical issue of algorithmic fairness in machine learning, focusing on its implications for credit scoring systems. As algorithms increasingly influence decision-making processes, concerns about bias and discrimination have come to the forefront. We examine various fairness metrics and their applicability to credit scoring algorithms, highlighting the challenges in balancing accuracy with equitable outcomes. Our research employs a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical data from credit scoring systems. Results indicate that while machine learning algorithms can improve predictive accuracy, they may inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases. We propose a framework for evaluating and mitigating algorithmic bias in credit scoring, emphasizing the importance of transparency, interpretability, and continuous monitoring. This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on ethical AI and provides practical insights for policymakers and practitioners in the financial sector."}
