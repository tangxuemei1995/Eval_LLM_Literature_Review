{"Abstract": "Data science presents both challenges and opportunities in advancing women's health research. This review explores the intersection of data science and biomedical research in reproductive and gynecologic health. We examine the potential of leveraging electronic health records and other large-scale datasets to gain insights into women's health issues. The paper discusses methodological challenges, including data quality, privacy concerns, and the need for diverse representation in datasets. We highlight successful applications of data science in areas such as predicting pregnancy complications and improving cancer screening. Additionally, we identify emerging opportunities for machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance personalized care in women's health. Finally, we propose strategies to overcome current limitations and maximize the impact of data science in this critical field."}
