{"Abstract": "Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare strategies to individual genetic profiles, but its effectiveness relies heavily on the diversity of genetic data used in research. This review explores the critical importance of including diverse ancestry groups in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the implications for identifying disease susceptibility variants. We examine how the current underrepresentation of non-European populations in genetic research limits the generalizability of findings and potentially exacerbates health disparities. The paper discusses strategies to increase diversity in cohorts and consortia, highlighting successful initiatives and ongoing challenges. We also analyze the impact of diverse genetic data on the development and application of polygenic risk scores, emphasizing their potential to improve disease prediction across populations. By synthesizing recent literature, we demonstrate that enhancing diversity in genetic studies is crucial for advancing precision medicine, ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes, and uncovering novel genetic associations that may be ancestry-specific or shared across populations."}
