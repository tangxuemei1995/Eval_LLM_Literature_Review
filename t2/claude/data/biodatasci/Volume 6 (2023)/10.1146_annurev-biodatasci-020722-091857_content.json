{"Abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of human cancers by providing unprecedented resolution of cellular heterogeneity within tumors. This powerful technology enables the comprehensive profiling of gene expression at the individual cell level, revealing intricate details of the tumor microenvironment and cellular interactions. By applying scRNA-seq to cancer research, scientists have uncovered novel cell populations, identified potential therapeutic targets, and gained insights into tumor evolution and drug resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, scRNA-seq has proven invaluable in studying the complex interplay between cancer cells and the immune system, facilitating the development of more effective immunotherapies. This review explores the applications of scRNA-seq in cancer research, highlighting its potential to advance personalized medicine and improve patient outcomes through a deeper understanding of tumor biology and therapeutic responses."}
