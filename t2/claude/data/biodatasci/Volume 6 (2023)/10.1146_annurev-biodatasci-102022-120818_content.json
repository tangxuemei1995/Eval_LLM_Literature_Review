{"Abstract": "The study of gene interactions, or epistasis, has gained significant traction in human disease research, with mounting evidence supporting its crucial role in understanding complex genetic architectures. This review synthesizes recent findings on epistatic effects in various human diseases, highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions beyond additive models. We explore how advances in multiomics technologies and analytical methods have facilitated the detection and characterization of epistatic interactions. The integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data has revealed intricate networks of genetic interactions that contribute to disease susceptibility and progression. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of epistasis for precision medicine, emphasizing how knowledge of gene interactions can inform more accurate risk prediction models and tailored therapeutic strategies. As the field progresses, challenges in statistical power and interpretation of high-dimensional data persist. Nevertheless, the growing body of evidence underscores the potential of epistasis research to revolutionize our understanding of human disease etiology and pave the way for more effective personalized interventions."}
