{"Abstract": "Single-cell proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. This review explores computational methods for analyzing single-cell proteomic data, focusing on mass cytometry and spatial proteomics techniques. We discuss state-of-the-art approaches for data preprocessing, normalization, and quality control. Advanced clustering algorithms and trajectory inference methods are examined for their ability to reveal cell populations and developmental processes. Additionally, we highlight computational strategies for integrating proteomic data with other single-cell omics modalities. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in computational single-cell proteomics, emphasizing the need for scalable and interpretable methods to handle increasingly complex datasets."}
