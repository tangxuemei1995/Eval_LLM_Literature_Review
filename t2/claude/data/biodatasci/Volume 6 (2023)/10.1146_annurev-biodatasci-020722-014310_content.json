{"Abstract": "Admixed populations present unique challenges and opportunities in genomic research. This review explores advanced strategies for analyzing the genetic architecture of complex traits in admixed individuals. We discuss recent methodological developments in statistical genetics that leverage admixture patterns to enhance the power and resolution of association studies. Key approaches include local ancestry inference, admixture mapping, and ancestry-aware fine-mapping techniques. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of these methods in the context of diverse admixed populations worldwide. Additionally, we examine how integrating admixture analysis with functional genomics data can provide insights into the evolutionary history and adaptive significance of trait-associated variants. Finally, we highlight the potential of admixture-based approaches to address health disparities and improve the generalizability of genetic findings across populations."}
