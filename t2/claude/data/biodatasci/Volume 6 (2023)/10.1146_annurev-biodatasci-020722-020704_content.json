{"Abstract": "The unequal representation of diverse populations in biomedical datasets poses a significant challenge to the development of equitable artificial intelligence (AI) systems in healthcare. This paper explores the implications of data inequality on AI-driven health interventions and proposes innovative strategies to mitigate its effects. We examine the concept of subpopulation shift and its impact on model performance across different ethnic groups. The potential of transfer learning techniques to address data scarcity in underrepresented populations is investigated. Additionally, we discuss the development of multiethnic machine learning approaches that can effectively leverage limited data from minority groups. Our findings highlight the importance of collaborative data sharing initiatives and the need for targeted data collection efforts to enhance health equity. We conclude by outlining a roadmap for future research aimed at creating more inclusive and generalizable AI models in biomedicine."}
