{"Abstract": "This study investigates the integration of molecular and radiomic features for improved risk assessment in breast cancer. We combine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores with radiomic features extracted from mammographic images to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model. A cohort of 1,500 breast cancer patients and 1,500 healthy controls underwent genetic testing and mammography. Radiomic features were extracted using advanced image analysis techniques, while genetic data was used to calculate polygenic risk scores. Machine learning algorithms were employed to integrate these diverse data types and create a unified risk prediction model. The combined model demonstrated superior performance compared to models based on genetic or radiomic features alone, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85. Our findings suggest that the integration of molecular and radiomic features can significantly enhance breast cancer risk assessment, potentially leading to more personalized screening and prevention strategies."}
