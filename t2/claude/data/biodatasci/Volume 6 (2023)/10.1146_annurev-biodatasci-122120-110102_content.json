{"Abstract": "Deciphering the functional significance of noncoding DNA sequences remains a critical challenge in genomics. This review explores recent advances in identifying and characterizing functional elements and variants within noncoding regions. We discuss the integration of high-throughput experimental techniques, computational approaches, and machine learning algorithms to predict enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, and other regulatory elements. The application of deep learning models to interpret noncoding sequence patterns and their impact on gene regulation is examined. We also highlight the importance of these methods in understanding rare variants and their potential contributions to complex traits and diseases, as revealed by whole genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies. Finally, we consider future directions for improving variant effect prediction in noncoding regions."}
