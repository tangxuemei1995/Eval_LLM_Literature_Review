{"Abstract": "Aging is a complex biological process characterized by distinct hallmarks. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of these hallmarks at unprecedented resolution. This review explores the latest developments in decoding aging hallmarks at the single-cell level, highlighting novel intervention targets and mechanisms. We discuss cutting-edge analysis tools that enable the interrogation of age-related changes across diverse cell types and tissues. Furthermore, we examine emerging data resources that facilitate the integration and interpretation of single-cell aging data. By synthesizing these findings, we provide insights into the heterogeneity of cellular aging processes and their potential implications for developing targeted interventions to promote healthy aging and combat age-related diseases."}
