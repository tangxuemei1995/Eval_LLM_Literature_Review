{"Abstract": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has revolutionized prenatal care by utilizing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) from maternal blood. This review explores recent advances, challenges, and future possibilities in NIPT. We discuss the evolution of liquid biopsy techniques for detecting fetal genetic abnormalities and their integration into clinical practice. The article examines the improved accuracy and expanded scope of NIPT, including the detection of microdeletions, single-gene disorders, and fetal fraction estimation. We address current limitations, such as false-positive results and confined placental mosaicism. Additionally, we explore emerging applications of cfRNA analysis for monitoring fetal development and predicting pregnancy-related complications. The potential of combining genomic and transcriptomic approaches to enhance NIPT's diagnostic capabilities is also considered. Finally, we highlight ethical considerations and the need for genetic counseling in the era of increasingly comprehensive prenatal screening."}
