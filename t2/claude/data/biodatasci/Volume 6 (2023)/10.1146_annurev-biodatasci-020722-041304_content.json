{"Abstract": "Rapidly mutating viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV, pose significant challenges to vaccine development due to their ability to evade immune responses. This review examines recent progress and ongoing challenges in designing broad-spectrum vaccines against these pathogens. We discuss the potential of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) as a key strategy for achieving universal protection. The review highlights innovative approaches, including structure-based vaccine design, germline-targeting immunogens, and novel adjuvants, which aim to elicit broad-spectrum immunity. Additionally, we explore the use of cutting-edge technologies, such as mRNA platforms and nanoparticle-based delivery systems, in enhancing vaccine efficacy. While significant strides have been made, particularly in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 research, major hurdles remain in developing truly universal vaccines. The review concludes by outlining future directions and emphasizing the importance of continued collaborative efforts in addressing this critical global health challenge."}
