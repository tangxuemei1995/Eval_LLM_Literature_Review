{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to understand the genetic factors influencing disease severity. This study investigates the contributions of rare and common genetic variants to COVID-19 pneumonia susceptibility and progression. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a large cohort of COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, comparing them to asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and healthy controls. Our analysis revealed several novel loci associated with increased risk of severe disease, including genes involved in innate immunity and interferon signaling pathways. Additionally, we identified rare loss-of-function variants in genes related to type I interferon responses, suggesting a potential role for inborn errors of immunity in COVID-19 severity. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture of COVID-19 susceptibility and may inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies and personalized risk assessment tools for managing the ongoing pandemic."}
