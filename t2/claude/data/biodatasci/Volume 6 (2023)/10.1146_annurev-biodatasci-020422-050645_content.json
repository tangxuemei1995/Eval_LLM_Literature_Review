{"Abstract": "Single-cell multiomics has emerged as a powerful approach to comprehensively profile individual cells at multiple molecular levels. This rapidly evolving field integrates various next-generation sequencing technologies to simultaneously measure multiple modalities, such as genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics, within single cells. The integration of these diverse data types provides unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, regulatory networks, and dynamic processes. However, the analysis of multimodal single-cell data presents significant computational challenges, requiring advanced algorithms and statistical methods for data integration, normalization, and interpretation. This review explores recent developments in single-cell multiomics technologies, computational approaches for data integration and analysis, and their applications in understanding complex biological systems. We discuss current limitations and future directions, highlighting the potential of single-cell multiomics to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease mechanisms."}
