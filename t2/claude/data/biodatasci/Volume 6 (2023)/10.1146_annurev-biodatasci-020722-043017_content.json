{"Abstract": "The human microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, making it a vital area of study for biomedical data scientists. This review explores the intersection of microbiome research and data science, focusing on sequencing techniques such as 16S rRNA and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We discuss the challenges and opportunities in analyzing complex microbiome datasets, including taxonomic classification, functional annotation, and integration with other omics data. The application of advanced computational methods, including machine learning and network analysis, to microbiome data is examined. We highlight the potential of microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics, emphasizing the importance of robust data analysis pipelines. This overview provides biomedical data scientists with essential knowledge to navigate the rapidly evolving field of microbiome research and its implications for human health."}
