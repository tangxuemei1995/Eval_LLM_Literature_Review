{"Abstract": "This review explores the role of virus-derived small RNAs and microRNAs in health and disease, with a focus on virally encoded microRNAs (v-miRNAs). We discuss the biogenesis and functions of these regulatory molecules, particularly in the context of Epstein-Barr virus infection. The application of bioinformatics approaches in identifying and characterizing v-miRNAs is examined, highlighting the importance of viral RNA bioinformatics resources in advancing our understanding of these molecules. We also investigate the potential implications of v-miRNAs in viral pathogenesis, host-virus interactions, and their prospective use as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of small RNAs and v-miRNAs in viral infections and their impact on human health."}
