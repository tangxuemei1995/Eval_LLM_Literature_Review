{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches have revolutionized drug discovery processes. This review explores the latest developments in molecular docking, machine learning, and deep learning techniques applied to virtual screening of ultralarge chemical libraries. We discuss the integration of GPU acceleration to enhance computational efficiency and throughput, enabling the screening of billions of compounds. The application of free energy simulations to improve the accuracy of binding affinity predictions is also examined. Furthermore, we highlight the synergistic combination of structure-based methods with ligand-based approaches, resulting in more robust and reliable hit identification. The review also addresses challenges in handling big data generated from ultralarge screenings and the potential of artificial intelligence in optimizing screening workflows. These cutting-edge methodologies are poised to significantly accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, potentially reducing costs and time-to-market for new therapeutic agents."}
