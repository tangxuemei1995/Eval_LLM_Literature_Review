{"Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by diverse behavioral and cognitive phenotypes. Recent advancements in data science and machine learning (ML) offer promising avenues for enhancing our understanding and management of ASD. This review synthesizes current research on the application of data science and ML techniques in autism phenotyping, diagnosis, and intervention. We explore the potential of digital phenotyping, which leverages smartphone and wearable technology to capture real-time behavioral data, providing unprecedented insights into ASD manifestations. The review also examines the role of ML algorithms in improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting treatment outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging field of digital psychiatry and its implications for personalized interventions in ASD. Crowdsourcing initiatives are highlighted as valuable tools for collecting large-scale, diverse datasets crucial for robust ML model development. Despite the significant progress, challenges remain in data standardization, privacy concerns, and clinical integration. We conclude by proposing a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical considerations, and the development of interpretable ML models to advance the field of computational autism research."}
