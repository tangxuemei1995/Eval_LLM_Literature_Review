{"Abstract": "Deep generative models, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have emerged as powerful tools in functional and evolutionary genomics. This review explores their applications in deciphering complex genetic patterns, predicting functional elements, and modeling evolutionary processes. We discuss how VAEs can efficiently compress high-dimensional genomic data and infer latent representations, enabling the discovery of novel genetic variants and regulatory elements. GANs are examined for their ability to generate realistic genomic sequences and simulate evolutionary scenarios. The integration of these models with traditional genomic analyses is highlighted, showcasing their potential to enhance our understanding of gene function, regulatory networks, and evolutionary dynamics. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in applying deep generative models to genomic research."}
