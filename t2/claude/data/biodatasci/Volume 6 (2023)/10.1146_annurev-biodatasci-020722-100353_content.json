{"Abstract": "This research explores advanced statistical learning methods for analyzing neuroimaging data, with a focus on applications in neuroscience and clinical studies. We investigate causal pathway analysis to uncover relationships between brain structure, function, and behavior. The study addresses challenges in handling heterogeneity within neuroimaging datasets and develops novel image processing techniques to enhance data quality. We examine various neuroimaging modalities and their integration to provide comprehensive insights into brain function. Population-based statistical analyses are employed to identify patterns and biomarkers across large cohorts. Additionally, we propose innovative study designs to optimize data collection and improve the reliability of neuroimaging research. Our findings contribute to the advancement of neuroimaging data analysis methods and their practical applications in understanding brain function and disorders."}
