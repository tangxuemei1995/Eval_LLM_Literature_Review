{"Abstract": "Alternative splicing plays a crucial role in expanding protein diversity and regulating gene expression. This review explores the current methodologies and challenges in identifying splice variants and protein isoforms using transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. We discuss the advantages and limitations of short-read and long-read RNA sequencing technologies for detecting alternative splicing events and reconstructing full-length transcripts. Additionally, we examine the application of top-down mass spectrometry in characterizing proteoforms and its integration with transcriptomic data. The review highlights recent advancements in bioinformatics tools and algorithms for improved splice variant detection and isoform quantification. Furthermore, we address the challenges in correlating transcriptomic and proteomic data to provide a comprehensive understanding of gene expression and protein diversity. This integrative approach offers valuable insights into the complex landscape of alternative splicing and its impact on cellular function and disease mechanisms."}
