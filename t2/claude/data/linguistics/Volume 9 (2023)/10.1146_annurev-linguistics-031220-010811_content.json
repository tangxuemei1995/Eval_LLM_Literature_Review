{"Abstract": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework has emerged as a powerful approach in computational pragmatics, bridging the gap between theoretical linguistics and empirical research. This framework models language use as a process of recursive social reasoning, where speakers and listeners reason about each other's intentions and knowledge. By integrating probabilistic inference with game-theoretic principles, RSA provides a formal account of how context and shared knowledge influence language interpretation and production. This paper reviews the key components of the RSA framework, its applications in various linguistic phenomena, and its contributions to experimental pragmatics and semantics. We discuss how RSA has shed light on pragmatic phenomena such as scalar implicature, metaphor comprehension, and referential communication. Furthermore, we explore the framework's potential for advancing our understanding of the interplay between semantics, pragmatics, and cognitive processes in natural language use."}
