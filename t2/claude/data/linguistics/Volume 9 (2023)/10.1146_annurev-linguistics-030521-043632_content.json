{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to verb classification across multiple languages, addressing the challenges of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP). We propose a framework that combines knowledge augmentation of neural models with crowdsourced data to create a comprehensive and linguistically diverse verb classification system. Our method leverages pre-trained language models and enhances them with structured linguistic knowledge, while also incorporating human expertise through carefully designed crowdsourcing tasks. We evaluate our approach on a dataset comprising 10 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating significant improvements in verb classification accuracy compared to existing monolingual and cross-lingual baselines. The results highlight the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in capturing nuanced verb semantics across languages, paving the way for more robust multilingual NLP applications. This work contributes to the growing field of multilingual language understanding and offers valuable insights for future research in cross-lingual semantic analysis."}
