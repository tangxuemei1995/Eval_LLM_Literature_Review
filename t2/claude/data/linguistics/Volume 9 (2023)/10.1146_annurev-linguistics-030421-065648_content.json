{"Abstract": "This review examines recent advances in understanding Chinese developmental dyslexia, focusing on linguistic profiles, brain abnormalities, and genetic factors. Research reveals both language-universal and language-specific characteristics in Chinese dyslexia. Linguistic profiles highlight deficits in phonological awareness, rapid naming, and orthographic processing. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate structural and functional abnormalities in left-hemisphere reading-related regions, with some unique features compared to alphabetic languages. Genetic investigations have identified several susceptibility genes, some shared with other populations and others potentially specific to Chinese dyslexia. The interplay between universal and language-specific factors in Chinese dyslexia underscores the importance of cross-linguistic research. This review synthesizes current findings, discusses their implications for diagnosis and intervention, and identifies areas for future investigation to enhance our understanding of developmental dyslexia in Chinese and other writing systems."}
