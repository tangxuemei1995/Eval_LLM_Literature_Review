{"Abstract": "This study investigates adjective ordering preferences across diverse languages, exploring cross-linguistic regularities in modification patterns. Analyzing data from typologically distinct language families, we examine the extent to which universal cognitive principles influence adjective sequencing. Our findings reveal significant similarities in ordering preferences, particularly for size, age, and color adjectives. However, we also identify language-specific variations, suggesting a complex interplay between universal tendencies and cultural-linguistic factors. These results contribute to our understanding of the cognitive underpinnings of language and have implications for theories of universal grammar and language acquisition."}
