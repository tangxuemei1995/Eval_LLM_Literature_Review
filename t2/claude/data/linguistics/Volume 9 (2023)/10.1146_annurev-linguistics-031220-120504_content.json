{"Abstract": "This paper surveys recent technological advancements in language documentation, focusing on resource creation and mobilization. We examine innovative tools and platforms that have emerged in the past decade, enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of language documentation processes. Key areas of progress include mobile applications for field data collection, cloud-based collaboration systems, and automated transcription and annotation tools. The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in language documentation workflows is also discussed, highlighting their potential to accelerate resource creation and analysis. Additionally, we explore novel approaches to resource mobilization, such as crowdsourcing and gamification, which have expanded participation in language documentation efforts. This review underscores the transformative impact of technology on the field and identifies promising directions for future research and development."}
