{"Abstract": "This study explores animal communication from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, drawing on seminal works by Washburn, Ladygina-Kohts, and Grice. It examines the extent to which animal communication systems exhibit key features of human language, such as duality of patterning and generativity. The research synthesizes findings from comparative cognition studies to assess the cognitive underpinnings of animal communication across various species. By analyzing vocalizations, gestures, and other communicative behaviors, the study investigates the presence of Gricean maxims and intentionality in animal interactions. The findings reveal both similarities and differences between human and animal communication systems, highlighting the evolutionary continuum of cognitive and linguistic abilities. This interdisciplinary approach provides new insights into the nature of communication and cognition, contributing to our understanding of language evolution and the cognitive capacities of non-human animals."}
