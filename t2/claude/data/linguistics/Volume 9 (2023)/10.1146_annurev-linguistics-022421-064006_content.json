{"Abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive typological analysis of reciprocal constructions across diverse languages. Drawing on data from a wide range of linguistic families, we examine the morphosyntactic strategies employed to express reciprocity and their relationship to semantic and pragmatic factors. Our investigation reveals significant cross-linguistic variation in the encoding of reciprocal meanings, including lexical, morphological, and syntactic mechanisms. We propose a novel typology that categorizes reciprocal constructions based on their formal properties, semantic scope, and degree of symmetry. The findings highlight the interplay between valency-changing operations and reciprocal marking, as well as the role of cultural and cognitive factors in shaping reciprocal expressions. This research contributes to our understanding of the universal and language-specific aspects of reciprocity in human communication."}
