{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on language processing and development, focusing on the concept of 'meaningful differences' in communication across diverse SES backgrounds. Through a comprehensive analysis of parental input, syntactic parsing abilities, and overall language acquisition, we examine how SES-related factors influence children's linguistic trajectories. Our research combines longitudinal observations of parent-child interactions, standardized language assessments, and experimental tasks to measure syntactic processing efficiency. Results reveal significant disparities in the quantity and quality of linguistic input across SES groups, with cascading effects on children's language development and processing skills. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors and language acquisition, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address linguistic inequalities. The study's implications extend to educational policies and practices aimed at promoting equitable language development opportunities for children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds."}
