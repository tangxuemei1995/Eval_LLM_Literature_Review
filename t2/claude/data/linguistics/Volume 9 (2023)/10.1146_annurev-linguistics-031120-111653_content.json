{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of computational models for anaphora resolution, a crucial task in natural language processing. We examine various approaches, including traditional rule-based methods, machine learning techniques, and state-of-the-art neural models. The study analyzes the effectiveness of these models in addressing different types of anaphora, such as coreference, bridging reference, and discourse deixis. We also discuss the challenges posed by the Winograd Schema Challenge and its implications for anaphora resolution systems. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of corpora availability and quality on model performance. Our findings highlight the recent advancements in neural models for coreference resolution while identifying areas for future research to improve the handling of complex anaphoric phenomena."}
