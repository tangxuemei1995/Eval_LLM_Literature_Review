{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex dynamics of heritage languages, focusing on the processes of acquisition, loss, and potential regaining among heritage speakers. Drawing on extensive research in bilingualism and language attrition, we examine the unique linguistic profiles of heritage speakers compared to native speakers. The investigation delves into the factors contributing to L1 attrition in heritage language contexts and the potential for language reactivation and relearning. Our findings suggest that while heritage speakers often experience incomplete acquisition or attrition of their heritage language, they possess latent linguistic knowledge that can be leveraged for language regaining. The study highlights the importance of tailored language instruction and immersion experiences in facilitating the reactivation of heritage languages. These insights contribute to our understanding of language maintenance in multilingual societies and have implications for heritage language education and revitalization efforts."}
