{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of environmental linguistics, biodiversity conservation, and indigenous knowledge systems, focusing on the Tuvan people of Southern Siberia. By examining the relationship between language, ecological understanding, and environmental stewardship, we investigate how native science and environmental intelligence contribute to sustainable practices. The research employs a decolonial approach to highlight the importance of preserving indigenous languages and traditional ecological knowledge in biodiversity conservation efforts. Through ethnographic fieldwork and linguistic analysis, we demonstrate how Tuvan language encodes crucial environmental information and supports adaptive strategies for ecosystem management. Our findings suggest that integrating native science with contemporary conservation approaches can enhance biodiversity protection and promote more holistic environmental policies. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on environmental linguistics and emphasizes the need for collaborative, culturally-sensitive approaches to global environmental challenges."}
