{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between impersonal pronouns and first-person perspective in language, focusing on their roles in attitude reports, de se interpretations, and generic statements. By analyzing cross-linguistic data and conducting experimental studies, we explore how impersonal pronouns interact with indexicality and perspective-taking mechanisms. Our findings reveal that impersonal pronouns often serve as a bridge between personal and generic interpretations, allowing speakers to express subjective experiences while maintaining a degree of detachment. We demonstrate that the use of impersonal pronouns in attitude reports can lead to ambiguities between de se and de re readings, highlighting the complex interplay between grammatical form and cognitive perspective. Furthermore, we show that impersonal pronouns contribute to the formation of generic statements, enabling speakers to generalize personal experiences to broader populations. This research enhances our understanding of the cognitive and linguistic processes underlying perspective-taking and self-reference in natural language."}
