{"Abstract": "This study examines the assessment of second language speaking proficiency, focusing on the challenges and methodologies involved in evaluating learners' oral communication skills. The research explores various approaches to speaking assessment, including task-based evaluations, interactive interviews, and technology-enhanced methods. By analyzing data from multiple assessment contexts, the study investigates the reliability and validity of different assessment techniques in capturing the complexities of spoken language production. Particular attention is given to the role of interaction in speaking proficiency and how it can be effectively measured. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating authentic communicative tasks and considering both linguistic and pragmatic competencies in speaking assessments. This research contributes to the ongoing development of more comprehensive and accurate methods for evaluating second language speaking proficiency, with implications for language teaching, testing, and curriculum design."}
