{"Abstract": "This study critically examines the concept of language policy and planning (LPP) within the context of postcolonial nation-states, focusing on Sudan as a case study. It challenges the traditional notion of the modern state as a homogeneous entity and explores the limitations of applying Western-centric LPP models to postcolonial contexts. By adopting a Southern perspective, the research investigates how colonial legacies, linguistic diversity, and power dynamics shape language policies in Sudan. The study employs a qualitative approach, analyzing historical documents, policy papers, and interviews with key stakeholders. Findings reveal that the complexities of Sudan's linguistic landscape and socio-political realities often render conventional LPP frameworks inadequate. The research contributes to the growing body of literature on postcolonial approaches to LPP and advocates for more nuanced, context-specific strategies that acknowledge the unique challenges faced by postcolonial nation-states in managing linguistic diversity and promoting national unity."}
