{"Abstract": "This paper examines the role of serialism and opacity in phonological theory, focusing on the challenges posed by opaque processes to parallel frameworks such as classic Optimality Theory (OT). We argue that while OT has been successful in accounting for many phonological phenomena, it struggles to adequately capture opaque interactions without additional machinery. We propose that Harmonic Serialism, a serial variant of OT, offers a more elegant solution to opacity problems by incorporating derivational steps into the constraint-based framework. Through a series of case studies involving counterfeeding and counterbleeding interactions, we demonstrate how Harmonic Serialism can account for opaque processes that are problematic for parallel OT. Our findings suggest that a return to serial derivation, albeit within a constraint-based model, may be necessary to fully capture the complexities of phonological opacity."}
