{"Abstract": "This paper addresses critical issues in the analysis of experimental linguistic data, proposing a shift towards more robust and informative statistical approaches. We advocate for the adoption of Bayesian methods as a superior alternative to traditional null hypothesis significance testing. The benefits of Bayesian analysis, including the ability to quantify uncertainty and compare competing hypotheses using Bayes factors, are discussed in the context of psycholinguistic research. We provide practical guidelines for implementing these methods and interpreting their results. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of pre-registration, power analysis, and effect size estimation in experimental design. By embracing these 'right ways' of data analysis, researchers can enhance the reliability and reproducibility of their findings, ultimately advancing our understanding of language processing and acquisition."}
