{"Abstract": "This study investigates the cross-linguistic manifestation of prosodic prominence, focusing on the interplay between pitch accent and lexical stress across diverse language families. Employing the Rapid Prosody Transcription method, we analyze acoustic and perceptual data from 20 typologically distinct languages. Our findings reveal significant variations in the realization and perception of prominence, challenging traditional assumptions in metrical phonology. While some languages exhibit a strong correlation between pitch accent and lexical stress, others demonstrate a more complex relationship, with prominence emerging from the interaction of multiple prosodic features. We propose a refined prosodic typology that accounts for these cross-linguistic differences, offering a more nuanced understanding of how prominence is encoded and perceived across languages. This research has important implications for speech recognition technologies, second language acquisition, and our theoretical understanding of prosodic systems. Our results underscore the need for a more comprehensive approach to studying prosodic prominence that considers both universal tendencies and language-specific characteristics."}
