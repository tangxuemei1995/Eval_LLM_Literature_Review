{"Abstract": "This paper examines the phenomenon of hyperraising, a syntactic operation involving movement out of finite clauses, which challenges traditional assumptions about clause boundaries and movement constraints. We review three prominent approaches to explaining hyperraising: defectiveness/nonphase analyses, deactivation analyses, and phase-edge analyses. By comparing these theoretical frameworks, we evaluate their strengths and limitations in accounting for crosslinguistic variation in hyperraising constructions. Our investigation reveals that while each approach offers valuable insights, no single theory fully captures the complexity of hyperraising across languages. We propose a hybrid model that incorporates elements from all three approaches, suggesting that the availability of hyperraising may be determined by a combination of clause structure, feature deactivation, and phase-edge accessibility. This integrated perspective provides a more comprehensive account of the observed crosslinguistic patterns and offers new avenues for future research on the nature of syntactic movement and clause boundaries in generative grammar."}
