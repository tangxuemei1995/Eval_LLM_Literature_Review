{"Abstract": "This paper examines the contentious issues surrounding homesign, a gestural communication system developed by deaf individuals without access to conventional sign languages. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and linguistic ethnographic studies, we explore the debates concerning homesign's status as a language, its role in language emergence, and its sociolinguistic implications. The research highlights the complex interplay between homesign and established sign languages, addressing questions of linguistic complexity, grammatical structure, and communicative efficacy. We investigate the challenges faced by homesigners in various social contexts and the potential impact of homesign on deaf education and language policy. By synthesizing diverse perspectives from sociolinguistics and language acquisition studies, this paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of homesign's place within the broader landscape of human communication and language development."}
