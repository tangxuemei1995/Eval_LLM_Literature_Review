{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted landscape of ethics in linguistics, examining the interplay between ethical praxis, regulatory ethics, and relational ethics within the field. It investigates how these ethical dimensions influence research methodologies, data collection, and the interpretation of linguistic phenomena. The study critically analyzes the current ethical frameworks governing linguistic research and their impact on scientific validity. By examining case studies and conducting a comprehensive literature review, the paper highlights the challenges and opportunities in maintaining ethical standards while pursuing rigorous linguistic inquiry. The findings underscore the importance of developing a more nuanced and context-sensitive approach to ethics in linguistics, one that balances scientific objectives with the rights and well-being of research participants. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on ethical considerations in linguistic studies and proposes recommendations for enhancing ethical practices in the field."}
