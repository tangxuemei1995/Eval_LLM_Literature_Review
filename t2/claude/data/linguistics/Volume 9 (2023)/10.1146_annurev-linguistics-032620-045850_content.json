{"Abstract": "This study examines the interplay between language change and poetic form, focusing on the enduring influence of Pāṇini's grammar. Through a retrospective analysis of historical texts and an autobiographical lens, we explore how linguistic evolution has shaped poetic expression over time. The research also considers future prospects for poetry in light of ongoing language shifts. By synthesizing insights from linguistics, literary theory, and personal experience, this work offers a unique perspective on the dynamic relationship between grammatical structures and artistic creativity in verse."}
