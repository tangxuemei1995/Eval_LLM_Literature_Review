{"Abstract": "Effective communication between healthcare providers and patients is crucial for optimal treatment outcomes. This study examines the role of physician-patient interactions in shaping medical decision-making processes and treatment adherence. Using conversation analysis techniques, we investigate how social interactions during medical consultations influence patient understanding, engagement, and compliance with prescribed treatments. The research focuses on the negotiation of treatment plans, shared decision-making, and the impact of communication styles on patient satisfaction and health outcomes. Our findings reveal that patient-centered communication, characterized by active listening, clear explanations, and collaborative decision-making, leads to improved treatment adherence and better health outcomes. The study highlights the importance of developing communication skills among healthcare professionals and emphasizes the need for further research on effective communication strategies in diverse healthcare settings."}
