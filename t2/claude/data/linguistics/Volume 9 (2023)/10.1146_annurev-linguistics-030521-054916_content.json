{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex sociolinguistic landscape of North Africa, focusing on the recognition and institutionalization of Tamazight and the challenges arising from this process. The research explores the interplay between Arabic, Tamazight, and DƒÅrija in the context of multilingualism and multiculturalism, considering the historical impact of colonization on language policies. By analyzing recent efforts to revitalize Tamazight and its official recognition in some North African countries, the study highlights the ongoing tensions between linguistic diversity and national identity. The findings reveal the intricate balance required to promote indigenous languages while maintaining social cohesion and addressing the practical challenges of implementing multilingual policies in education, media, and public administration."}
