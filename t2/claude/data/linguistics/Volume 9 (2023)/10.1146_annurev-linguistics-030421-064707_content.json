{"Abstract": "This study explores the diverse landscape of constructed languages, examining their historical development, linguistic structures, and sociocultural impacts. Focusing on philosophical languages, international auxiliary languages, and artistic conlangs, the research investigates the motivations behind their creation and their potential applications in various fields. Special attention is given to Esperanto, the most widely spoken constructed language, analyzing its success factors and limitations. The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from linguistics, psycholinguistics, and sociolinguistics to evaluate the cognitive processes involved in learning and using constructed languages. Furthermore, it examines the role of constructed languages in fostering cross-cultural communication and promoting linguistic diversity. The findings contribute to our understanding of language creation, acquisition, and the complex interplay between artificial and natural languages in contemporary society."}
