{"Abstract": "This study investigates the actuation problem in sound change, focusing on the role of individual differences in cognitive processing styles. While previous research has explored various factors contributing to linguistic change, the specific mechanisms triggering actuation remain elusive. We propose that variations in cognitive processing styles among speakers may play a crucial role in initiating and propagating sound changes. Using agent-based modeling, we simulate a population of speakers with diverse cognitive profiles, incorporating factors such as attention to phonetic detail, memory capacity, and social network position. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between these individual differences and environmental factors can lead to the emergence and spread of novel linguistic variants. Specifically, we find that speakers with heightened sensitivity to phonetic variation are more likely to initiate sound changes, while those with strong social connections facilitate their propagation. This study contributes to our understanding of the actuation problem by highlighting the importance of cognitive heterogeneity in linguistic communities and provides a framework for future research on the complex interplay between individual and social factors in language change."}
