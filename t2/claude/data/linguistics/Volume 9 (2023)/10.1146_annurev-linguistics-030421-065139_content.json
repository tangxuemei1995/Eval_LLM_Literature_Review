{"Abstract": "Speech prosody plays a crucial role in human communication, conveying both linguistic and paralinguistic information. This review examines the relationship between speech prosody and mental disorders, focusing on prosody recognition, production, and pragmatic and affective aspects. We synthesize findings from recent studies investigating prosodic abnormalities in various mental disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, autism spectrum disorders, and anxiety disorders. The literature reveals consistent patterns of impaired prosody recognition and production across multiple disorders, with varying degrees of severity. Pragmatic prosody deficits are particularly pronounced in autism spectrum disorders, while affective prosody abnormalities are common in mood disorders. These prosodic disturbances can significantly impact social functioning and quality of life for individuals with mental disorders. We discuss potential underlying mechanisms, including neurocognitive deficits and altered brain connectivity. Finally, we highlight the clinical implications of these findings and suggest directions for future research, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve prosodic abilities in individuals with mental disorders."}
