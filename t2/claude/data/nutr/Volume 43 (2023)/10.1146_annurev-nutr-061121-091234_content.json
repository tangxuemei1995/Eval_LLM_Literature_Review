{"Abstract": "Child undernutrition remains a global health challenge, with complex underlying factors. This review explores the critical role of host-microbiome interactions in child undernutrition, focusing on stunting and wasting. Recent advances in microbiome research have revealed significant alterations in the gut microbial composition and function of malnourished children. These disruptions in the microbiome, characterized by reduced diversity and altered metabolic capabilities, contribute to impaired nutrient absorption, immune dysfunction, and compromised growth. We discuss the bidirectional relationship between malnutrition and the microbiome, examining how dietary deficiencies impact microbial communities and how dysbiosis exacerbates nutritional deficits. Additionally, we highlight potential interventions targeting the microbiome, including probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiota-directed complementary foods, as promising strategies to ameliorate undernutrition. Understanding these host-microbiome interactions provides new insights into the pathophysiology of child undernutrition and opens avenues for innovative therapeutic approaches to combat this pervasive global health issue."}
