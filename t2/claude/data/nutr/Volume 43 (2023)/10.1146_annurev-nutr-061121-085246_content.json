{"Abstract": "The placenta serves as a crucial interface between mother and fetus, facilitating nutrient exchange, gas transfer, and waste elimination. This review explores the complex structure and function of the placenta, focusing on the syncytiotrophoblast layer and its role in maternal-fetal communication. We discuss the transition from histiotrophic to hemotrophic nutrition during pregnancy and examine the diverse array of nutrient transporters expressed in the placenta. The phenomenon of placental mosaicism is addressed, highlighting its potential impact on fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. Recent advances in understanding placental physiology and pathology are presented, including novel insights into the placenta's role in fetal programming and long-term health. This comprehensive overview underscores the placenta's significance as a multifaceted organ essential for successful pregnancy and emphasizes the need for continued research in this field."}
