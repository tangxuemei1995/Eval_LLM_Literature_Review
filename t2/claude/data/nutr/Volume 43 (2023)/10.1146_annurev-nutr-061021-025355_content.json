{"Abstract": "The microbiota–gut–brain axis plays a crucial role in early life development, influencing cognitive, behavioral, and physiological outcomes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the impact of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of this complex system. We explore the effects of key nutritional components, including milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation significantly influences the infant's gut microbiome composition and subsequent neurodevelopment. Breastfeeding provides a unique blend of bioactive compounds that support optimal gut colonization and brain development. For formula-fed infants, supplementation with MFGM, HMOs, and LC-PUFAs aims to mimic the benefits of human milk. Emerging evidence suggests that pre-, pro-, and postbiotics may offer additional support for the developing microbiota–gut–brain axis. This review highlights the importance of early life nutrition in shaping long-term health outcomes and identifies areas for future research to optimize infant nutrition and neurodevelopment."}
