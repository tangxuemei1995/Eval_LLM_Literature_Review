{"Abstract": "This article presents an insightful conversation with James Ntambi, a renowned professor of biochemistry and nutritional sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Ntambi's autobiographical account traces his journey from Uganda to his current position as a leading researcher in nutritional biochemistry. The interview delves into his groundbreaking work on stearoyl-CoA desaturase, a key enzyme in fat metabolism, and its implications for understanding nutrient-gene interactions. Ntambi discusses his research on the regulation of gene expression by dietary factors and how this knowledge can be applied to address issues of obesity and metabolic disorders. The conversation also highlights his contributions to understanding malnutrition, particularly in developing countries, and his efforts to bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical applications in public health. Ntambi shares his experiences in teaching and mentoring students, emphasizing the importance of fostering critical thinking and scientific curiosity. The article provides a comprehensive overview of Ntambi's career, showcasing his significant contributions to the field of nutritional biochemistry and his ongoing commitment to addressing global health challenges through innovative research and education. This conversation offers valuable insights into the intersection of basic science, nutrition, and public health, demonstrating the far-reaching impact of Ntambi's work on our understanding of human metabolism and disease prevention."}
