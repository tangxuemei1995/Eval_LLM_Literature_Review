{"Abstract": "Iron homeostasis during pregnancy is a complex process involving maternal, placental, and fetal regulatory mechanisms. This review explores the intricate interplay between these systems, focusing on the role of hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism. Maternal iron requirements increase dramatically during pregnancy to support fetal growth and development. The placenta acts as a crucial interface, regulating iron transfer from mother to fetus through various transporters and receptors. Fetal iron homeostasis is tightly controlled to ensure proper organ development and prevent toxicity. Maternal iron deficiency and inflammation can significantly impact this delicate balance, potentially leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is essential for developing targeted interventions to prevent iron-related complications during pregnancy. This review synthesizes current knowledge on iron homeostasis during pregnancy, highlighting the importance of maintaining optimal iron status for both maternal and fetal health."}
