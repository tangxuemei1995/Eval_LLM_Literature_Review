{"Abstract": "Gluconeogenesis, a critical metabolic pathway for glucose production, plays a pivotal role in various metabolic diseases. This review explores the dysregulation of gluconeogenic flux in conditions such as insulin resistance, hormone imbalances, and enzyme deficiencies. We examine the intricate interplay between gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling, highlighting how alterations in this pathway contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of hormonal imbalances on gluconeogenic flux and their implications for metabolic homeostasis. The review also investigates the consequences of enzyme deficiencies in key gluconeogenic steps and their effects on glucose metabolism. Finally, we explore the emerging role of altered gluconeogenesis in cancer metabolism, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for metabolic interventions in oncology."}
