{"Abstract": "Precision nutrition has gained significant attention as a promising approach to personalize dietary recommendations for chronic disease prevention. However, this review critically examines the current state of evidence supporting precision nutrition and its potential impact on public health policies. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding this field, we argue that the hype is outpacing the scientific evidence and rigorous standards required to inform population-wide dietary guidelines. We analyze the challenges in accounting for complex biological variations, environmental factors, and individual nutrient requirements when developing personalized nutrition strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing studies and the need for large-scale, long-term clinical trials to validate the efficacy of precision nutrition interventions. While acknowledging the potential benefits of tailored dietary advice, we emphasize the importance of maintaining evidence-based, population-level recommendations to ensure equitable public health outcomes. This review calls for a balanced approach that integrates precision nutrition research with established nutritional science to inform future dietary guidelines and policies."}
