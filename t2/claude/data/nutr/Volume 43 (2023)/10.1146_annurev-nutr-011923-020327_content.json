{"Abstract": "Despite widespread use of dietary supplements, significant gaps persist in our understanding of their impact on health and disease. This review critically examines the current state of dietary supplement research, focusing on methodological challenges in assessment and measurement. We highlight the limitations of existing dietary assessment tools, including issues of validity and reproducibility when applied to supplement use. The complex nature of supplement composition and consumption patterns introduces unique measurement errors that are often overlooked in nutritional studies. We discuss the need for standardized methodologies to accurately capture supplement intake and its effects on nutritional status. Additionally, we explore the challenges in separating the effects of supplements from those of dietary patterns and lifestyle factors. The review emphasizes the importance of developing more robust and tailored approaches for assessing supplement use in diverse populations. By addressing these methodological gaps, researchers can enhance the quality and reliability of dietary supplement studies, ultimately improving our understanding of their role in health and disease prevention."}
