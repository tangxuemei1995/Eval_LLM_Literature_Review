{"Abstract": "Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of small, highly conserved cytoplasmic proteins that play crucial roles in lipid metabolism and transport. This review explores the diverse functions of mammalian FABPs, highlighting their importance in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and their involvement in various physiological processes. We discuss the tissue-specific expression patterns of different FABP isoforms and their unique roles in fatty acid uptake, intracellular trafficking, and signaling. Furthermore, we examine the emerging evidence linking dysregulation of FABPs to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes, as well as their potential involvement in cancer progression. Understanding the multifaceted nature of FABPs provides valuable insights into lipid metabolism and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases and cancer."}
