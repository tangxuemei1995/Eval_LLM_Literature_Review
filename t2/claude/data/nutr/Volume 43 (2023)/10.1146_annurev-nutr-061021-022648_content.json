{"Abstract": "Serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes and has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its implications in health and disease. This review explores the sources and sinks of serine in human metabolism, focusing on its interconversion with glycine and its involvement in one-carbon metabolism. We examine the metabolic flux of serine in different tissues and discuss its importance in neurotransmitter synthesis, protein production, and cellular proliferation. Furthermore, we investigate the emerging evidence linking serine metabolism to neurological disorders, diabetes, and cancer. By integrating data from metabolomics studies and clinical research, we provide insights into the potential therapeutic applications of serine supplementation and the modulation of serine biosynthesis pathways in treating various pathological conditions."}
