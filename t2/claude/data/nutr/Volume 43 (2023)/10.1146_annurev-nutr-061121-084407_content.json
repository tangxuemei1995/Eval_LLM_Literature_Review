{"Abstract": "Riboflavin deficiency, a prevalent nutritional concern, has far-reaching implications for human health. This review explores the etiology and clinical consequences of riboflavin deficiency, focusing on its assessment through the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac). We examine the current dietary reference intakes for riboflavin and their adequacy in preventing deficiency. The study investigates the association between riboflavin status and various health outcomes, particularly hypertension and anemia. Our findings suggest that riboflavin deficiency may contribute to the development of hypertension through impaired nitric oxide synthesis and antioxidant capacity. Additionally, we discuss the role of riboflavin in erythropoiesis and its potential impact on anemia. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of maintaining adequate riboflavin status and proposes areas for future research to elucidate the full spectrum of riboflavin's physiological roles and clinical significance."}
