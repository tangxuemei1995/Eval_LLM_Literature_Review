{"Abstract": "This study explores the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in unraveling complex diet-disease relationships through a series of case studies. As precision nutrition gains prominence, AI techniques, particularly neural networks, offer unprecedented capabilities in analyzing vast datasets to identify intricate connections between dietary patterns and health outcomes. The research examines how machine learning algorithms can integrate diverse data sources, including genomics, metabolomics, and microbiome profiles, to generate personalized nutritional recommendations. Case studies demonstrate AI's potential in predicting disease risk based on dietary habits, optimizing nutrient intake for specific health conditions, and uncovering novel food-health interactions. The findings highlight AI's capacity to revolutionize nutritional science by enabling more accurate, individualized dietary interventions. This work underscores the transformative impact of AI in advancing personalized nutrition strategies and paves the way for more effective disease prevention and management through tailored dietary approaches."}
