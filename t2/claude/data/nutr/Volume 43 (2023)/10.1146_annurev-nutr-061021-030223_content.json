{"Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing global health concern, characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. This review explores the potential therapeutic role of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in NAFLD management. We examine the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids modulate lipid metabolism, reduce inflammation, and attenuate fibrosis in the liver. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated promising results in using omega-3 supplementation to improve liver function and reduce steatosis in NAFLD patients. However, optimal dosage, duration, and long-term efficacy remain subjects of ongoing research. Additionally, we discuss the synergistic effects of omega-3 fatty acids with lifestyle modifications and other therapeutic approaches. This review highlights the need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to establish evidence-based guidelines for the use of omega-3 fatty acids in NAFLD treatment and prevention."}
