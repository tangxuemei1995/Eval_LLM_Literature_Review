{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between diet and the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal health and disease. This review explores the complex interactions between dietary components, gut microbiota, and host physiology, with a focus on their impact on gastrointestinal disorders. We examine the mechanisms by which diet influences microbial composition and function, including fermentation processes and metabolite production. The gutâ€“brain axis is discussed as a key mediator of these interactions, highlighting the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Furthermore, we investigate the role of diet-induced dysbiosis in promoting inflammation and metabolic disturbances. The potential of microbiome-targeted therapies, such as prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, is evaluated as strategies to modulate the gut microbiome and alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms. By integrating recent advances in metabolomics and microbiome research, this review provides insights into novel therapeutic approaches for managing gastrointestinal disorders through dietary interventions and microbiome manipulation."}
