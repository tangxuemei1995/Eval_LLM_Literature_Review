{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate relationship between intestinal amino acid transport and metabolic health, focusing on the impact of protein restriction and digestion on epithelial cell function. We examine the various membrane transport mechanisms involved in amino acid absorption and their regulation in response to dietary changes. The role of specific amino acid transporters in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and modulating nutrient sensing is discussed. Additionally, we investigate how alterations in amino acid availability affect metabolic processes throughout the body, including glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure. The review also highlights recent findings on the interplay between the gut microbiome and amino acid metabolism, and its implications for overall health. Understanding these complex interactions may provide new insights into the development of targeted nutritional interventions for metabolic disorders and the optimization of protein intake for improved health outcomes."}
