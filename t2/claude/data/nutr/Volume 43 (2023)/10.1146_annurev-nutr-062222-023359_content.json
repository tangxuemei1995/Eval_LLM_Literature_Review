{"Abstract": "Nutrition security, encompassing both food access and nutritional quality, is crucial for promoting healthy dietary intake and positive health outcomes in the United States. This review examines current methods for assessing and monitoring nutrition security, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We analyze various indicators, including household food security surveys, dietary intake assessments, and biomarkers of nutritional status. The paper also explores the relationship between nutrition security and health outcomes, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach that considers both quantity and quality of food consumed. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in implementing effective monitoring systems and propose innovative strategies to improve nutrition security assessment. Our findings underscore the need for integrated, multidimensional approaches to better understand and address nutrition security issues. By enhancing assessment and monitoring techniques, policymakers and health professionals can develop more targeted interventions to improve dietary intake and overall health outcomes across diverse populations in the United States."}
