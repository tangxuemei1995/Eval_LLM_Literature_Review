{"Abstract": "Inflammation is a complex biological response to harmful stimuli, and its resolution is crucial for tissue homeostasis. Lipoxins, a class of bioactive lipid mediators, play a pivotal role in the active resolution of inflammation. This study explores the therapeutic potential of lipoxin mimetics, specifically AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT, in modulating inflammatory responses and preventing fibrosis. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and experimental data, we investigate the mechanisms by which these mimetics enhance the resolution of inflammation, reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and promote tissue repair. Our findings suggest that AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT significantly attenuate inflammatory pathways and inhibit fibrotic processes, offering promising avenues for the development of novel anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapies. This research underscores the importance of lipoxin mimetics in the resolution of inflammation and their potential clinical applications in treating chronic inflammatory diseases."}
