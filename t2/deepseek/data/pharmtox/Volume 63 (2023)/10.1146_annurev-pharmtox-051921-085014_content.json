{"Abstract": "Leukotrienes are potent lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid, playing pivotal roles in inflammation and the pathogenesis of various endemic diseases. The biosynthesis of leukotrienes is catalyzed by a series of enzymes, including 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase, whose structures have been elucidated through advanced crystallographic techniques. Understanding the three-dimensional architectures of these enzymes provides critical insights into their catalytic mechanisms and regulatory features. This knowledge has paved the way for structure-based drug design, aiming to develop novel therapeutics that can selectively inhibit leukotriene biosynthesis. Such inhibitors hold promise for treating inflammatory diseases and conditions exacerbated by leukotrienes, offering a targeted approach to mitigate inflammation and its associated pathologies. This review highlights recent advancements in the structural biology of leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes and the development of new therapeutic agents targeting this pathway."}
