{"Abstract": "Obesity-related metabolic complications, including type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases, pose significant health challenges worldwide. Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) have emerged as promising therapeutic targets due to their critical roles in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. This review explores the potential of FGF-based pharmacotherapies, focusing on FGF19, FGF21, and FGF1 analogs, as well as agonistic antibodies targeting FGF receptors, in ameliorating obesity-induced metabolic dysfunctions. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these protein therapeutics in improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic steatosis, and promoting weight loss. However, challenges such as optimizing pharmacokinetics, minimizing off-target effects, and ensuring long-term safety remain. Advances in protein engineering and delivery systems are expected to enhance the therapeutic potential of FGF-based interventions. This paper highlights the current state of research, discusses the mechanisms of action, and outlines future directions for developing effective FGF-based treatments for obesity-related metabolic complications."}
