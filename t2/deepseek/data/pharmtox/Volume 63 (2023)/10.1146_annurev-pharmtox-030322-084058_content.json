{"Abstract": "The Organic Anion Transporters (OATs), Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides (OATPs), and Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs) play pivotal roles in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a wide array of endogenous and exogenous substances. This study delves into the intricate mechanisms of OAT1 (SLC22A6), OAT3 (SLC22A8), OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1), OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3), MRP2 (ABCC2), and MRP4 (ABCC4), alongside the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP/ABCG2), within the framework of the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory. This theory posits that these transporters are integral to a complex network that not only facilitates the systemic distribution and elimination of drugs and toxins but also participates in inter-organ communication and homeostasis maintenance. By synthesizing current literature, this research highlights the significance of these transporters in drug disposition, their impact on therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, and their potential as targets for drug development. Furthermore, it explores the implications of genetic polymorphisms in these transporters on individual variability in drug response, underscoring the importance of personalized medicine in optimizing therapeutic outcomes."}
