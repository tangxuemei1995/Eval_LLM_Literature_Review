{"Abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, traditionally recognized for their efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for a variety of clinical disorders beyond their conventional use. This review explores the expanding therapeutic landscape of cGMP-specific PDE5 inhibitors, focusing on their potential in addressing endothelial dysfunction, offering cardioprotection, managing metabolic disorders, mitigating aging-related conditions, and their emerging role in cancer therapy. By enhancing the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway, these inhibitors not only improve vascular health but also exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative effects, which are beneficial in a wide range of pathological conditions. The evidence suggests that PDE5 inhibitors could play a pivotal role in the treatment of complex diseases, highlighting the need for further research to fully elucidate their mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential across different clinical settings."}
