{"Abstract": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases (MKPs) play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell signaling pathways by dephosphorylating and inactivating Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs). Despite their critical function in cellular processes and disease states, MKPs have historically been considered 'undruggable' due to the challenges associated with targeting protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases. However, recent advancements in understanding the structural biology of MKPs, including the identification of allosteric sites, have opened new avenues for the development of small molecule inhibitors. This review explores the potential of targeting MKPs as a therapeutic strategy, highlighting the progress in the design and discovery of inhibitors that modulate MKP activity. By focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying MKP function and the innovative approaches to overcome the hurdles of druggability, this article underscores the emerging opportunities for MKP-targeted therapies in the treatment of diseases characterized by dysregulated MAPK signaling."}
