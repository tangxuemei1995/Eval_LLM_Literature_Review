{"Abstract": "Recent pharmacological advancements have reignited interest in the role of aspirin in cancer chemoprevention, particularly through its modulation of the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. Aspirin's ability to irreversibly inhibit COX enzymes, thereby reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin, has been pivotal in understanding its chemopreventive mechanisms. This review synthesizes current evidence on aspirin's efficacy in reducing the risk of various cancers, focusing on its impact on the COX-2 mediated inflammatory pathway, which is implicated in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we explore the balance between aspirin's antithrombotic effects and its potential to mitigate cancer risk, highlighting the importance of dosage and duration in optimizing therapeutic outcomes. Emerging research on aspirin's role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and enhancing immune surveillance offers promising avenues for future investigation. Despite its widespread use, the precise mechanisms underlying aspirin's chemopreventive properties remain an area of active research, underscoring the need for further studies to elucidate its full potential in cancer prevention strategies."}
