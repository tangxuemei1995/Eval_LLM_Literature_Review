{"Abstract": "Granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, play pivotal roles in the immune response but can also contribute to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The pharmacological induction of granulocyte cell death, particularly through apoptosis, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate these adverse effects. This approach aims to selectively target and eliminate overactive or dysregulated granulocytes without compromising the overall immune function. Recent advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying granulocyte apoptosis have facilitated the development of targeted pharmacological agents. These agents can modulate key apoptotic pathways, such as the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, to induce cell death in a controlled manner. This review highlights the potential of pharmacological induction of granulocyte apoptosis as a therapeutic intervention, discusses the challenges associated with this strategy, and explores future directions for research in this field. The ultimate goal is to develop safe and effective treatments for diseases characterized by granulocyte-mediated tissue damage."}
