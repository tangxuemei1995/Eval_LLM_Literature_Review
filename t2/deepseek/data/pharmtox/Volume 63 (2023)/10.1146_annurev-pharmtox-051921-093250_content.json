{"Abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia, significantly impacting patients' functional outcomes and quality of life. This review explores the pathophysiology underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, focusing on the roles of glutamate neurotransmission and NMDA receptor dysfunction. Evidence suggests that abnormalities in the glutamatergic system, particularly at NMDA receptors, contribute to the cognitive symptoms observed in schizophrenia. Additionally, the review examines the potential of mismatch negativity (MMN), an event-related potential, as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. The interplay between dopamine and glutamate systems is also discussed, highlighting how dysregulation in these neurotransmitter systems may lead to cognitive impairments. Finally, current and emerging treatment strategies targeting these pathophysiological mechanisms are reviewed, including pharmacological interventions aimed at modulating glutamatergic and dopaminergic activity. The findings underscore the importance of a multifaceted approach to understanding and treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, with the goal of improving patient outcomes."}
