{"Abstract": "The integration of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and genomics has emerged as a transformative approach in drug discovery, offering unprecedented opportunities to identify novel drug targets and understand disease mechanisms. This study explores the synergistic potential of combining EHRs with genomic data, leveraging techniques such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), and Mendelian Randomization (MR). By analyzing large-scale EHR datasets alongside genomic information, we can uncover genetic variants associated with diseases and drug responses, facilitating the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the application of MR allows for the inference of causal relationships between genetic variants and clinical outcomes, enhancing the validity of drug target identification. This research underscores the importance of integrating EHRs and genomics in the drug discovery pipeline, highlighting its potential to accelerate the development of personalized medicine and improve patient outcomes. The findings advocate for continued investment in bioinformatics infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaboration to fully harness the power of EHRs and genomics in advancing drug discovery."}
