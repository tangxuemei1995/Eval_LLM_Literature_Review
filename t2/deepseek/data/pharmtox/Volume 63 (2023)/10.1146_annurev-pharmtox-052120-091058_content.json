{"Abstract": "Biased agonism at opioid receptors represents a pivotal concept in pharmacology, offering insights into the differential signaling pathways activated by distinct ligands. This phenomenon, where ligands preferentially activate either G protein or β-arrestin pathways, has profound implications for the development of safer and more effective opioid analgesics. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand bias, highlighting the role of receptor conformation and intracellular signaling cascades. By focusing on the differential engagement of G protein versus β-arrestin pathways, researchers aim to harness biased agonism to mitigate adverse effects associated with traditional opioids, such as respiratory depression and addiction. This review synthesizes current knowledge on biased agonism at opioid receptors, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of biased ligands in pain management. The findings underscore the importance of understanding ligand-receptor interactions at a molecular level to design next-generation opioids with improved safety profiles."}
