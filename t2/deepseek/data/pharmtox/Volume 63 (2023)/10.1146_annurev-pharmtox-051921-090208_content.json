{"Abstract": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC omega-3 PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their role in cardiovascular health. Found abundantly in fish oil, these fatty acids are known to exert beneficial effects on heart disease risk factors, including reducing triglycerides, blood pressure, and inflammation. However, the evidence regarding their impact on cardiovascular outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke remains mixed. While some studies suggest a significant reduction in cardiovascular events with LC omega-3 PUFA supplementation, others report minimal or no benefit. This discrepancy may be attributed to variations in study design, population characteristics, and dosage. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects of high-dose omega-3 supplementation, including increased bleeding risk and interactions with medications. This review aims to critically evaluate the pros and cons of LC omega-3 PUFAs in cardiovascular health, providing a balanced perspective on their therapeutic potential and limitations."}
