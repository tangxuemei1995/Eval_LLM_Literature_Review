{"Abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) into the drug discovery pipeline, particularly in the lead-to-candidate decision-making process, represents a transformative shift in pharmaceutical research. This study explores the application of AI and ML techniques to enhance decision quality, streamline the identification of viable drug candidates, and predict potential toxicological outcomes. By leveraging computational toxicology and advanced data analytics, we demonstrate how these technologies can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. Our findings highlight the potential of AI and ML to not only improve the efficiency of lead optimization but also to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of drug action and toxicity. This research underscores the importance of adopting AI and ML tools in the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate the development of safer and more effective therapeutics."}
