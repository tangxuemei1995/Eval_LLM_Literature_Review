{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neurotoxic effects of air pollution, focusing on ultrafine particles (UFPs) and PM2.5, across different stages of life. Exposure to these pollutants has been linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders in children and neurodegenerative diseases in adults. The research explores the mechanisms by which air pollution induces brain metal dyshomeostasis, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuronal damage. By reviewing epidemiological and toxicological studies, this paper highlights the critical need for public health interventions to mitigate air pollution exposure and protect vulnerable populations. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the life-span impacts of air pollution on brain health to inform preventive strategies and therapeutic approaches."}
