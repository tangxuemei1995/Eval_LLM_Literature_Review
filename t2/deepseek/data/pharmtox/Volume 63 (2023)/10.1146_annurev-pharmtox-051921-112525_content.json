{"Abstract": "Age-related perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), including postoperative delirium and long-term cognitive dysfunction, represent significant challenges in perioperative brain health. This review explores experimental models that mimic the complex pathophysiology of PNDs, focusing on neuroinflammation as a central mechanism. We discuss the utility of these models in identifying druggable targets that could mitigate cognitive decline. Furthermore, we evaluate current cognitive assessment tools and their role in early detection and monitoring of PNDs. The integration of these tools into care pathways is crucial for improving outcomes in elderly surgical patients. By synthesizing findings from preclinical and clinical studies, this review aims to highlight promising therapeutic strategies and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to perioperative brain health."}
