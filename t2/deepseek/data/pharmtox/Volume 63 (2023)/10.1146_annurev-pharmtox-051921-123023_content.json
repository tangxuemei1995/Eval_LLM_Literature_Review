{"Abstract": "The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, composed of Kir6.x subunits (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) and sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1 and SUR2), play a pivotal role in coupling cellular metabolism to electrical activity. Mutations in these subunits are implicated in a spectrum of KATP-dependent pathologies, including congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant√∫ syndrome. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders and highlights the potential of personalized therapeutics tailored to the specific genetic and functional alterations in KATP channels. Advances in understanding the structure-function relationship of KATP channels have paved the way for the development of targeted therapies, offering hope for improved management of these conditions. By focusing on the unique molecular signatures of each pathology, personalized medicine approaches promise to enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects, marking a significant step forward in the treatment of KATP-dependent diseases."}
