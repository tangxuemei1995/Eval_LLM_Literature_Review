{"Abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a debilitating condition affecting millions worldwide, arises from damage or dysfunction within the somatosensory nervous system. This review delves into the complex mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain, highlighting the pivotal roles of neurons and immune cells in its pathogenesis. A growing body of evidence suggests significant sex differences in the prevalence, severity, and response to treatment of neuropathic pain, with females often reporting higher pain levels and different therapeutic outcomes compared to males. However, sex similarities in certain aspects of pain processing and modulation are also noted, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of sex-specific and sex-common mechanisms. The review further explores emerging therapies targeting these mechanisms, including novel pharmacological agents and non-pharmacological interventions, with an emphasis on their potential to address the global burden of neuropathic pain. By integrating insights from recent research, this article aims to inform the development of more effective, personalized treatment strategies for neuropathic pain, taking into account the critical influence of sex."}
