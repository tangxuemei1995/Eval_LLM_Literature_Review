{"Abstract": "This review explores the pharmacological interventions utilized during labor and delivery, focusing on their mechanisms of action and clinical implications. The myometrium, a key player in uterine contractions, is the primary target for these interventions. Drugs such as oxytocin and prostaglandins are commonly used to induce or augment labor, addressing conditions like dystocia. Conversely, tocolytics are employed to inhibit preterm contractions, thereby delaying preterm delivery. The management of postpartum hemorrhage, a leading cause of maternal mortality, involves the use of uterotonics like ergometrine and misoprostol to enhance uterine contraction and reduce blood loss. This paper also discusses the challenges and side effects associated with these pharmacological agents, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment strategies to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes. The synthesis of current evidence underscores the critical role of pharmacological interventions in managing various complications of labor and delivery, highlighting areas for future research and clinical practice improvement."}
