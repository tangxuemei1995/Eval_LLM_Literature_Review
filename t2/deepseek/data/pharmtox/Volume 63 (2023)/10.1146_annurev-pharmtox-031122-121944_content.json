{"Abstract": "The G proteinâ€“coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has emerged as a pivotal mediator of estrogen signaling, distinct from the classical nuclear estrogen receptors. This review delves into the molecular pharmacology of GPER, elucidating its role in various physiological and pathological processes. GPER's involvement in cancer progression, cardiovascular health, endocrine regulation, immune responses, and metabolic control underscores its therapeutic potential. In cancer, GPER influences cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis, presenting a novel target for intervention. Its cardioprotective effects, mediated through vasodilation and anti-inflammatory actions, highlight its significance in cardiovascular diseases. GPER also modulates endocrine functions, impacting hormone-sensitive conditions. Furthermore, its role in immunity and metabolism opens avenues for addressing autoimmune disorders and metabolic syndromes. This comprehensive analysis underscores the therapeutic applications of GPER modulation, advocating for further research to harness its full potential in treating diverse diseases."}
