{"Abstract": "Inflammation is a complex biological response to harmful stimuli, and its resolution is crucial for tissue homeostasis and the prevention of chronic diseases. Recent advances in resolution pharmacology have highlighted the therapeutic potential of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and annexin A1 peptides in promoting the resolution of inflammation. SPMs, including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, play pivotal roles in orchestrating the termination of inflammatory responses and facilitating tissue repair. Similarly, annexin A1, a glucocorticoid-regulated protein, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects through its interaction with formyl peptide receptors. This review focuses on the emerging roles of SPMs and annexin A1 peptides in resolution pharmacology, emphasizing their mechanisms of action and therapeutic innovation in inflammatory diseases. By harnessing the pro-resolving properties of these mediators, novel therapeutic strategies can be developed to enhance the resolution of inflammation, offering new avenues for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions."}
