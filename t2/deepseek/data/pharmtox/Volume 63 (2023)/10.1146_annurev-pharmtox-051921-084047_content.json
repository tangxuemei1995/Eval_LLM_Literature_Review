{"Abstract": "Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, play a pivotal role in the resolution of inflammation and pain. This review explores the emerging field of resolution pharmacology, focusing on the therapeutic potential of SPMs, including resolvins and neuroprotectin, in modulating neuroimmune interactions to control pain and itch. SPMs exert their effects by targeting nociceptive sensory neurons and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, key players in the transduction of pain and itch signals. By promoting the resolution of inflammation without compromising the host's defense mechanisms, SPMs offer a novel approach to managing chronic pain and itch conditions. This paper highlights the mechanisms through which SPMs modulate neuroimmune pathways, their interaction with TRP channels, and their potential as therapeutic agents in resolution pharmacology, providing insights into future directions for research and clinical applications."}
