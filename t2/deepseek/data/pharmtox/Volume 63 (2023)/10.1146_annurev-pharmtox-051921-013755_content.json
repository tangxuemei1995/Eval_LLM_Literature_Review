{"Abstract": "Lysosomal ion channels, including TPCs, TRPMLs, and TMEM175, play pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as autophagy, lysosomal pH regulation, and calcium signaling. These channels are integral to the maintenance of cellular health, and their dysfunction has been implicated in a range of diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. This review explores the physiological roles of lysosomal ion channels, their involvement in disease pathogenesis, and their potential as therapeutic targets. We discuss the current understanding of how these channels contribute to neurodegeneration and evaluate the challenges and opportunities in targeting them pharmacologically. The druggability of lysosomal ion channels is a promising area of research, with the potential to unlock novel treatments for diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction. However, the development of specific and effective modulators requires a deeper understanding of the complex biology of these channels and their interactions within the cellular environment."}
