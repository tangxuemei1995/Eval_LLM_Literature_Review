{"Abstract": "The field of pharmacogenetics has significantly advanced the understanding of individual variability in response to antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on the role of pharmacogenomics in guiding antiplatelet therapy, with a special emphasis on the CYP2C19 gene, which encodes a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of clopidogrel, a widely used antiplatelet agent. Variants in the CYP2C19 gene have been associated with altered drug metabolism, leading to variability in therapeutic efficacy and risk of adverse events. The integration of pharmacogenetic testing into clinical practice offers a promising approach to precision medicine, enabling the selection of optimal antiplatelet therapy tailored to an individual's genetic makeup. This review highlights the current evidence, challenges, and future directions in the pharmacogenetics of antiplatelet therapy, underscoring its potential to improve patient outcomes through personalized treatment strategies."}
