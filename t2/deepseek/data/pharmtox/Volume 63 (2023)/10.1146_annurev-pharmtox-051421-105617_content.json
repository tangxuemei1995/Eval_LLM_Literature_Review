{"Abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a pivotal model organism in the realms of systems pharmacology and toxicology, offering a scalable, in vivo platform for the high-throughput screening of drugs and environmental toxins. This review underscores the zebrafish's unique advantages, including its genetic tractability, optical transparency during early development, and physiological similarities to humans, which facilitate the elucidation of complex biological pathways and the assessment of therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. By integrating advanced genetic, imaging, and computational tools, zebrafish models have significantly contributed to our understanding of disease mechanisms, drug discovery, and safety evaluation. The adoption of zebrafish as an alternative model system not only accelerates the pace of biomedical research but also aligns with the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) in animal research, thereby enhancing ethical standards. This paper highlights recent advancements and future directions in leveraging zebrafish for in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology studies."}
