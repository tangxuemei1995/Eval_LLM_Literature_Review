{"Abstract": "Arsenic, a ubiquitous element in the environment, exhibits a complex metabolism in humans, characterized by its dual role as both a toxin and a potential detoxification agent. This review explores the speciation of arsenic, highlighting the critical role of methylation in its metabolism. Methylation processes convert inorganic arsenic into various organic forms, significantly influencing its toxicity and detoxification pathways. The impact of arsenic metabolism on human health is profound, with chronic exposure linked to a range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurological impairments. Understanding the mechanisms of arsenic speciation and methylation is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate its toxic effects. This study underscores the importance of further research into arsenic metabolism to enhance public health outcomes and inform regulatory policies."}
