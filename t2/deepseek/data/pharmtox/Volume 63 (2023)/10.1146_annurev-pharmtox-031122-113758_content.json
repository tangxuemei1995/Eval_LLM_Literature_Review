{"Abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids, often marketed as 'Spice' or 'K2', represent a significant class of new psychoactive substances that have emerged as popular alternatives to cannabis. These designer drugs, designed to mimic the effects of natural cannabinoids, interact with the endocannabinoid system, leading to a wide range of pharmacological and toxicological effects. Despite their structural similarity to THC, the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids exhibit higher potency and efficacy at cannabinoid receptors, contributing to their unpredictable and often severe adverse effects. This overview aims to explore the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the effects of synthetic cannabinoids, their role in substance use disorders, and the challenges they pose to public health and regulatory bodies. By synthesizing current research, this paper highlights the urgent need for comprehensive studies to better understand the risks associated with synthetic cannabinoid use and to develop effective strategies for prevention and treatment."}
