{"Abstract": "The global fight against HIV/AIDS has seen significant progress with the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet achieving universal treatment remains a formidable challenge. This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap towards universal antiretroviral treatment, focusing on the 90-90-90 targets set by UNAIDS: 90% of people living with HIV knowing their status, 90% of diagnosed individuals receiving sustained ART, and 90% of those on ART achieving viral suppression. We delve into the critical role of antiretrovirals in immune reconstitution and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment initiation. Strategies to overcome barriers such as stigma, healthcare access, and medication adherence are discussed, alongside the need for innovative financing mechanisms and strengthened health systems. The paper concludes with a call for global solidarity and sustained political commitment to ensure that the benefits of ART reach all individuals affected by HIV, moving us closer to ending the AIDS epidemic."}
