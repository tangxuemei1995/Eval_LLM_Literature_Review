{"Abstract": "The concept of the chemical exposome encompasses the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards, playing a crucial role in human health and disease. This review focuses on understanding the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood, a critical window of susceptibility. We explore the pathways through which xenobiotics and natural contaminants can impact prenatal development, with a particular emphasis on the role of the placenta in modulating exposure. Human biomonitoring studies are highlighted as essential tools for assessing the presence and concentration of these chemicals in biological samples, providing insights into exposure levels and potential health risks. The review underscores the importance of integrating chemical exposome data with epidemiological studies to better understand the complex interactions between environmental exposures and developmental outcomes. By synthesizing current knowledge, this paper aims to inform future research directions and public health strategies aimed at reducing harmful exposures during these vulnerable life stages."}
