{"Abstract": "The integration of rapid randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into health care systems presents a transformative approach to enhancing quality improvement and safety. This study explores the efficacy of rapid RCTs as a methodological innovation for swiftly identifying and implementing evidence-based interventions within complex health care environments. By leveraging the principles of randomization and control, rapid RCTs offer a robust framework for evaluating the impact of quality improvement initiatives in real-time, thereby facilitating immediate adjustments and optimizations. The research underscores the potential of rapid RCTs to bridge the gap between clinical research and practice, ensuring that health care systems can adapt to emerging challenges with agility and precision. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper highlights the critical role of rapid RCTs in fostering a culture of continuous improvement, ultimately contributing to the advancement of patient care and safety outcomes in health care systems worldwide."}
