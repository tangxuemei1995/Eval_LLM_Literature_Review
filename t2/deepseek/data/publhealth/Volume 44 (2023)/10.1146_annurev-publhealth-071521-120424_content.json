{"Abstract": "This literature review explores the intricate relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes across the globe, highlighting the statistical challenges inherent in synthesizing evidence from diverse studies. Air pollution, a well-documented environmental health risk, has been hypothesized to exacerbate the severity and mortality of COVID-19 infections. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing research, this paper identifies key methodological issues, including variability in exposure assessment, confounding factors, and the heterogeneity of health outcomes. Furthermore, it underscores the pivotal role of data science and advanced visualization techniques in elucidating these complex associations. By integrating findings from epidemiological studies, this review aims to provide a clearer understanding of the air pollution-COVID-19 nexus, offering insights into public health interventions and policy-making. The synthesis of evidence presented herein serves as a foundation for future research, emphasizing the need for standardized methodologies and innovative data visualization tools to navigate the challenges of evidence synthesis in this domain."}
