{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationships between climatic and environmental changes, migration patterns, and health outcomes. As global temperatures rise and environmental conditions deteriorate, populations are increasingly compelled to migrate, either temporarily or permanently, leading to significant health implications. The research delves into the mechanisms through which climate-induced migration—encompassing displacement, relocation, and mobility—affects physical and mental health. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset from various regions affected by climate change, the study identifies key factors that exacerbate health risks among migrant populations, including access to healthcare, exposure to new pathogens, and the psychological stress of displacement. Furthermore, it examines the role of policy interventions in mitigating these health risks and facilitating adaptive migration strategies. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated approaches that address the health impacts of climate-induced migration, advocating for policies that enhance resilience and support sustainable mobility in the face of environmental change."}
