{"Abstract": "The United States public health workforce is at a critical juncture, facing ongoing challenges in recruitment, retention, and development that threaten its capacity to protect and improve the nation's health. This paper examines the current state of the public health workforce, highlighting the persistent issues of underfunding, inadequate training opportunities, and the lack of a comprehensive enumeration system to accurately assess workforce needs and capabilities. Despite these challenges, there are promising directions for the future, including innovative workforce development programs, enhanced training initiatives, and the adoption of new technologies to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The paper argues for a concerted effort among public health leaders, policymakers, and educators to address these challenges through strategic investments in workforce development, the creation of more robust training and retention programs, and the establishment of a standardized enumeration system. Such efforts are essential to ensure that the public health workforce is equipped to meet the evolving health needs of the U.S. population."}
