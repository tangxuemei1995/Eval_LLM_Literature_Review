{"Abstract": "Early childhood education (ECE) plays a pivotal role in shaping the developmental trajectories of children, influencing not only their educational outcomes but also their long-term health and economic prospects. This study explores the multifaceted impacts of ECE, emphasizing its significance in promoting health equity and economic efficiency. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset from various longitudinal studies, we investigate how access to quality ECE can mitigate health disparities and foster equitable opportunities for children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Furthermore, the research delves into the economic implications of investing in ECE, highlighting the cost-benefit analysis of early interventions and their potential to yield substantial returns in terms of reduced healthcare costs and enhanced productivity in adulthood. The findings underscore the necessity of integrating health, equity, and economic considerations into ECE policies to maximize societal benefits and ensure sustainable development."}
