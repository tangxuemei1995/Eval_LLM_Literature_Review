{"Abstract": "This study explores the dichotomy between necessity and choice in physical activity within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), focusing on active transport as a primary form of movement. In LMICs, where economic constraints and infrastructural limitations often dictate daily routines, physical activity is frequently a necessity rather than a choice. This research aims to understand how this distinction impacts health equity and social justice, particularly in the context of global health initiatives promoting physical activity. By analyzing existing literature and case studies, the study highlights the unique challenges faced by populations in LMICs, including limited access to recreational facilities and the reliance on non-motorized transport for daily commuting. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at increasing physical activity in these regions must consider the socio-economic and environmental contexts, advocating for policies that support active transport infrastructure and equitable access to physical activity opportunities. This approach not only addresses public health goals but also contributes to broader social justice objectives by recognizing and mitigating the disparities in physical activity engagement across different socio-economic groups."}
