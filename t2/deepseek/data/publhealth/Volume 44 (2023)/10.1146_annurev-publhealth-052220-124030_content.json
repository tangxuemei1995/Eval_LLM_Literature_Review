{"Abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with a significant proportion of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors. This study aims to delineate the spectrum of cancers linked to avoidable exposures and to quantify the attributable fractions (AFs) for these risk factors, thereby providing a comprehensive road map for cancer prevention. By systematically reviewing and synthesizing data from epidemiological studies, we identify key modifiable factors including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, poor diet, physical inactivity, and exposure to carcinogens. Our findings underscore the potential for substantial reductions in cancer incidence through targeted public health interventions aimed at these risk factors. The estimated AFs highlight the critical areas for cancer control strategies, emphasizing the importance of primary prevention. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the prioritization of modifiable risk factors in cancer prevention efforts, offering actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals to mitigate the global cancer burden."}
