{"Abstract": "The dynamic nature of healthcare environments necessitates the on-the-go adaptation of implementation approaches and strategies to effectively address emerging challenges and opportunities. This paper explores the evolving landscape of health implementation science, focusing on the critical role of adaptation in enhancing the relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability of health interventions. Drawing on a comprehensive review of recent literature, we identify key perspectives that underscore the importance of flexibility, context sensitivity, and stakeholder engagement in the adaptation process. Furthermore, we highlight emerging research opportunities aimed at advancing our understanding of how and when to adapt implementation strategies to optimize health outcomes. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying gaps, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting adaptive implementation practices in health. Our findings underscore the need for continued research to develop robust frameworks and tools that facilitate the systematic adaptation of implementation strategies, thereby improving the delivery and impact of health interventions across diverse settings."}
