{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between health misinformation exposure and health disparities, with a particular focus on the role of structural racism and its impact on health behaviors and misperceptions. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of observational data, we identify key pathways through which misinformation exacerbates health disparities among marginalized communities. Our findings suggest that structural racism not only facilitates the spread of health misinformation but also deepens the mistrust in healthcare systems, leading to adverse health behaviors and outcomes. We highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions that address the root causes of misinformation and its disproportionate effects on vulnerable populations. By proposing a multi-faceted approach that includes community engagement, education, and policy reform, this research aims to contribute to the reduction of health disparities and the promotion of equitable health outcomes."}
