{"Abstract": "The advent of emerging infectious diseases, exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has underscored the critical need for innovative approaches in public health surveillance. This study explores the integration of advanced technologies, including spatial modeling and artificial intelligence (AI), into the national notifiable disease reporting system to enhance the detection, monitoring, and response to infectious diseases. Spatial modeling facilitates the visualization and analysis of disease spread patterns, enabling public health officials to identify hotspots and allocate resources more effectively. Meanwhile, AI algorithms offer the potential to predict outbreaks by analyzing vast datasets, including social media, electronic health records, and environmental factors, thereby providing early warning signals. The incorporation of these technologies into public health surveillance systems promises to revolutionize the way we track and manage infectious diseases, offering a more proactive and predictive approach to public health. This paper reviews current innovations, discusses their implications for public health policy, and outlines future directions for research and implementation, aiming to bolster the global response to emerging infections and safeguard public health in an increasingly interconnected world."}
