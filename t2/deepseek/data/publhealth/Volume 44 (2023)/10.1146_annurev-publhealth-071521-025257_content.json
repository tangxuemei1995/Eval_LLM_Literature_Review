{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted impacts of paid family and medical leave (PFML) on worker health, family well-being, and employer outcomes. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, we explore how PFML policies influence parental leave utilization, caregiving responsibilities, and overall health outcomes for employees. Additionally, the research investigates the effects of PFML on family dynamics, including child development and spousal support. From an employer perspective, the analysis considers the implications of PFML on workforce productivity, retention rates, and the broader economic landscape. Our findings suggest that PFML significantly benefits worker health and family well-being, with mixed outcomes for employers. The study contributes to the ongoing debate on the necessity and design of PFML policies, offering insights for policymakers, employers, and advocates aiming to balance the needs of workers, families, and businesses."}
