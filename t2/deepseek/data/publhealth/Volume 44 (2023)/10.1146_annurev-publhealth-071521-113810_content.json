{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of gentrification, displacement, urban regeneration, and health equity, proposing a theoretical and methodological guide to mitigate the adverse health effects associated with urban transformation. Gentrification, while often heralded for revitalizing neighborhoods, can lead to displacement of long-term residents, exacerbating health disparities and undermining health equity. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this research identifies key mechanisms by which gentrification impacts health, including increased stress, loss of social networks, and reduced access to healthcare and healthy food options. The study advocates for a multi-faceted approach to urban regeneration that prioritizes health equity, suggesting strategies such as inclusive zoning policies, community land trusts, and health impact assessments. By integrating health equity considerations into urban planning and policy-making, this guide aims to foster environments that support the well-being of all residents, particularly those most vulnerable to the negative effects of gentrification."}
