{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate relationship between housing quality and disparities in health and well-being, emphasizing the role of healthy housing in promoting equitable health outcomes. By analyzing a comprehensive body of scientific literature, we identify key factors within the indoor environment—such as air quality, thermal comfort, and safety—that significantly influence occupants' physical and mental health. The study highlights the importance of adhering to established housing guidelines to mitigate health risks and enhance well-being. Furthermore, it underscores the cobenefits of improving housing quality, including reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and enhanced social cohesion. Our findings advocate for integrated approaches in housing policy and practice that prioritize health equity, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of socioeconomic status, have access to safe and healthy living environments. This review contributes to the ongoing discourse on public health by providing evidence-based recommendations for fostering healthier communities through improved housing standards."}
