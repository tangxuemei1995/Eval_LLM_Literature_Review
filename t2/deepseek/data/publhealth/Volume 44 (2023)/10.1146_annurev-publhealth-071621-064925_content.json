{"Abstract": "Environmental justice (EJ) has emerged as a critical framework for understanding and addressing the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities, particularly those of color. This paper explores the historical trajectory of the EJ movement, highlighting its roots in combating environmental racism and its evolution into a broader advocacy for equitable environmental policies and practices. By examining the intersection of structural racism and environmental health disparities, we underscore the persistent challenges in achieving environmental equity. Furthermore, this study delves into the role of health advocacy and activism in advancing EJ, emphasizing the importance of community-led initiatives and policy reforms. Looking ahead, we discuss potential directions for the EJ movement, including the integration of EJ principles into climate change mitigation strategies and the amplification of voices from the most affected communities. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on environmental justice by providing a comprehensive overview of its past achievements and future prospects."}
