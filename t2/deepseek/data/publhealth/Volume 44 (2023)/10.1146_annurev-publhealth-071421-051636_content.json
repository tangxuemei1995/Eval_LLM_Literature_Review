{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the public health implications of drought within the context of climate change, focusing on the interplay between drought trends, human health, vulnerability, and drought risk management. As climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of droughts, understanding their impact on public health becomes increasingly crucial. This paper synthesizes current research to explore how droughts affect water quality and availability, food security, and the prevalence of diseases, thereby increasing human vulnerability. It also evaluates the effectiveness of existing drought risk management strategies in mitigating these health impacts. The review highlights the need for integrated approaches that combine climate adaptation and public health strategies to enhance resilience against drought-related health risks. By identifying gaps in current knowledge and practice, this study aims to inform future research and policy development to better protect vulnerable populations from the health consequences of drought in a changing climate."}
