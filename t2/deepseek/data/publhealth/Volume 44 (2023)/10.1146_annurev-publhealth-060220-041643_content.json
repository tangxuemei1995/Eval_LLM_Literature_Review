{"Abstract": "The integration of mobile technology into public health promotion represents a transformative approach to enhancing physical activity and facilitating health behavior change. This paper explores the multidisciplinary perspective of leveraging digital health tools, including wearable sensors and culturally relevant personalized medicine, to address the global challenge of sedentary lifestyles and their associated health risks. By synthesizing current research, we highlight the potential of mobile technology to deliver tailored interventions that are both accessible and engaging for diverse populations. The discussion underscores the importance of designing digital health solutions that are sensitive to cultural contexts and individual preferences, thereby maximizing adherence and effectiveness. Furthermore, we examine the role of wearable sensors in providing real-time feedback and fostering a deeper understanding of personal health metrics. This abstract calls for a collaborative effort among technologists, healthcare professionals, and public health experts to harness the power of mobile technology in creating sustainable health promotion strategies."}
