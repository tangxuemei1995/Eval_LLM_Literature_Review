{"Abstract": "Extreme heat events (EHEs) are becoming increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change, posing significant public health challenges. This study explores the critical components of public health preparedness for EHEs, emphasizing the development and implementation of comprehensive heat action plans (HAPs). By analyzing existing literature and case studies, we identify key strategies for disaster risk reduction, including early warning systems, community outreach, and healthcare system readiness. The findings highlight the importance of integrating climate change projections into HAPs to enhance their effectiveness and adaptability. Additionally, the study underscores the need for multi-sectoral collaboration and public engagement to build resilience against the adverse health impacts of EHEs. The insights provided aim to inform policymakers and public health practitioners in designing and implementing robust preparedness measures to safeguard vulnerable populations from the escalating threat of extreme heat."}
