{"Abstract": "The accurate assessment of food and nutrient intake is pivotal in nutritional epidemiology and population sciences research, yet it remains fraught with challenges due to measurement errors inherent in dietary assessment methods. This study explores innovative approaches to enhance the capacity for assessing food and nutrient intake, focusing on the integration of nutritional biomarkers and advanced statistical techniques such as regression calibration. By leveraging these methodologies, we aim to mitigate the impact of measurement errors, thereby improving the reliability and validity of dietary data. Our findings underscore the potential of combining traditional dietary assessment tools with biomarker data and statistical corrections to refine intake estimates. This integrated approach not only advances the methodological framework of nutritional epidemiology but also contributes to more precise public health recommendations and interventions. The implications of this research extend to the broader field of population sciences, offering a pathway to more accurate and actionable insights into diet-disease relationships."}
