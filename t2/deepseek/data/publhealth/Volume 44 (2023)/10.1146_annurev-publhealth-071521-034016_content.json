{"Abstract": "The intersection of public health and the criminal justice system, particularly within the context of mass incarceration, presents a critical area of concern for policymakers, healthcare providers, and society at large. This research delves into the priorities for public health within prisons, emphasizing the unique challenges posed by the correctional environment. Mass incarceration has exacerbated health disparities, with incarcerated populations suffering from higher rates of infectious diseases, mental health disorders, and chronic conditions compared to the general population. The study explores the concept of correctional health as a public health priority, advocating for comprehensive healthcare services that address the physical, mental, and social health needs of inmates. Furthermore, it examines the potential of decarceration strategies to mitigate the public health crisis within prisons, suggesting that reducing prison populations could lead to significant improvements in inmate health outcomes and broader public health benefits. The research underscores the necessity of integrating public health principles into correctional policies to ensure the well-being of incarcerated individuals and to foster a healthier society."}
