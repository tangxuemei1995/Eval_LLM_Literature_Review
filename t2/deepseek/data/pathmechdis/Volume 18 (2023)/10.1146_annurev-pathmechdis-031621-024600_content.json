{"Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. This review explores the intricate interplay between pancreatic cancer cells and the TME, focusing on the roles of tumor immunology, stroma, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The TME in pancreatic cancer is characterized by a dense desmoplastic stroma and an immunosuppressive milieu, which not only promotes tumor progression but also hinders the efficacy of conventional and novel therapies. Understanding the dynamic interactions within the TME offers potential therapeutic targets, aiming to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer."}
