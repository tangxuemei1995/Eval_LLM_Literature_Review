{"Abstract": "Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, is characterized by variable airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and underlying inflammation. Despite advances in understanding its pathophysiology, the role of mucus and airway obstruction remains a critical area of investigation. This review focuses on the pathological mechanisms contributing to airway obstruction in asthma, with particular emphasis on the role of mucus hypersecretion and the involvement of galectin-10 and neutrophils. Galectin-10, a protein associated with Charcot-Leyden crystals, has been implicated in the inflammatory processes of asthma, while neutrophils contribute to the persistence of inflammation and tissue damage. The interplay between these elements and their impact on airway obstruction is explored, highlighting the challenges in targeting these pathways for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the complex pathology of asthma, including the roles of mucus, galectin-10, and neutrophils, is essential for developing more effective treatments and improving patient outcomes."}
