{"Abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization represents a significant immunological response following exposure to non-self RBC antigens, primarily through blood transfusions or pregnancy. This process can lead to the production of alloantibodies, which may cause hemolysis, complicating subsequent transfusions and posing serious risks to patient health. Particularly in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), the prevalence of alloimmunization is notably higher due to the frequent need for transfusions and the genetic diversity in RBC antigens between donors and recipients. This review explores the mechanisms underlying RBC alloimmunization, including the role of antigenic differences, immune system activation, and genetic predispositions. Furthermore, it examines the clinical consequences of alloimmunization, such as delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and challenges in finding compatible blood for future transfusions. Strategies for prevention and management, including the use of extended antigen matching and immunosuppressive therapies, are also discussed. Understanding the development and implications of RBC alloimmunization is crucial for improving outcomes in transfusion medicine, especially for patients with SCD."}
