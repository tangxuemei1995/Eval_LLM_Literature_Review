{"Abstract": "Parkinson's syndrome encompasses a spectrum of disorders characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, with Parkinson's disease (PD) being the most prevalent form. The pathogenesis of PD is complex, involving genetic, environmental, and aging factors. Recent advances in functional genomics have highlighted the oligogenic nature of PD, implicating genes such as GBA, LRRK2, and alpha-synuclein in its etiology. These genes play critical roles in key cellular processes, including synaptic function, lysosomal activity, and mitochondrial dynamics, suggesting that disruptions in these pathways contribute to the neurodegenerative process. The heterogeneity of PD is evident in its clinical presentation and genetic underpinnings, complicating the development of targeted therapies. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the genetic architecture of PD and parkinsonism, emphasizing the interplay between genetic variants and cellular dysfunction. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PD is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and advancing personalized medicine approaches to mitigate the impact of this debilitating syndrome."}
