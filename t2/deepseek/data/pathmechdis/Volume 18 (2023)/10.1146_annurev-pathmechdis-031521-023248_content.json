{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between the nervous system and cancer cells has emerged as a pivotal area of research, shedding light on the complex mechanisms underlying tumor progression and metastasis. This study delves into the multifaceted roles of neuroepithelial interactions in cancer, focusing on processes such as axonogenesis and neurogenesis, which contribute to the tumor microenvironment's complexity. We explore the phenomenon of perineural invasion, where cancer cells migrate along nerves, a pathway that significantly influences disease spread and prognosis. Additionally, the investigation highlights the role of neuronal signaling in promoting cancer cell proliferation, survival, and transdifferentiation, a process by which cancer cells acquire neuronal characteristics, further complicating the tumor landscape. By synthesizing current findings, this research underscores the importance of understanding neuroepithelial interactions in cancer, offering novel insights into potential therapeutic targets that could disrupt these critical pathways, thereby impeding tumor progression and improving patient outcomes."}
