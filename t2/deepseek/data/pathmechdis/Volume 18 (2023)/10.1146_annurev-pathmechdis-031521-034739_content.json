{"Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, has emerged as a significant public health concern due to its association with severe neurological disorders. This review delves into the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection, focusing on its cellular tropism and the mechanisms by which it evades host immune responses. ZIKV exhibits a broad tropism, infecting various cell types including neural progenitor cells, leading to neurodevelopmental defects. A key aspect of ZIKV pathogenesis is its interaction with the host ubiquitin system, particularly the role of TRIM7, a ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in the antiviral response. ZIKV has developed strategies to antagonize immune responses, including the inhibition of type I interferon signaling, which is crucial for the host's antiviral defense. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV pathogenesis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies and vaccines to combat this emerging viral threat."}
