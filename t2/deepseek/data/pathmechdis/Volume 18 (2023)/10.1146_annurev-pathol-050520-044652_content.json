{"Abstract": "Lymphomas, a diverse group of malignancies originating from lymphocytes, present significant challenges in monitoring and treatment response assessment. The advent of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis through next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the molecular monitoring of lymphomas, offering a non-invasive, sensitive, and specific method for detecting measurable residual disease (MRD). This approach enables real-time insights into tumor dynamics, facilitating early detection of relapse and assessment of therapeutic efficacy. By leveraging ctDNA, clinicians can tailor treatment strategies more precisely, potentially improving patient outcomes. This review highlights the transformative impact of ctDNA-based MRD monitoring in lymphoma management, underscoring its role in advancing personalized medicine and enhancing our understanding of lymphoma biology."}
