{"Abstract": "Tuft cells, a conserved chemosensory lineage, play pivotal roles in mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis through context- and tissue-specific programming. These cells are characterized by their unique expression of type II taste transduction components, enabling them to detect and respond to environmental cues. In the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, tuft cells contribute to mucociliary clearance and host defense by secreting acetylcholine and cysteinyl leukotrienes, which modulate immune responses and epithelial function. Notably, tuft cells are integral to type 2 immunity, orchestrating responses to parasitic infections and allergens through the release of interleukin-25 (IL-25). This cytokine activates innate lymphoid cells, driving protective and pathological immune reactions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying tuft cell function across different tissues offers insights into their dual roles in health and disease, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets in inflammatory and infectious conditions."}
