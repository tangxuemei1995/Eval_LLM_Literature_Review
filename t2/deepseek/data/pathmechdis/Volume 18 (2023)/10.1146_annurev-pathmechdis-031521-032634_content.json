{"Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, characterized by a specific immune response against self-antigens. This review delves into the immunobiology and pathogenesis of CD, highlighting the critical roles of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules in presenting gluten peptides to T cells, initiating an autoimmune cascade. The involvement of B cells in producing autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2, a key enzyme in the disease process, is also explored. Understanding the intricate interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and immune dysregulation offers insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for managing this prevalent autoimmune condition."}
