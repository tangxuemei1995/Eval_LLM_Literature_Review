{"Abstract": "Osteoclasts, the primary cells responsible for bone resorption, play a pivotal role in the dynamic process of bone remodeling. These multinucleated giant cells are derived from hematopoietic progenitors through a process known as osteoclastogenesis, which is tightly regulated by various cytokines and signaling pathways. Osteoclasts adhere to the bone surface and create a sealed microenvironment where they secrete acids and proteolytic enzymes, leading to the dissolution of the mineralized matrix and degradation of organic components, a process termed osteolysis. This activity is essential for maintaining bone health, facilitating the repair of microdamages, and allowing for the adaptation of bone structure to mechanical stresses. However, dysregulation of osteoclast function can lead to pathological conditions such as osteoporosis and bone metastasis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying osteoclast differentiation and activity offers potential therapeutic targets for treating bone-related diseases."}
