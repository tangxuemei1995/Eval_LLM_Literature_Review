{"Abstract": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, have emerged as pivotal mediators in the tumor microenvironment (TME), facilitating intercellular communication and modulating various aspects of tumor progression. These EVs carry a diverse array of cargoes, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which can influence the behavior of recipient cells, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating cells. By transferring oncogenic molecules, tumor-derived EVs promote cell migration, tumor invasion, and the establishment of a pre-metastatic niche, thereby contributing to cancer metastasis. Furthermore, the unique molecular signatures of tumor-derived EVs offer promising opportunities for the development of liquid biopsies, enabling non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. This review highlights the multifunctional roles of tumor-derived EVs in the TME, emphasizing their contributions to tumor progression and their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. Understanding the complex interplay between tumor-derived EVs and the TME is crucial for advancing cancer research and improving patient outcomes."}
