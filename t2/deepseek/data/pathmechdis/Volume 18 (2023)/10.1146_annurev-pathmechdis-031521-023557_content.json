{"Abstract": "This study explores the orchestration of collective migration and metastasis by tumor cell clusters, a phenomenon increasingly recognized for its role in cancer progression. Focusing on the mechanisms of collective metastasis, we delve into the polyclonal seeding process, where clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) disseminate and colonize distant organs. The research highlights the significance of collective migration, emphasizing how cell-cell interactions and collective signaling pathways facilitate the survival and metastatic potential of these clusters. By integrating recent findings from in vitro and in vivo models, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular dynamics underlying the collective behavior of tumor cells. This work underscores the potential of targeting collective migration and signaling pathways as novel therapeutic strategies to combat metastasis."}
