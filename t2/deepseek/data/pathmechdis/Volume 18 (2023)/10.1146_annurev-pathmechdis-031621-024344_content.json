{"Abstract": "Viral lung injuries, particularly those caused by influenza, pose significant challenges to pulmonary homeostasis, necessitating a complex interplay between alveolar epithelial cells and the innate immune system for effective repair and regeneration. This study delves into the mechanisms underlying the restoration of lung function post-viral injury, focusing on the dynamic interactions between the alveolar epithelium and immune components. We explore the processes of epithelial cell repair and regeneration, highlighting the pivotal role of immune-epithelial crosstalk in reestablishing homeostasis. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we identify key signaling pathways and cellular behaviors that facilitate recovery, including the activation of stem cell niches and the modulation of inflammatory responses. Our findings underscore the importance of a balanced immune response in promoting epithelial repair while preventing excessive tissue damage. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of lung recovery mechanisms, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for enhancing regeneration and repair following viral lung injury."}
