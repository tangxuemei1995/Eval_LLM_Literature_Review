{"Abstract": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) represents a spectrum of liver injuries caused by chronic alcohol consumption, ranging from simple steatosis to more severe forms such as alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Recent advances have significantly enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of ALD, highlighting the critical roles of programmed cell death (PCD), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the complement system, and the gut-liver axis. PCD mechanisms, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, have been implicated in the progression of liver damage, offering potential therapeutic targets. PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors, recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns, initiating inflammatory responses that contribute to liver injury. The complement system, a key component of innate immunity, has been shown to exacerbate liver inflammation and fibrosis in ALD. Furthermore, the gut-liver axis, emphasizing the interplay between gut microbiota, intestinal barrier integrity, and liver health, has emerged as a pivotal factor in ALD pathogenesis. These insights pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the burden of ALD."}
