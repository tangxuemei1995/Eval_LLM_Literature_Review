{"Abstract": "Adipose tissue remodeling plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of various conditions, including burns, cachexia, and infectious diseases. This process involves significant changes in adipose tissue composition and function, such as browning and fibrosis, which can influence systemic metabolism and immune responses. Browning of white adipose tissue, characterized by the emergence of beige adipocytes, enhances energy expenditure and has been implicated in the metabolic adaptation to burns and cachexia. Conversely, adipose tissue fibrosis, marked by excessive extracellular matrix deposition, contributes to metabolic dysfunction and may exacerbate the progression of cachexia and the severity of infectious diseases. Understanding the mechanisms underlying adipose tissue remodeling offers potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the adverse effects of these conditions. This review highlights the dual role of adipose tissue browning and fibrosis in disease pathophysiology, emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate their complex interplay and therapeutic implications."}
