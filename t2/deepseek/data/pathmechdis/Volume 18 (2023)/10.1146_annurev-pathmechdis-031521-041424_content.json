{"Abstract": "Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has seen a significant epidemiological shift, with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cases now constituting a majority in many developed countries. This review focuses on HPV-related OPSCC, particularly its nonkeratinizing variant, which is characterized by distinct molecular and clinical features compared to its HPV-negative counterpart. The role of HPV, especially type 16, in the pathogenesis of OPSCC is explored, highlighting the virus's ability to integrate into the host genome and express oncoproteins E6 and E7, leading to tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the review delves into the mechanisms of immune escape employed by HPV-related OPSCC, including the downregulation of antigen presentation and the creation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic strategies. The review also discusses the implications of HPV status on prognosis and treatment outcomes, emphasizing the need for HPV testing in the diagnostic workup of OPSCC to guide personalized treatment approaches."}
