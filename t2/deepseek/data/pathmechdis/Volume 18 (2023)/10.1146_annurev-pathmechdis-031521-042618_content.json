{"Abstract": "Mastocytosis, a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation of mast cells in various tissues, has seen significant advancements in understanding its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of the KIT D816V mutation in the etiology of mastocytosis, offering insights into genetic risk factors and mechanisms underlying mast cell proliferation and activation. The measurement of serum tryptase levels has emerged as a crucial tool in the diagnosis and prognostication of the disease, aiding in the identification of patients at risk for severe anaphylaxis. Furthermore, the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting the KIT receptor has opened new avenues for the treatment of mastocytosis, promising improved outcomes for patients. This review synthesizes emerging concepts in the field, emphasizing the importance of genetic and molecular diagnostics in tailoring therapeutic strategies and enhancing patient care."}
