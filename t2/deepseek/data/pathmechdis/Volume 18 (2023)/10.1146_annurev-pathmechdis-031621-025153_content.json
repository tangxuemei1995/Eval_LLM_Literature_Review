{"Abstract": "African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a life-threatening disease caused by the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The pathogenesis of this disease is complex, involving intricate interactions between the parasite and the host immune system. A key feature of African trypanosomes is their ability to undergo antigenic variation, primarily through the expression of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs), which allows them to evade the host's immune response. This mechanism of immune evasion is central to the parasite's survival and the chronic nature of the disease. Additionally, the role of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) in human innate immunity against trypanosomes has been highlighted, with certain APOL1 variants conferring resistance to T. b. rhodesiense infection. However, these same variants are associated with an increased risk of kidney disease in individuals of African descent, illustrating a complex interplay between pathogen resistance and disease susceptibility. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of African trypanosomiasis is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies and vaccines."}
