{"Abstract": "The liver exhibits a remarkable spatiotemporal organization, with metabolic functions distributed across its lobular architecture in a process known as liver zonation. This intricate spatial arrangement is crucial for the organ's diverse roles in metabolism, detoxification, and homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the influence of circadian rhythms on liver zonation, suggesting a temporal layer to this spatial organization that affects hepatic function and disease. The WNT signaling pathway has emerged as a key regulator of zonation, orchestrating the expression of metabolic enzymes in a gradient-dependent manner. Disruptions in this zonation pattern are implicated in various liver pathologies, including monogenic liver diseases and broader liver pathophysiology. Understanding the mechanisms underlying liver zonation and its circadian regulation offers new insights into liver pathology and opens avenues for therapeutic interventions. Chronopharmacology, the study of how the timing of drug administration affects efficacy and toxicity, is particularly relevant in this context, as it leverages the temporal aspects of liver function to optimize treatment strategies. This review explores the current understanding of spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation, its regulatory mechanisms, and its implications for liver health and disease."}
