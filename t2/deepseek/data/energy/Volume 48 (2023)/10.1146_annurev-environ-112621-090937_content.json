{"Abstract": "Fungi, encompassing Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and early diverging fungi, represent a vast and largely unexplored kingdom of life, playing critical roles in ecosystems worldwide. This study aims to push the frontiers of biodiversity research by unveiling the global diversity, distribution, and conservation status of fungi. Utilizing advanced metabarcoding techniques, we assess the fungus:plant ratio across diverse habitats, shedding light on the intricate relationships between fungi and their plant counterparts. Our findings highlight the endemic nature of many fungal species, emphasizing the urgent need for their conservation. By integrating data from the IUCN Red List, we identify species at risk and propose targeted in situ and ex situ conservation strategies. This research not only advances our understanding of fungal biodiversity but also underscores the importance of fungi in maintaining ecological balance and the necessity of their preservation for future generations."}
