{"Abstract": "The effectiveness of conservation efforts in protected areas (PAs) and Indigenous and locally managed areas (ILMAs) is significantly influenced by governance structures and processes. This study explores the relationship between governance types and conservation outcomes, focusing on the roles of state, private, community, and co-managed governance models. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key governance factors that contribute to successful conservation, including legitimacy, equity, accountability, and participation. Our findings suggest that ILMAs often exhibit higher levels of community engagement and traditional ecological knowledge, which can lead to more sustainable and culturally appropriate conservation practices. However, challenges such as limited resources, conflicting interests, and external pressures can undermine governance effectiveness in both PAs and ILMAs. The study highlights the importance of adaptive governance approaches that can respond to changing social, economic, and environmental conditions. We conclude that integrating diverse governance models and fostering collaboration among stakeholders are essential for enhancing conservation effectiveness. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, conservation practitioners, and local communities aiming to improve the governance and management of protected and locally managed areas."}
