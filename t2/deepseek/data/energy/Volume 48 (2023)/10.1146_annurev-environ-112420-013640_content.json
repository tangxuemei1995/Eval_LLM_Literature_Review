{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationships between industrial activities and Earth's ecological systems, employing Earth system science as a foundational framework. By integrating biodiversity conservation, land-use change, conservation planning, and social-ecological systems, we aim to map the multifaceted impacts of industrialization on global ecosystems during the Anthropocene. Our research synthesizes data from diverse scientific literature to identify key industrial influences that threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services. We propose a novel approach to conservation planning that incorporates the dynamic interplay between human activities and ecological processes, offering strategies to mitigate negative impacts and promote sustainable coexistence. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the Anthropocene by highlighting the critical need for integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to address the challenges posed by industrial influences on Earth's ecology."}
