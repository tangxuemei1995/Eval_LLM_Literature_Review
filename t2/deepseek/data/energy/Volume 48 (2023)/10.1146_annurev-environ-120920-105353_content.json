{"Abstract": "The transition towards a sustainable economy has catalyzed the emergence of sustainability careers, encompassing a broad spectrum of green jobs that contribute to environmental preservation, social equity, and economic viability. This study explores the evolving landscape of sustainability jobs, identifying key competencies required for professionals in this field. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of current training programs and curricula, we highlight the critical skills and knowledge areas that facilitate successful transitions into sustainability careers. Our findings suggest that interdisciplinary education, practical experience, and continuous learning are paramount for equipping individuals with the competencies needed to address complex sustainability challenges. Furthermore, we propose recommendations for enhancing educational programs to better prepare the workforce for the demands of green jobs. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainability education and workforce development, offering insights for educators, policymakers, and professionals aiming to foster a sustainable future."}
