{"Abstract": "This study explores the impact of opinion and perceived polarization on environmental decision-making, particularly in the context of climate change. As societies become increasingly divided, understanding how polarization influences intergroup relations and collective action towards environmental sustainability becomes crucial. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of recent case studies, this research identifies key factors that exacerbate or mitigate the effects of polarization on environmental policies and practices. It highlights the role of communication strategies, social identity, and trust in shaping perceptions and behaviors related to climate change. The findings suggest that reducing perceived polarization and fostering constructive intergroup dialogue can enhance collaborative environmental decision-making. This paper contributes to the broader discourse on climate action by offering insights into overcoming polarization barriers, thereby facilitating more effective and inclusive environmental governance in polarized times."}
