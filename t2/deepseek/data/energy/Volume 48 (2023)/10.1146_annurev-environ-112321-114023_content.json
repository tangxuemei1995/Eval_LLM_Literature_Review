{"Abstract": "The 30×30 initiative, aiming to conserve 30% of the planet's land and ocean areas by 2030, emerges as a pivotal strategy in the global response to climate change and biodiversity loss. This paper delves into the historical evolution and prospective future of climate change-integrated conservation strategies, with a particular focus on the 30×30 framework. By synthesizing findings from climate change biology, systematic conservation planning, and regional coordination efforts, we explore how the 30×30 initiative can address the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity decline. The movement of species in response to changing climates, a phenomenon increasingly observed across ecosystems, underscores the necessity for adaptive conservation strategies that transcend static protected areas. We argue that the success of the 30×30 initiative hinges on its ability to incorporate dynamic, climate-smart conservation planning that accounts for species on the move, ensuring the resilience of ecosystems and the services they provide. Furthermore, this paper highlights the importance of regional coordination in achieving the 30×30 targets, emphasizing the need for collaborative governance structures that can navigate the complexities of cross-border conservation efforts. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key challenges and opportunities in scaling up conservation efforts to meet the 30×30 goals, including the integration of traditional ecological knowledge, the mobilization of financial resources, and the development of innovative conservation technologies. Ultimately, this paper calls for a concerted global effort to realize the 30×30 vision, advocating for a paradigm shift in conservation planning that fully embraces the realities of a changing climate and the imperative of biodiversity conservation for future generations."}
