{"Abstract": "This paper explores the evolving landscape of qualitative methods in environmental research, emphasizing their critical role in understanding complex socioecological systems and addressing climate change challenges. By integrating participatory research approaches, this study highlights how qualitative methods facilitate deeper insights into human-environment interactions, community resilience, and adaptive strategies. The discussion underscores the importance of these methods in capturing the nuanced, context-specific dynamics that quantitative approaches may overlook. Through a review of recent advancements, the paper illustrates the application of qualitative techniques in diverse environmental contexts, from local community studies to global climate policy analysis. It argues for the complementary use of qualitative and quantitative methods to enrich environmental research, offering a more holistic understanding of ecological issues. The findings advocate for the continued innovation and integration of qualitative methodologies in environmental studies, ensuring that research remains responsive to the complexities of socioecological systems and the multifaceted nature of climate change."}
