{"Abstract": "The transition towards a sustainable energy future necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the global potential of renewable electricity sources. This study meticulously evaluates the technical, economic, and feasible potential of key renewable energy technologies, including solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. By synthesizing data from a vast array of scientific literature and leveraging advanced modeling techniques, we quantify the maximum achievable energy generation under ideal conditions (technical potential), the subset of this potential that is economically viable at current market prices (economic potential), and the portion that can be realistically implemented considering social, environmental, and regulatory constraints (feasible potential). Our findings reveal that solar PV and wind energy dominate the global renewable electricity potential, with significant contributions also from hydropower and CSP. Geothermal and ocean energy, while offering substantial potential in specific regions, are limited by geographical and technological constraints. The analysis underscores the critical role of policy frameworks, technological innovation, and investment in unlocking the full potential of renewables. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of integrating these energy sources into the global grid to achieve a sustainable, low-carbon energy system. This study provides a foundational framework for policymakers, investors, and researchers to prioritize and strategize the deployment of renewable energy technologies, paving the way for a cleaner, more resilient energy future."}
