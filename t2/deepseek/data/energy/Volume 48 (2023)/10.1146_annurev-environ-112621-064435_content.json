{"Abstract": "This study examines the United States' legal and regulatory framework governing the management of nuclear waste from both current and future reactors, including advanced reactor designs and their associated fuel cycles. It focuses on the challenges and opportunities presented by the evolving nuclear energy landscape, particularly in terms of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) management, retrievability requirements, and the implications of the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste. The analysis highlights the need for a robust, flexible regulatory framework that can accommodate the unique characteristics of advanced reactors and their fuel cycles, ensuring safe, secure, and efficient nuclear waste management. The study also explores potential legal and policy reforms to address existing gaps and enhance the sustainability of nuclear energy as a low-carbon power source."}
