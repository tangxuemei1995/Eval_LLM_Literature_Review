{"Abstract": "Brine, a highly concentrated saline solution, plays a pivotal role in the global economy and environmental sustainability due to its rich mineral content, including potash and lithium. This study delves into the genesis of brine, exploring its formation processes in salt lakes and other saline environments worldwide. We examine the geological and climatic factors that contribute to brine formation, highlighting the significance of these natural resources in the context of increasing demand for minerals essential to modern technologies. Furthermore, this research focuses on innovative processing techniques aimed at the efficient and sustainable recovery of valuable minerals from brine. We assess the environmental impacts of traditional extraction methods and propose advanced strategies for minimizing ecological footprints while maximizing resource recovery. The paper also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive utilization of brine, advocating for the development of integrated approaches that not only extract valuable minerals but also address water scarcity and environmental conservation. Through a global perspective, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable resource management, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by brine as a critical resource in the 21st century."}
