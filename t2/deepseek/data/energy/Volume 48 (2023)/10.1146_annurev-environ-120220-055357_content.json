{"Abstract": "The Anthropocene epoch is characterized by significant human impacts on Earth's ecosystems, with wildfires playing a pivotal role in shaping biodiversity, climate change, and the sustainability of social-ecological systems. This study delves into the complexities of fire regimes, examining their influence on the Earth System and their implications for a sustainable future. By integrating interdisciplinary research from ecology, climatology, and social sciences, we explore the dynamic interactions between fire, biodiversity, and human activities. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding fire regimes to mitigate adverse effects on biodiversity and to adapt to climate change. We propose a framework for sustainable fire management that balances ecological integrity with human needs, aiming to foster resilience in social-ecological systems. This research underscores the critical need for a nuanced understanding of fire regimes to navigate the challenges of the Anthropocene, ensuring the preservation of biodiversity and the promotion of sustainability in the face of global environmental change."}
