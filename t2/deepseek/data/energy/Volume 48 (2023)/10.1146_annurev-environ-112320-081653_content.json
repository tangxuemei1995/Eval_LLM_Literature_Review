{"Abstract": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) represent a significant ecological and public health challenge, exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication. These blooms are characterized by the proliferation of cyanobacteria, capable of producing cyanotoxins that pose risks to aquatic ecosystems, human health, and water quality. This study explores the biological traits and mechanisms underlying HCBs, including their adaptive strategies to environmental stressors. We assess the risks associated with cyanotoxins, focusing on their impact on freshwater resources and the potential for bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. Furthermore, we review current and emerging control strategies aimed at mitigating HCBs, emphasizing the importance of integrated management approaches that address both the symptoms and root causes of blooms. Our findings highlight the need for adaptive management strategies that consider the complex interplay between climate change, nutrient loading, and cyanobacterial dynamics to safeguard freshwater ecosystems and public health."}
