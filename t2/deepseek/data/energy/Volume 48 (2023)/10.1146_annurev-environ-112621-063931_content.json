{"Abstract": "Urban areas are pivotal in the global transition toward decarbonization, offering unique opportunities to integrate health, climate resilience, and equity co-benefits. This research explores the nexus linkages between decarbonization strategies and their potential to simultaneously advance sustainable development goals (SDGs) in urban contexts. By employing a comprehensive urban metabolism framework, the study assesses how low-carbon urban transitions can enhance public health, promote social equity, and bolster climate resilience. The analysis highlights the interconnectedness of these objectives, demonstrating that integrated approaches can yield synergistic benefits, thereby accelerating progress toward the SDGs. Through a review of case studies and policy analyses, the paper identifies key strategies for embedding co-benefits into urban planning and governance processes. The findings underscore the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and the adoption of holistic, systems-based approaches to urban development. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable urban transitions, offering insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to achieve zero-carbon cities that are healthy, resilient, and equitable."}
