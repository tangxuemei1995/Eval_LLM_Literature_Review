{"Abstract": "The integration of green technologies into urban and rural infrastructures presents a pivotal opportunity to address environmental justice concerns. This study explores the implications of such technologies, including electrification, modal shifts in transportation, and the development of sustainable buildings, on the principles of just transition and distributional justice. By analyzing case studies and reviewing existing literature, we assess how these innovations can either mitigate or exacerbate social inequalities. Our findings suggest that while green technologies hold the potential to reduce environmental degradation and promote equitable resource distribution, their implementation must be carefully managed to ensure that benefits are accessible to all communities, particularly those historically marginalized. The paper concludes with policy recommendations aimed at fostering an inclusive approach to environmental sustainability, ensuring that the transition towards green technologies contributes positively to the broader goals of environmental justice."}
