{"Abstract": "The Anthropocene epoch presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities for humanity, necessitating a profound reimagining of our collective futures. This paper delves into the exploration of alternative futures within the Anthropocene, emphasizing the critical role of imagination, scenarios, and cognitive processes in envisioning transformative pathways. By synthesizing insights from futures studies, cognitive science, and transformation research, we propose a multidisciplinary framework for anticipating and shaping future visions. Our analysis highlights the importance of fostering anticipatory capacities and cognitive flexibility to navigate the complexities of socio-ecological systems. Through the examination of diverse scenarios, we underscore the potential for radical transformations that align with sustainable and equitable futures. This study contributes to the growing discourse on futures thinking by offering a nuanced understanding of how imagination and cognition can be harnessed to envision and enact alternative futures in the Anthropocene."}
