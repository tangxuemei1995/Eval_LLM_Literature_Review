{"Abstract": "The pervasive use of plastics has led to significant environmental challenges, with microplastics emerging as a particularly insidious pollutant. This study examines the lifecycle of plastic polymers, from production to disposal, and their impact on ecosystems. We focus on the mechanisms by which plastics degrade into microplastics, their distribution in aquatic and terrestrial environments, and the chemical pollutants they carry. Our analysis reveals that microplastics act as vectors for a range of harmful chemicals, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which can bioaccumulate in the food chain, posing risks to wildlife and human health. Furthermore, we explore the role of industrial practices and consumer behavior in exacerbating plastic contamination. The findings underscore the urgent need for innovative solutions to mitigate plastic pollution, including the development of biodegradable polymers, enhanced recycling technologies, and stricter regulatory frameworks. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence on the environmental impact of plastics and calls for a concerted global effort to address this pressing issue."}
