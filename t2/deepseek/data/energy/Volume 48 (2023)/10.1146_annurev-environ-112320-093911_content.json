{"Abstract": "This paper surveys the evidence on sustainable intensification strategies for smallholder agricultural systems, with a focus on the Global South. It examines the adoption and impact of innovative practices such as improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) on staple crops. These strategies aim to enhance food production while minimizing environmental degradation, thereby addressing the dual challenges of food security and sustainability. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, this study highlights the potential of these approaches to increase yields, improve resilience to climate change, and reduce the ecological footprint of agriculture. The findings suggest that while there is significant promise in these strategies, their success depends on context-specific adaptations and the integration of local knowledge. This survey underscores the importance of continued research and policy support to scale up sustainable intensification practices, ensuring they contribute effectively to the sustainable development goals in smallholder agricultural systems."}
