{"Abstract": "Over the past three decades, climate mitigation policy has evolved significantly, aiming to address the escalating challenge of global warming. This literature review synthesizes findings from a wide array of studies to evaluate the effectiveness of various policy instruments in achieving greenhouse gas abatement. The analysis encompasses a broad spectrum of policy tools, including carbon pricing, renewable energy incentives, energy efficiency standards, and regulatory measures. Despite the diversity of approaches, the review identifies common themes and challenges in policy implementation, such as political feasibility, economic impacts, and the need for international cooperation. The evidence suggests that while significant progress has been made in certain sectors and regions, global emissions continue to rise, indicating a gap between policy intentions and outcomes. The review highlights the importance of integrating multiple policy instruments to enhance effectiveness and the critical role of technological innovation and behavioral change in achieving long-term mitigation goals. Furthermore, it underscores the necessity of adaptive policy frameworks that can respond to evolving scientific understanding and socio-economic conditions. This comprehensive analysis aims to inform future policy design and implementation, offering insights into the lessons learned from three decades of climate mitigation efforts and the pathways forward to more effective and equitable climate action."}
