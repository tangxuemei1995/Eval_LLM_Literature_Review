{"Abstract": "Urban overheating, a phenomenon exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, poses significant challenges to cities worldwide. This study delves into the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating, exploring its multifaceted impacts on human health, energy consumption, and environmental sustainability. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key drivers of urban overheating, including urbanization, land use changes, and climate change. The research further examines a range of heat mitigation and adaptation strategies, from green infrastructure and cool materials to urban planning and policy interventions, assessing their effectiveness in reducing urban temperatures and enhancing resilience. Despite these efforts, the study highlights the persistent challenges in combating urban overheating, particularly in the context of rapid urbanization and global warming. The paper concludes with a call for integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to address urban overheating, emphasizing the need for future research to focus on innovative solutions, policy integration, and community engagement to ensure sustainable urban development in the face of escalating thermal stress."}
