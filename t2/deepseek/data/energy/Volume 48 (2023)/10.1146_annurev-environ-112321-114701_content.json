{"Abstract": "Groundwater serves as a critical source of drinking water worldwide, yet its quality is increasingly threatened by both geogenic and emerging contaminants. This study investigates the impact of key substances found in groundwater on human health, emphasizing the need for sustainable groundwater management practices. Geogenic contaminants, such as arsenic and fluoride, naturally occur in groundwater and pose significant health risks when consumed at high concentrations. Emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, further complicate the scenario by introducing new challenges to water safety. Through a comprehensive review of recent scientific literature, this research identifies the most critical substances affecting groundwater quality and evaluates their health implications. The findings underscore the importance of integrating advanced monitoring techniques, public health policies, and community engagement in managing groundwater resources. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, this study contributes to the development of strategies aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of groundwater supplies, thereby safeguarding public health against the backdrop of increasing environmental and anthropogenic pressures."}
