{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of the commons, focusing on the governance and sustainability of common-pool resources (CPRs) through the lens of collective action and common property regimes. By synthesizing a broad spectrum of scientific literature, we explore the challenges and opportunities inherent in managing resources that are collectively owned and utilized, such as forests, fisheries, and water bodies. The concept of 'commoning' is examined as a participatory approach to resource governance, emphasizing the role of community engagement and local knowledge in fostering sustainable practices. Furthermore, the research highlights the critical importance of natural resource policy in shaping the effectiveness of common property management, advocating for adaptive governance frameworks that can respond to environmental changes and socio-economic pressures. Through this comprehensive analysis, the paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on resource governance, offering insights into the mechanisms that can enhance the resilience and productivity of the commons in the face of global challenges."}
