{"Abstract": "Climate change poses significant risks to coastal critical infrastructure, threatening the resilience of systems essential for societal functioning and economic stability. This study examines the multifaceted vulnerabilities of coastal infrastructure to climate-induced hazards, including sea-level rise, increased storm intensity, and extreme weather events. By integrating interdisciplinary research, we assess the potential for cascading hazards that can amplify the impact on infrastructure networks, leading to widespread disruptions. The analysis highlights the importance of adaptive strategies and robust design principles in enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, the study explores the role of policy frameworks and community engagement in mitigating risks and fostering sustainable development. Through a comprehensive review of case studies and predictive modeling, we identify key areas of concern and propose actionable recommendations for stakeholders. The findings underscore the urgent need for proactive measures to safeguard coastal infrastructure against the escalating threats of climate change, ensuring long-term resilience and the protection of vulnerable communities."}
