{"Abstract": "The transition towards low energy demand futures in buildings is pivotal for climate change mitigation, yet it remains underexplored in the context of both residential and commercial sectors. This paper reviews the current state of research on modeling such futures, emphasizing the integration of megatrends and the imperative of maintaining decent living standards. We identify a critical gap in the development of scenarios that comprehensively account for energy demand transformation, driven by technological, behavioral, and policy changes. Our analysis highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine quantitative modeling with qualitative insights to capture the complexity of energy use in buildings. Furthermore, we underscore the importance of aligning energy demand reduction strategies with broader societal goals, ensuring that the pursuit of low energy futures does not compromise the quality of life. This paper calls for enhanced research efforts to refine modeling frameworks, incorporate diverse megatrends, and explore the socio-economic implications of transitioning to low energy demand futures in buildings."}
