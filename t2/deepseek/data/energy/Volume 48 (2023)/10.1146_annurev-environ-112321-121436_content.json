{"Abstract": "The concept of deforestation-free commodity supply chains has emerged as a pivotal strategy in the global effort to combat deforestation and promote sustainability. This research critically examines the feasibility and effectiveness of such supply chains, focusing on the interplay between land use, forest governance, and the policy mix required to achieve zero deforestation. By analyzing existing literature and case studies, the study identifies key challenges and opportunities in implementing deforestation-free supply chains. It highlights the importance of robust governance structures, stakeholder engagement, and the integration of sustainability principles into supply chain management. The findings suggest that while the goal of deforestation-free commodity supply chains is ambitious, it is attainable with a comprehensive and coordinated policy approach. However, the study also underscores the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation of strategies to address the dynamic nature of global commodity markets and environmental policies."}
