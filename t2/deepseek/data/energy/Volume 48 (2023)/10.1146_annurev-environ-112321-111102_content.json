{"Abstract": "The concept of Great Green Walls has emerged as a prominent strategy to combat desertification and rehabilitate degraded drylands across the globe, notably in regions such as the Sahel in Africa and parts of China and Algeria. This paper critically examines the scientific underpinnings, ecological outcomes, and socio-economic implications of large-scale afforestation projects aimed at creating green barriers against desert expansion. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we assess the effectiveness of these initiatives in achieving their environmental rehabilitation goals, while also addressing the challenges and controversies surrounding their implementation. Our analysis reveals a complex interplay between ecological benefits, such as biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration, and potential drawbacks, including water resource depletion and impacts on local communities. By distinguishing between the hype and the scientific evidence, this study aims to provide a balanced perspective on the role of Great Green Walls in sustainable land management and climate change mitigation strategies."}
