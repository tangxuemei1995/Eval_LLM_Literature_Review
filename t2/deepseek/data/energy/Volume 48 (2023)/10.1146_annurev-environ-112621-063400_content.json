{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and application of metrics for decision-making in energy justice, focusing on the principles of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. By analyzing existing literature and case studies, we identify key indicators that can be used to assess energy equity across different contexts. The proposed metrics aim to provide policymakers and stakeholders with a comprehensive framework to evaluate the fairness and inclusivity of energy policies and projects. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating diverse perspectives and addressing systemic inequalities in the energy sector. The study concludes with recommendations for refining these metrics to better support equitable decision-making and promote sustainable energy transitions that benefit all communities."}
