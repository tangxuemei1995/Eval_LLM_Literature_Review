{"Abstract": "The state of the world's arable land is a critical concern for global sustainability, food security, and environmental health. This research explores the multifaceted challenges facing arable lands, including biodiversity loss, increased greenhouse gas emissions, land degradation, and the impacts of changing land use patterns. The study highlights the intricate relationship between soil carbon sequestration and agricultural practices, emphasizing the role of sustainable land management in mitigating climate change. Furthermore, it examines the socio-economic implications for rural economies, which are heavily dependent on the productivity and health of arable lands. By integrating findings from recent scientific literature, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of arable lands, identify key drivers of change, and propose strategies for enhancing resilience and sustainability in agricultural landscapes."}
