{"Abstract": "The attribution of extreme events to climate change has become a pivotal area of research in understanding the impacts of global warming on weather patterns and societal vulnerability. This study synthesizes current methodologies and findings in the field of extreme event attribution, focusing on the role of anthropogenic climate change in altering the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, heavy precipitation, and tropical cyclones. By leveraging advanced climate models and observational data, researchers have made significant strides in quantifying the human influence on specific extreme events, thereby enhancing our understanding of climate vulnerability and risk. The paper also explores the implications of these findings for policy-making, disaster preparedness, and climate adaptation strategies, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. Through a comprehensive review of recent case studies, this research underscores the importance of attribution science in informing climate resilience efforts and highlights the challenges and opportunities in advancing our predictive capabilities in the face of a changing climate."}
