{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential of land modifications as a strategy for mitigating concurrent flood and drought risks, emphasizing the perspectives and motivations of land users. As climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of these concurrent hydrological extremes, innovative adaptation strategies are urgently needed. Land modifications, including changes in land use, soil management, and water conservation practices, offer a promising avenue for reducing vulnerability to these risks. Through a comprehensive review of scientific literature and case studies, this research identifies key land modification techniques that have been effective in different contexts. Furthermore, it delves into the motivations and barriers faced by land users in adopting these practices, highlighting the importance of socio-economic factors, policy support, and community engagement. The findings underscore the need for integrated approaches that combine technical solutions with an understanding of land users' perspectives to enhance the resilience of landscapes to concurrent flood and drought risks."}
