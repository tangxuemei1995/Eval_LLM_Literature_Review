{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate partnership between the body and brain in shaping cognition, with a particular focus on the exaptation of memory processes. Central to this investigation is the role of the hippocampus in memory formation and retrieval, alongside the phenomenon of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that are critical for memory consolidation. We delve into the mechanisms of homeostasis and allostasis, examining how these processes facilitate body control and glucose regulation, thereby influencing cognitive functions. The research posits that the body's physiological states, regulated through these mechanisms, are not merely background conditions but active participants in cognitive processes. By integrating findings from neuroscience and physiology, this paper aims to shed light on how the body-brain partnership underpins the exaptation of memory, offering new insights into the adaptive functions of memory in response to internal and external demands."}
