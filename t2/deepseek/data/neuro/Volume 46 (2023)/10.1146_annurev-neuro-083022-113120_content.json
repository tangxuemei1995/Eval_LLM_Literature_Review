{"Abstract": "The inhibition of Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 (PTBP1) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases by facilitating the conversion of glial cells into functional neurons. This review explores the underlying mechanisms of PTB inhibition, focusing on its role in neuronal reprogramming and the potential to replenish neuronal loss in the brain. Through lineage tracing studies, we highlight the capacity of PTB inhibition to induce pluripotent progenitors to adopt a neuronal fate, offering insights into the cellular and molecular pathways involved. Furthermore, we discuss the behavioral benefits observed in animal models following PTB inhibition, suggesting its potential to ameliorate symptoms associated with neurodegeneration. By synthesizing current findings, this review underscores the therapeutic potential of PTB inhibition in converting glial cells to neurons, paving the way for novel treatments for neurodegenerative disorders."}
