{"Abstract": "The spinal cord plays a pivotal role in the execution of motor control, with spinal interneurons (INs) at the heart of this complex process. This review delves into the diversity and connectivity of spinal INs, particularly within the ventral horn, where they orchestrate the intricate circuitry essential for locomotion and other motor functions. By integrating findings from recent studies, we highlight the classification of INs based on their molecular markers, physiological properties, and synaptic connections. The emerging picture is one of a highly specialized network, where distinct IN populations contribute to the generation, modulation, and refinement of motor output. Understanding the precise roles and interactions of these INs not only sheds light on the fundamental principles of motor control but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions in motor disorders."}
