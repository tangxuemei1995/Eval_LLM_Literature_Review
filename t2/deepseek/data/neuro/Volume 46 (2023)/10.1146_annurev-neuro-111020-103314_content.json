{"Abstract": "Understanding the neural circuits underlying emotion states is a central challenge in neuroscience, bridging the gap between circuit neuroscience and affective neuroscience. This research explores the intricate networks that encode the valence of emotions, employing cross-species approaches to unravel the conserved and species-specific mechanisms. By integrating findings from rodent models and human studies, we aim to delineate the neural substrates that govern emotional responses and their dysregulation in psychiatric disorders. Advanced techniques in neural circuit mapping and manipulation are utilized to dissect the functional connectivity and plasticity of these circuits. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive framework for understanding the neural basis of emotions, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for mood and anxiety disorders. This study underscores the importance of cross-species research in advancing our knowledge of the neural circuits for emotion, paving the way for novel interventions in mental health."}
