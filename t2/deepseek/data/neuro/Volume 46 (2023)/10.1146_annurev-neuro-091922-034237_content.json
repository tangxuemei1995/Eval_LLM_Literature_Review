{"Abstract": "Cholesterol metabolism plays a pivotal role in the aging process and the development of age-related disorders, particularly neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how cholesterol homeostasis is altered with aging, focusing on its impact on neurons and microglia, the brain's resident immune cells. Aging is associated with dysregulated cholesterol metabolism, leading to altered neuronal function and increased neuroinflammation, which are key contributors to neurodegeneration. In Alzheimer's disease, the accumulation of cholesterol in neurons and microglia exacerbates amyloid-beta production and tau pathology, hallmark features of the disease. Understanding the intricate relationship between cholesterol metabolism, aging, and age-related neurological disorders offers potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the progression of these debilitating conditions. This abstract highlights the importance of further research into cholesterol's role in brain aging and neurodegeneration, aiming to uncover novel strategies for disease intervention and prevention."}
