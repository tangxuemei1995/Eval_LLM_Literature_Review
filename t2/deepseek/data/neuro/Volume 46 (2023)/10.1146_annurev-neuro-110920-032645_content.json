{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate role of neural networks in navigation, focusing on the transition from neural connections to computational processes. By examining key components such as memory, menotaxis, path integration, head direction, dopamine, and coordinate transformation, we delve into how these elements interact within the brain to facilitate complex navigational tasks. Memory systems are crucial for storing and retrieving spatial information, while menotaxis and path integration allow for the maintenance of direction and the calculation of position relative to a starting point, respectively. Head direction cells provide a neural compass, and dopamine plays a pivotal role in reward-based learning and decision-making processes. Coordinate transformation mechanisms enable the translation of sensory inputs into a navigable spatial framework. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to shed light on the computational underpinnings of navigation, offering insights into the neural basis of spatial orientation and movement."}
