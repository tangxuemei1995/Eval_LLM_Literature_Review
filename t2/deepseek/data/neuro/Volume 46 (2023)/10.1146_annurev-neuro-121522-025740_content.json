{"Abstract": "The striatum, a critical component of the basal ganglia, plays a pivotal role in the integration of volition and action through its distinct compartments: the striosomes and the matrisomes. These compartments serve as scaffolds for the dynamic coupling of cognitive and motor functions, facilitating learning and decision-making processes. Striosomes, embedded within the matrisomal framework, are particularly responsive to dopamine signaling, which modulates their activity in response to reward and punishment cues. This study explores the intricate interplay between striosomes and matrisomes, highlighting their contribution to the plasticity of the basal ganglia circuits. By synthesizing recent findings from neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies, we propose a model wherein the striosomal-matrisomal network orchestrates the balance between exploratory and exploitative behaviors. This model underscores the importance of dopamine in mediating the adaptive responses of the striatum to environmental stimuli, thereby influencing learning outcomes. Our analysis suggests that disruptions in the striosomal-matrisomal dynamics may underlie various neuropsychiatric disorders, offering new insights into their pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets. This research underscores the necessity of further investigation into the striatal compartments to fully elucidate their roles in the complex processes of volition and action."}
