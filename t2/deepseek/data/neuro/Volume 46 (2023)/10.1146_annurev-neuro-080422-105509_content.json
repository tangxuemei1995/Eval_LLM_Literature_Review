{"Abstract": "Migraine, a debilitating neurological disorder, is intricately linked with the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This review explores the pivotal role of meningeal mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology, focusing on the interaction between meningeal afferents and the trigeminal system. Neurogenic inflammation and sensitization of meningeal nociceptors are identified as key processes that contribute to the headache phase of migraine. Additionally, cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, is discussed for its potential to activate meningeal nociceptors, thereby initiating migraine attacks. Understanding the complex interplay between meningeal afferents, neurogenic inflammation, and CSD offers new insights into migraine mechanisms and paves the way for innovative therapeutic strategies targeting meningeal pathways to alleviate migraine symptoms."}
