{"Abstract": "Circadian rhythms, the endogenous 24-hour cycles that regulate physiological processes, are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and health. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the brain, play a pivotal role in modulating these rhythms through calcium signaling and the release of gliotransmitters. This review explores the dual role of astrocytes in circadian regulation, highlighting their beneficial effects on sleep and cognitive functions, as well as their potential involvement in pathological conditions. We discuss how disruptions in astrocytic circadian functions can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and the progression of gliomas. By examining the intricate interplay between circadian rhythms and astrocyte activity, this paper aims to shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying brain health and disease, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for circadian-related disorders."}
