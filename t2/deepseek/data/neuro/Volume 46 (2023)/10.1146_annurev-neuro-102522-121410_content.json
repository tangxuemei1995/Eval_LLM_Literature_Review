{"Abstract": "The primate brain exhibits a sophisticated architecture for processing social information, underpinned by specialized networks dedicated to social cognition. This study delves into the functional brain organization that facilitates complex social behaviors, focusing on the neural substrates involved in face processing, social interaction analysis, and the acquisition of social knowledge. By synthesizing findings from neuroimaging, lesion studies, and comparative neuroanatomy, we highlight the pivotal role of the 'social brain' in navigating the intricacies of primate social life. Our analysis reveals distinct yet interconnected neural circuits that support the recognition of social cues, the interpretation of others' intentions, and the formation of social bonds. These insights not only advance our understanding of the neural basis of social cognition but also underscore the evolutionary significance of specialized networks in fostering adaptive social behaviors. This research contributes to the broader discourse on the neurobiological foundations of sociality, offering a comprehensive framework for future investigations into the primate social brain."}
