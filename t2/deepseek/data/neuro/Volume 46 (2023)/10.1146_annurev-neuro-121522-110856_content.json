{"Abstract": "This study explores the neural mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic social behaviors, focusing on the transition from developmental stages to adulthood. Utilizing the social behavior network (SBN) as a framework, we investigate the role of GABA neurons in modulating behaviors such as aggression and social play. Epigenetic modifications and the enzyme aromatase are examined for their contributions to the sexual differentiation of the brain and behavior. By integrating developmental neurobiology with adult behavioral outcomes, this research aims to elucidate the complex interplay between genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors in shaping sex-specific social behaviors. Our findings highlight the importance of early-life experiences and epigenetic regulation in the maturation of neural circuits that govern social interactions, offering new insights into the developmental origins of behavioral sex differences."}
