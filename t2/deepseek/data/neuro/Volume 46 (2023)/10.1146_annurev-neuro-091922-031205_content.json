{"Abstract": "Astrocyte endfeet, specialized structures that ensheath cerebral blood vessels, play a pivotal role in maintaining brain homeostasis and orchestrating neurovascular coupling. These dynamic interfaces facilitate the bidirectional communication between neurons and the vasculature, ensuring the precise regulation of cerebral blood flow in response to neuronal activity. Despite their critical functions, numerous open questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying astrocyte endfoot-mediated signaling and their contributions to brain pathology. This review highlights the current understanding of astrocyte endfeet in the context of the blood-brain barrier integrity, cerebral blood flow regulation, and neurovascular coupling. We also discuss the emerging evidence implicating astrocyte endfeet dysfunction in various neurological disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy. By addressing these unresolved questions, we aim to shed light on the potential therapeutic targets within the astrocyte-vascular interface for the treatment of brain diseases."}
