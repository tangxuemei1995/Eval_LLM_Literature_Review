{"Abstract": "The mouse visual cortex exhibits a complex modular architecture, where the integration of feedforward and feedback information streams is crucial for visual processing. This study investigates the role of patchy connections and layer 1 in facilitating these streams, with a focus on the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor's involvement. By analyzing the processing hierarchy within the cortex, we uncover how distinct pathways contribute to the synthesis of visual information. Our findings suggest that the interplay between feedforward and feedback mechanisms, mediated by specific neural circuits and receptor activity, underpins the cortex's ability to process and interpret visual stimuli efficiently. This research provides insights into the modular organization of the visual cortex and its implications for understanding visual perception and neural computation."}
