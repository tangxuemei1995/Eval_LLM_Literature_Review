{"Abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising intervention for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, notably Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This review synthesizes current evidence on the efficacy, mechanisms, and safety of DBS in modulating neural circuits implicated in these conditions. By targeting specific brain regions such as the subthalamic nucleus, ventral capsule/ventral striatum, and anterior limb of the internal capsule, DBS has shown potential in alleviating symptoms where traditional therapies have failed. Despite its therapeutic promise, the application of DBS in psychiatric neurosurgery faces challenges, including variability in patient response, ethical considerations, and the need for precise targeting to minimize adverse effects. This abstract highlights the importance of ongoing research to refine DBS techniques, understand its long-term outcomes, and expand its accessibility to patients suffering from severe OCD and depression, thereby offering new hope for those with treatment-resistant conditions."}
