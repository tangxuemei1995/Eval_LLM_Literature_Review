{"Abstract": "The construction of cognitive maps, essential for spatial navigation and memory, involves intricate neural circuits and computational processes within the brain. This research delves into the developmental trajectory of these maps, focusing on the pivotal roles of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Through a synthesis of recent findings, we explore how these brain regions collaborate to encode, store, and retrieve spatial information, facilitating effective navigation and memory formation. The study highlights the dynamic interplay between neural development and environmental interactions, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the maturation of spatial representation capabilities. By integrating insights from neuroscience and computational modeling, this work advances our understanding of the foundational processes that enable the brain to construct and utilize cognitive maps, offering new perspectives on the neural basis of spatial cognition and its implications for learning and memory."}
