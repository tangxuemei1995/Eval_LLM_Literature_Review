{"Abstract": "Context-dependent learning is a fundamental aspect of cognition, enabling organisms to adapt their behavior based on environmental cues. This study explores the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this process, integrating insights from memory, learning, and continual learning paradigms. We employ Bayesian inference models to elucidate how the brain updates and retrieves information in a context-sensitive manner. Neural computation analyses reveal the pivotal roles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortex in encoding, maintaining, and retrieving context-dependent information. Our findings suggest that these brain regions interact dynamically to support the flexible adaptation of learned behaviors to new contexts. This research advances our understanding of the neural substrates of context-dependent learning and offers a computational framework for studying continual learning in both biological and artificial systems."}
