{"Abstract": "The ocean's biological pump plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, facilitating the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the deep ocean through a series of biological processes. This study aims to quantify the efficiency and variability of the biological pump and its impact on carbon sequestration on a global scale. Utilizing advanced satellite oceanography techniques and biogeochemical modeling, we explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon export pathways. Our findings reveal significant regional variations in the biological pump's efficiency, influenced by factors such as phytoplankton community structure, nutrient availability, and ocean circulation patterns. This research underscores the importance of integrating satellite observations with modeling approaches to improve our understanding of the ocean's role in mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration. The results contribute to refining global carbon cycle models and informing climate policy decisions."}
