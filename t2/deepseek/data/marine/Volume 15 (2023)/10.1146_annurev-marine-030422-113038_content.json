{"Abstract": "Marine organisms exhibit a remarkable array of biological rhythms, synchronized with environmental cycles through endogenous oscillators. These rhythms, including circadian, circatidal, circalunar, and circannual, play crucial roles in the survival and reproductive success of species ranging from algae to complex animals. This study delves into the mechanisms underlying these biological clocks, exploring how they are entrained by environmental cues such as light, temperature, and tidal movements. Furthermore, we examine the impact of climate change on these rhythms, highlighting the potential disruptions to marine ecosystems. As global temperatures rise and oceanic conditions shift, the synchronization between endogenous oscillators and environmental cycles may be altered, affecting the timing of critical biological processes. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, this research underscores the importance of understanding biological rhythms in marine organisms for predicting their responses to environmental changes. By integrating findings from molecular biology, ecology, and climatology, we aim to provide insights into the resilience of marine life in the face of ongoing climate challenges, offering a foundation for future conservation strategies."}
