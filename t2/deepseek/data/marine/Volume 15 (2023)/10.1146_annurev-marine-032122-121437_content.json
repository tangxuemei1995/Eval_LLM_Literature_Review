{"Abstract": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are extreme climatic events characterized by prolonged periods of anomalously high sea temperatures, which have become more frequent and intense due to climate change. These events pose significant threats to marine ecosystems, altering biodiversity, disrupting ecosystem services, and causing shifts in species distributions. This study investigates the biological impacts of MHWs, focusing on their effects on marine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services. By synthesizing recent research, we highlight the cascading effects of MHWs on marine life, including coral bleaching, changes in species interactions, and the loss of habitat-forming species. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these changes for human societies that rely on marine resources. Our findings underscore the urgent need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of MHWs and safeguard marine ecosystems in the face of ongoing climate change."}
