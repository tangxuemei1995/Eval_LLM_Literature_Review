{"Abstract": "Tidal wetlands, including marshes and mangroves, play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of coastal storms such as cyclones and hurricanes. These natural ecosystems act as buffers, reducing wave energy, storm surge, and flood risks, thereby protecting inland areas and human settlements. This study explores the effectiveness of marshes and mangroves as nature-based solutions for coastal defense, comparing their performance with traditional coastal engineering approaches. Through a review of recent scientific literature and case studies, we assess the capacity of these ecosystems to attenuate storm impacts, their resilience to extreme weather events, and their contribution to biodiversity and carbon sequestration. The findings highlight the potential of integrating tidal wetlands into coastal management strategies, offering sustainable and cost-effective alternatives to hard infrastructure. This research underscores the importance of preserving and restoring these critical habitats to enhance coastal resilience in the face of increasing storm intensity and frequency due to climate change."}
