{"Abstract": "Lipid biogeochemistry plays a pivotal role in understanding the complex interactions between biological processes and the geochemical environment, particularly in marine ecosystems. This study delves into the advancements in modern lipidomic techniques, which have revolutionized our ability to analyze and interpret the vast diversity of lipids in environmental samples. By integrating microbial oceanography with meta-omics approaches, we explore the intricate relationships between microbial communities and lipid dynamics in the ocean. The application of cutting-edge lipidomic tools, such as high-resolution mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, has enabled the detailed characterization of lipid profiles, shedding light on their biogeochemical cycling and ecological functions. Furthermore, this research highlights the significance of lipid geochemistry in tracing organic matter sources and understanding the carbon cycle in marine environments. Through a comprehensive review of recent studies, we aim to provide insights into the potential of lipidomics to address key questions in biogeochemistry and microbial oceanography, paving the way for future research in this interdisciplinary field."}
