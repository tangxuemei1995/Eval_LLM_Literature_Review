{"Abstract": "The field of oceanography, like many STEM disciplines, faces significant challenges in achieving gender equity. This study explores the current state of gender representation within oceanography, identifying barriers that women and non-binary individuals encounter in their academic and professional journeys. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, surveys, and interviews with professionals in the field, we highlight systemic issues such as bias in hiring and promotion, unequal access to fieldwork opportunities, and the lack of mentorship for underrepresented genders. Our findings suggest that while progress has been made in increasing the visibility of women in oceanography, substantial work remains to ensure equitable participation and recognition. We propose actionable strategies for institutions and professional organizations to foster a more inclusive environment, including targeted recruitment efforts, the establishment of mentorship programs, and the implementation of policies that support work-life balance. This research underscores the importance of gender equity in advancing scientific innovation and calls for a collective effort to dismantle the barriers that hinder diversity in oceanography."}
