{"Abstract": "This study employs nuclear reprocessing tracers, specifically 129I, to elucidate the intricate flow features and connectivity between the Arctic and Subpolar North Atlantic Oceans. By analyzing the distribution and transit time of 129I, we provide novel insights into the circulation patterns that govern the exchange of water masses between these critical oceanic regions. Our findings reveal distinct pathways and temporal scales of water mass transport, highlighting the role of the Arctic as a significant source of water entering the North Atlantic. The application of 129I as a tracer offers a unique perspective on the dynamics of oceanic circulation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that influence global climate and marine ecosystems. This research underscores the importance of nuclear reprocessing tracers in advancing our knowledge of oceanic connectivity and the mechanisms driving the global ocean conveyor belt."}
