{"Abstract": "This study delves into the paleo-environmental insights provided by nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) preserved within the biomineral structures of diatoms, foraminifera, and corals. By analyzing the δ15N signatures embedded in these marine organisms, we aim to reconstruct past oceanic nitrogen cycles and their responses to climatic and environmental changes. Diatoms, foraminifera, and corals serve as natural archives, each offering unique temporal and spatial perspectives on nitrogen dynamics. The research focuses on the methodological approaches for extracting and interpreting δ15N data from fossilized specimens, highlighting the challenges and advancements in biomineral analysis. Our findings underscore the significance of nitrogen isotopes as proxies for understanding historical nutrient utilization, productivity, and biogeochemical processes in marine ecosystems. The integration of δ15N records from these diverse organisms provides a comprehensive view of the interplay between nitrogen cycling and global environmental shifts over geological timescales. This study contributes to the broader field of paleoceanography by enhancing our ability to decode the complex history of Earth's nitrogen cycle through the lens of biomineralized fossils."}
