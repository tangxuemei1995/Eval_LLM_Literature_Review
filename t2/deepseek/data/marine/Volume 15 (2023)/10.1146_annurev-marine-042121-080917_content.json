{"Abstract": "Coral reefs, among the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, are facing unprecedented threats from climate change, including deoxygenation and nutrient imbalances. This study delves into the pivotal role of microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sustaining coral reef ecosystem function and resilience. Through a comprehensive analysis of microbiomes and their metabolic pathways, we uncover the intricate processes of nutrient cycling that are essential for coral health and survival. Our findings highlight how microbes mediate the transformation of DOM, facilitating the recycling of nutrients and supporting the complex web of life within coral reefs. Furthermore, we explore the implications of deoxygenation on these microbial processes, revealing potential vulnerabilities and adaptive strategies. This research underscores the importance of microbial-DOM interactions in maintaining ecosystem balance and offers insights into strategies for enhancing coral reef resilience in the face of environmental stressors."}
