{"Abstract": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are among the most productive marine ecosystems, playing a crucial role in global carbon cycling and supporting significant fisheries. This study investigates the impacts of climate change on EBUS, focusing on the mechanisms through which global warming alters coastal upwelling dynamics. Utilizing a combination of historical data analysis, climate model projections, and ecological modeling, we assess changes in upwelling intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution under various climate scenarios. Our findings indicate a complex response of EBUS to climate change, with potential increases in upwelling intensity in some regions due to enhanced wind stress, while others may experience weakened upwelling as a result of altered atmospheric circulation patterns. These changes have profound implications for marine biodiversity, fisheries productivity, and carbon sequestration capacity. The study highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on EBUS and the communities that depend on them. By integrating multidisciplinary approaches, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the resilience of EBUS in the face of global environmental change."}
