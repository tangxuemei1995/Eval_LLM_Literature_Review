{"Abstract": "The Beaufort Gyre, a dominant circulation feature of the Arctic Ocean, plays a crucial role in regulating the distribution of sea ice, freshwater, and ocean heat content. This study investigates the dynamics of the Beaufort Gyre, focusing on its impact on Arctic climate variability. By analyzing recent observational data and model simulations, we explore the mechanisms driving the gyre's circulation patterns and their implications for sea ice extent and freshwater storage. Our findings highlight the gyre's sensitivity to atmospheric forcing and its potential feedback effects on global climate systems. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of Arctic Ocean processes and their broader environmental impacts."}
