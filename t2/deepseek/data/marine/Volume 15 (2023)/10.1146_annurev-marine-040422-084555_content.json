{"Abstract": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV) represents a significant mode of climate variability with profound impacts on global weather patterns, ecosystems, and human activities. This study synthesizes current understanding of the modes and mechanisms driving PDV, focusing on the interplay between oceanic and atmospheric processes within the Pacific Ocean. We explore the role of ocean–atmosphere teleconnections in modulating PDV, emphasizing the influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a key driver of interannual to decadal climate fluctuations. Through a comprehensive review of observational data, climate model simulations, and theoretical frameworks, we identify the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) as dominant patterns of PDV, characterized by shifts in sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric pressure across the Pacific basin. The mechanisms underlying these patterns, including ocean heat content variability, wind-driven ocean circulation changes, and feedback loops between the ocean and atmosphere, are critically examined. Furthermore, this study highlights the implications of PDV for climate change projections, underscoring the need for improved understanding and predictive capabilities to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies in a warming world."}
