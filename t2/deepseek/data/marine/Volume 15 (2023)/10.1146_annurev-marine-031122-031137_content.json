{"Abstract": "The burial of marine carbonates during the Quaternary period plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, influencing atmospheric CO2 levels and climate dynamics. This study synthesizes proxy- and model-based reconstructions to explore the variations in carbonate burial across glacial and interglacial cycles. By integrating sedimentary records, isotopic data, and biogeochemical models, we assess the spatial and temporal patterns of carbonate deposition and dissolution in the ocean. Our findings highlight significant shifts in carbonate burial rates, driven by changes in sea level, ocean circulation, and biological productivity. Despite advances in understanding, persisting uncertainties remain regarding the quantification of carbonate fluxes and their feedback mechanisms with climate. This research underscores the need for improved proxy records and model simulations to better constrain the role of carbonate burial in the Earth's carbon cycle and its implications for future climate scenarios."}
