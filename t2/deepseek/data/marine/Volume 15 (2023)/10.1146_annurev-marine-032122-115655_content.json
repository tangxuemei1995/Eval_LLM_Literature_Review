{"Abstract": "The deep ocean's water column is a vast and largely unexplored habitat that harbors a diverse array of prokaryotic life, including bacteria and archaea. These microorganisms play crucial roles in biogeochemical cycles, contributing to the global carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles through their metabolic activities. Recent advances in microbial oceanography have shed light on the distribution, diversity, and functional capabilities of prokaryotes in these extreme environments. Studies utilizing high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses have revealed a complex microbial community structure, with distinct populations adapted to the varying pressures, temperatures, and nutrient availabilities found at different depths. Furthermore, research has highlighted the importance of prokaryotic metabolic processes, such as chemolithotrophy and heterotrophy, in sustaining life in the deep ocean. Understanding the ecological roles and adaptive strategies of these microorganisms is essential for comprehending the broader implications of microbial activity on ocean health and global climate dynamics. This review synthesizes current knowledge on prokaryotic life in the deep ocean's water column, emphasizing their ecological significance and the challenges of studying these remote ecosystems."}
