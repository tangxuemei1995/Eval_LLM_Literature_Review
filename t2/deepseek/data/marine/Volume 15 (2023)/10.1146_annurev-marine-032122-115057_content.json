{"Abstract": "The nearshore region, a dynamic interface between land and sea, plays a critical role in the exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles, significantly impacting coastal ecosystems and water quality. This study investigates the mechanisms driving cross-shore exchange, focusing on the behavior of particles under the influence of turbulence, wind, surface waves, and internal waves. Utilizing a combination of field observations and numerical modeling, we explore how these physical forces facilitate the transport and mixing of materials across the nearshore zone. Our findings reveal that turbulence and wave-induced currents are primary drivers of particle dispersion, while wind and internal waves contribute to the vertical and horizontal redistribution of substances. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting the fate of pollutants and the distribution of plankton, offering insights into the management and conservation of coastal environments."}
