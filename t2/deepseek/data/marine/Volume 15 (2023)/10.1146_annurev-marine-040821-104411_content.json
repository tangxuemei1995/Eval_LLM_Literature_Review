{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 stands as one of the most significant marine oil spills in history, prompting extensive research into the mechanisms of oil transport in oceanic environments. This study focuses on the processes of oil spreading, dispersion, droplet formation, and the role of eddy diffusivity in the aftermath of the blowout. Utilizing a combination of satellite imagery, in situ measurements, and numerical modeling, we analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of oil transport. Our findings highlight the critical influence of oceanic currents and turbulence on the dispersion of oil, with eddy diffusivity playing a pivotal role in the horizontal and vertical distribution of oil droplets. The formation of oil droplets, influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the oil and the presence of dispersants, significantly affects the rate and extent of oil spreading. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of oil transport mechanisms in deep-sea environments, offering valuable insights for future spill response strategies and environmental impact assessments."}
