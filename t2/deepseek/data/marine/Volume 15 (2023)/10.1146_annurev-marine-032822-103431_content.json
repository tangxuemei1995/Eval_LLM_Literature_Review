{"Abstract": "Marine iron biogeochemistry plays a pivotal role in regulating oceanic primary productivity and the global carbon cycle. This study leverages the novel application of iron isotopes to unravel the complex processes governing iron cycling in marine environments. By analyzing isotopic signatures from diverse sources, including atmospheric dust, marine sediments, and hydrothermal vents, we provide unprecedented insights into the sources, transformations, and sinks of iron in the ocean. Our findings, supported by data from the GEOTRACES program, highlight the significant contributions of hydrothermal vents to the oceanic iron pool, challenging previous assumptions dominated by dust inputs. Furthermore, isotopic fractionation patterns reveal intricate biogeochemical processes, such as redox transformations and biological uptake, that influence iron's bioavailability and its role in ocean ecosystems. This research underscores the utility of iron isotopes as a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of ocean biogeochemistry and its implications for global climate dynamics."}
