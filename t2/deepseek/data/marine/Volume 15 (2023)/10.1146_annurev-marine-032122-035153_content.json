{"Abstract": "The biological carbon pump plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by transferring carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, thereby sequestering atmospheric CO2. This process is mediated by a complex interplay of biological and physical mechanisms, including the formation of marine snow, fecal pellets, and aggregates, which facilitate the downward flux of organic carbon. However, this flux is subject to attenuation due to microbial degradation and zooplankton feeding, which can significantly reduce the amount of carbon reaching the deep ocean. From a biologist's perspective, understanding the dynamics of carbon export requires a detailed examination of the organisms and processes involved in the production, transformation, and consumption of organic matter. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on the biological carbon pump, with a focus on the roles of marine snow, fecal pellets, and aggregates, and discusses the implications of flux attenuation for carbon sequestration in the ocean."}
