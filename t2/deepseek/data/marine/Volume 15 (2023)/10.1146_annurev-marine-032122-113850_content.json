{"Abstract": "Ocean Carbon Dioxide Removal (OCDR) has emerged as a pivotal strategy in mitigating climate change, leveraging the ocean's vast capacity to absorb CO2. This paper delves into the sociotechnical dimensions of OCDR, exploring the interplay between technological innovation, climate finance mechanisms, public perception, and environmental ethics. We examine the technological feasibility and scalability of OCDR methods, alongside the financial models that could support their deployment. Public perception is scrutinized to understand societal acceptance and the potential for public engagement in OCDR initiatives. Furthermore, the study addresses the ethical considerations surrounding OCDR, including its impact on marine ecosystems and the equitable distribution of its benefits and risks. By integrating these sociotechnical aspects, this research aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the responsible development and implementation of OCDR strategies, ensuring they contribute effectively to global climate goals while respecting ecological and societal values."}
