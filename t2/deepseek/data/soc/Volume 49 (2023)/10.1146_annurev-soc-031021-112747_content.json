{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate relationship between food systems and social inequality, exploring how agricultural practices, food access, and policies perpetuate disparities across different societal strata. By employing an intersectional lens, the research examines the multifaceted dimensions of food justice and sovereignty, highlighting the systemic barriers that marginalized communities face in achieving equitable food distribution and consumption. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the paper identifies key factors contributing to food inequality, including economic constraints, racial and gender discrimination, and environmental degradation. The findings underscore the necessity for holistic approaches that address the root causes of food insecurity and advocate for sustainable, inclusive agricultural models. This research contributes to the broader discourse on social justice by emphasizing the critical role of food in shaping societal equity and calls for transformative policies that ensure food sovereignty for all, irrespective of socio-economic status."}
