{"Abstract": "This study explores the phenomenon of diverging destinies in East Asia, focusing on the interplay between family structures, children's outcomes, and societal inequalities, with a particular emphasis on gender dynamics. Drawing on a comprehensive review of recent literature and demographic data, we examine how economic, social, and cultural shifts in East Asian societies have led to varying trajectories for families and children. The analysis highlights the role of educational attainment, labor market participation, and family policies in shaping these destinies, revealing significant disparities based on socioeconomic status and gender. Our findings suggest that while some families and children benefit from the region's rapid modernization and economic growth, others are left behind, exacerbating existing inequalities. The study calls for targeted policy interventions to address these disparities, ensuring more equitable outcomes for all children in East Asia."}
