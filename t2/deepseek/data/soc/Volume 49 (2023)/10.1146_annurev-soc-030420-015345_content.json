{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning have significantly enhanced our ability to understand and predict the effects of interventions across various domains. This paper reviews the latest methodologies that leverage machine learning techniques to address key challenges in causal inference, including the estimation of counterfactuals, treatment effect heterogeneity, and mediation effects. We explore how machine learning models, with their flexibility and capacity to handle high-dimensional data, are being adapted to improve the accuracy of causal effect estimation, particularly in the presence of complex, non-linear relationships. Furthermore, we discuss the critical issues of extrapolation and external validity, highlighting innovative approaches that aim to ensure the generalizability of causal findings beyond the study sample. By synthesizing recent developments, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in integrating machine learning with causal inference, offering insights into future research directions and practical applications."}
