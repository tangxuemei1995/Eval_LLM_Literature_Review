{"Abstract": "Social isolation represents a significant, yet unevenly distributed, health hazard across various demographics, influenced by a complex interplay of factors including gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. This study delves into the multifaceted nature of social isolation, examining its prevalence and impact through the lens of disparities that permeate the life course. By analyzing existing literature and empirical data, we uncover how marginalized groups face heightened risks of social isolation, which in turn exacerbates health inequities. The research highlights the critical need for targeted interventions that address the root causes of social isolation, taking into account the diverse experiences and challenges faced by different populations. Our findings underscore the importance of a nuanced understanding of social isolation as a determinant of health, advocating for policies and practices that promote social inclusion and equity across all stages of life."}
