{"Abstract": "This study explores the divergent conceptualizations of race through the lenses of essentialism and constructivism, aiming to elucidate how these frameworks shape individual and collective beliefs about racial identity. Essentialist perspectives posit race as a fixed, inherent characteristic rooted in biology, whereas constructivist views emphasize race as a socially constructed category, shaped by historical, cultural, and political contexts. By analyzing a broad spectrum of scientific literature, this research investigates the implications of these contrasting paradigms on societal attitudes, racial categorization, and the perpetuation of racial stereotypes. The findings suggest that essentialist beliefs may reinforce rigid racial boundaries and hierarchies, while constructivist approaches offer a more fluid understanding of race, potentially fostering greater inclusivity and social equity. This paper contributes to ongoing debates in the social sciences by highlighting the critical role of conceptual frameworks in shaping perceptions of race and advocating for a nuanced, interdisciplinary approach to understanding racial dynamics."}
