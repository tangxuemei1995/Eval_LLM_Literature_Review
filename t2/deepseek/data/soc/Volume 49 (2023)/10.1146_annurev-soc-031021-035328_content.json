{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate relationships between space, place, policing, and punishment within the criminal legal system, employing spatial-contextual analyses to uncover the nuanced dynamics at play. By integrating geographical information systems (GIS) with socio-legal research methods, we explore how spatial configurations and place-based characteristics influence policing practices and punitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that the spatial distribution of law enforcement resources and the socio-economic attributes of places significantly affect the intensity of policing and the severity of punishments meted out. Furthermore, this research highlights the role of historical and cultural contexts in shaping the spatial patterns of the criminal legal system, suggesting that place is not merely a backdrop but a pivotal factor in the administration of justice. This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on the geography of crime and justice, offering insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to address spatial disparities in the criminal legal system."}
