{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted issue of land inequalities in the United States, focusing on the interplay between property rights, economic disparities, and environmental impacts across urban and rural landscapes. By analyzing historical and contemporary data, we explore how legal frameworks and economic policies have shaped land ownership patterns, contributing to significant disparities in wealth and access to resources. The research highlights the environmental consequences of these inequalities, including habitat destruction and resource depletion, and assesses the effectiveness of current laws in addressing these challenges. Through a comparative analysis of urban and rural areas, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the root causes and potential solutions to land inequalities, offering insights for policymakers, activists, and scholars interested in promoting more equitable and sustainable land use practices."}
