{"Abstract": "This study explores the social construction of age, emphasizing its multifaceted nature and the implications for research methodology and demographic analysis. By integrating perspectives from the life course, intersectionality, and social stratification, we examine how age is conceptualized and measured across different societal contexts. The research highlights the dynamic interplay between biological aging and social factors, such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status, which collectively shape the aging experience. Through a critical review of existing methodologies, we identify gaps in the measurement of age and propose innovative approaches that capture its complexity. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting an intersectional lens in demographic studies to better understand the diverse pathways of aging and their implications for policy and practice. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on aging by offering a comprehensive framework for the social construction of age, advocating for more nuanced and inclusive research methodologies."}
