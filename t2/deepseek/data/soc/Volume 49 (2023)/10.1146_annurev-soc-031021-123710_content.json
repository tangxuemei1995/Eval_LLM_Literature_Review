{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of White privilege and Whiteness through the lens of Critical Race Theory (CRT), aiming to confront, challenge, and rethink the pervasive structures of racial inequality. By analyzing the historical and contemporary manifestations of White privilege, the research seeks to uncover the mechanisms through which Whiteness operates as a normative power, often invisibly shaping societal norms, policies, and individual identities. Employing CRT as a theoretical framework, the paper critically examines the intersections of race, power, and privilege, advocating for a transformative approach to dismantle systemic racism. Through a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on race and inequality, offering insights into strategies for fostering a more equitable and inclusive society."}
