{"Abstract": "This study introduces the concept of Neighborhoodâ€“School Structures (NSS) as a novel framework for examining the intertwined effects of neighborhoods and schools on individual outcomes. Recognizing the limitations of studying these social contexts in isolation, NSS emphasizes the dynamic interplay between neighborhood and school environments, particularly in the context of segregation and its implications for educational and social equity. By integrating theories and methodologies from urban sociology, education, and social epidemiology, this research proposes a multidimensional approach to understanding how the characteristics of neighborhoods and schools jointly influence developmental trajectories. The paper outlines key dimensions of NSS, including demographic composition, resource availability, and social networks, and discusses their potential impacts on academic achievement, social mobility, and health outcomes. Through this lens, the study aims to advance the joint study of social contexts, offering new insights into the mechanisms of neighborhood and school effects and informing policy interventions aimed at reducing disparities."}
