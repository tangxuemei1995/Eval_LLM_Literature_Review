{"Abstract": "This study delves into the pervasive issue of social inequality within the high-tech industry, focusing on how gender, race, and ethnicity shape the dynamics of the world's most powerful sector. Through a comprehensive analysis of organizational structures, workplace practices, and venture capital funding patterns, we uncover the systemic barriers that marginalized groups face in accessing opportunities and advancing their careers. Our research highlights the underrepresentation of women and racial/ethnic minorities in leadership roles and technical positions, as well as the biases that influence hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. By examining the intersectionality of these social categories, we provide insights into the complex mechanisms that perpetuate inequality in high-tech organizations. The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion, ensuring that the high-tech industry reflects the diverse society it serves and benefits from the full spectrum of talent available."}
