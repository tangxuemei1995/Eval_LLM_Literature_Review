{"Abstract": "Ethnomethodology, since its inception, has profoundly influenced the landscape of social sciences, offering a unique lens through which to examine the intricacies of social order and interaction. This paper delves into the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology, tracing its evolution and its pivotal contributions to various fields such as conversation analysis, studies of science, organizations, workplace studies, instructed action, and the understanding of rules in social contexts. By scrutinizing the foundational principles of ethnomethodology, we explore how it has reshaped our comprehension of the mundane yet complex fabric of social life, emphasizing the importance of local practices and the situated nature of social order. Furthermore, this study highlights the ongoing relevance of ethnomethodology in contemporary research, particularly in its application to emerging areas of inquiry and its potential to address new challenges in understanding social phenomena. Through a critical review of existing literature and case studies, we aim to illuminate the enduring impact of ethnomethodology on social science research and its promising avenues for future exploration. This paper not only celebrates the rich legacy of ethnomethodology but also charts a course for its continued evolution and application in deciphering the ever-changing dynamics of social interaction and organization."}
