{"Abstract": "This study explores the paradoxical strength of weak ties within social networks, a concept pivotal to understanding information diffusion and social capital. By integrating computational social science methodologies with theoretical frameworks of structure versus agency, we investigate how weak ties, often perceived as less significant, can become conduits for novel information and opportunities, thereby strengthening social networks. Our analysis focuses on the role of bridging ties in facilitating connections across diverse groups, enhancing the diffusion of ideas and resources. Through empirical data and network simulations, we demonstrate that the strength of weak ties lies in their ability to connect disparate clusters, offering a unique perspective on the dynamics of social networks and the mechanisms underlying the diffusion of innovations."}
