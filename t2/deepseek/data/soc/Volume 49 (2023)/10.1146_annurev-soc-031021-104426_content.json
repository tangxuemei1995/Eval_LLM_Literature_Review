{"Abstract": "This paper embarks on a 60-year journey through the evolving landscape of comparative political economy, tracing the transition from the concept of embedded autonomy to the emergence of counter-hegemonic globalization. It explores the intricate dynamics of dependent development and the pivotal role of state-society synergy in shaping the developmental state. Through an autobiographical lens, the study delves into the transformative power of transnational advocacy networks in challenging hegemonic structures and fostering a more inclusive global economic order. By weaving together theoretical insights with personal experiences, this research offers a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms driving economic and political change across different contexts. It highlights the importance of adaptive strategies in navigating the complexities of global capitalism and underscores the potential for collective action in reimagining the contours of global governance."}
