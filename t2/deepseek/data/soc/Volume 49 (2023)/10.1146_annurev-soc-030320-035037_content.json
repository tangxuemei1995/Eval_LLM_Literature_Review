{"Abstract": "In an era marked by increasing polarization and the politicization of knowledge, the legitimacy of science has become a pivotal concern for public policy and cultural discourse. This study explores the multifaceted dimensions of scientific legitimacy, examining how it is constructed, contested, and maintained in the public sphere. By analyzing the interplay between scientific knowledge, societal values, and political agendas, the research sheds light on the challenges science faces in asserting its authority amidst divergent cultural narratives. The investigation draws on a comprehensive review of scientific literature, policy documents, and media representations to identify key factors that influence public trust in science. Findings suggest that the legitimacy of science is not solely dependent on its empirical rigor but is also shaped by its alignment with public interests, ethical considerations, and the transparency of its processes. The study concludes with recommendations for fostering a more inclusive and resilient scientific culture that can navigate the complexities of contemporary societal challenges."}
