{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of cross-border politics, focusing on the mobilization of diasporic communities and the corresponding responses of states. By examining the interplay between transnationalism, diaspora, and geopolitics, the research delves into how emigrant politics influence and are influenced by nationalism and homeland policies. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the paper analyzes case studies to understand the mechanisms through which diasporas engage in political activities across borders, and how states navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these transnational networks. The findings highlight the dual role of diasporas as both agents of change and subjects of state strategies, shedding light on the complex relationship between emigrant communities and their countries of origin. This research contributes to the broader discourse on global migration, nationalism, and the evolving nature of state sovereignty in an increasingly interconnected world."}
