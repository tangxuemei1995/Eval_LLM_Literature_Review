{"Abstract": "Biological invasions are a significant driver of global change, altering community composition and ecosystem functioning. This study explores the functional trait variation along animal invasion pathways, focusing on the interplay between physiological adaptations and phenotypic plasticity. By synthesizing data from diverse taxa, we identify key traits that enhance invasiveness, aligning with the 'ideal weed' concept. Our findings reveal that successful invaders often exhibit a combination of high reproductive rates, broad environmental tolerance, and efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, phenotypic plasticity emerges as a critical factor, enabling invaders to rapidly adjust to novel environments and outcompete native species. This research underscores the importance of integrating physiological and ecological perspectives to predict and manage biological invasions. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying trait variation, we provide insights into the dynamics of invasive species and their impacts on community ecology, offering a foundation for developing targeted conservation strategies."}
