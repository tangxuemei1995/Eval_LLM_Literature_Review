{"Abstract": "Terrestrial phosphorus (P) cycling plays a crucial role in ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration, yet its responses to climatic change remain poorly understood. This study synthesizes findings from forest, grassland, and tundra ecosystems to explore how climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation influence P availability and cycling. Through a combination of field experiments and modeling approaches, we investigate the mechanisms by which climatic change may exacerbate or alleviate P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. Our results indicate that increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns can significantly affect P cycling processes, including mineralization, leaching, and plant uptake. In forests, warming may enhance P mineralization rates, potentially alleviating P limitation. Conversely, in grasslands and tundras, changes in precipitation regimes could lead to increased P leaching, exacerbating P limitation. This research underscores the importance of incorporating P cycling dynamics into climate change models to predict future ecosystem responses accurately. Our findings highlight the need for targeted experiments and long-term monitoring to better understand and mitigate the impacts of climatic change on terrestrial P cycling."}
