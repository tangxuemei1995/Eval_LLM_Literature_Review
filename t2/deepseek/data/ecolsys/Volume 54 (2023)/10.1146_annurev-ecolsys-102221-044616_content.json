{"Abstract": "Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for the study of pollination ecology, a critical mutualistic interaction that underpins biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research explores the dynamics of pollinator communities within cities, focusing on the interplay between urban landscapes and the dispersal patterns of pollinators. By examining the connectivity of green spaces and the structure of pollination networks, we aim to understand how urban planning and design can enhance or hinder pollinator movement and plant-pollinator interactions. Our findings suggest that despite the fragmentation of habitats, cities can support diverse pollinator assemblages through the strategic placement of green infrastructure, which facilitates dispersal and maintains network resilience. This study underscores the importance of integrating ecological principles into urban development to sustain pollination services, highlighting the potential for cities to act as refuges for pollinators in an increasingly human-dominated world."}
