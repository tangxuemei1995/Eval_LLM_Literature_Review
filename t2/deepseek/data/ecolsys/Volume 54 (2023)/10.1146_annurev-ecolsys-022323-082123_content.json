{"Abstract": "Marine ecosystems are increasingly subjected to the dual pressures of climate change and extreme weather events, such as marine heatwaves. This study explores the ecological implications of temperature variability, distinguishing between smooth (mean temperature changes) and spiky (heatwave events) patterns, on marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We investigate the role of depth refuges in buffering species against thermal stress, the capacity for acclimation to fluctuating temperatures, and the legacy effects of past thermal events on current ecological resilience. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both mean temperature shifts and variability in predicting the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. By integrating data from field observations, laboratory experiments, and modeling approaches, we provide a comprehensive understanding of how variability in thermal regimes influences species survival, community composition, and ecosystem services, offering critical insights for conservation and management strategies in the face of global climate change."}
