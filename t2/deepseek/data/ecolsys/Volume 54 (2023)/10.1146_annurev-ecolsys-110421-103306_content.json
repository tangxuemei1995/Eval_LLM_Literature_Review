{"Abstract": "The study of Anolis lizards has provided profound insights into the mechanisms of evolution and adaptive radiation, particularly within the biodiverse ecosystems of the Caribbean. This research delves into the evolutionary trajectories of anoles, highlighting their remarkable adaptability and the ecological dynamics that have shaped their diversification. By examining the genetic, morphological, and ecological variations among Anolis species, this study sheds light on the processes driving speciation and adaptation in response to environmental pressures. Furthermore, it explores the impact of the Anthropocene on these evolutionary patterns, considering the challenges posed by habitat alteration, climate change, and invasive species. The findings underscore the importance of Anolis lizards as a model system for understanding evolutionary biology, offering new perspectives on the resilience and vulnerability of species in rapidly changing environments. This research contributes to the broader discourse on conservation biology and the sustainable management of biodiversity in the face of global environmental change."}
