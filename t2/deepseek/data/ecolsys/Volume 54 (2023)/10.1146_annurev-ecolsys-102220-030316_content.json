{"Abstract": "This study explores the role of background acoustics in terrestrial ecosystems, focusing on its impact on animal behavior and community ecology. By analyzing the direct and indirect effects of soundscapes on species interactions, we investigate how acoustic environments influence communication, predator-prey dynamics, and habitat selection. Special attention is given to the phenomenon of auditory masking, where background noise interferes with the detection of biologically significant sounds, potentially altering species' survival strategies. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we aim to elucidate the complex interplay between acoustic conditions and ecological processes. Our findings highlight the importance of considering soundscapes in conservation planning and ecosystem management, suggesting that changes in acoustic environments can have profound implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This research underscores the need for further studies to understand the ecological consequences of anthropogenic noise and to develop strategies for mitigating its impact on terrestrial wildlife."}
