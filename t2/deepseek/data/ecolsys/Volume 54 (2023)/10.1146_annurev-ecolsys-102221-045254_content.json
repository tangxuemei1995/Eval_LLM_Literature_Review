{"Abstract": "The evolutionary ecology of plant chemical defenses represents a critical interface between molecular biology and community ecology, offering insights into the mechanisms driving biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics. This study explores the role of plant secondary metabolites in mediating plantâ€“herbivore interactions, emphasizing their contribution to defense evolution and community assembly. By synthesizing recent findings from molecular to community levels, we highlight how chemical diversity underpins the complexity of ecological networks and influences species coexistence. Our analysis reveals that the evolutionary trajectories of plant chemical defenses are shaped by a dynamic interplay between selective pressures from herbivores and the ecological context of plant communities. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these interactions for the maintenance of biodiversity and the resilience of ecosystems to environmental changes. This research underscores the importance of integrating molecular and ecological perspectives to advance our understanding of the evolutionary ecology of plant chemical defenses and their role in shaping the structure and function of ecological communities."}
