{"Abstract": "Amphibians exhibit a remarkable diversity in parental care strategies, offering unique insights into the evolution of caregiving behaviors across species. This study explores how fertilization mode, terrestriality, and the necessity for protection, transport, and nutrition influence the development of parental care in amphibians. By examining the interplay between these factors, we uncover the evolutionary pressures that shape parental sex roles and care strategies. Our findings suggest that the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments has significantly impacted the evolution of parental care, with terrestriality favoring the development of more complex care behaviors. Furthermore, the mode of fertilization—external or internal—plays a critical role in determining which parent assumes caregiving responsibilities. This research highlights the importance of amphibians as a model for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of parental care, shedding light on the adaptive significance of these behaviors in ensuring offspring survival and reproductive success."}
