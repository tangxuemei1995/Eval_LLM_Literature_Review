{"Abstract": "South Florida stands as a global epicenter for biological invasions, hosting an unparalleled diversity of non-native species. This study delves into the intricate patterns of introduction, spread, and ecological impact of these species within this ecologically unique region. Leveraging a comprehensive review of existing literature and field observations, we explore the mechanisms driving the success of invasive species, including the empty niche hypothesis and the role of biological control efforts. Our analysis highlights the pathways of species introduction, ranging from accidental transport to intentional release for pest management, and examines the factors facilitating their establishment and proliferation. Furthermore, we assess the ecological consequences of these invasions, focusing on biodiversity loss, ecosystem function alteration, and the challenges of eradication. This research underscores the urgent need for integrated management strategies to mitigate the impacts of invasive species in South Florida, offering insights that are critical for conservation efforts in this and other vulnerable ecoregions worldwide."}
