{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has provided unprecedented insights into the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). This respiratory infection, originating as a zoonotic disease, underscores the critical role of spillover events from wildlife to humans in the emergence of pathogens. The rapid global spread of COVID-19 highlights the influence of social behavior on disease transmission and the challenges in implementing effective disease control measures. Furthermore, the evolution of virulence in SARS-CoV-2, observed through the emergence of variants with increased transmissibility, offers a real-time case study of pathogen adaptation. This pandemic emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach to understand and mitigate the risks of EIDs, integrating ecological, evolutionary, and social perspectives to inform public health strategies and prevent future outbreaks."}
