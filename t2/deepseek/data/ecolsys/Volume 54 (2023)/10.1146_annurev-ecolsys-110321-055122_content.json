{"Abstract": "Large Old World fruit bats, particularly those of the genus Pteropus, commonly known as flying foxes, are facing unprecedented threats leading to their rapid decline and potential extinction. These keystone species play a crucial role in the pollination of native plants and the dispersal of seeds, thereby maintaining the ecological balance and biodiversity of their habitats. However, factors such as habitat destruction, hunting, and the impacts of climate change are significantly contributing to their vulnerability. Island conservation efforts are increasingly critical, as many Pteropus species are endemic to specific islands, making them more susceptible to extinction. This paper explores the causes behind the decline of these fruit bats, emphasizing the consequences of their potential extinction on ecosystem health and biodiversity. It also discusses the importance of implementing targeted conservation strategies to mitigate these threats and ensure the survival of these vital species."}
