{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of terrestrial communities by integrating the principles of conservation paleobiology, with a particular focus on the Anthropocene epoch. By analyzing fossil records and contemporary biodiversity data, we aim to uncover patterns of ecosystem responses to environmental stressors over geological timescales. Our research highlights the critical role of paleontological evidence in understanding current biodiversity crises and in forecasting future ecological trajectories. Through a comprehensive review of fossil assemblages and their ecological contexts, we identify key stressors that have historically impacted terrestrial ecosystems, including climate change, habitat destruction, and invasive species. This retrospective analysis not only enriches our comprehension of past ecological shifts but also provides invaluable insights for developing robust conservation strategies. Ultimately, our findings underscore the importance of a deep-time perspective in addressing the pressing environmental challenges of the Anthropocene, advocating for a holistic approach that bridges paleobiology and contemporary conservation science."}
