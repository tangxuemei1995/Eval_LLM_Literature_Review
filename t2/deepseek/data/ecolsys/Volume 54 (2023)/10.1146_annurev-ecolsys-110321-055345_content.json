{"Abstract": "Density-dependent selection plays a pivotal role in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of populations by influencing the fitness of individuals in response to population density. This study explores the intricate dynamics of density-dependent selection, focusing on its interaction with age structure, norms of reaction, and the mechanisms of population regulation. By examining the contrasting strategies of r-selection and K-selection, we elucidate how organisms adapt to varying environmental pressures and resource availability. Our analysis reveals that density-dependent selection not only affects the life history traits of organisms but also drives the evolution of phenotypic plasticity through norms of reaction. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of age structure in modulating the intensity and direction of selection pressures, thereby influencing population dynamics and stability. This research underscores the complexity of density-dependent selection in natural populations and provides insights into the evolutionary processes that govern population regulation and adaptation."}
