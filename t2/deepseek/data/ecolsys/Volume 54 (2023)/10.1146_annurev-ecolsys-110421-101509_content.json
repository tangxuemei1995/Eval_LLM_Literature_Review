{"Abstract": "The quest to understand the origin of life is one of the most profound challenges in science, intertwining chemistry, biology, and geology. This study explores the hypothesis that life's emergence was guided by its own biochemical processes, focusing on key elements such as CO2 fixation, the formation of protocells, and the development of metabolism. Central to this investigation is the role of FeS clusters in catalyzing early metabolic reactions and the proton-motive force in energy transduction, which may have been pivotal in the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry. Additionally, the RNA world hypothesis and the emergence of the genetic code are examined as critical milestones in the evolution of life. By synthesizing recent findings, this research aims to shed light on how life's inherent properties could have directed its own origins, offering new insights into the fundamental principles that govern the transition from non-living to living matter."}
