{"Abstract": "This study investigates the response of deep soil organic carbon (SOC) to global change factors, including climate change, elevated CO2 levels, and land use and land cover change (LULCC). Deep SOC, a critical component of the global carbon cycle, has been understudied despite its significant role in carbon sequestration and climate regulation. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of long-term soil carbon data, we assess how changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and land management practices influence deep SOC stocks. Our findings reveal that while elevated CO2 can enhance carbon inputs to deep soils through increased plant productivity, climate change and LULCC may lead to substantial carbon losses due to enhanced decomposition rates and soil disturbance. This research underscores the importance of incorporating deep SOC dynamics into global carbon models to improve predictions of carbon-climate feedbacks and inform sustainable land management strategies."}
