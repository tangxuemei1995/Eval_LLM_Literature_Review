{"Abstract": "Sky islands, isolated mountain habitats surrounded by radically different lowland environments, serve as natural laboratories for studying the ecological and evolutionary impacts of climate change. These unique ecosystems, characterized by their high levels of endemism and genetic variation, offer critical insights into the processes of convergent evolution and the persistence of relict populations under changing climatic conditions. By examining the adaptive responses of species within sky islands, researchers can predict broader ecological and evolutionary trends in the face of global warming. This study synthesizes findings from sky islands worldwide to highlight their role as predictive tools for understanding biodiversity dynamics. The findings underscore the importance of conserving these habitats not only for their intrinsic ecological value but also for their utility in forecasting the future of biodiversity in a rapidly changing world."}
