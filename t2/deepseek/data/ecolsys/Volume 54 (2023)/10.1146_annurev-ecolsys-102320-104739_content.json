{"Abstract": "Seed dispersal is a fundamental ecological process that influences plant population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. This study explores the causes and consequences of seed dispersal, integrating insights from dispersal processes, dispersal syndromes, and the movement ecology paradigm. We employ a generalized gravity framework to model dispersal patterns, emphasizing the role of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping seed movement. The concept of 'seedscape' is introduced to encapsulate the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of dispersal environments. Our analysis highlights the importance of seed dispersal effectiveness in determining plant fitness and biodiversity patterns. By synthesizing empirical data and theoretical models, this research advances our understanding of dispersal mechanisms and their ecological implications, offering new perspectives for conservation and ecosystem management strategies."}
