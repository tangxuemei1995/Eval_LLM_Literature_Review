{"Abstract": "In the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions, understanding the dynamics of novel disturbance regimes and their ecological responses has become paramount. This study delves into the intricate interplay between resilience, recovery, and succession processes in ecosystems subjected to unprecedented disturbances. By examining response traits across various species and communities, we identify key thresholds that signify shifts in ecosystem states. Our findings underscore the importance of adaptive management strategies in mitigating the impacts of these disturbances, ensuring ecosystem functionality and biodiversity conservation. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and case studies, we propose a framework for predicting ecological responses to novel disturbances, facilitating the development of proactive management practices. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on ecosystem resilience, offering insights into the mechanisms that underpin recovery and succession in the context of global environmental change."}
