{"Abstract": "The evolution of cetaceans represents a remarkable adaptation to aquatic life, with significant implications for understanding the ecophysiological drivers and limits of foraging behaviors such as diving, feasting, and fasting. This study explores the interplay between body size, scaling, and gigantism in shaping the foraging strategies of whales, focusing on the physiological adaptations that enable deep diving and prolonged fasting. By synthesizing data from extant and fossil cetaceans, we examine how predator-prey dynamics have influenced the evolution of gigantism and the development of specialized foraging techniques. Our findings highlight the critical role of energy acquisition and expenditure in the evolution of cetacean body size, suggesting that the ecological niches occupied by these marine giants are a direct result of their ability to exploit deep-sea resources efficiently. This research provides new insights into the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the largest animals on Earth, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding the ecophysiological limits of foraging in cetaceans."}
