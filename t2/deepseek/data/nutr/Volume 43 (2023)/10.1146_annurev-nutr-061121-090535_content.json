{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between diet and disease has long been a focal point of nutritional science, yet the complexity of these interactions often eludes traditional analytical methods. This study explores the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly neural networks, in unraveling the nuanced connections between dietary patterns and disease outcomes. By leveraging AI's capacity for processing vast datasets and identifying subtle patterns, we present case studies that demonstrate its efficacy in advancing precision and personalized nutrition. Our findings underscore AI's role in facilitating a deeper understanding of dietâ€“disease relationships, enabling the development of tailored dietary recommendations that could significantly impact public health. This research highlights the synergy between AI and nutritional science, paving the way for innovative approaches to disease prevention and management through diet."}
