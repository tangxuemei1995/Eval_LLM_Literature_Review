{"Abstract": "Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes beyond its traditional association with bone metabolism. This review highlights the multifaceted functions of osteocalcin, particularly its undercarboxylated form, which has emerged as a significant regulator of energy metabolism. It influences glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and sensitivity, thereby linking bone health with energy regulation. Furthermore, recent studies have unveiled its role as a danger repellent, protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation. The intricate mechanisms through which osteocalcin exerts these effects underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders and bone-related diseases, offering new insights into the bone-endocrine axis."}
