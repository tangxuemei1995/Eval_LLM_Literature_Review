{"Abstract": "Serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a pivotal role in various metabolic pathways, serving as a precursor for the synthesis of glycine, cysteine, and other critical biomolecules. This review explores the intricate balance of serine sources and sinks within the human body, emphasizing its significance in nutrition, health, and disease. Through the lens of metabolic flux analysis and metabolomics, we delve into the dynamic regulation of serine metabolism and its implications for conditions such as neuropathy and diabetes. The synthesis and degradation of serine are tightly regulated, with dietary intake, biosynthesis, and inter-organ transport contributing to its homeostasis. Disruptions in serine metabolism have been linked to a range of pathological states, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of its metabolic pathways. This abstract underscores the importance of serine in maintaining metabolic balance and its potential as a therapeutic target in disease management."}
