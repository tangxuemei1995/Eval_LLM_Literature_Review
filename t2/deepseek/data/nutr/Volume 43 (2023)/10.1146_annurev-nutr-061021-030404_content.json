{"Abstract": "Iron homeostasis during pregnancy is a complex process that involves intricate regulatory mechanisms to ensure adequate iron supply for both the mother and the developing fetus. This review explores the roles of maternal, placental, and fetal systems in maintaining iron balance, with a focus on the hormone hepcidin, which is a central regulator of iron metabolism. During pregnancy, maternal hepcidin levels are typically suppressed to enhance iron absorption and mobilization, facilitating iron transfer to the fetus. The placenta plays a critical role in this process, acting as a selective barrier and transporter of iron. Disruptions in these regulatory mechanisms can lead to iron deficiency, which is a common nutritional deficiency in pregnancy and can have significant implications for maternal and fetal health. Additionally, inflammation can alter iron homeostasis, complicating the management of iron status during pregnancy. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective interventions to prevent and treat iron deficiency in pregnant women."}
