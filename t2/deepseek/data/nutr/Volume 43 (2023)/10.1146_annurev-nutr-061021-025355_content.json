{"Abstract": "The microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) plays a pivotal role in the early development of infants, influencing both physical and mental health outcomes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how maternal and infant nutrition impact the development of the MGBA. Key nutritional components, including milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics, are examined for their roles in shaping the infant gut microbiota and, consequently, the MGBA. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is highlighted as a critical factor that can modulate the composition of the infant gut microbiota, with implications for neurodevelopment and immune system maturation. The review also explores the potential of dietary interventions in infancy to support a healthy MGBA, emphasizing the importance of breastfeeding and the strategic use of nutritional supplements. By integrating findings from recent studies, this abstract underscores the significance of early nutritional strategies in promoting optimal development of the MGBA, offering insights for future research and clinical practice."}
