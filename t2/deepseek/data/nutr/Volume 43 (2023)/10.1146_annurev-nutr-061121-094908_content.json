{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between diet and the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, influencing the gutâ€“brain axis, inflammation, and metabolic processes. This review explores the dynamic relationship between dietary components and microbial communities, highlighting how dietary patterns can modulate the gut microbiota composition and function, thereby impacting host health. We delve into the mechanisms by which diet-induced changes in the microbiome contribute to GI disorders, including alterations in microbial fermentation products and metabolomic profiles. Furthermore, we discuss emerging microbiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions, aimed at restoring microbial balance and alleviating GI symptoms. By integrating findings from recent studies, this review underscores the potential of dietary strategies and microbiome modulation as therapeutic avenues for managing GI disorders, offering insights into personalized nutrition approaches based on individual microbiome profiles."}
