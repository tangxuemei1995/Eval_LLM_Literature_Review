{"Abstract": "Child undernutrition remains a critical global health challenge, manifesting primarily as stunting and wasting, with profound implications for physical and cognitive development. Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in mediating the effects of undernutrition, highlighting a complex interplay between dietary intake, microbial communities, and host physiology. This study delves into the mechanisms by which malnourished microbes contribute to the pathophysiology of child undernutrition, focusing on alterations in microbial diversity, metabolic functions, and immune modulation. By integrating findings from clinical studies and animal models, we explore how dysbiosis exacerbates nutrient malabsorption and systemic inflammation, thereby perpetuating the cycle of undernutrition. Furthermore, this research evaluates the potential of microbiome-targeted interventions, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiota transplantation, in restoring microbial balance and improving nutritional outcomes. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift towards microbiome-informed strategies in combating child undernutrition, offering new avenues for therapeutic innovation and public health policy."}
