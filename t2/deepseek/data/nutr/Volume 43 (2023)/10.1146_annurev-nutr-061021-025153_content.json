{"Abstract": "Precision nutrition has emerged as a promising approach to tailor dietary recommendations to individual characteristics, aiming to optimize health outcomes and prevent chronic diseases. However, the enthusiasm surrounding precision nutrition often surpasses the current scientific evidence and evidentiary standards required to inform public health recommendations. This review critically examines the state of the science in precision nutrition, focusing on the interplay between nutrient requirements, biological variation, and the development of nutrition policy. We highlight the gaps in research that need to be addressed to ensure that precision nutrition can be effectively integrated into public health strategies. The discussion underscores the importance of rigorous scientific validation and the establishment of robust evidentiary standards before precision nutrition can be widely adopted for the prevention of chronic disease. This analysis calls for a balanced approach that combines the potential of precision nutrition with the foundational principles of public health nutrition."}
