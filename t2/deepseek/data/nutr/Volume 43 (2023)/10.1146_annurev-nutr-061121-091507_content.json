{"Abstract": "Gluconeogenesis, a critical metabolic pathway, plays a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, especially under fasting conditions. This process, however, is intricately linked with various metabolic diseases, including insulin resistance and enzyme deficiencies, which can significantly alter its flux. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between hormones and gluconeogenesis, revealing how hormonal imbalances can exacerbate metabolic disorders. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a connection between altered gluconeogenesis flux and cancer metabolism, indicating potential therapeutic targets. This review aims to explore the mechanisms by which gluconeogenesis flux is regulated in the context of metabolic disease, the impact of hormonal regulation, and the implications of enzyme deficiencies. Additionally, it will discuss the emerging role of gluconeogenesis in cancer metabolism, providing insights into novel intervention strategies for metabolic and oncological diseases."}
