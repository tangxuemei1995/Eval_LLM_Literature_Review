{"Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of liver disorders, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. The pathogenesis of NAFLD involves complex interactions between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have emerged as potential therapeutic agents due to their anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties. This review explores the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids modulate hepatic lipid metabolism, reduce inflammation, and prevent fibrosis in NAFLD. Clinical studies suggest that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids can improve liver enzyme levels, reduce hepatic steatosis, and attenuate the progression of NASH. However, the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing fibrosis and cirrhosis remains under investigation. This abstract highlights the potential of omega-3 fatty acids as a therapeutic strategy in NAFLD, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize dosing regimens and understand long-term outcomes."}
