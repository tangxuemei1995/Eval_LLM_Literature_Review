{"Abstract": "Nutrition security, an extension of food security, emphasizes the importance of access to not just sufficient food, but to nutritious food that supports a healthy dietary intake and positive health outcomes. This study aims to assess and monitor the state of nutrition security in the United States, identifying key factors that influence dietary quality and health disparities among different populations. By analyzing existing data on food access, dietary patterns, and health outcomes, alongside conducting surveys and interviews with diverse communities, this research seeks to uncover the barriers to achieving nutrition security. Furthermore, it evaluates the effectiveness of current policies and programs designed to improve dietary intake and health outcomes. The findings will contribute to the development of targeted interventions and strategies to enhance nutrition security, thereby promoting healthier dietary practices and reducing health disparities across the United States. This study underscores the critical need for a comprehensive approach to monitoring and addressing nutrition security as a fundamental component of public health."}
