{"Abstract": "The placenta serves as a critical maternofetal interface, facilitating essential physiological exchanges between mother and fetus. This organ's unique structure, particularly the syncytiotrophoblast layer, plays a pivotal role in nutrient and gas exchange, waste removal, and endocrine functions. The placenta supports fetal development through two primary nutritional pathways: histiotrophic nutrition, which involves the uptake of maternal secretions and cellular debris, and hemotrophic nutrition, characterized by the direct transfer of nutrients and gases from maternal blood to fetal circulation. Nutrient transporters within the placenta are crucial for the selective transfer of substances, ensuring fetal growth and development. Additionally, placental mosaicism, the presence of two or more cell populations with different chromosomal constitutions, can impact placental function and fetal health. Understanding the complex mechanisms of placental function and pathology is essential for improving pregnancy outcomes and addressing complications related to placental dysfunction."}
