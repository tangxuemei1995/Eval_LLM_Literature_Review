{"Abstract": "The mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) represent a crucial family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins that play pivotal roles in lipid metabolism and transport. These proteins facilitate the solubilization and intracellular trafficking of fatty acids and other lipophilic substances, thereby influencing various cellular processes including energy homeostasis, signaling pathways, and gene expression regulation. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of FABPs in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a link between FABPs and cancer progression, with certain FABP isoforms being implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the multifunctional roles of FABPs in health and disease, with a particular focus on their contributions to lipid metabolism, metabolic diseases, and cancer, thereby offering insights into their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets."}
