{"Abstract": "Riboflavin, a crucial water-soluble vitamin, plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism and cellular function. Deficiency in riboflavin, often assessed through the Erythrocyte Glutathione Reductase Activation Coefficient (EGRac), can lead to significant clinical sequelae, including anemia and hypertension. This review explores the causes of riboflavin deficiency, ranging from inadequate dietary intake to impaired absorption and increased metabolic demand. Furthermore, it examines the relationship between riboflavin status and its impact on health outcomes, particularly focusing on the mechanisms by which deficiency contributes to the development of anemia and hypertension. The importance of adhering to dietary reference intakes for riboflavin is highlighted, emphasizing the need for public health strategies to prevent deficiency and its associated health risks. This synthesis of current literature aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of riboflavin's role in human health and the consequences of its deficiency."}
