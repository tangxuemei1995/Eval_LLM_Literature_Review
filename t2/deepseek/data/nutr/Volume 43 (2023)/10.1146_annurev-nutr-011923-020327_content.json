{"Abstract": "The utilization of dietary supplements has become increasingly prevalent in the pursuit of health and the management of disease. Despite their widespread use, significant gaps remain in our understanding of their efficacy, safety, and the methodologies employed to assess their impact. This review highlights the critical issues surrounding the validity and reproducibility of studies on dietary supplements, emphasizing the challenges posed by dietary assessment techniques and measurement errors. Current methodologies often fail to accurately capture the complex interactions between supplements, diet, and health outcomes, leading to inconsistent findings and a lack of consensus in the field. Furthermore, the variability in supplement composition, dosage, and bioavailability adds another layer of complexity to research efforts. Addressing these methodological shortcomings is essential for advancing our knowledge and ensuring that recommendations regarding dietary supplement use are based on robust, reliable evidence. This paper calls for a concerted effort to refine dietary assessment tools, standardize research protocols, and enhance the reproducibility of studies to bridge the existing gaps in our understanding of dietary supplements in health and disease."}
