{"Abstract": "The inflammasome complex plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response by orchestrating the activation of inflammatory caspases, such as caspase-1 and caspase-8, leading to the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This process is crucial for host defense against microbial infections and is regulated by various NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Recent studies have highlighted the intricate interplay between bacterial pathogens and inflammasome signaling, where bacteria can either collaborate with or counteract the host's immune mechanisms. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms by which bacterial influencers modulate inflammasome activation, focusing on the roles of caspase-1, caspase-8, gasdermin proteins, and NLRs. Understanding these interactions provides insights into the dual role of bacteria in inflammasome signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases and bacterial infections."}
