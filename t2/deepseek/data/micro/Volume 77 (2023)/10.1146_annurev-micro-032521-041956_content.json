{"Abstract": "The assembly of microbial communities in fermented foods is a complex process influenced by a myriad of factors including raw materials, environmental conditions, and human practices. This study delves into the microbiome dynamics within three distinct fermented food categories: cheese, sourdough, and fermented vegetables. By employing high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, we unravel the intricate patterns of microbial succession and interaction that underpin the fermentation process. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of starter cultures and indigenous microbiota in shaping the microbial landscape, which in turn, dictates the sensory and safety attributes of the final product. Furthermore, we explore the impact of artisanal versus industrial production methods on microbiome assembly, revealing significant differences in microbial diversity and functionality. This research not only advances our understanding of microbial ecology in fermented foods but also provides valuable insights for optimizing fermentation processes to enhance product quality and safety."}
