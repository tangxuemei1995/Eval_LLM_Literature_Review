{"Abstract": "Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are complex communities of microorganisms that play a pivotal role in the biogeochemistry of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Dominated by cyanobacteria, these crusts are integral to soil stabilization, water retention, and nutrient cycling, particularly in extreme environments where vascular plant growth is limited. This study delves into the microbial composition of BSCs, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of cyanobacteria to desiccation and UV radiation. Through a comprehensive analysis of microbial diversity and function, we explore the mechanisms by which BSCs contribute to carbon and nitrogen fixation, thereby influencing soil fertility and ecosystem productivity. Furthermore, the research sheds light on the ecological significance of BSCs in mitigating soil erosion and supporting biodiversity in arid lands. By integrating field observations with molecular techniques, this investigation provides insights into the microbial dynamics of BSCs and their potential applications in ecological restoration and sustainable land management practices."}
