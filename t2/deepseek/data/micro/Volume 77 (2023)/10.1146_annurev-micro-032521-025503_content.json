{"Abstract": "Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) are sophisticated molecular machines employed by bacteria for the delivery of effector proteins into host cells, playing pivotal roles in bacterial pathogenesis and symbiosis. This study delves into the structural intricacies of T3SS within the bacterial flagellum and injectisome, utilizing cutting-edge cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques. Our findings reveal the conserved architecture and dynamic mechanisms underlying these systems, highlighting the remarkable adaptability of T3SS in facilitating bacterial motility and virulence. Through high-resolution imaging, we uncover novel structural features and conformational changes that occur during the secretion process, offering insights into the molecular basis of T3SS function. This research not only advances our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis but also opens new avenues for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections."}
