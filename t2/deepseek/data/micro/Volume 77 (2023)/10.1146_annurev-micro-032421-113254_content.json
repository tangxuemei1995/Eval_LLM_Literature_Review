{"Abstract": "The early fossil record of eukaryotes presents a complex puzzle, with interpretations often hindered by the scarcity and ambiguous nature of Precambrian fossils. This study reviews current frameworks for interpreting these ancient remains, focusing on the Proterozoic eon, a critical period for eukaryogenesis. We explore the impact of the Great Oxidation Event on eukaryotic evolution, considering how increased atmospheric oxygen levels may have facilitated the emergence and diversification of eukaryotes. By integrating paleontological, geochemical, and molecular data, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to decipher the early history of eukaryotes. Our analysis highlights the importance of distinguishing between biogenic and non-biogenic structures in the fossil record and underscores the need for refined dating techniques to better understand the timing and environmental context of eukaryotic origins. This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of early eukaryotic evolution and its environmental drivers."}
