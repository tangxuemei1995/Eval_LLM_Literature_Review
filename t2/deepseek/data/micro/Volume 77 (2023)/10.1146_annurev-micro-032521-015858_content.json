{"Abstract": "Candida auris has emerged as a significant global health threat due to its multidrug resistance and ability to cause outbreaks in healthcare settings. This study delves into the genetic underpinnings of C. auris's emergence, focusing on its resistance mechanisms against major antifungal classes, including azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins. Through comprehensive genomic analysis, we identified key mutations in genes associated with drug efflux pumps, cell wall biosynthesis, and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, which collectively contribute to its formidable resistance profile. Our findings highlight the role of genetic plasticity in facilitating rapid adaptation to antifungal pressures, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. This research provides critical insights into the evolutionary dynamics of C. auris, offering a foundation for targeted interventions to curb its spread and mitigate its impact on public health."}
