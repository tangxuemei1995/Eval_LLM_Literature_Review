{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate mechanisms of extracellular electron transfer (EET) in electroactive bacteria, specifically focusing on Shewanella and Geobacter species. These microorganisms are renowned for their ability to transfer electrons beyond their outer membrane to external acceptors, a process pivotal for bioelectrochemical systems and environmental bioremediation. Central to this process are multiheme cytochromes and electron shuttles, which facilitate electron transport across the cell envelope to insoluble substrates. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we explore the structural and functional aspects of these cytochromes, alongside the role of soluble electron shuttles in enhancing EET efficiency. Our findings highlight the evolutionary adaptations that enable these bacteria to thrive in diverse environments, from metal-rich sediments to bioelectrochemical reactors. This research underscores the potential of harnessing EET mechanisms for sustainable energy production and environmental cleanup, offering insights into the optimization of bioelectrochemical systems for future applications."}
