{"Abstract": "Wolbachia, a genus of intracellular bacteria, induces cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in arthropods, a phenomenon that results in embryonic lethality when an infected male mates with an uninfected female. This study delves into the molecular mechanisms underpinning CI, focusing on the roles of Wolbachia-encoded proteins, including nucleases, deubiquitylases, and toxins, in manipulating host cellular processes. We explore the hypothesis that these proteins interfere with the normal function of host factors essential for embryonic development, leading to CI. Additionally, the investigation sheds light on the potential involvement of these molecular players in other Wolbachia-induced reproductive manipulations, such as male killing. By integrating findings from genetic, biochemical, and structural analyses, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular biology of CI, offering insights into the evolutionary dynamics of Wolbachia-host interactions and the potential application of Wolbachia in controlling arthropod-borne diseases."}
