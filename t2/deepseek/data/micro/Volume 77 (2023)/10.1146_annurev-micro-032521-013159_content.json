{"Abstract": "The Brucella cell envelope, a critical component of this Alphaproteobacteria genus, plays a pivotal role in its survival and pathogenicity as an intracellular pathogen causing zoonosis. Brucella species, being gram-negative bacteria, possess a complex cell envelope structure that includes an outer membrane, a periplasmic space containing a thin peptidoglycan layer, and an inner membrane. This unique architecture is essential for the bacterium's ability to evade host immune responses and establish chronic infections. The outer membrane, rich in lipopolysaccharides (LPS), is particularly noteworthy for its low endotoxic activity, which contributes to the stealthy nature of Brucella infections. Furthermore, the cell envelope's components are involved in various virulence mechanisms, including adhesion, invasion, and intracellular replication within host cells. Understanding the molecular composition and functional dynamics of the Brucella cell envelope is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat brucellosis, a disease with significant implications for both animal and human health."}
