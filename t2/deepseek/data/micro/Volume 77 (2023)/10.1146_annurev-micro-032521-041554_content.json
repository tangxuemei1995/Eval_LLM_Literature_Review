{"Abstract": "Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, remains a significant global health challenge. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have unveiled the complex epigenetic landscape and chromatin architecture that govern the parasite's life cycle and virulence. This study delves into the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in epigenetic regulation and chromatin remodeling within Plasmodium species. By integrating single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we identify key lncRNAs that modulate gene expression and chromatin state, influencing parasite development and host immune evasion. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between lncRNAs and chromatin architecture, offering novel insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying malaria pathogenesis. This research paves the way for the development of epigenetic-based therapeutic strategies targeting the unique regulatory networks of Plasmodium parasites."}
