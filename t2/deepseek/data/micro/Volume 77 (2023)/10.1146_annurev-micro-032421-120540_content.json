{"Abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, exhibit unique mitochondrial properties that distinguish them from their host organisms. These Myzozoa possess a highly reduced mitochondrial genome and rely on a streamlined electron transport chain (ETC) for energy production. Notably, the ATP synthase complex in these parasites has evolved distinct structural and functional characteristics, which are crucial for their survival and proliferation. The ETC components, including cytochrome bc1 complex and alternative oxidase, present potential targets for antiparasitic drug development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these unique mitochondrial features not only sheds light on the evolutionary adaptations of Apicomplexa but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the peculiarities of Apicomplexan mitochondria, focusing on their ATP synthase and electron transport complexes, and discusses the implications for designing novel antiparasitic strategies."}
