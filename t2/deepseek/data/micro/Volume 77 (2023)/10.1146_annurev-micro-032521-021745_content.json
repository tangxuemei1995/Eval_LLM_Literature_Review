{"Abstract": "Recent studies have significantly advanced our understanding of how human fungal pathogens respond to hypoxia, a condition of low oxygen availability, during disease progression. This response is crucial for fungal survival and virulence in host tissues, where oxygen levels are often limited. Research has highlighted the role of hypoxia in modulating fungal pathogenicity, including the regulation of genes involved in virulence and the adaptation to host immune responses. Furthermore, insights into the hypoxia response mechanisms have opened new avenues for the development of antifungal drugs, targeting the unique adaptations of fungi to low oxygen environments, thereby offering promising strategies to combat fungal infections."}
