{"Abstract": "The study of habitat transition in the evolution of Bacteria and Archaea offers profound insights into microbial evolution, dispersal, and adaptation mechanisms. This research focuses on the dynamic processes that enable these microorganisms to colonize new environments, highlighting the role of genetic and phenotypic adaptations. Special attention is given to the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria, a group characterized by their small genomes and unique metabolic capabilities, which have undergone significant habitat transitions. Additionally, the evolution of the human microbiome is examined as a case study of microbial adaptation to host-associated environments. By integrating findings from environmental microbiology, this study aims to elucidate the evolutionary pathways that facilitate microbial survival and proliferation across diverse habitats. The implications of these transitions for microbial ecology, evolution, and their impact on global biogeochemical cycles are discussed, providing a comprehensive understanding of microbial life's adaptability and resilience."}
