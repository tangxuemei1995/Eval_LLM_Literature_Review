{"Abstract": "Secretory IgA (SIgA) plays a pivotal role in mucosal immunity, offering a first line of defense against enteropathogens such as Salmonella. This study delves into the structureâ€“function relationships of SIgA across various scales, from molecular interactions to systemic immune responses. By examining the polymeric nature of IgA and its interaction with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), we uncover the mechanisms underlying SIgA's ability to clump pathogens, thereby neutralizing their infectivity. Our findings highlight the importance of SIgA's unique structure in facilitating its protective functions, including pathogen agglutination, immune exclusion, and modulation of the gut microbiota. Through a combination of biochemical assays, structural biology, and in vivo models, we provide insights into how SIgA's molecular architecture underpins its efficacy as a mucosal immune effector. This research advances our understanding of SIgA's role in combating enteric infections and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting mucosal immunity."}
