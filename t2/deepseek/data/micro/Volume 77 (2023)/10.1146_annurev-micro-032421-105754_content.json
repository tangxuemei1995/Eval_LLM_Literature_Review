{"Abstract": "The human gut phageome, comprising the collective bacteriophage populations within the gut microbiome, plays a pivotal role in maintaining gut health and influencing disease states. This review explores the factors contributing to the variation of the gut phageome, including diet, age, geography, and antibiotic usage. Bacteriophages, as key regulators of bacterial populations, impact the gut microbiome's composition and function, thereby affecting host health. The interplay between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts can lead to dynamic shifts in the gut virome, with implications for both health and disease. Understanding the factors that drive these variations is crucial for developing targeted therapies and interventions aimed at modulating the gut phageome to promote health or treat disease. This synthesis of current research highlights the complexity of the gut phageome and underscores the need for further studies to unravel the intricate relationships between bacteriophages, the gut microbiome, and human health."}
