{"Abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, yet the genetic manipulation of its constituent microbes remains a significant challenge. This study focuses on expanding the repertoire of genetically tractable members within the human gut microbiome, aiming to enhance our understanding and control over microbial communities for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. By leveraging advanced genetic engineering tools and techniques, we identify and characterize novel model organisms that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Our findings reveal a diverse set of microbes that can be engineered to express or repress specific genes, offering new avenues for microbiome engineering. This research not only broadens the scope of genetically tractable microbes but also paves the way for targeted interventions in microbiome-associated diseases, highlighting the potential of microbiome engineering in advancing human health and disease management."}
