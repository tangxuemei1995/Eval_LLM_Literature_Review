{"Abstract": "Transporter proteins play a pivotal role in the ecological adaptation and evolutionary dynamics of microbial eukaryotic pangenomes, serving as both ecological assets and features that distinguish core from accessory genomes. This study explores the functional diversity and evolutionary mechanisms of transporter proteins, emphasizing their contribution to microbial adaptation, virulence, and the facilitation of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). By analyzing the distribution and evolution of transporter genes within microbial eukaryotic pangenomes, we uncover patterns of gene duplication and divergence that underscore the adaptive significance of these proteins. Our findings reveal that transporter proteins are not only crucial for nutrient acquisition and stress response but also act as key players in the expansion of the accessory genome, thereby enhancing microbial fitness and ecological versatility. This research highlights the intricate interplay between transporter proteins and microbial pangenome architecture, offering new insights into the mechanisms driving microbial evolution and adaptation in diverse ecological niches."}
