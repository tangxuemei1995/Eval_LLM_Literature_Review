{"Abstract": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are a critical component of the bacterial outer membrane, facilitating the active transport of essential nutrients and siderophores. These transporters are characterized by their Î²-barrel structure, which spans the outer membrane, and their reliance on the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex for energy transduction. This review explores the structural and functional mechanisms of TBDTs, highlighting their role in nutrient acquisition and their potential as targets for novel therapeutic strategies, including the development of 'Trojan horse' antibiotics. Additionally, we examine the unique adaptations of TBDTs in Bacteroidetes, a phylum known for its diverse and complex polysaccharide utilization systems. Understanding the intricacies of TonB-dependent transport not only sheds light on bacterial physiology but also opens avenues for combating antibiotic resistance through innovative drug design."}
