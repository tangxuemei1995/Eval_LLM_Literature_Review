{"Abstract": "The phc quorum-sensing system plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pathogenicity and virulence in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex, which includes Ralstonia solanacearum and Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum. This cellâ€“cell communication mechanism enables these phytopathogenic bacteria to coordinate gene expression in response to population density, facilitating the colonization and infection of host plants. The phc system modulates the expression of various virulence factors, including extracellular polysaccharides, motility, and type III secretion system effectors, crucial for bacterial wilt disease development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the phc quorum-sensing system offers insights into the complex interplay between bacterial pathogens and their plant hosts, providing potential targets for novel disease management strategies. This review highlights recent advances in the study of the phc system, emphasizing its significance in the pathogenicity of the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex and its implications for controlling bacterial wilt diseases."}
