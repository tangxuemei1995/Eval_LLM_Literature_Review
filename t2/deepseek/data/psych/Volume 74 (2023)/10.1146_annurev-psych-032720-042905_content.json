{"Abstract": "The psychology of climate change is a critical area of study that explores the complex interplay between human values, beliefs, and the acceptability of climate action. This research delves into how individual and collective values shape perceptions of climate change and influence the willingness to engage in system change. By examining the underlying psychological factors that drive climate change beliefs, this study aims to identify key barriers and facilitators to the adoption of sustainable behaviors and policies. The findings highlight the importance of aligning climate action with deeply held values to enhance its acceptability and effectiveness. Furthermore, the research underscores the need for a systemic approach to address the psychological dimensions of climate change, advocating for strategies that foster a collective shift towards sustainability. This abstract contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological aspects of climate change, offering insights for policymakers, educators, and activists aiming to promote meaningful climate action."}
