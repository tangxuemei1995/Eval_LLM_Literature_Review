{"Abstract": "This paper delves into the pivotal role of emotion within organizational contexts, synthesizing theory and empirical research to illuminate its multifaceted impact on workplace dynamics. Emotions, as a fundamental aspect of human experience, significantly influence individual behavior, decision-making processes, and interpersonal relationships in organizations. By exploring the social functions of emotion, this study highlights how emotional expressions can serve as critical signals that shape group cohesion, leadership effectiveness, and organizational culture. Furthermore, the concept of emotional intelligence is examined as a key determinant of professional success, emphasizing its importance in managing one's own emotions and understanding those of others. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research underscores the necessity of integrating emotional considerations into organizational theory and practice. It advocates for a more nuanced understanding of affect in the workplace, proposing that emotional awareness and regulation are essential for fostering a positive and productive organizational environment."}
