{"Abstract": "This study investigates the determinants of social cognitive aging, focusing on the interplay between social resources, context, motivation, and cognitive effort in predicting resilience and risk among older adults. Utilizing a comprehensive approach that integrates ecological validity, we explore how these factors influence cognitive performance and adaptability in real-world settings. Our findings highlight the critical role of enriched social environments and intrinsic motivation in fostering cognitive resilience, while also identifying contexts that may exacerbate cognitive risk. The research underscores the importance of considering individual differences and environmental factors in understanding cognitive aging. By elucidating the mechanisms through which social and motivational factors contribute to cognitive outcomes, this study offers valuable insights for developing targeted interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive health and well-being in the aging population."}
