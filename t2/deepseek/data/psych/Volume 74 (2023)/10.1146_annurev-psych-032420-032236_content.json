{"Abstract": "Self-continuity, a fundamental aspect of psychological health, refers to the perception of oneself as remaining the same over time despite changes in circumstances, roles, and physical appearance. This concept is deeply intertwined with attitudes and behavior, influencing how individuals navigate their social and personal environments. Research highlights the role of culture in shaping self-continuity, with variations observed between individualistic and collectivistic societies. In collectivistic cultures, the collective self—a sense of belonging and identification with a group—plays a significant role in fostering self-continuity. This study explores the mechanisms through which self-continuity impacts psychological health, emphasizing the mediating role of cultural context. By examining the interplay between self-continuity, attitudes, behavior, and the collective self across different cultural backgrounds, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how individuals maintain a coherent sense of self over time. The findings have implications for psychological interventions and cross-cultural psychology, offering insights into promoting mental well-being in diverse populations."}
