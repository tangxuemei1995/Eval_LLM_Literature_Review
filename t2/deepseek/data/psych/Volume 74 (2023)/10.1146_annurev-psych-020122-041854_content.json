{"Abstract": "Psychological resilience, the capacity to maintain or regain mental health in the face of adversity, is a critical area of study within psychology. This research explores resilience through an affect-regulation framework, emphasizing the role of emotion and emotion regulation in navigating stress and coping mechanisms. By integrating findings from diverse scientific literature, we propose that effective affect regulation strategies are foundational to psychological resilience, enabling individuals to adaptively manage emotional responses to stressors. This framework suggests that resilience is not merely the absence of distress but involves active processes of emotional engagement and regulation that contribute to psychological health. The study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamic interplay between adversity, emotion regulation, and resilience, offering insights into interventions aimed at enhancing resilience by fostering adaptive affect regulation skills. This approach underscores the potential for targeted strategies to bolster psychological resilience in the face of life's challenges."}
