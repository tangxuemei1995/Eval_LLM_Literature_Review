{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between working memory and selective attention, emphasizing their pivotal roles in guiding behavior through anticipation and expectation. By integrating findings from vision and action research, we propose a novel framework that conceptualizes working memory as a dynamic system that not only retains information but also actively shapes attentional processes to optimize behavioral outcomes. Our analysis reveals that working memory facilitates the anticipation of future events and the formation of expectations, which in turn influence the allocation of attention to relevant stimuli. This inside-out perspective underscores the proactive nature of working memory in serving behavior, challenging traditional views that emphasize its passive storage function. Through a series of experimental paradigms, we demonstrate how this interplay between working memory and selective attention underpins adaptive behavior in complex environments, offering new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that drive human action."}
