{"Abstract": "This study explores the pivotal role of pride as a self-conscious emotion in the attainment and maintenance of social rank. Drawing on a comprehensive review of psychological and sociological literature, we examine how pride functions as both a motivator and a signal in the pursuit of status, distinguishing between the pathways of prestige and dominance. Through the lens of evolutionary psychology, we argue that pride has evolved as a mechanism to facilitate social navigation, enabling individuals to assess their position within social hierarchies and to strive for higher status. Our analysis highlights the dual nature of pride, encompassing both authentic and hubristic forms, and its differential impact on social rank attainment. By integrating findings from empirical studies, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the emotional underpinnings of social stratification and the complex interplay between emotion and social behavior."}
