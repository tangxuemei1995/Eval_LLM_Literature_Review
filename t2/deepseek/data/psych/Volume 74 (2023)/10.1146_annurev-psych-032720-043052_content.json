{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of gender inclusion and person-environment fit within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, addressing the persistent gender disparities and stereotypes that hinder diversity and inclusion. By analyzing existing literature and empirical data, we investigate how gender stereotypes influence the perception of fit between individuals and their STEM environments, and how these perceptions affect the participation and retention of women and gender minorities in STEM. Our findings suggest that enhancing gender inclusion requires not only addressing overt biases but also fostering environments that value diverse perspectives and competencies. We propose strategies for creating more inclusive STEM cultures, including mentorship programs, bias training, and policy reforms aimed at reducing systemic barriers. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on diversity and inclusion in STEM by highlighting the importance of person-environment fit in achieving gender equity and leveraging the full potential of a diverse workforce."}
