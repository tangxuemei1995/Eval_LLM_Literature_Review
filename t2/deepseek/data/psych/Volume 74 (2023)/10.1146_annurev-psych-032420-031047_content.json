{"Abstract": "Self-compassion, a construct rooted in Buddhist philosophy, has emerged as a significant area of interest within psychological research, offering a novel perspective on emotional resilience and well-being. This paper synthesizes current theory, methodological approaches, empirical findings, and intervention strategies related to self-compassion. It explores the tripartite model of self-compassion, encompassing self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness, and its implications for mitigating negative psychological outcomes and enhancing positive states. Through a review of recent studies, the paper highlights the role of self-compassion in fostering resilience, reducing stress, and promoting mental health. Furthermore, it examines the efficacy of self-compassion-based interventions, such as Mindfulness-Based Self-Compassion (MBSC) programs, in clinical and non-clinical populations. The findings underscore the importance of integrating self-compassion practices into therapeutic and educational settings to support individuals in navigating life's challenges with greater ease and emotional balance."}
