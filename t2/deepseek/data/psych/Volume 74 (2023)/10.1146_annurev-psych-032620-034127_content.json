{"Abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental biological process essential for cognitive functions such as memory consolidation, attention regulation, and overall mental health. This review explores the intricate relationship between sleep and cognition, emphasizing the role of sleep structure—comprising REM and non-REM stages—in facilitating these cognitive processes. We delve into how sleep deprivation and disturbances can impair memory retention and attentional capacities, highlighting the importance of sleep optimization for cognitive enhancement. Furthermore, the impact of aging on sleep patterns and its subsequent effects on cognitive decline are examined, suggesting that tailored sleep interventions could mitigate age-related cognitive deterioration. By synthesizing current research, this paper underscores the necessity of prioritizing sleep quality and duration as a means to bolster cognitive performance across the lifespan. The findings advocate for a holistic approach to sleep optimization, integrating lifestyle adjustments and potential therapeutic strategies to improve sleep and, by extension, cognitive health."}
