{"Abstract": "This paper introduces a socioecological-genetic framework to explore the intricate relationships between culture and personality, emphasizing their roots, evolutionary trends, and dynamic interplay. By integrating socioecological perspectives with genetic insights, we examine how environmental pressures and genetic predispositions jointly shape cultural norms and individual personality traits. The framework highlights the bidirectional influences between cultural change and personality development, offering a nuanced understanding of the nature–nurture debate. Through the lens of genes × environment interaction, we propose that cultural evolution and personality adaptation are deeply intertwined processes, driven by both societal shifts and genetic variability. This comprehensive approach aims to bridge the gap between macro-level cultural dynamics and micro-level personality psychology, providing a holistic view of human behavior in the context of changing socioecological landscapes."}
