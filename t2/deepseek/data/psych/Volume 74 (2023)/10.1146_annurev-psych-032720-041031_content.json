{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate mechanisms of human object vision, exploring how the brain processes and represents visual information. By integrating findings from neuroscience and computer science, we examine the parallels between the human visual cortex and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in object recognition tasks. Our research highlights the complexity of object representations within the visual cortex, suggesting that a single image can evoke a multitude of neural responses. Through behavioral experiments and computational modeling, we aim to bridge the gap between biological and artificial vision systems, offering insights into the efficiency and adaptability of human object recognition. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of visual perception and its implications for developing more sophisticated DCNNs."}
