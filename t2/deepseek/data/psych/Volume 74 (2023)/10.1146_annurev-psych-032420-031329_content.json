{"Abstract": "Conspiracy theories, defined as explanations for events or phenomena that invoke secret plots by powerful groups, have garnered significant attention in both academic and public discourse. This paper adopts a definitional approach to explore the multifaceted nature of conspiracy theories, focusing on their correlates, consequences, and modes of communication. Drawing on a comprehensive review of the literature, we identify key predictors of conspiracy beliefs, including psychological factors such as cognitive biases and personality traits, as well as socio-political factors like distrust in institutions and exposure to specific media environments. The consequences of endorsing conspiracy theories are examined, highlighting their potential to undermine social cohesion, erode trust in democratic processes, and influence individual and collective behavior. Furthermore, the paper delves into the mechanisms of conspiracy theory communication, analyzing the role of social media, echo chambers, and the spread of misinformation. By synthesizing existing research, this study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding conspiracy theories and their impact on society."}
