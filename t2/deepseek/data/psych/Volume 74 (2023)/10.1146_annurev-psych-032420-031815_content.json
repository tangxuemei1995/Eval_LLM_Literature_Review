{"Abstract": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) represents a pivotal mechanism in attitude formation, where the valence of a neutral stimulus is altered through its association with a valent stimulus. This review delineates the evolution of EC research, from its foundational studies emphasizing the role of associations in shaping attitudes, to contemporary debates that integrate propositional processes. We explore the robustness of EC effects across diverse contexts, underscoring the importance of external validity in understanding its applicability to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends and future directions, including the integration of neuroscientific methods and the exploration of EC's role in digital environments. By synthesizing past findings and current perspectives, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of EC's contributions to our understanding of attitude formation and to chart a course for future research endeavors in this dynamic field."}
