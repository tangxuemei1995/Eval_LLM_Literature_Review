{"Abstract": "This study explores the efficacy of psychosocial and integrative oncology interventions across the disease trajectory, focusing on their impact on anxiety, depression, and distress in cancer patients. By examining a range of therapeutic approaches, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, mindfulness, mind-body therapies, and psychedelic therapy, the research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current practices and their outcomes. The findings highlight the importance of tailored interventions that address the psychological and emotional needs of patients, offering insights into the potential benefits of integrating these therapies into standard oncology care. The study underscores the need for further research to optimize treatment strategies and improve the quality of life for individuals navigating the complexities of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship."}
