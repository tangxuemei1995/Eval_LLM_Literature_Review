{"Abstract": "Careless responding in survey data poses significant challenges to the validity and reliability of research findings. This study addresses the critical issue of insufficient effort responding (IER), a prevalent form of invalid responding that includes random responding and lazy respondents. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we explore effective strategies for the prevention and identification of careless responding. We highlight the importance of incorporating methodological safeguards during survey design and employing advanced statistical techniques for detecting IER. Furthermore, we propose a set of recommended best practices aimed at minimizing the impact of careless responding on data quality. Our findings underscore the necessity for researchers to adopt a proactive approach in dealing with IER, ensuring the integrity of survey-based research."}
