{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate development of color perception and cognition from infancy through childhood, a critical period for sensory and cognitive maturation. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine how infants initially perceive color and how this perception evolves into more complex cognitive processes as children grow. The research highlights the role of environmental stimuli and genetic factors in shaping color perception, emphasizing the transition from basic color discrimination to the ability to categorize and name colors. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of color perception on cognitive development, including memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. By integrating findings from developmental psychology, neuroscience, and education, this paper provides a holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying color perception and cognition. The implications of these findings for educational practices and interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive development through color-based activities are also discussed."}
