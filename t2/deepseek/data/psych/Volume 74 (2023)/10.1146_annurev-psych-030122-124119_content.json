{"Abstract": "Cancer diagnosis and treatment present significant stressors that can adversely affect patients' psychological and physiological well-being, potentially impacting health outcomes. This study explores the efficacy of stress management interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in facilitating psychological and physiological adaptation among cancer patients and survivors. By systematically reviewing current literature, we identify key cancer-related stressors and evaluate the role of targeted interventions in mitigating these stressors. Our findings suggest that stress management interventions, including CBT, significantly enhance psychological adaptation, evidenced by reduced anxiety and depression levels, and improve physiological adaptation, indicated by better immune function and reduced inflammation. These interventions are associated with improved cancer health outcomes, including enhanced quality of life and potentially longer survival rates. This research underscores the importance of integrating stress management strategies into cancer care protocols to support holistic patient well-being and optimize health outcomes."}
