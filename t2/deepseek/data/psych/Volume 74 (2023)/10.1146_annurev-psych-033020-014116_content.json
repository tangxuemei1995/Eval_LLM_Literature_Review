{"Abstract": "This review delves into the intricate dynamics of negotiation, bargaining, and conflict resolution, emphasizing the complexity inherent in these processes. Drawing from a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we explore the multifaceted factors that influence negotiation outcomes, including psychological, social, and contextual elements. The paper highlights the evolution of negotiation research, from traditional models focusing on rational decision-making to contemporary approaches that incorporate emotional intelligence, cultural differences, and power dynamics. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, this review aims to provide a nuanced understanding of negotiation strategies and their effectiveness in various settings. Ultimately, it advocates for a more holistic approach to negotiation research, one that embraces complexity and fosters more effective conflict resolution practices."}
