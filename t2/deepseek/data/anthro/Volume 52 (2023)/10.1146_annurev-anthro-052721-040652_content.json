{"Abstract": "This paper explores the imperative of decolonizing museums as a critical step toward a paradigm shift in cultural representation and preservation. Drawing on Native American scholarship and the broader discourse on indigenization, it examines the historical and contemporary practices of museums that have often marginalized Indigenous voices and narratives. The study advocates for a transformative approach that prioritizes the inclusion, participation, and leadership of Indigenous communities in museum operations, from curation to governance. By analyzing case studies of museums that have embarked on decolonization efforts, the paper highlights the challenges and opportunities in redefining museum practices to reflect a more equitable and respectful engagement with Indigenous cultures. The findings underscore the importance of decolonization as not merely a theoretical concept but a practical necessity for museums to become spaces of true cultural exchange and understanding. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on decolonization in the arts and cultural sectors, offering insights into how museums can evolve to better serve diverse communities and foster a more inclusive historical narrative."}
