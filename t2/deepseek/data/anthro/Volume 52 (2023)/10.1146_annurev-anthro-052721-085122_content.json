{"Abstract": "The human gut microbiota, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms, plays a pivotal role in host health, disease, and phenotypic variation. This review explores the intricate intersections between gut microbial communities and human ecology and evolution, emphasizing the dynamic host-microbial interactions that have shaped human biology. By examining comparative studies involving nonhuman primates, we gain insights into the evolutionary pressures that have influenced the co-evolution of humans and their microbiota. These interactions are not only fundamental to understanding the adaptive mechanisms of the human body but also highlight the microbiota's contribution to phenotypic plasticity and variation. The synthesis of current research underscores the importance of considering the microbiome in the context of human evolutionary biology, offering a comprehensive perspective on how microbial communities have been integral to human adaptation and survival across diverse ecological niches."}
