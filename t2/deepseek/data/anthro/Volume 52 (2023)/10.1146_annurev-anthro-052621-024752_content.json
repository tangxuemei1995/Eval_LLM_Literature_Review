{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the evolving perceptions of Neandertals within the history of science, particularly focusing on the intersections of race, racism, and the interpretation of symbolic behavior. Historically, Neandertals have been portrayed through a lens that often reflects contemporary biases, leading to a distorted understanding of their capabilities and place in human evolution. By revisiting key archaeological findings and reassessing the evidence of Neandertal symbolic behavior, this study challenges the 'uncanny valley' hypothesis that posits a discomfort with beings that are almost, but not quite, human. It argues that such discomfort has influenced scientific narratives, contributing to the marginalization of Neandertals in the story of human ancestry. Through a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from anthropology, archaeology, and cognitive science, this research advocates for a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of Neandertals, recognizing their complexity and the shared heritage with modern humans."}
