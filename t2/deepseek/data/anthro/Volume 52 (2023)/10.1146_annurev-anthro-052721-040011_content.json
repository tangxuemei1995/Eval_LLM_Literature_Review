{"Abstract": "This paper delves into the burgeoning field of Critical University Studies (CUS), exploring its intersections with higher education, decolonization, abolition, and Black studies. By examining the historical and contemporary challenges faced by universities, the study highlights the imperative for systemic reform within academic institutions. It argues for a decolonial approach to dismantle the entrenched structures of inequality and oppression, advocating for the abolition of practices that perpetuate racial and social injustices. Drawing on Black studies, the research underscores the importance of centering marginalized voices and epistemologies in the pursuit of a more equitable and inclusive academic environment. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on transforming higher education into a space that fosters social justice, equity, and liberation for all."}
