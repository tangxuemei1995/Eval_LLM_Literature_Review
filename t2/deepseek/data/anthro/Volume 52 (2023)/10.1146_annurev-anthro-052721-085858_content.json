{"Abstract": "This study explores the physiological and metabolic adaptations of human bodies to extreme environments, focusing on thermoregulation and metabolic adjustments. By analyzing existing literature, we investigate how humans adapt to extreme cold, heat, and high altitudes, and the role of structural inequality in access to resources that facilitate such adaptations. The research highlights the impact of climate change on exacerbating environmental extremes and the consequent challenges to human health and survival. Findings suggest that while physiological adaptations play a crucial role, structural inequalities significantly influence the capacity of individuals and communities to cope with extreme conditions. This study underscores the importance of addressing both physiological and socio-economic factors in developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of extreme environments on human populations."}
