{"Abstract": "This study revisits the anthropology of masculinity, focusing on the often-unmarked nature of men and masculinity in gender studies. By examining the intersections of gender, sexuality, and inequality, the research aims to uncover the nuanced ways in which masculinity is constructed, performed, and challenged across different cultural contexts. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and incorporating contemporary case studies, the paper explores the dynamic processes of change in masculine identities and practices. It argues that understanding masculinity requires a critical examination of its invisibility in normative discourses and its impact on gender relations. The findings highlight the importance of rethinking masculinity not as a fixed category but as a fluid and contested terrain that shapes and is shaped by broader social, economic, and political forces. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on gender by offering fresh insights into the complexities of masculinity and its implications for achieving gender equality."}
