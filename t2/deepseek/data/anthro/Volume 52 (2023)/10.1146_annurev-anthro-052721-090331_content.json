{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between water needs, water insecurity, and human biology, emphasizing the physiological and psychological impacts of inadequate water access. Water insecurity, a growing concern exacerbated by climate change, significantly affects hydration levels, triggering thirst and compelling individuals to adopt various coping strategies. These strategies, while essential for survival, often lead to adverse health outcomes, embodying the physical and mental toll of water scarcity. Through a comprehensive review of scientific literature, this research highlights the biological adaptations and maladaptations that arise from prolonged exposure to water insecurity. It also examines how these adaptations influence human behavior and health, particularly in vulnerable populations. The findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable water management practices and policies to mitigate the effects of water insecurity on human biology, ensuring equitable access to this vital resource in the face of escalating environmental challenges."}
