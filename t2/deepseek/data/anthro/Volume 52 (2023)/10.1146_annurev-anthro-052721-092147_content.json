{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intersection of linguistic anthropology and visual culture, exploring the semiotic processes through which images become meaningful within specific cultural contexts. By employing concepts such as entextualization, performativity, and enregisterment, the research examines how images are not merely passive representations but active participants in the construction of social realities. Through a series of case studies, the paper illustrates the dynamic interplay between visual and linguistic signs, highlighting the role of images in the negotiation of identity, power, and social relations. The findings underscore the importance of a linguistic anthropological approach to understanding the complex ways in which images are produced, circulated, and interpreted, offering new insights into the semiotic landscapes of contemporary societies."}
