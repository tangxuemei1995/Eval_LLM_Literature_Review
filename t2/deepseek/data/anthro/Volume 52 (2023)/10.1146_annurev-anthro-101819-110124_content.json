{"Abstract": "The archaeology of long-distance connections across the ancient Indian Ocean has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, shedding light on the complex maritime networks that linked South Asia with distant regions. This research focuses on the exchange of goods, such as beads and ceramics, which serve as key indicators of trade and cultural interactions. Through the analysis of archaeological findings and the application of advanced scientific techniques, scholars have been able to trace the origins, distribution patterns, and technological aspects of these artifacts. The study highlights the role of South Asia as a pivotal node in the ancient Indian Ocean exchange system, facilitating not only the movement of materials but also the transmission of ideas and technologies. These developments contribute to a deeper understanding of the socio-economic and cultural dynamics that shaped the ancient world, offering new perspectives on the interconnectedness of early civilizations."}
