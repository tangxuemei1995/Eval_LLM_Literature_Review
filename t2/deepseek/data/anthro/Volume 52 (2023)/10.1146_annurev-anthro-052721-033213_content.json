{"Abstract": "This article explores the intricate dynamics of security regimes through the lens of transnational and imperial entanglements, employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates political anthropology and transnational feminism. By examining the intersections of security, empire, race, and gender, the study reveals how these regimes are not merely mechanisms of state control but are deeply embedded in historical and ongoing imperial projects. The analysis highlights the ways in which security practices perpetuate racial and gendered hierarchies, often under the guise of protecting national and international order. Through case studies and theoretical insights, the article argues for a reimagined understanding of security that challenges imperial legacies and embraces a feminist, anti-racist framework. This research contributes to broader debates on the politics of security, offering critical perspectives on how to dismantle oppressive structures and foster more inclusive and equitable security practices."}
