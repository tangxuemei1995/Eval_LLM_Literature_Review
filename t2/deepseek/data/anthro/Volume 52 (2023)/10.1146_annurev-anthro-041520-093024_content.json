{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the paradigms of global health interventions, focusing on the roles of military involvement, the pursuit of 'magic bullet' solutions, and the deterministic models that often underpin such efforts. Drawing on a multidisciplinary approach that includes anthropology, global public health, and the history of medicine, we explore how these frameworks have shaped the delivery of health care and aid in post-colonial contexts. By analyzing case studies and historical precedents, we argue that these approaches frequently overlook the complex socio-political and cultural determinants of health, perpetuating a form of neo-colonialism in global health practices. The paper advocates for an 'intervention otherwise'â€”a more nuanced, context-sensitive approach that prioritizes local knowledge, community engagement, and the dismantling of power asymmetries in global health initiatives. This reimagined framework seeks to foster more equitable and sustainable health outcomes, challenging the status quo of global health interventions."}
