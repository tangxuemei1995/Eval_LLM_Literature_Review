{"Abstract": "This study delves into the linguistic and cognitive implications of the Pirahã language, spoken by an indigenous group in Amazonia, which has sparked significant debate in the fields of linguistic anthropology and cognitive science. The Pirahã language challenges the notion of universal grammar, particularly the concept of recursion, a cornerstone of Chomskyan linguistic theory. Through an analysis of Pirahã's unique linguistic features, including its purported lack of recursion, number terms, and color terms, this research explores the boundaries of linguistic diversity and cognitive universality. By examining the interplay between language structure and cognitive processes, the study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the nature of the language faculty and its universality across human cultures. The findings underscore the importance of indigenous languages in understanding the full spectrum of human linguistic capabilities and the potential limitations of existing linguistic theories in accounting for such diversity."}
