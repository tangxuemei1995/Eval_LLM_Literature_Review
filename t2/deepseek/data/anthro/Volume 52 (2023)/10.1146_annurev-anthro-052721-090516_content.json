{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between environmental factors and epigenetic mechanisms plays a pivotal role in modulating the pace of human aging and the onset of age-related diseases. This review synthesizes current evidence on how external environmental exposures, ranging from dietary habits to pollution, influence epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA expression. These epigenetic alterations, in turn, affect the expression of genes involved in aging processes and disease susceptibility. The concept of the epigenetic clock, a biomarker of aging based on DNA methylation patterns, is explored as a tool to quantify biological age and predict lifespan. By elucidating the mechanisms through which the environment impacts epigenetic regulation and aging, this research underscores the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate age-related decline and promote healthy longevity. The findings highlight the importance of considering environmental and epigenetic factors in the development of strategies to combat aging and age-associated diseases."}
