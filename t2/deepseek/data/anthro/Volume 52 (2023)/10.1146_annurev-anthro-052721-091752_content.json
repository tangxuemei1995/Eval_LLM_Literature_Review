{"Abstract": "This study delves into the nuanced realm of interpreting, shedding light on the often-overlooked aspects of invisible labor and ethical considerations within the profession. Interpreters, pivotal in bridging linguistic and cultural divides, navigate complex terrains of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes, where their voices and identities frequently become obscured. Through an interdisciplinary lens, this research explores the ethical dilemmas interpreters face, including issues of neutrality, confidentiality, and the moral implications of their work in various contexts. By examining the intersection of interpreting with global capitalism and humanitarian efforts, the study aims to uncover the layers of invisible labor that sustain communication across borders. It calls for a reevaluation of the ethical frameworks governing interpreting practices, advocating for greater recognition of interpreters' contributions and the challenges they encounter. This investigation contributes to a deeper understanding of the critical role interpreters play in facilitating global dialogue and the ethical considerations that underpin their work."}
