{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between algorithms and their ecological contexts, emphasizing the dynamic interplay within digital infrastructures and social imaginaries. By examining the interface of smart technology, we delve into how algorithms are not merely technical entities but are deeply embedded in socio-technical ecosystems. The study proposes a framework for understanding the ecology of algorithms, highlighting their roles in shaping and being shaped by human interactions, environmental factors, and infrastructural dependencies. Through this lens, we aim to uncover the multifaceted impacts of algorithms on society and the environment, advocating for a more holistic approach to their design and implementation in smart technologies."}
