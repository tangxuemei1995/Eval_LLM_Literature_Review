{"Abstract": "This study examines the implications of mandatory employment arbitration as a prevalent form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in the context of employment law. By analyzing recent legal developments and empirical data, the research highlights the tension between the efficiency of arbitration processes and the accessibility of justice for employees. The paper explores how mandatory arbitration clauses, often embedded in employment contracts, may limit employees' rights to pursue claims in court, potentially undermining the principles of fairness and equity. Furthermore, it assesses the impact of such practices on the balance of power between employers and employees, considering the broader implications for workplace justice. Through a critical review of existing literature and case studies, this research aims to contribute to the ongoing debate on the role of arbitration in employment disputes, offering insights into potential reforms to ensure a more equitable resolution process."}
