{"Abstract": "The integration of technology into law firms has been a subject of significant interest, particularly with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to transform the legal profession. This study explores the extent to which technology is reshaping law firms, focusing on the concept of organizational complementarityâ€”where technology enhances rather than replaces human expertise. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and case studies, we examine how AI and other technological advancements are being adopted in legal practices, the challenges faced, and the outcomes of such integrations. Our findings suggest that while technology is indeed transforming certain aspects of law firms, such as document review and legal research, its impact is moderated by the need for human judgment and the complex nature of legal work. The paper concludes that successful transformation requires a balanced approach, leveraging technology to complement rather than substitute the nuanced skills of legal professionals."}
