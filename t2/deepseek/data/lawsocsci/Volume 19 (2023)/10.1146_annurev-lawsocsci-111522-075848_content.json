{"Abstract": "This paper explores the concept of refeudalization within the context of modern legal and political systems, examining the transition from the rule of law to ties of allegiance. It argues that contemporary shifts in governance and sovereignty reflect a resurgence of feudal characteristics, where personal and corporate loyalties increasingly overshadow democratic principles and legal impartiality. Through an analysis of the contractualization of public services and the privatization of state functions, the study highlights how these processes contribute to the erosion of democratic representation and the rule of law. By drawing on historical and theoretical perspectives, the paper seeks to illuminate the mechanisms through which refeudalization occurs and its implications for democracy and legal governance. The findings suggest a need for renewed attention to the foundational principles of democracy and the rule of law to counteract the tendencies towards refeudalization in contemporary society."}
