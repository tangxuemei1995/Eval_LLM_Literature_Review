{"Abstract": "This study explores civil litigants' evaluations of their legal experiences, focusing on their perceptions of procedures, satisfaction, and fairness within the civil law system. Through a comprehensive analysis of survey data and interviews, the research identifies key factors that influence litigants' assessments, including the transparency of legal processes, the demeanor of legal professionals, and the outcomes of their cases. Findings reveal that litigants' satisfaction is significantly affected by their perceived fairness of the proceedings, rather than solely the case outcome. The study contributes to the broader discourse on legal system reform by highlighting the importance of procedural justice in enhancing litigants' trust and confidence in the civil law framework. Recommendations for improving litigant experiences are proposed, emphasizing the need for more accessible and equitable legal procedures."}
