{"Abstract": "This paper delves into the complexities and nuances of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a cornerstone of corporate reorganization in the United States. By examining the interplay between bankruptcy law and corporate law, we explore the known mechanisms that facilitate the survival and restructuring of financially distressed companies. However, our focus extends beyond the established frameworks to uncover the unknownsâ€”areas where legal ambiguities and economic uncertainties challenge the efficacy of Chapter 11 proceedings. Through a comprehensive review of case law, economic theories, and empirical studies, this research aims to shed light on the gaps in our understanding of bankruptcy law's impact on corporate behavior, creditor rights, and the broader economy. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on how to refine bankruptcy legislation to better serve the interests of all stakeholders involved."}
