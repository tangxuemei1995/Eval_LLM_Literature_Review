{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China, focusing on the dual state framework where the rule of law coexists with authoritarian governance. It examines how property rights, markets, land, and labor are regulated within this unique political-economic system. The research highlights the tension between the formal legal structures that support market operations and the informal mechanisms of state control that ensure political stability. Through an analysis of legal reforms and economic policies, the paper reveals how the Chinese state leverages its legal system to facilitate economic growth while maintaining tight political control. The findings suggest that the dual state model enables the Chinese government to navigate the complexities of global capitalism, balancing the demands of market efficiency with the imperatives of authoritarian rule. This study contributes to the broader discourse on the adaptability of authoritarian regimes in the face of economic liberalization and global integration."}
