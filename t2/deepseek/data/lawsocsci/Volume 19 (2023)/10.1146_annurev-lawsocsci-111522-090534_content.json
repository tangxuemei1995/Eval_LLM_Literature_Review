{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted role of vaccines beyond their conventional perception as mere tools of public health, delving into their sociolegal and scientific dimensions. By integrating sociolegal studies with science and technology studies (STS), alongside ethnographic methods, the research investigates how vaccines are embedded within complex networks of law, policy, and societal norms. It examines the interplay between legal frameworks and public health strategies, highlighting how vaccines are not only biological entities but also sociolegal constructs that influence and are influenced by cultural, ethical, and political factors. The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of vaccines as objects of interdisciplinary inquiry, shedding light on their implications for governance, equity, and trust in public health systems. Through this lens, the research contributes to broader discussions on the role of law and science in shaping public health interventions and societal responses to vaccination."}
