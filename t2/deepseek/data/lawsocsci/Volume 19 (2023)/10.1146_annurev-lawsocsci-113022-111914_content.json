{"Abstract": "This study examines the dual roles of police officers as both witnesses and defendants within the judicial system, focusing on the implications for police accountability and law enforcement practices. Through an analysis of legal cases and scholarly literature, the research highlights critical issues such as perjury, the disclosure of Brady evidence, and the application of qualified immunity. The findings suggest that while police officers play a pivotal role in the administration of justice, their participation in court proceedings raises significant concerns regarding transparency, accountability, and the integrity of the legal process. The study calls for a reevaluation of current practices and policies to ensure that the rights of all parties are protected and that the principles of justice are upheld. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on law enforcement reform and the need for mechanisms that promote accountability and trust in the criminal justice system."}
