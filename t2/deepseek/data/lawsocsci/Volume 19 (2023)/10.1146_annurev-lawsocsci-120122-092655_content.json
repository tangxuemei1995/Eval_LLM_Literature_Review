{"Abstract": "The landscape of pretrial detention reform is in constant flux, reflecting broader societal shifts in attitudes towards justice and fairness. This paper examines the evolving discourse surrounding bail reform and its implications for pretrial detention practices within the criminal law framework. By analyzing recent legislative changes, judicial decisions, and empirical studies, we explore the challenges and opportunities in balancing public safety with the rights of the accused. The study highlights the critical need for evidence-based approaches to reform, aiming to reduce unnecessary detention while ensuring accountability and equity in the criminal justice system."}
