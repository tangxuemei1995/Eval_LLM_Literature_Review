{"Abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into government operations presents a transformative potential for public administration, offering unprecedented efficiencies and decision-making capabilities. However, this integration also poses significant challenges in terms of regulation and sociotechnical design, necessitating a careful balance between innovation and ethical considerations. This paper explores the complexities of regulating government AI, focusing on the interplay between technological advancements and institutional frameworks. It examines the necessity for adaptive regulatory mechanisms that can accommodate the rapid evolution of AI technologies while ensuring accountability, transparency, and fairness in public administration. The study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to institutional design, incorporating insights from computer science, law, ethics, and public policy to address the unique challenges posed by AI in government. By analyzing current regulatory practices and proposing a framework for sociotechnical design, this research aims to contribute to the development of robust governance models that can harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks, ensuring that government AI serves the public interest effectively and ethically."}
