{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of social cognition and legal frameworks, focusing on how laws and policies can serve as social interventions to mitigate implicit bias and foster intergroup relations. By analyzing the psychological underpinnings of segregation and implicit bias, the research investigates the potential of legal mechanisms to act as debiasing tools, promoting equality and reducing social divides. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the paper highlights the role of psychology in shaping effective legal strategies that address the root causes of bias. The findings suggest that targeted laws and policies, informed by psychological insights, can significantly alter social cognition patterns, leading to more equitable intergroup interactions. This research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in crafting interventions that not only address but also prevent the perpetuation of bias in society."}
