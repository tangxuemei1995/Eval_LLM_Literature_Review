{"Abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into global governance structures presents a transformative shift in the mechanisms of international regulation and policy-making. This paper explores the modalities through which AI technologies are being deployed in global governance, focusing on the rationales that underpin their adoption and the tensions that arise from their implementation. By examining case studies of algorithmic regulation and the use of machine learning in decision-making processes, the study highlights the potential of AI to enhance efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity in governance. However, it also identifies significant challenges, including ethical concerns, the risk of bias, and the implications for sovereignty and human rights. The paper argues for a nuanced approach to AI regulation, one that balances the benefits of technological innovation with the need to safeguard democratic values and social equity. Through this analysis, the study contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of AI in shaping the future of global governance."}
