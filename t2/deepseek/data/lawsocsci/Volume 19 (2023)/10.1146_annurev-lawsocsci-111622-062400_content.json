{"Abstract": "This study critically examines the intersection of race, immigration, and labor within the context of low-wage work, aiming to center race in the analysis of immigrant labor experiences. By synthesizing existing literature and incorporating empirical data, the research highlights how systemic racism shapes the working conditions, rights, and justice for immigrant workers. It explores the mechanisms through which racial hierarchies are perpetuated in the labor market, affecting immigrants' access to fair wages, safe working environments, and legal protections. The study argues for a more nuanced understanding of the racialized dimensions of immigrant labor, advocating for policies and practices that address racial inequities and promote justice and rights for all workers. This research contributes to the broader discourse on immigration, labor, and race, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities for achieving equitable labor conditions."}
