{"Abstract": "This study examines the enduring legacy of Guant치namo Bay detention camp, focusing on its implications for international law, human rights, and the rule of law. Through an analysis of practices such as torture, the use of CIA black sites, and the operation of military commissions, the research highlights the challenges posed to habeas corpus and the broader legal framework governing war crimes. The role of the Supreme Court in adjudicating cases related to Guant치namo detainees is critically assessed, revealing tensions between national security imperatives and the protection of fundamental rights. By exploring the legal and ethical controversies surrounding Guant치namo, this paper contributes to the discourse on the balance between security and liberty in the context of counterterrorism efforts. The findings underscore the need for adherence to the rule of law and the importance of accountability in addressing the abuses associated with Guant치namo's legacy."}
