{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of effective data governance, particularly in the context of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for public health responses such as contact tracing. This research explores the intersection of pandemic management, data privacy, and AI, highlighting the existing gaps in data governance frameworks. It examines how the rapid deployment of AI-driven solutions has raised significant privacy concerns, undermining public trust. The study advocates for the adoption of 'privacy by design' principles to ensure that data governance strategies are robust, transparent, and capable of protecting individual privacy while facilitating the effective use of data for pandemic response. By analyzing case studies and existing literature, this paper aims to contribute to the development of more resilient data governance models that can address the challenges posed by future public health crises."}
