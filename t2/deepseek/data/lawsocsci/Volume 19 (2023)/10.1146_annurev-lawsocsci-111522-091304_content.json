{"Abstract": "This study explores the complexities of global lawmaking through the lens of intellectual property rights (IPR) and international health emergencies, offering a critical analysis of the interplay between these domains. By examining the evolution of international agreements and the challenges posed by methodological nationalism, the research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of global legal frameworks. The paper argues that traditional approaches to studying law, which often prioritize national perspectives, are inadequate for addressing the transnational nature of contemporary legal issues. Through a comparative analysis of IPR and global health governance, the study identifies key lessons for the development of more effective and inclusive global lawmaking processes. The findings underscore the importance of fostering international cooperation and adopting a global perspective to tackle pressing legal and health challenges in an increasingly interconnected world."}
