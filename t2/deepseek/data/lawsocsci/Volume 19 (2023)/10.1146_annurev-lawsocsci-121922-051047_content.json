{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of social reproduction theory, legal realism, and materialist feminism to analyze the legal frameworks governing unpaid domestic and care work. Social reproduction, a concept central to understanding the perpetuation of social and economic systems, encompasses the unpaid labor predominantly performed by women in households. Despite its critical role in sustaining economies, this labor remains largely invisible in legal and economic discourses. Drawing on the insights of legal realism and materialist feminism, this study examines how laws and policies either reinforce or challenge the gendered division of labor. It argues for a reimagining of legal frameworks to recognize and redistribute the burdens of social reproduction more equitably. By integrating perspectives from law and political economy, the paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing debate on how legal systems can better address the material conditions of social reproduction, advocating for transformative legal reforms that acknowledge the value of unpaid work in the broader socio-economic context."}
