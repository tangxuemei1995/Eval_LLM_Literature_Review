{"Abstract": "Iceberg calving, the process by which ice breaks off from the edge of glaciers or ice shelves, plays a critical role in the dynamics of ice sheets and their contribution to sea-level rise. This study investigates the regimes and transitions of iceberg calving, focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which are the largest contributors to global sea-level rise. By analyzing satellite imagery, field observations, and numerical models, we identify distinct calving regimes characterized by the size, frequency, and mechanisms of iceberg detachment. These regimes are influenced by factors such as ice thickness, ocean temperature, and the presence of ice shelves. Our findings reveal that transitions between calving regimes can be abrupt and are often triggered by environmental changes, such as warming ocean temperatures or the disintegration of ice shelves. These transitions have significant implications for ice-sheet stability, as they can lead to accelerated ice flow and increased ice discharge into the ocean. Understanding the mechanisms driving iceberg calving and the conditions under which regime transitions occur is essential for improving predictions of future sea-level rise. This research highlights the need for continued monitoring of calving activity and the development of more sophisticated models to capture the complex interactions between ice sheets, oceans, and climate. The insights gained from this study contribute to a better understanding of the processes governing ice-sheet dynamics and their impact on global sea levels."}
