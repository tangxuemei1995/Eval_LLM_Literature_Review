{"Abstract": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels through the Phanerozoic eon has been a subject of intense study due to its profound implications for the development of life on Earth, particularly the evolution of animals. This paper revisits the trajectory of atmospheric O2 concentrations over the past 541 million years, integrating the latest geochemical data and models of the carbon cycle. We synthesize evidence from various proxies, including carbon isotopes, sulfur isotopes, and the composition of sedimentary rocks, to reconstruct a more accurate and detailed history of atmospheric oxygen. Our analysis suggests that O2 levels have fluctuated significantly, with notable increases during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, which correlate with major evolutionary events such as the rise of large, complex animals. We also explore the feedback mechanisms between the biosphere and the geosphere that have regulated atmospheric O2, emphasizing the role of the carbon cycle in modulating oxygen levels. This revised understanding of atmospheric O2 evolution provides new insights into the co-evolution of life and the Earth's surface environment, highlighting the intricate interplay between biological innovation and geochemical processes."}
