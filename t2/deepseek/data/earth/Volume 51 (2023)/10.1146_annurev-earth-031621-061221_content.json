{"Abstract": "Mimas, one of Saturn's innermost moons, presents a unique enigma in planetary science, straddling the line between a frozen relic of the past and a potential ocean world. This study delves into the multifaceted nature of Mimas, exploring its origins, internal structure, and the dynamic processes that may govern its evolution. By synthesizing data from Cassini spacecraft observations and employing advanced modeling techniques, we investigate the hypothesis of a subsurface ocean beneath Mimas's icy crust. The analysis focuses on the interplay between tidal heating, rotational dynamics, and tectonics, which could sustain liquid water in such a small and seemingly inert body. Furthermore, we examine Mimas's role in the context of satellite formation and its interactions with Saturn's rings, considering whether it could be a remnant of ring material or a byproduct of a larger moon's fragmentation. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of ocean worlds, highlighting the diversity of environments that may harbor life beyond Earth. This research underscores the importance of Mimas as a key target for future exploration, offering insights into the processes that shape icy satellites and the potential for habitability in the outer solar system."}
