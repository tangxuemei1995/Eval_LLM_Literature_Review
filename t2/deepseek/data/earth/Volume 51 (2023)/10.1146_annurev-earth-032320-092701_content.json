{"Abstract": "The evolution of carbon sources and sinks over the Phanerozoic eon has been a subject of intense study, given its critical role in shaping Earth's climate and biosphere. This research leverages a comprehensive suite of models to explore the dynamics of the carbon cycle across deep time, focusing on the interplay between geological processes, such as weathering, and biological activity. By integrating data from paleoclimate proxies with advanced modeling techniques, we aim to reconstruct the fluxes of carbon between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere, and to understand how these fluxes have influenced global climate over millions of years. Our findings highlight the importance of silicate weathering as a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2, modulated by tectonic activity and the evolution of land plants. Additionally, the models reveal significant variations in volcanic outgassing and organic carbon burial rates, which have acted as major carbon sources and sinks, respectively. These variations are closely linked to major geological events, such as the formation and breakup of supercontinents, and biological innovations, including the colonization of land by plants and the evolution of calcifying organisms. The study also underscores the role of feedback mechanisms in stabilizing Earth's climate over geological timescales, despite the occurrence of extreme climatic events. By providing a quantitative framework for understanding the carbon cycle's evolution, this research contributes to our knowledge of Earth's past climate dynamics and offers insights into the potential impacts of current anthropogenic carbon emissions on future climate trajectories."}
