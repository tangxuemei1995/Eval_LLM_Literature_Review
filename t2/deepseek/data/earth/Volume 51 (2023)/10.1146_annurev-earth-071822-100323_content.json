{"Abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) into earthquake seismology has revolutionized the way we analyze, predict, and understand seismic activities. This study explores the application of neural networks and other ML algorithms in processing vast datasets of seismic signals, enabling the identification of patterns that precede earthquakes. By leveraging the computational power of AI, researchers can now predict seismic events with greater accuracy, assess potential risks, and mitigate the impact of earthquakes on vulnerable populations. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by the use of ML in seismology, including the need for high-quality data, the complexity of seismic signals, and the potential for real-time earthquake detection systems. The findings suggest that ML and AI hold the promise of significantly advancing our understanding of earthquake mechanisms, contributing to the development of more effective early warning systems and disaster response strategies."}
