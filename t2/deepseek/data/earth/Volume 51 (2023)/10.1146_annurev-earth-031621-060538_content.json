{"Abstract": "The formation of the Moon has been a subject of intense scientific inquiry, with the giant impact hypothesis emerging as the leading explanation. This hypothesis posits that the Moon formed from the debris of a collision between the proto-Earth and a Mars-sized body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Recent advancements in geochronology and isotopic analysis have refined our understanding of the Moon's formation chronology, particularly through the study of lunar samples returned by the Apollo missions. These studies have provided model ages that suggest the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean occurred within the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the Moon's formation, focusing on the integration of chronological data with dynamical models of the giant impact. We discuss the implications of these findings for the thermal and chemical evolution of the Moon, including the timing of crust formation and the differentiation of the lunar interior. Furthermore, we explore how these chronological constraints inform our understanding of the early Solar System's dynamics and the processes that shaped the terrestrial planets. The synthesis of chronological data with theoretical models continues to refine our understanding of the Moon's formation, offering insights into the broader context of planetary formation and evolution."}
