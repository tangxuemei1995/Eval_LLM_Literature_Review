{"Abstract": "River deltas, dynamic landforms at the interface of terrestrial and marine environments, are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) driven by climate change. This study synthesizes current understanding of the geomorphological responses of river deltas to SLR, integrating insights from sedimentary geology, coastal dynamics, and climate science. We explore the complex interplay between fluvial sediment supply, deltaic morphology, and rising sea levels, highlighting the critical role of sedimentary processes in delta resilience. Through a review of global case studies, we identify key factors influencing deltaic adaptation to SLR, including sediment flux, tidal range, and human interventions such as damming and land reclamation. Our analysis reveals that while some deltas may sustain their form and function through sediment accretion and progradation, others face increased risk of submergence, erosion, and habitat loss. The study underscores the importance of holistic management strategies that consider both natural processes and anthropogenic impacts to enhance delta resilience. By advancing our understanding of deltaic responses to SLR, this research contributes to the development of adaptive strategies for coastal protection, ecosystem conservation, and sustainable development in deltaic regions worldwide."}
