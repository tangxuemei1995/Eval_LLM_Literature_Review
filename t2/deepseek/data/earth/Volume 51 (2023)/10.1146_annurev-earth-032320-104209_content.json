{"Abstract": "The Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) marks a significant shift in Earth's climate system, characterized by a change in the dominant periodicity of glacial cycles from approximately 41,000 to 100,000 years around 1.2 to 0.8 million years ago. This transition has been a focal point of paleoclimate research, as it represents a fundamental change in the response of the Earth's climate to orbital forcing. The MPT is associated with variations in ice volume, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and the carbon cycle, yet the exact mechanisms driving this shift remain elusive. This study synthesizes recent findings from paleoclimate proxies, ice core records, and climate models to explore the interplay between orbital cycles, ice sheet dynamics, and the carbon cycle during the MPT. We examine the role of CO2 as a feedback mechanism in amplifying orbital forcing and discuss the potential contributions of changes in ocean circulation, dust deposition, and ice sheet stability to the transition. Our analysis highlights the complexity of the Earth's climate system and underscores the importance of integrating multiple lines of evidence to understand the drivers of the MPT. By elucidating the processes that led to this pivotal shift in Earth's climate history, this research contributes to our broader understanding of climate dynamics and the potential impacts of future climate change."}
