{"Abstract": "The Neogene period marks a transformative era in the evolution of the Amazonian flora, shaped by complex interactions between geological upheavals, climatic fluctuations, and biological diversification. This study synthesizes geological, palynological, and molecular phylogenetic data to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the Amazonian plant communities. The uplift of the Andes during the Neogene played a pivotal role in altering drainage patterns and creating diverse habitats, which, in turn, influenced the distribution and evolution of plant species. Palynological records provide insights into the floristic composition and vegetation dynamics, revealing significant shifts in response to global and regional climate changes. Molecular phylogenetic analyses offer a temporal framework for understanding the evolutionary relationships among Amazonian plant lineages, highlighting periods of rapid diversification coinciding with major environmental changes. The integration of these datasets underscores the importance of the Andean orogeny and climatic variability as drivers of Amazonian biodiversity. Furthermore, this research elucidates the paleobiogeographic pathways that facilitated the dispersal and establishment of plant taxa across the Amazon Basin. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical processes that have shaped the current patterns of plant diversity in the Amazon, offering valuable perspectives for conservation and biodiversity management in the face of ongoing climate change."}
