{"Abstract": "Solar geoengineering, a form of climate intervention aimed at mitigating global warming by reflecting a portion of incoming solar radiation, has garnered significant attention for its potential to rapidly reduce global temperatures. However, its implications for the hydrologic cycle and regional precipitation patterns remain poorly understood. This study investigates the hydrological consequences of solar radiation modification (SRM) strategies, focusing on their impact on global and regional precipitation, evaporation, and water availability. By analyzing climate model simulations that incorporate SRM techniques, we assess the potential for unintended disruptions to the hydrologic cycle, including shifts in monsoon dynamics, changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and alterations in freshwater resources. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between solar geoengineering and the Earth's climate system, revealing that while SRM may effectively lower global temperatures, it could also exacerbate water stress in certain regions by altering precipitation patterns. This research underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs associated with solar geoengineering, emphasizing the importance of considering hydrological impacts in the development and evaluation of climate intervention strategies. The study contributes to the ongoing debate on the feasibility and risks of geoengineering, providing critical insights into its potential effects on the hydrologic cycle and the broader implications for climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts."}
