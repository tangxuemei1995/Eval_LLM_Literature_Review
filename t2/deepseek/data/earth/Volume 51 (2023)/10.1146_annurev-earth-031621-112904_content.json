{"Abstract": "The study of kimberlite-borne xenolithic eclogites provides critical insights into the petrogenesis and geodynamic significance of these enigmatic rocks, which are pivotal in understanding the processes occurring within paleo-subduction zones and the lithospheric mantle. This research delves into the complex origins of xenolithic eclogites, exploring their formation through the subduction of oceanic crust and subsequent metamorphism at high pressures and temperatures. By analyzing the geochemical and isotopic signatures of these eclogites, we unravel the intricate interactions between the convecting mantle and the overlying continental lithosphere, shedding light on the deep geochemical cycles that drive continent evolution. The findings highlight the role of xenolithic eclogites as tracers of ancient subduction events, offering a window into the thermal and compositional evolution of the Earth's mantle over geological time scales. This study underscores the importance of xenolithic eclogites in deciphering the dynamic processes that shape the Earth's interior, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the geodynamic framework that governs the evolution of continents and the mantle."}
