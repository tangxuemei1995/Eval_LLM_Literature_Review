{"Abstract": "The rock-hosted biosphere represents a frontier in understanding life's resilience and adaptability, particularly in subsurface environments where conditions are extreme. This study delves into the microbial communities thriving within rock fractures, focusing on endoliths that engage in chemolithoautotrophy, a process enabling them to derive energy from inorganic compounds. By analyzing microbial activity in the Earth's crust, we uncover the mechanisms by which these organisms sustain life in the absence of sunlight, relying instead on chemical energy sources. Our findings highlight the significance of fractures in facilitating microbial colonization and nutrient transport, thereby supporting a diverse and active subsurface biosphere. This research not only expands our knowledge of life's limits but also has implications for astrobiology, suggesting that similar life forms could exist in the subsurface of other planetary bodies. Through this exploration, we aim to contribute to the broader understanding of microbial life in extreme environments and its potential beyond Earth."}
