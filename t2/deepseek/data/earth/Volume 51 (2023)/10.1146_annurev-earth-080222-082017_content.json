{"Abstract": "The late Paleozoic era marked a pivotal transformation in Earth's environmental history, largely driven by the evolution and proliferation of terrestrial plants. This study employs a systems approach to unravel the complex interactions between plant functional traits, ecosystem dynamics, and global climate during this critical period. By integrating plant functional strategies with advanced ecosystem and Earth system modeling, we aim to elucidate how early vascular plants influenced atmospheric composition, hydrology, and climate feedbacks. Our analysis focuses on key plant functional traits—such as stomatal density, leaf area index, and root architecture—that played significant roles in carbon sequestration, water cycling, and soil development. We explore how these traits, in combination with plant functional strategies like resource allocation and reproductive mechanisms, facilitated the colonization of diverse habitats and the establishment of complex ecosystems. Furthermore, we investigate the feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate, particularly the impact of plant-driven changes on atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperature. Through a series of model simulations, we assess the long-term consequences of plant-environment interactions on Earth's biogeochemical cycles and climate stability. Our findings highlight the profound influence of plant evolution on the late Paleozoic environment, providing new insights into the co-evolution of life and the Earth system. This research underscores the importance of a systems perspective in understanding the deep-time impacts of vegetation on global environmental change, offering valuable lessons for contemporary ecological and climate studies."}
