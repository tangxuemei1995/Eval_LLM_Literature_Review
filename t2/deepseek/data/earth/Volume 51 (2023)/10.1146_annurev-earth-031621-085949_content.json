{"Abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has emerged as a transformative tool in geochemistry, offering a novel approach to reconstructing past temperatures and understanding the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and oxygen. This technique leverages the thermodynamic preference for isotopologues (molecules with the same chemical formula but different isotopic compositions) to clump together in carbonate minerals at equilibrium, a phenomenon that is temperature-dependent. The application of clumped isotope thermometry extends across a broad spectrum of geological and environmental sciences, from paleoclimate reconstruction to the study of diagenetic processes. Recent advancements in analytical methodologies, including the development of high-precision mass spectrometry, have significantly enhanced the accuracy and precision of clumped isotope measurements, enabling the detection of subtle variations in isotopic compositions. This paper reviews the frontiers of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry, highlighting the theoretical underpinnings, methodological innovations, and diverse applications of this technique. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with the interpretation of clumped isotope data, including the effects of kinetic fractionation and diagenetic alteration. Furthermore, we explore the potential of integrating clumped isotope thermometry with other geochemical proxies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's history and the processes shaping its surface environments. As the field continues to evolve, carbonate clumped isotope thermometry promises to remain at the forefront of geochemical research, offering new insights into the complex interplay between temperature, chemistry, and life on Earth."}
