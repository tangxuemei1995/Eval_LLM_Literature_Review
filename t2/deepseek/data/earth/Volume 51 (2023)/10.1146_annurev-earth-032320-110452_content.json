{"Abstract": "The Gangdese Batholith in southern Tibet represents a significant geological feature that provides insights into the processes of continental crustal growth within a magmatic arc setting. This study focuses on the mechanisms of crustal stratification and growth, particularly in the context of the collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Through detailed geochemical and geochronological analyses, we have identified distinct phases of magmatic activity that contributed to the vertical and lateral expansion of the crust. The findings reveal that the Gangdese Batholith underwent multiple episodes of magmatic underplating and intra-crustal differentiation, leading to the formation of a stratified crust with a mafic lower layer and a more felsic upper layer. These processes are indicative of the complex interplay between mantle-derived magmas and pre-existing crustal materials, highlighting the role of magmatic arcs in the accretion and differentiation of continental crust. The study also sheds light on the temporal and spatial variations in crustal growth rates, suggesting that the most significant phase of crustal thickening occurred during the Late Cretaceous to Early Cenozoic, coinciding with the initial stages of the India-Eurasia collision. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the dynamics of crustal growth in collision zones and the evolution of continental crust in magmatic arc environments."}
