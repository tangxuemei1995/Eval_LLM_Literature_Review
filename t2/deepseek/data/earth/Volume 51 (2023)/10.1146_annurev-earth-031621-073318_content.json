{"Abstract": "The exploration of Mars has entered a new era with the deployment of seismometers on its surface, enabling the study of Mars' interior through the analysis of marsquakes and impacts. This research focuses on the field of Mars seismology, which aims to unravel the planet's internal structure, composition, and dynamics. The detection of marsquakes, particularly those originating from the Cerberus Fossae region, provides critical insights into the tectonic activity and stress distribution within Mars. Additionally, the study of impact-generated seismic waves offers a unique opportunity to probe the planet's crustal and mantle properties. By analyzing the seismic data collected, researchers can infer the thickness of Mars' crust, the state of its mantle, and the size and composition of its core. This paper reviews the current understanding of Mars' interior structure based on seismic observations, discusses the implications of these findings for the planet's geological history and evolution, and outlines future directions for Mars seismology research. The integration of seismic data with other geophysical and geological observations is essential for constructing a comprehensive model of Mars' interior, which will enhance our understanding of terrestrial planet formation and evolution in the solar system."}
