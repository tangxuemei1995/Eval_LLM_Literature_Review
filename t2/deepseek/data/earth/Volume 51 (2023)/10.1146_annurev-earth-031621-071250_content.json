{"Abstract": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) represents one of the most significant carbon isotope excursions in Earth's history, occurring during the Paleoproterozoic era, approximately 2.22 to 2.06 billion years ago. This period is closely associated with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), a pivotal moment when atmospheric oxygen levels rose dramatically, fundamentally altering the planet's surface chemistry and biosphere. The LJE is characterized by anomalously high Î´13C values in marine carbonates, suggesting a profound perturbation in the global carbon cycle. This study aims to deconstruct the LJE by examining the interplay between biological, geological, and chemical processes that may have driven this excursion. We explore various hypotheses, including enhanced organic carbon burial, changes in the oxidation state of the ocean, and the role of methanogenesis and methanotrophy. By integrating geochemical data, paleoenvironmental reconstructions, and biogeochemical modeling, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind the LJE and its implications for the co-evolution of life and Earth's surface environments during the Precambrian. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on the dynamics of the carbon cycle in response to major oxygenation events and offer insights into the resilience and adaptability of Earth's biosphere in the face of extreme environmental changes."}
