{"Abstract": "The formation of planets is a complex process that involves numerous physical mechanisms, among which giant impacts play a pivotal role. This study delves into the significance of collisions, particularly giant impacts, in shaping the architecture and composition of planetary systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and simulation data, we explore how these high-energy events contribute to the accretion of planetary embryos, the differentiation of planetary interiors, and the delivery of volatiles to terrestrial planets. Our analysis highlights the critical influence of giant impacts on the final stages of planet formation, including the establishment of planetary masses, orbital characteristics, and the potential for habitability. Furthermore, we examine the implications of giant impacts for the diversity of exoplanetary systems observed today, suggesting that such events are not only common but also essential for understanding the wide range of planetary configurations. By integrating observational evidence with theoretical models, this research underscores the importance of giant impacts in the planet formation process, offering new insights into the dynamic history of our solar system and beyond."}
