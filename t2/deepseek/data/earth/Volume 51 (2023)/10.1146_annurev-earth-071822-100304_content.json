{"Abstract": "Understanding the energy dissipation mechanisms during earthquakes is crucial for comprehending rupture dynamics and the overall earthquake energy budget. This study focuses on two key components: fracture energy and breakdown work, which play pivotal roles in the dynamic weakening of fault zones. Fracture energy, the energy required to create new fracture surfaces, and breakdown work, the energy dissipated in the process zone ahead of the rupture front, are both influenced by the fault zone structure and material properties. We employ a combination of theoretical models, laboratory experiments, and field observations to investigate how these energy components vary under different stress conditions and fault geometries. Our findings reveal that dynamic weakening mechanisms, such as thermal pressurization and flash heating, significantly reduce the effective fracture energy and breakdown work, facilitating rupture propagation. Additionally, the heterogeneity of fault zone materials and the presence of fluids further modulate these energy dissipation processes. By integrating these insights, we propose a refined framework for the earthquake energy budget that accounts for the complex interplay between fracture energy, breakdown work, and dynamic weakening. This framework enhances our ability to predict earthquake behavior and assess seismic hazard, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the physical processes governing earthquake ruptures."}
