{"Abstract": "The ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle plays a pivotal role in the dynamics of Earth's interior, influencing plate tectonics, mantle convection, and the evolution of geological structures. This study focuses on the deformation mechanisms and ductile flow within the lithospheric mantle, with particular emphasis on the behavior of olivine, the predominant mineral in the upper mantle. Through a comprehensive review of experimental and theoretical studies, we explore the plasticity of olivine under various pressure, temperature, and strain rate conditions, which are critical for understanding the rheological properties of the mantle. The analysis reveals that dislocation creep and diffusion creep are the dominant deformation mechanisms, with their relative contributions varying with depth and thermal state. Additionally, the role of water content and grain size in modulating the ductile flow of the lithospheric mantle is examined, highlighting their impact on the viscosity and strength of mantle rocks. The findings underscore the complexity of mantle deformation processes and their implications for geodynamic modeling. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanical behavior of the lithospheric mantle, offering insights into the forces driving plate tectonics and the long-term evolution of Earth's lithosphere."}
