{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate hydrological functioning of landscapes, focusing on the role of instructive surprises that challenge conventional understanding. By integrating ecohydrology and isotope hydrology, we explore the dynamic interactions within catchments and hillslopes that govern runoff generation and water movement. Our research highlights unexpected patterns and processes, such as the disproportionate influence of small-scale features on catchment response and the complex role of vegetation in modulating water fluxes. Through a combination of field observations, isotopic analysis, and modeling, we uncover how these surprises can lead to a deeper comprehension of hydrological systems. The findings underscore the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in landscape hydrology, offering new insights into water resource management and ecosystem sustainability. This work contributes to the evolving field of ecohydrology by providing a nuanced perspective on the hydrological functioning of landscapes, emphasizing the need for adaptive approaches in the face of environmental change."}
