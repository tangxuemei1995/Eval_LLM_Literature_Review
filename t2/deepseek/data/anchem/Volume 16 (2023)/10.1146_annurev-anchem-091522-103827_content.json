{"Abstract": "Microfluidics has emerged as a pivotal technology in biofilm studies, offering unparalleled insights into flow dynamics and shear stress effects on biofilm formation and behavior. This review highlights the application of microfluidic devices for in situ visualization of biofilms, enabling real-time monitoring of their development and response to environmental stimuli. The integration of organ-on-chip models and biosensors within microfluidic platforms has facilitated the study of biofilm-associated antimicrobial resistance and the evaluation of novel antifouling strategies. By mimicking physiological conditions, these advanced systems provide a deeper understanding of biofilm mechanics and interactions, paving the way for innovative approaches to combat biofilm-related challenges in medical and industrial settings."}
