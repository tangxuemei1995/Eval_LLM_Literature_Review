{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has underscored the need for advanced analytical techniques to understand the environmental impact of petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). This study explores emerging chemical methods, including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and fluorescence spectroscopy, for the characterization of petrogenic DOM and black carbon in marine environments. ICP-MS offers unparalleled sensitivity and specificity for trace metal analysis, providing insights into the geochemical cycling of elements associated with petroleum. Fluorescence spectroscopy, on the other hand, enables the identification and quantification of complex organic compounds, shedding light on the transformation and degradation processes of DOM. Together, these techniques offer a comprehensive toolkit for assessing the environmental fate of petroleum-derived compounds, facilitating the development of more effective remediation strategies and enhancing our understanding of the ecological consequences of oil spills."}
