{"Abstract": "Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) continue to pose significant health challenges in low-resource settings, primarily due to the lack of affordable and accessible diagnostic tools. This research explores the development of low-cost microfluidic systems for the detection of NTDs, leveraging advancements in paper-based microfluidics, lateral flow assays, and immunochromatographic tests. By integrating enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques with point-of-care testing (POCT) platforms, we aim to create highly sensitive, specific, and user-friendly diagnostic devices. These systems are designed to operate with minimal infrastructure, making them ideal for deployment in remote and underserved areas. The study highlights the potential of microfluidic technologies to revolutionize clinical diagnosis of NTDs, offering a cost-effective solution that could significantly improve disease management and control strategies. Through this work, we contribute to the global effort to combat NTDs by providing a scalable and sustainable approach to early detection and intervention."}
