{"Abstract": "The advent of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has revolutionized the field of pathology by enabling nondestructive, three-dimensional (3D) imaging of biological specimens with unprecedented speed and resolution. This technique, rooted in optical-sectioning microscopy, offers a powerful tool for computational and digital pathology, facilitating the detailed analysis of tissue architecture and cellular interactions in their native spatial context. By integrating LSFM with advanced computational algorithms, researchers can now extract quantitative, high-dimensional data from complex biological systems, paving the way for breakthroughs in spatial biology and precision medicine. This abstract highlights the transformative potential of LSFM in translational research and clinical assays, underscoring its role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, understanding disease mechanisms, and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies. The convergence of LSFM with computational pathology heralds a new era in biomedical research, where 3D pathology becomes a cornerstone of clinical decision-making and patient care."}
