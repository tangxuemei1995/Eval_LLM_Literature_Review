{"Abstract": "This paper serves as a beginner's guide to micro- and nanoscale electrochemical additive manufacturing, focusing on the integration of 3D printing technologies with electrochemical processes such as electrodeposition. We explore advanced techniques including meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED), FluidFM, scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), and electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), which utilize nanopipettes for precise material deposition at the micro- and nanoscale. These methods offer unprecedented control over the fabrication of complex structures with high resolution and accuracy, opening new avenues for research and application in fields ranging from electronics to biomedicine. The guide aims to provide a foundational understanding of these technologies, their operational principles, and their potential for revolutionizing manufacturing processes at the smallest scales."}
