{"Abstract": "The integration of infrared spectroscopic imaging with digital histopathology represents a transformative approach in the analysis of tissue samples, offering a non-destructive, label-free method to obtain detailed chemical and molecular information. This technique leverages the unique absorption spectra of molecular vibrations in the mid-infrared region, enabling the visualization of tissue architecture and composition at a microscopic level. The advent of machine learning and deep learning algorithms has further enhanced the capability of infrared spectroscopic imaging by facilitating the automated classification and interpretation of complex spectral data, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This paper reviews the principles of infrared spectroscopic imaging, its application in digital pathology, and the role of advanced computational methods in analyzing the vast datasets generated. The potential of this technology to revolutionize histopathological analysis by providing a comprehensive, chemical imaging-based diagnostic tool is discussed, highlighting its implications for personalized medicine and the future of pathology."}
