{"Abstract": "In the era of a connected world, the integration of biosensors into system-level support frameworks presents a transformative approach to enhancing decision-making processes, ensuring meaningful use of technology, and improving the quality of service across various domains. This research explores the pivotal role of biosensors in creating a knowledge network that facilitates real-time data acquisition, analysis, and dissemination. By leveraging the capabilities of biosensors, we propose a comprehensive model that supports decision-making through accurate, timely, and context-aware information. The study delves into the challenges and opportunities of embedding biosensors within existing infrastructures, focusing on optimizing the quality of service while adhering to principles of meaningful use. Through a series of case studies and empirical analyses, we demonstrate how biosensor-enabled knowledge networks can revolutionize healthcare, environmental monitoring, and personalized services, ultimately contributing to a more informed, efficient, and connected society."}
