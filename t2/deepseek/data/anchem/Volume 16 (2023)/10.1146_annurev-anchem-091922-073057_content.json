{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to observe and analyze the dynamic behaviors of individual molecules within complex biological systems. This review highlights the development and application of cutting-edge methodologies, including feedback-control tracking, which allows for the precise monitoring of fast-moving molecules by dynamically adjusting the imaging parameters in real-time. Point-spread-function engineering has emerged as a powerful tool to improve spatial resolution and localization accuracy, enabling the detailed observation of molecular interactions at the nanoscale. Furthermore, multiple plane microscopy has been instrumental in capturing three-dimensional trajectories of molecules, providing deeper insights into their spatial dynamics. Advanced trajectory and clustering analysis techniques have also been developed, facilitating the interpretation of complex molecular behaviors and interactions. These technological innovations not only deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms but also open new avenues for research in biophysics, cell biology, and nanotechnology."}
