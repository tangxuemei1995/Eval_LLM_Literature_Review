{"Abstract": "The advancement of energy storage technologies necessitates a profound understanding of interfacial phenomena, where electrochemical processes predominantly occur. This review delves into the realm of scanning probe methods, including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM), Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM), and Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy (SECCM), for the electrochemical imaging of interfaces in energy storage devices. These techniques offer unparalleled spatial resolution and sensitivity, enabling the direct observation of interfacial dynamics and material properties at the nanoscale. We explore their applications in characterizing battery materials and interfaces, highlighting recent progress in automation and the integration of deep learning for data analysis and interpretation. The prospects of these methods in advancing energy storage research are discussed, emphasizing their potential to unravel complex interfacial processes and guide the design of next-generation energy storage systems."}
