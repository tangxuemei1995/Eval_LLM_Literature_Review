{"Abstract": "Microscale electrophoresis has emerged as a pivotal technique in the separation and analysis of biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans. This study delves into the application of gels as sieving matrices within capillary and microfluidic gel electrophoresis systems, highlighting their critical role in enhancing resolution and efficiency. By leveraging the unique properties of gels, such as their tunable pore sizes and chemical compositions, researchers can achieve superior separation of complex biological samples. The review explores recent advancements in gel formulations and their impact on the performance of microscale electrophoresis, offering insights into the optimization of separation conditions for various analytes. Furthermore, the potential of integrating novel gel materials with microfluidic platforms is discussed, paving the way for the development of next-generation analytical tools in genomics, proteomics, and glycomics."}
