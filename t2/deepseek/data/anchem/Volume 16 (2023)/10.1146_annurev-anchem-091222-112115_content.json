{"Abstract": "The accurate detection and quantification of organic micropollutants in water samples are critical for environmental monitoring and public health protection. This study focuses on the development and application of efficient validation strategies in environmental analytical chemistry, specifically targeting organic micropollutants. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques such as liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we emphasize the importance of method validation, quality assurance, and quality control (QA/QC) protocols to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of analytical results. The research highlights the challenges associated with the analysis of complex water matrices and proposes innovative approaches to overcome these obstacles, including the optimization of sample preparation, the selection of appropriate analytical methods, and the implementation of stringent QA/QC measures. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust validation strategies to enhance the accuracy and precision of environmental monitoring efforts, thereby contributing to the effective management of water quality and the mitigation of pollution risks."}
