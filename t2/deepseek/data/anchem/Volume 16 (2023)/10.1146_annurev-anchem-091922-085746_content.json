{"Abstract": "The monitoring of coastal and oceanic environments is crucial for understanding marine ecosystems, predicting natural disasters, and managing human activities. This review focuses on the advancements and applications of in situ sensors for coastal and ocean monitoring. In situ sensors, deployed directly in the marine environment, provide real-time data on various parameters such as temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen, essential for oceanographic research and environmental monitoring. The integration of these sensors into sensor networks has significantly enhanced data collection, enabling comprehensive spatial and temporal analysis of marine conditions. However, challenges such as biofouling, which can impair sensor accuracy and longevity, remain a significant concern. This paper discusses the latest developments in sensor technology, strategies for mitigating biofouling, and the role of sensor networks in advancing oceanographic studies. The review highlights the importance of continuous innovation in sensor technology to improve the reliability and efficiency of coastal and ocean monitoring systems."}
