{"Abstract": "Label-free electrochemical methods have emerged as a powerful tool in the field of disease detection, offering a blend of sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity. These techniques leverage the intrinsic electrochemical properties of biological molecules, eliminating the need for labels or tags, thus streamlining the diagnostic process. By focusing on the direct interaction between the target analyte and the electrode surface, label-free electrochemical biosensors facilitate real-time monitoring and rapid detection of diseases. This review highlights the principles, advancements, and applications of label-free electrochemical methods in diagnostics, underscoring their potential in early disease detection and personalized medicine. The integration of these methods with nanotechnology and microfluidics is also discussed, pointing towards future directions in analytical chemistry and biosensing."}
