{"Abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have revolutionized the field of disease biology by offering a unique platform for studying human diseases in vitro. These cells, reprogrammed from somatic cells, possess the ability to differentiate into any cell type, thereby providing an invaluable tool for modeling genetic disorders, understanding gene regulation, and developing organoids that mimic human tissues. This review highlights the significant advancements in iPSC technology, focusing on their application in dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases. By leveraging iPSCs, researchers can now explore disease pathology, screen for potential therapeutic compounds, and personalize medicine with unprecedented precision. The evidence supporting the utility of iPSCs in vitro underscores their potential to transform our approach to studying and treating human diseases."}
