{"Abstract": "Coral reefs, among the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, are facing unprecedented threats from global change, including rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and habitat destruction. This study employs population genomics to explore the mechanisms of local adaptation and evolutionary rescue in coral reef fish populations, which are critical for their survival in rapidly changing environments. By analyzing genetic variation across populations, we aim to identify adaptive loci associated with thermal tolerance and other stress responses, and to assess the potential for dispersal to facilitate genetic rescue in isolated or declining populations. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of coral reef ecosystems under climate change, offering insights into conservation strategies that leverage natural genetic variation to enhance resilience and adaptability in the face of global environmental challenges."}
