{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of CRISPR technology in manipulating wild populations through genetic biocontrol strategies, focusing on gene drive mechanisms for population suppression and modification. By leveraging the homing ability of CRISPR, we investigate its potential to alter the genetic destiny of species, offering innovative solutions for biodiversity conservation and pest management. The research highlights ethical considerations and ecological impacts, aiming to balance technological advancements with environmental stewardship."}
