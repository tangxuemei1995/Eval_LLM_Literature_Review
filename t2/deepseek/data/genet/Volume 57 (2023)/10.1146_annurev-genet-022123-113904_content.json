{"Abstract": "The escalating crisis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is intricately linked to global environmental changes, presenting a complex challenge to public health and ecosystems worldwide. This study explores the multifaceted interplay between AMR and environmental factors, including the widespread contamination of natural habitats with antibiotics and resistant genes, driven by anthropogenic activities. Climate change further exacerbates this issue by altering microbial ecosystems and facilitating the spread of resistant pathogens. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we identify key mechanisms by which environmental changes influence AMR dynamics, such as increased bacterial mutation rates and horizontal gene transfer. Our findings underscore the urgent need for integrated approaches that address both the medical and environmental dimensions of AMR. Strategies to mitigate this crisis must include reducing antibiotic misuse, enhancing wastewater treatment, and implementing policies that consider the environmental impact of human activities. This research highlights the critical importance of a One Health approach in combating the intertwined challenges of AMR and global environmental change."}
