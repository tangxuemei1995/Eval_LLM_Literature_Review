{"Abstract": "Meiosis, a specialized cell division process, is fundamental for sexual reproduction, ensuring genetic diversity through the generation of haploid gametes from diploid cells. This intricate process involves the precise pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes, a dance that is tightly regulated to promote genetic variation while maintaining genomic integrity. Key features distinguishing meiosis from mitosis include homologous chromosome pairing, crossover formation, and crossover interference, mechanisms that ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes. The evolutionary significance of meiosis lies in its ability to shuffle genetic material, fostering adaptability and survival in changing environments. This review delves into the molecular choreography of meiosis, highlighting the critical differences from mitosis and the evolutionary advantages conferred by this unique cellular process."}
