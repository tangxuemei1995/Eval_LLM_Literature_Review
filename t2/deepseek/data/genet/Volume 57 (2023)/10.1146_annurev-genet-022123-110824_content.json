{"Abstract": "The advent of single-cell genomics has revolutionized our ability to dissect the genetic basis of complex traits by enabling the analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility at an unprecedented resolution. This study leverages single-cell populations to explore the intricate relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic diversity. By integrating quantitative genetics with single-cell technologies, we aim to identify key genetic loci and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits. Our approach involves the analysis of mutants and natural variants within a population genetics framework, providing insights into the genetic architecture of traits and the evolutionary forces shaping them. This research not only advances our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits but also opens new avenues for the development of targeted therapies and precision medicine."}
