{"Abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play pivotal roles in maintaining CNS homeostasis and responding to pathological conditions. Recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have unveiled the complexity of microglial transcriptional signatures, highlighting their heterogeneity across different CNS regions and states of health and disease. This review synthesizes current knowledge on microglial transcriptomic profiles, emphasizing the dynamic nature of these cells in response to environmental cues. By integrating findings from recent studies, we explore how microglial transcriptional diversity underpins their functional versatility in neurodevelopment, synaptic pruning, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of microglial heterogeneity for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and the potential for targeting microglial transcriptional programs in therapeutic strategies. This comprehensive overview aims to pave the way for future research into the multifaceted roles of microglia in CNS health and disease, offering insights into novel approaches for modulating microglial function to treat neurological disorders."}
