{"Abstract": "Noncoding regulatory variants, though elusive, play a pivotal role in gene expression and disease etiology. This study explores innovative strategies for identifying these variants, leveraging genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare-variant association tests, and machine learning algorithms. By integrating functional assays to validate enhancer activity, we aim to enhance the detection of noncoding variants with significant biological impact. Our approach offers a comprehensive framework for uncovering the hidden regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases."}
