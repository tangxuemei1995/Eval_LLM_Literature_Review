{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of complex life cycles into the framework of comparative developmental biology, focusing on the interplay between developmental modes, body plans, and the evolutionary significance of larval stages. By examining the morphological and genetic underpinnings of head and trunk development across diverse taxa, we aim to elucidate how variations in life cycle complexity contribute to the diversification of body plans. Our analysis highlights the pivotal role of larvae as developmental and evolutionary innovations, facilitating adaptive transitions between ecological niches. Through a synthesis of empirical data and theoretical models, we propose that the modularity of developmental processes underpins the evolutionary plasticity of life cycles, offering new insights into the mechanisms driving morphological diversity. This research underscores the importance of considering life cycle complexity in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of developmental biology."}
