{"Abstract": "Paramecium, a genus of unicellular ciliates, serves as a compelling model for exploring the complexities of genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology. This study delves into the intricate mechanisms of gene duplication and genome evolution within Paramecium species, shedding light on the evolutionary dynamics that drive genetic diversity and adaptation. By employing advanced population genomics techniques, we uncover the patterns of genetic variation across different Paramecium populations, providing insights into the evolutionary pressures that shape their genomes. Our findings highlight the role of gene duplication in the expansion of gene families, which is pivotal for the adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. Furthermore, we explore the evolutionary cell biology of Paramecium, examining how cellular structures and functions have evolved in response to genetic changes. This research not only enhances our understanding of the evolutionary processes in ciliates but also contributes to the broader field of evolutionary biology by elucidating the genetic and genomic underpinnings of adaptation and speciation in unicellular organisms."}
