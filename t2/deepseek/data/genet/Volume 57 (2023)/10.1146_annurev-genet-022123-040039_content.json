{"Abstract": "Asymmetric stem cell division plays a pivotal role in maintaining germline immortality, a phenomenon that ensures the transmission of genetic material across generations without the accumulation of age-related damage. This study explores the intricate mechanisms underlying this process, with a particular focus on the role of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) stability. We investigate how asymmetric division contributes to the segregation of damaged cellular components, thereby preserving the integrity of the germline. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of rDNA stability is crucial for preventing aging-related decline in germline cells. This research sheds light on the fundamental biological processes that sustain germline immortality and offers insights into the broader implications for aging and cellular longevity."}
