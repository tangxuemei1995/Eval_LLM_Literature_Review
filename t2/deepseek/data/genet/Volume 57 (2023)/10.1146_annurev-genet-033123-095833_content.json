{"Abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process that plays a crucial role in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. However, the occurrence and mechanisms of PCD in unicellular organisms have been a subject of increasing interest and debate. This study explores the evolutionary significance and molecular mechanisms of PCD in unicellular versus multicellular organisms, focusing on the similarities and differences in the pathways involved. By analyzing the latest research on microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast, and protozoa, we highlight the adaptive advantages of PCD in microbial communities, such as population control, stress response, and genetic exchange. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of microbial PCD for understanding the origins of regulated cell death in multicellular organisms. Our findings suggest that PCD in unicellular organisms is not merely a vestigial process but a sophisticated mechanism that has evolved to enhance survival and adaptability in diverse environments."}
