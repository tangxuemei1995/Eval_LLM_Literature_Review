{"Abstract": "Transcriptionâ€“replication conflicts (TRCs) represent a significant source of genomic instability, posing a fundamental challenge to cellular integrity and function. These conflicts arise when the processes of transcription and replication occur simultaneously on the same DNA template, leading to collisions between the replisome and RNA polymerase. Such encounters can result in replication fork stalling, DNA damage, and ultimately, genomic alterations. This review explores the mechanisms underlying TRCs, including the role of origin firing and replication stress in exacerbating these conflicts. Additionally, we delve into the cellular strategies employed to mitigate the impact of TRCs, focusing on DNA repair pathways and regulatory mechanisms that ensure the coordination of transcription and replication. Understanding the dynamics of TRCs is crucial for elucidating their contribution to genomic instability and for developing therapeutic strategies to combat diseases associated with DNA damage and repair deficiencies."}
