{"Abstract": "Pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens have revolutionized functional genomics by enabling the systematic interrogation of gene function across the genome. However, traditional pooled screens often average signals across cell populations, masking the heterogeneity inherent in biological systems. Here, we present a novel approach that integrates pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell resolution, leveraging advancements in single-cell genomics and cell sorting technologies. This method allows for the precise dissection of gene function at the individual cell level, providing unprecedented insights into cellular diversity and the complex interplay of genetic networks. By combining CRISPR-mediated gene perturbation with single-cell RNA sequencing, we can simultaneously assess the impact of genetic alterations on gene expression profiles in thousands of individual cells. This approach not only enhances the resolution of functional genomics studies but also opens new avenues for understanding the molecular basis of cellular behavior, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic responses at a single-cell level."}
