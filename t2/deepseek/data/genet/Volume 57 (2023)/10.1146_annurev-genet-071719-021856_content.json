{"Abstract": "The intricate mechanisms of RNA repair, particularly in the context of tRNA restriction and splicing, have long eluded comprehensive understanding. This study delves into the nuanced processes of end healing and end sealing, pivotal for the maintenance of RNA integrity and function. By focusing on the roles of polynucleotide kinaseâ€“phosphatase (PNKP) and RNA ligase, we uncover novel insights into the enzymatic orchestration required for RNA repair. Our findings highlight the discovery of previously unidentified enzymes that play critical roles in these repair pathways, shedding light on the complex interplay between RNA damage and repair mechanisms. This research not only advances our understanding of RNA biology but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting RNA repair processes. Through a combination of biochemical assays and structural analysis, we provide a detailed exploration of the molecular choreography underlying RNA repair, offering a fresh perspective on this essential cellular function."}
