{"Abstract": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a complex group of disorders characterized by dysregulation of the innate immune system, leading to unprovoked inflammation. The genetic architecture of SAIDs is diverse, encompassing monogenic, digenic, polygenic, and epigenetic mechanisms, alongside emerging evidence of somatic mutations contributing to disease pathogenesis. This review delves into the genetic underpinnings of SAIDs, highlighting the pivotal role of genetic mutations in inflammasome components and other immune regulatory pathways. We explore the spectrum of genetic alterations, from single nucleotide variants to complex genetic interactions, and their impact on disease phenotype and severity. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations in the context of autoinflammatory diseases, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets and personalized medicine approaches. Understanding the genetic basis of SAIDs is crucial for advancing diagnostic strategies and developing targeted therapies."}
