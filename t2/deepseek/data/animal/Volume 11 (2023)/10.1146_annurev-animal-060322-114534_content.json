{"Abstract": "Cephalopods exhibit a remarkable capacity for RNA editing, a process that significantly alters the neural proteome and is thought to contribute to their complex behaviors and adaptability. This study explores the extensive recoding of the neural proteome in cephalopods through RNA editing, focusing on the role of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. By analyzing transcriptomic data from various cephalopod species, we identify a high frequency of RNA editing events, particularly in genes associated with neural function. These editing events are predominantly catalyzed by ADARs, leading to amino acid changes that could impact protein function. Our findings suggest that RNA editing is a key mechanism underlying the neural plasticity and adaptability of cephalopods, offering insights into the evolutionary significance of this process in shaping complex behaviors. This research underscores the importance of RNA editing in the diversification of the neural proteome and its potential implications for understanding cephalopod intelligence and adaptability."}
