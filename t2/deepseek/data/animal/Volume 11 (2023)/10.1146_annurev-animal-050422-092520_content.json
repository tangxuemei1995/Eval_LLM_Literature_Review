{"Abstract": "The persistence of recessive lethal alleles in natural populations challenges our understanding of evolutionary dynamics. This study investigates the roles of mutation–selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in maintaining such variation. Mutation–selection balance posits that new lethal mutations are introduced at a rate equal to their removal by selection, yet this equilibrium may be disrupted by other evolutionary forces. Heterozygote advantage, where carriers of a lethal allele exhibit superior fitness, could also contribute to the allele's persistence. Additionally, linked selection, including associative overdominance and the influence of supergenes, may shield lethal alleles from purging by selection. Through a synthesis of theoretical models and empirical data, we explore how these mechanisms interact to sustain lethal variation. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of recessive lethal alleles is a complex interplay of mutation, selection, and genetic linkage, highlighting the nuanced nature of evolutionary processes in natural populations."}
