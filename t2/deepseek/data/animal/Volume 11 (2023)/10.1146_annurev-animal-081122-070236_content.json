{"Abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound derived from the Cannabis plant, has garnered significant attention for its potential therapeutic applications in veterinary medicine, particularly for the management of diseases in dogs and cats. This review synthesizes current scientific evidence on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of CBD in treating a range of conditions, including anxiety, inflammation, and epilepsy, in companion animals. Emerging research suggests that CBD exhibits anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory properties, offering a promising alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, its anticonvulsant effects have been observed in models of epilepsy, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic agent. However, the regulatory landscape surrounding CBD use in veterinary medicine remains complex, necessitating further research to establish standardized dosing guidelines and to fully understand its long-term safety profile. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of scientific validation for CBD in the management of dog and cat diseases, emphasizing the need for continued investigation to optimize its therapeutic potential."}
