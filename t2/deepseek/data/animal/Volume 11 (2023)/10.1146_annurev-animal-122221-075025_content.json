{"Abstract": "Insect populations are facing unprecedented declines globally, necessitating urgent conservation efforts. This study employs population genomics to unravel the genetic underpinnings of insect declines and to inform conservation strategies. We conducted comprehensive genome assemblies for several insect species at risk, enabling the identification of genetic adaptations and deleterious mutations that may impact population viability. Our findings reveal significant genetic diversity loss in declining populations, highlighting the role of genetic drift and inbreeding in exacerbating vulnerability to environmental stressors. Furthermore, we identified specific genetic adaptations related to pesticide resistance and climate change, providing insights into the evolutionary pressures faced by these species. The detection of deleterious mutations, particularly those affecting reproductive success and survival, underscores the importance of genetic health in conservation planning. This research underscores the potential of conservation genomics to guide targeted interventions, such as genetic rescue and habitat restoration, to mitigate insect declines. By integrating genomic data with ecological and demographic information, we propose a holistic approach to insect conservation that addresses both genetic and environmental challenges. Our study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on conservation genomics and offers a framework for applying genomic tools to preserve biodiversity in the face of global change."}
