{"Abstract": "This study explores the genetic underpinnings of monogenic and complex diseases in Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dogs), leveraging the unique position of dogs as models for both veterinary and human medicine under the One Health approach. By integrating advanced genomic technologies and bioinformatics tools, we aim to identify specific genetic risk factors associated with a range of canine diseases. Our research not only contributes to the advancement of precision medicine in veterinary practice but also offers insights into human disease mechanisms, highlighting the translational potential of canine models. This work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in unraveling the genetic complexities of diseases, paving the way for targeted therapies and improved health outcomes across species."}
