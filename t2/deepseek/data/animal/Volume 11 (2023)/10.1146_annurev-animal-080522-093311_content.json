{"Abstract": "Understanding the impact of deleterious variation in natural populations is crucial for conservation genetics, as it influences genetic load and inbreeding depression, which can threaten population viability. This study explores the prevalence and consequences of deleterious mutations in wild populations, employing simulations to model their effects under various demographic scenarios. We investigate how genetic load accumulates in small, isolated populations and the role of purging in mitigating inbreeding depression. Our findings highlight the importance of considering deleterious variation in conservation strategies, particularly for endangered species with limited genetic diversity. The results underscore the need for genetic management practices that reduce the risk of inbreeding and preserve adaptive potential. This research contributes to the broader field of conservation biology by providing insights into the genetic factors that influence population resilience and offering recommendations for the conservation of biodiversity in the face of genetic threats."}
