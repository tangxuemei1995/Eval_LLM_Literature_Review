{"Abstract": "This review explores the integration of Indigenous perspectives within the field of animal biosciences, focusing on the contributions of American Indian and Native American communities. It highlights the significance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in understanding animal behavior, health, and ecosystems, and its potential to enrich contemporary scientific practices. The concept of One Health, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, serves as a framework for this discussion. By examining case studies and scholarly literature, this paper demonstrates how Indigenous knowledge systems offer unique insights into animal sciences, from wildlife management to veterinary medicine. The review also addresses the challenges and opportunities in fostering collaborations between Indigenous communities and the scientific community, emphasizing the importance of ethical engagement and respect for cultural heritage. Ultimately, this paper advocates for a more inclusive approach in animal biosciences that values and incorporates Indigenous perspectives for holistic and sustainable solutions."}
