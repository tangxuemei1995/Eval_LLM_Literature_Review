{"Abstract": "The intersection of wildlife conservation and legal justice has become increasingly prominent with the rise of poaching forensics, a field dedicated to bringing animal victims into the courtroom. This study explores the pivotal role of forensic science, particularly DNA evidence, in prosecuting wildlife crimes. By analyzing case studies and legal precedents, we demonstrate how genetic markers and other forensic tools are used to identify species, trace the origins of poached animals, and link suspects to crime scenes. The research highlights the challenges and opportunities in applying forensic techniques to wildlife crime, including the need for standardized protocols and international cooperation. Ultimately, this paper argues that poaching forensics not only aids in the prosecution of offenders but also serves as a deterrent, contributing to the broader goals of wildlife conservation and biodiversity protection."}
