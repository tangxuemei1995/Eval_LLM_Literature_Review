{"Abstract": "Biologging and biotelemetry have revolutionized our understanding of marine animal behavior, physiology, and ecology by providing unprecedented insights into their lives and environments. These technologies enable the collection of detailed data on movement ecology, revealing patterns of migration, foraging, and habitat use that were previously obscured. Field physiology studies benefit from real-time monitoring of physiological parameters, offering a window into the stress responses and energetic demands of marine species. Furthermore, biologging devices facilitate the investigation of predatorâ€“prey interactions and social dynamics, shedding light on the complex relationships that govern marine ecosystems. Importantly, these tools also allow for the assessment of the impacts of anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and climate change, on marine life. By bridging the gap between laboratory and field studies, biologging and biotelemetry are indispensable for advancing marine conservation and management strategies."}
