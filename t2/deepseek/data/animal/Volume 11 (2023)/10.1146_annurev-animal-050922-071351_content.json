{"Abstract": "The study of vertebrate hormones and their receptors has been significantly advanced by the exploration of non-osteichthyan genomes, including those of cartilaginous fishes and cyclostomes. This research provides critical insights into the evolutionary origins and functional diversification of key hormones such as leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin. By analyzing these ancient genomes, we uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the conservation and divergence of hormone-receptor interactions across vertebrate lineages. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of gene duplication and subsequent neofunctionalization in the evolution of hormonal systems, offering a deeper understanding of their physiological roles and evolutionary trajectories. This study not only sheds light on the ancestral state of vertebrate endocrine systems but also paves the way for future research into the molecular basis of hormone action and its implications for vertebrate biology and medicine."}
