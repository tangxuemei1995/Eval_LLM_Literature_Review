{"Abstract": "Emerging human-infecting coronaviruses (CoVs) pose significant public health threats, as evidenced by recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the mechanisms of zoonotic transmission, the role of animal reservoirs, and the potential for cross-species spread is crucial for predicting and preventing future pandemics. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the animal models used to study these viruses, the zoonotic reservoirs that harbor them, and the genetic factors facilitating cross-species transmission, including recombination events that may enhance viral adaptability. We highlight the importance of surveillance in wildlife and domestic animals to identify potential sources of zoonotic CoVs and discuss strategies for mitigating the risk of spillover events. By integrating insights from virology, ecology, and epidemiology, this work aims to inform public health interventions and guide future research efforts to better understand and control the emergence of novel coronaviruses."}
