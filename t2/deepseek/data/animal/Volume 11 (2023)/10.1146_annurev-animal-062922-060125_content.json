{"Abstract": "Domestic animals play a pivotal role in the transmission and maintenance of zoonotic viral diseases, acting as reservoir hosts for both emerging and endemic pathogens. This study explores the intricate dynamics between domestic animals and zoonotic viruses, emphasizing the significance of these animals in the epidemiology of diseases that pose a threat to human health. By analyzing current literature, we identify key factors contributing to the emergence of viral zoonoses, including close human-animal interactions, environmental changes, and global trade. The concept of One Health is highlighted as a critical framework for understanding and mitigating the risks associated with zoonotic diseases, advocating for a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses human, animal, and environmental health. Our findings underscore the importance of surveillance, early detection, and collaborative efforts in preventing potential pandemics originating from domestic animal reservoirs."}
