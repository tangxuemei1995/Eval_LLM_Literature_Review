{"Abstract": "This study delves into the fascinating biology and evolutionary significance of fierce females within two distinct mammalian species: the talpid mole and the spotted hyena. Both species exhibit remarkable instances of female masculinization, a phenomenon that challenges traditional gender roles in the animal kingdom. In talpid moles, females possess ovotestes, a unique reproductive organ that combines ovarian and testicular tissues, while spotted hyena females are known for their pseudopenis, an elongated clitoris that mimics male genitalia. These anatomical adaptations are accompanied by aggressive behaviors typically associated with males, suggesting a complex interplay between genetics, hormones, and social structures in shaping these traits. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research aims to shed light on the evolutionary pressures that have led to such extraordinary adaptations, offering insights into the mechanisms of sexual differentiation and the role of aggressive behavior in female survival and reproductive success."}
