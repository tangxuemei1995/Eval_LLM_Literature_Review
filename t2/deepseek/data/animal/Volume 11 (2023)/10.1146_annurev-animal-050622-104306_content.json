{"Abstract": "In the face of global biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, zoos and aquariums have emerged as pivotal institutions for biodiversity conservation, environmental education, and scientific research. This study explores the multifaceted roles these institutions play in a rapidly changing world, focusing on their contributions to captive breeding programs, species reintroduction efforts, and the advancement of animal welfare standards. By integrating conservation biology with public engagement, zoos and aquariums not only safeguard endangered species but also foster a deeper public understanding of ecological issues and the importance of biodiversity. Through a review of current practices and case studies, this research highlights the challenges and opportunities faced by these institutions in their mission to conserve wildlife and habitats. The findings underscore the critical need for continued innovation and collaboration in conservation strategies to ensure the survival of species and the health of ecosystems worldwide."}
