{"Abstract": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, involving the cleavage and polyadenylation of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to produce mature mRNA. This process is facilitated by a complex machinery comprising endonucleases, poly(A) polymerases, and a multitude of associated factors that recognize specific sequence elements within the pre-mRNA. The addition of the poly(A) tail not only stabilizes the mRNA but also plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, influencing mRNA export, translation efficiency, and decay. Recent studies have shed light on the intricate regulatory mechanisms that govern 3′-end processing, including the interplay between transcription and processing machineries, and the impact of processing defects on cellular function and disease. Understanding the molecular details of 3′-end processing offers insights into the control of gene expression and the development of therapeutic strategies targeting mRNA processing."}
