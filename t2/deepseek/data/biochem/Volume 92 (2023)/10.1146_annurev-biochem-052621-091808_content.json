{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between translation and mRNA stability is a pivotal aspect of gene expression regulation. This study delves into the mechanisms by which codon optimality and tRNA abundance influence translation elongation rates and, consequently, mRNA decay. Codon usage, a critical factor in translation efficiency, is examined for its role in modulating mRNA stability through the recruitment of specific decay factors. By analyzing the interplay between codon optimality and tRNA availability, we uncover how these elements collectively impact the stability of mRNA transcripts. Our findings highlight the significance of translation elongation as a determinant of mRNA lifespan, offering insights into the complex regulatory networks that govern gene expression. This research underscores the importance of codon usage and tRNA dynamics in the control of mRNA stability, providing a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying protein synthesis and mRNA degradation."}
