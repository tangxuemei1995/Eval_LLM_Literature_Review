{"Abstract": "The dynamic landscape of mRNA modifications, known as the epitranscriptome, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular function. Among these modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) stands out as the most prevalent and well-studied. This review focuses on the proteins involved in the m6A modification process, categorized into three functional groups: writers, readers, and erasers. Writers, such as methyltransferases, are responsible for adding m6A marks to mRNA, while erasers, including demethylases, remove these marks, thereby reversing the modification. Readers, on the other hand, recognize and bind to m6A-modified mRNAs, influencing their fate and function. Understanding the interplay between these proteins offers insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms of the epitranscriptome and its implications in health and disease. This synthesis of current knowledge highlights the significance of m6A modification proteins in the broader context of RNA biology and their potential as therapeutic targets."}
