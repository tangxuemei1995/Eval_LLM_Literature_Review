{"Abstract": "Thiolase enzymes play a pivotal role in biochemistry, leveraging coenzyme A (CoA)–thioester chemistry to facilitate the making and breaking of carbon–carbon (C–C) bonds. This review delves into the structural and mechanistic intricacies of thiolases, highlighting their versatility as biocatalysts in various metabolic pathways, including the Claisen condensation reaction. Central to their function is the oxyanion hole, a structural feature that stabilizes transition states during catalysis. Additionally, the hydrogen-bond network and proton wire mechanisms are crucial for the precise transfer of protons, ensuring the efficiency and specificity of thiolase-catalyzed reactions. By exploring the interplay between these elements, this study sheds light on the sophisticated design of thiolases, offering insights into their potential applications in synthetic biology and industrial biocatalysis. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of thiolase activity not only advances our knowledge of enzyme mechanisms but also opens new avenues for the development of bio-based chemical processes."}
