{"Abstract": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) plays a pivotal role in the Calvin cycle, facilitating the primary step of carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. Despite its critical function, Rubisco's efficiency is hampered by its dual activity, catalyzing both carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, the latter leading to photorespiration and reduced photosynthetic efficiency. This review explores the evolutionary trajectory of Rubisco, highlighting the enzyme's adaptation to varying atmospheric CO2 and O2 concentrations over geological timescales. Furthermore, we delve into the latest advancements in enzyme engineering aimed at enhancing Rubisco's carboxylation efficiency and specificity. Through directed evolution, rational design, and synthetic biology approaches, researchers are striving to overcome the inherent limitations of Rubisco, paving the way for improved photosynthetic efficiency and crop productivity. The potential implications of these engineering efforts for sustainable agriculture and carbon sequestration are also discussed, underscoring the importance of Rubisco in addressing global challenges related to food security and climate change."}
