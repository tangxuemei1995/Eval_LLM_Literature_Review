{"Abstract": "The Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme superfamily represents a diverse group of enzymes that catalyze a wide range of biochemical reactions through the generation of radical species. Central to their mechanism is the reductive cleavage of SAM to produce a highly reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (5′-dA•), which initiates substrate turnover by abstracting a hydrogen atom. This process is facilitated by a unique [4Fe-4S] cluster that coordinates SAM in a bidentate manner, positioning it for electron transfer from the reduced cluster to the sulfonium of SAM. The resulting organometallic intermediate, featuring a direct iron-carbon bond, is a key species in the radical generation pathway. This review delves into the structural and mechanistic insights into the radical initiation process, highlighting the role of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, the nature of the organometallic intermediate, and the subsequent steps leading to the formation of the 5′-dA• radical. Understanding these mechanisms provides a foundation for exploring the vast catalytic potential of the radical SAM enzyme superfamily in both natural and synthetic contexts."}
