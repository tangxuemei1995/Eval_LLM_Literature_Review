{"Abstract": "The insulin receptor (IR) plays a pivotal role in metabolic regulation, with its activation being crucial for insulin signaling. This study delves into the structural intricacies of IR activation, employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate the molecular dynamics at play. We focus on the interaction between insulin and its receptor, particularly at insulin-binding site 1 and insulin-binding site 2, which are critical for the receptor's conformational changes leading to activation. Our findings reveal a detailed mechanism by which insulin binding induces a structural rearrangement in the IR, transitioning it from an inactive to an active state. This structural perspective not only enhances our understanding of IR activation but also provides a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting insulin signaling pathways. The implications of these findings extend to the treatment of diabetes and other metabolic disorders, offering new avenues for intervention."}
