{"Abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates. Polyamines, small aliphatic molecules involved in various cellular processes, have emerged as significant players in the pathogenesis of PD. This study explores the dual role of polyamines in PD, highlighting their potential to induce neurotoxicity through mechanisms involving endo/lysosomal dysfunction and mitochondrial impairment, while also considering their neuroprotective effects mediated by astrocyte activation. The intricate balance between these opposing actions of polyamines is crucial for understanding their impact on PD progression. By examining the interplay between polyamines, α-synuclein pathology, and cellular stress responses, this research aims to shed light on novel therapeutic strategies targeting polyamine metabolism to mitigate neurodegeneration in PD."}
