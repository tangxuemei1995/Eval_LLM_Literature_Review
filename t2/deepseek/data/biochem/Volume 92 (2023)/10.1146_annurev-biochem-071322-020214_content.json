{"Abstract": "This autobiographical account explores the intricate relationship between DNA fragility and repair mechanisms, focusing on endogenous DNA damage and base excision repair. Highlighting the role of DNA glycosylases in correcting base lesions, it reflects on how understanding these processes has illuminated pathways leading to cancer mutations, offering a personal perspective on decades of research."}
