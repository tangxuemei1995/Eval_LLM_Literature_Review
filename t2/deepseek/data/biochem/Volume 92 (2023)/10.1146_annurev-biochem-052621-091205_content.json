{"Abstract": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a critical DNA repair mechanism that specifically targets lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes, ensuring the rapid removal of DNA damage that impedes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) progression. This process is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing the accumulation of mutations that can lead to cellular dysfunction and disease. TC-NER operates in conjunction with global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), which surveys the entire genome for damage. The interplay between TC-NER and the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage highlights the complexity of cellular mechanisms that protect against the deleterious effects of environmental stressors. Defects in TC-NER are associated with severe human disorders, such as Cockayne syndrome, underscoring the importance of this repair pathway in human health. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of TC-NER, its role in the transcriptional response to DNA damage, and the implications of TC-NER dysfunction in disease."}
