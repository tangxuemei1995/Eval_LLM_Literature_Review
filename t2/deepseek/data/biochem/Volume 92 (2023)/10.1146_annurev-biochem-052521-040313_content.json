{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between cholesterol and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways plays a pivotal role in cellular development and homeostasis. Cholesterol, a critical component of biological membranes, is essential for the proper functioning of the Hh signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and tissue regeneration. This pathway is mediated through the primary cilium, a cellular organelle that acts as a signaling hub. Cholesterol modification of the Hh proteins is necessary for their activation and subsequent interaction with cell surface receptors, including the G proteinâ€“coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO). This review highlights the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol influences Hh signaling, emphasizing the importance of cholesterol in the regulation of Hh pathway activity and its implications for understanding developmental disorders and cancer."}
