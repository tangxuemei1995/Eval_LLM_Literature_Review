{"Abstract": "The regulation of mRNA by RNA modifications represents a pivotal aspect of posttranscriptional gene expression control, intricately linking the epitranscriptome to RNA metabolism. This study delves into the dynamic landscape of RNA modifications, including but not limited to N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and pseudouridine (Î¨), and their profound impact on mRNA stability, splicing, transport, and translation. By employing advanced sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, we uncover the complex regulatory networks governed by these modifications, highlighting their roles in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis. Our findings underscore the significance of RNA modifications in fine-tuning gene expression and offer insights into the therapeutic potential of targeting the epitranscriptome for the treatment of various diseases."}
