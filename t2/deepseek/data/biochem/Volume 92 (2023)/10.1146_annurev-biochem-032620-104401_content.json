{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays a pivotal role in innate immune signaling, acting as a key mediator in the body's response to cellular stress and infection. This review explores the mechanisms by which mtDNA is released into the cytosol and extracellular space, focusing on the formation of mitochondrial pores as a critical step in this process. Once released, mtDNA can be recognized by DNA sensors, triggering inflammatory pathways that are essential for host defense but can also contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases. We discuss the dual role of mtDNA in both protecting against and exacerbating disease, highlighting the delicate balance between beneficial immune activation and harmful inflammation. By examining the latest research on mtDNA release and its implications for disease, this review aims to shed light on potential therapeutic targets for modulating innate immune responses and mitigating disease progression."}
