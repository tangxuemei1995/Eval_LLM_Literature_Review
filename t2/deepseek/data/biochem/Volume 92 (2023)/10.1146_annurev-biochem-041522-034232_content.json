{"Abstract": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a vital cellular mechanism that preferentially removes bulky DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes, ensuring genomic integrity and preventing mutagenesis. This process is facilitated by transcription-repair coupling factors such as Mfd in prokaryotes and CSB in eukaryotes, which recognize stalled RNA polymerase at the site of damage and recruit the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying TCR, highlighting the intricate interplay between transcription and DNA repair pathways. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a connection between TCR and the circadian clock, indicating that DNA repair processes may be temporally regulated to optimize genomic maintenance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of TCR, emphasizing the roles of key factors, the impact of TCR on mutagenesis, and its potential regulation by the circadian clock, providing insights into the complex network of DNA damage response and repair."}
