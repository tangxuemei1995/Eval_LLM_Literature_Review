{"Abstract": "Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes play a pivotal role in the three-dimensional organization of the genome, facilitating processes such as DNA loop extrusion, which is crucial for chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. This study delves into the mechanisms by which SMC complexes, including cohesin and condensin, orchestrate the formation and maintenance of DNA loops, thereby influencing genome architecture and function. Through the integration of single-molecule studies, we explore the dynamic interactions between SMC complexes and DNA, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of loop extrusion. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how SMC complexes regulate genome organization, offering insights into their roles in cellular processes and potential implications for genetic disorders and cancer."}
