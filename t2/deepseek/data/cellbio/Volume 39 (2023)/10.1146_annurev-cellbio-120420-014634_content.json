{"Abstract": "RBG motif bridge-like lipid transport proteins (BLTPs) represent a fascinating class of proteins involved in the intracellular transport of lipids, a process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and membrane integrity. This review focuses on the structural characteristics and functional roles of key BLTP family members, including VPS13, ATG2, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164. These proteins share a conserved RBG (Ras of complex proteins, pleckstrin, and Glycolipid transfer proteins) motif, which is essential for their lipid transport activities. We delve into the mechanisms by which these proteins facilitate lipid transfer between membranes, their involvement in autophagy, and their roles in various cellular processes. Despite significant advances, many questions remain regarding the precise molecular mechanisms of lipid transport, the regulation of BLTP activity, and their interactions with other cellular components. This review highlights these open questions and suggests directions for future research to further elucidate the complex roles of BLTPs in cellular physiology and pathology."}
