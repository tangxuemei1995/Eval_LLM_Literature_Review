{"Abstract": "The study of tissue biology is undergoing a transformative shift, moving beyond the traditional focus on individual cell types to embrace a more holistic understanding of tissue organization and function. This paper explores the emerging paradigm that views tissues as complex systems composed of 'tissue modules'â€”integrated units of cells and extracellular matrix that perform specific functions. By examining the intricate relations between different cell categories and their evolutionary origins, we highlight the importance of self-organization principles in shaping tissue architecture. This new perspective not only enriches our comprehension of tissue biology but also opens novel avenues for research in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and evolutionary studies. Through a synthesis of recent findings, we argue that a deeper understanding of tissue modules and their self-organizing capabilities is crucial for unraveling the complexities of multicellular life."}
