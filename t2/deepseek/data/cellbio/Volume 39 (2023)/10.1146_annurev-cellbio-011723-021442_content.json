{"Abstract": "The endometrium undergoes dynamic changes throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and parturition, showcasing remarkable regenerative capabilities. This review explores the mechanisms underlying endometrial regeneration and fibrosis, focusing on the roles of stem cells and the impact of pathological conditions such as Asherman syndrome and intrauterine adhesions. Stem cells within the endometrium are pivotal for its cyclic regeneration and repair post-menstruation, while dysregulation in these processes can lead to fibrosis, impairing fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Asherman syndrome, characterized by intrauterine adhesions, exemplifies the delicate balance between regeneration and fibrosis, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Insights into these processes not only advance our comprehension of endometrial biology but also pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies to treat endometrial disorders, enhancing reproductive health and fertility."}
