{"Abstract": "The intricate process of retinal morphogenesis, from the initial formation of the optic cup to the complex neuronal lamination, represents a fundamental aspect of vertebrate eye development. This study delves into the dynamic mechanisms underlying the shape and growth of the retina, focusing on the pivotal role of neuronal migration in establishing its layered architecture. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and experimental data, we explore the molecular and cellular cues that orchestrate the transformation of a simple epithelial sheet into a highly organized, multi-layered structure capable of sophisticated visual processing. Key findings highlight the importance of intrinsic genetic programs and extrinsic environmental factors in guiding the precise positioning of diverse retinal cell types. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of disruptions in these processes for retinal diseases and developmental anomalies. By integrating insights from developmental biology, genetics, and neuroscience, this review aims to provide a holistic understanding of retinal morphogenesis, offering new perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in the field of ocular development and regeneration."}
