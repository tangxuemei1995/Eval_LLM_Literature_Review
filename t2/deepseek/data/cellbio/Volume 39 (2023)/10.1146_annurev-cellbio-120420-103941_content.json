{"Abstract": "Membrane receptors and their ligands play pivotal roles in cellular signaling, with their interactions traditionally categorized into cis and trans configurations. This study delves into the less explored cis interactions, where both receptor and ligand are co-expressed on the same cell surface, contrasting with the well-characterized trans interactions involving separate cells. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and experimental data, we explore the mechanisms, regulation, and functional implications of cis interactions in various signaling pathways. Our findings highlight the complexity of receptor-ligand dynamics, revealing that cis interactions can modulate signaling outcomes by competing with or enhancing trans interactions. Furthermore, we discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting cis interactions in diseases characterized by aberrant signaling. This research underscores the importance of considering both cis and trans interactions in the study of membrane receptor signaling, offering new insights into cellular communication and potential avenues for intervention."}
