{"Abstract": "The Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TORC2) plays a pivotal role in cellular growth and metabolism by regulating various signaling pathways. In yeast, TORC2 is composed of multiple subunits that orchestrate its function and localization, primarily at the plasma membrane (PM) and endosomes. This study delves into the intricate mechanisms by which TORC2 activity is modulated through its interaction with phosphoinositides and phosphorylation events. Phosphoinositides, key lipid components of the PM, are crucial for the recruitment and stabilization of TORC2 at the membrane, thereby influencing its signaling output. Additionally, phosphorylation of TORC2 subunits emerges as a critical regulatory mechanism, affecting both the complex's localization and its kinase activity. Through a comprehensive analysis of genetic and biochemical data, we uncover the dynamic interplay between TORC2, phosphoinositides, and phosphorylation, shedding light on the complex regulatory network that governs TORC2 function in yeast. This research provides foundational insights into the spatial and temporal control of TORC2 signaling, with implications for understanding cellular homeostasis and disease."}
