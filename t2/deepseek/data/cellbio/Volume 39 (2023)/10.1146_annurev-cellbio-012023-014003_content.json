{"Abstract": "The Mexican Tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a pivotal model system in the fields of cell and developmental biology, offering unique insights into the mechanisms of evolution and development (evo-devo). This species comprises both surface-dwelling and cave-adapted populations, providing a natural experiment to study the genetic and developmental bases of evolutionary adaptation. Cavefish populations of A. mexicanus exhibit a suite of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits that have evolved in response to the extreme cave environment, including loss of pigmentation and eyes, enhanced sensory systems, and changes in feeding behavior. These traits make the Mexican Tetra an invaluable model for understanding the genetic underpinnings of developmental plasticity and evolutionary change. By leveraging the comparative biology of surface and cave morphs, researchers can dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving these adaptations, shedding light on fundamental processes in development and evolution. The Mexican Tetra thus stands as a testament to the power of natural selection and developmental biology in shaping the diversity of life."}
