{"Abstract": "Transfer RNA (tRNA) plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis, acting as the molecular bridge between mRNA and amino acids. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of tRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the multifaceted roles of tRNA, including its aminoacylation by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, post-transcriptional modifications, and splicing processes, in maintaining neuronal health. Furthermore, we delve into the impact of angiogenin-mediated tRNA cleavage and the activation of the integrated stress response on neuronal function and survival. By synthesizing current evidence, this paper aims to elucidate the complex interplay between tRNA biology and neurological disorders, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the mechanisms underlying tRNA dysregulation could pave the way for novel interventions in the treatment of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases."}
