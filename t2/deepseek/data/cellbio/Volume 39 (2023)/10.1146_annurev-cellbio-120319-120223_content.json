{"Abstract": "The Toll signaling pathway, initially recognized for its pivotal role in innate immunity across diverse taxa, has undergone neofunctionalization in insects, extending its influence to embryonic dorsoventral (DV) patterning. This study explores the evolutionary trajectory of Toll signaling in insects, focusing on model organisms such as Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus, alongside non-insect hexapods, to elucidate its dual functionality. Through comparative analysis, we investigate the pathway's contribution to germ layer evolution, particularly in mesoderm formation, and its involvement in the development of extraembryonic tissues like the serosa and the synthesis of serosal and blastodermal cuticles. Our findings highlight the adaptive significance of Toll signaling in orchestrating complex developmental processes, underscoring its evolutionary plasticity from a primitive immune response mechanism to a sophisticated regulator of embryonic patterning in insects."}
