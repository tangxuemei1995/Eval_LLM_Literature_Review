{"Abstract": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex biological process that relies on the dynamic interactions between cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM). This study delves into the pivotal roles of cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins and cadherins, in mediating these interactions. Integrins facilitate cell-ECM adhesion, influencing cell signaling and mechanical properties, while cadherins are crucial for cell-cell adhesion, affecting tissue cohesion and architecture. The basement membrane, a specialized ECM structure, serves as a scaffold for tissue organization and a signaling platform for cellular activities. Interfacial tension, a physical property arising from the differential adhesion and contractility of cells, is also explored as a driving force in tissue shaping and compartmentalization. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, this research highlights the intricate balance between biochemical signaling and biophysical forces in tissue morphogenesis, offering insights into the fundamental principles governing tissue development and regeneration."}
