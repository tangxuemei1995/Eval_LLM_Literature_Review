{"Abstract": "This study employs advanced fluorescence microscopy to track the dynamic lifecycle of mRNAs within single cells, from transcription and splicing to localization, translation, and eventual decay. By visualizing these processes in real-time, we uncover the intricate spatial and temporal regulation of mRNA molecules, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying gene expression control. Our findings provide unprecedented insights into the cellular dynamics of mRNA, offering a deeper understanding of how cells regulate protein synthesis and respond to environmental changes at the molecular level."}
