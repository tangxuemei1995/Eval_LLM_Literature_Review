{"Abstract": "The intricate and diverse skin color patterns observed in vertebrates have long fascinated biologists and mathematicians alike. This study explores the remarkable efficacy of reaction-diffusion (RD) systems, initially proposed by Alan Turing, in explaining the formation of these patterns. By integrating principles from cellular automata and phenomenological models, we demonstrate how RD mechanisms can generate complex, sequential patterning akin to those found in nature. Through computational simulations and comparative analysis with empirical data, we validate the hypothesis that RD processes underpin the spatial organization of pigments in vertebrate skin. Our findings suggest that the interplay between local activation and long-range inhibition, a hallmark of RD systems, is sufficient to produce a wide array of patterns, from simple spots to intricate stripes. This research not only underscores the versatility of RD models in biological pattern formation but also provides a robust framework for future investigations into the genetic and molecular bases of skin coloration in vertebrates."}
