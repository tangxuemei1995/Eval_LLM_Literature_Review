{"Abstract": "The tubulin code represents a sophisticated regulatory mechanism that governs the functional diversity of microtubules, crucial cytoskeletal elements involved in numerous cellular processes. This code is defined by the expression of specific tubulin isoforms and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation. These modifications confer unique properties to microtubules, influencing their stability, dynamics, and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motors. The precise regulation of the tubulin code is essential for normal cellular function, and its dysregulation has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and ciliopathies. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the tubulin code, its impact on cellular physiology, and its implications for health and disease. Understanding the tubulin code offers promising avenues for therapeutic intervention, highlighting the importance of further research in this field."}
