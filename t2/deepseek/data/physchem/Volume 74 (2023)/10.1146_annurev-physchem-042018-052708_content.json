{"Abstract": "The formation of stable glasses through physical vapor deposition has emerged as a pivotal area of research, offering insights into the glass transition and the role of surface-mediated equilibration. This study delves into the mechanisms by which enhanced surface mobility facilitates the creation of glasses with exceptional stability and structural anisotropy. By examining the interplay between surface dynamics and bulk properties, we uncover the conditions under which stable glasses can be synthesized, highlighting the significance of deposition parameters in tailoring glass properties. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the glass transition process, paving the way for the development of materials with optimized performance for technological applications. This research underscores the potential of surface-mediated approaches in advancing the field of glass science."}
