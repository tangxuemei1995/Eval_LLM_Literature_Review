{"Abstract": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) has become a pivotal tool in biological imaging due to its unique fluorescence properties. This study delves into the intricate photoacid dynamics of GFP, employing ultrafast spectroscopy to unravel the mechanisms underlying its photophysical behavior. We focus on the role of proton tunneling and coherence in the excited state proton transfer (ESPT) process, which is crucial for the protein's fluorescence. Stimulated Raman spectroscopy is utilized to probe the vibrational modes associated with the chromophore and its immediate environment, providing insights into the structural dynamics that facilitate ESPT. Our findings shed light on the interplay between electronic and nuclear motions in GFP, offering a deeper understanding of its photoacidic properties and paving the way for the design of novel fluorescent markers with enhanced performance for biological applications."}
