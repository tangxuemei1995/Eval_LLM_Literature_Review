{"Abstract": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) stands as a cornerstone in the computational study of electronic structure, offering a balance between accuracy and computational feasibility. This research delves into the pivotal role of exact constraints and appropriate norms in enhancing the predictive power of DFT, particularly in the accurate determination of exchange-correlation energy. By systematically integrating exact constraints derived from physical principles and employing appropriate norms for the assessment of density functionals, we aim to refine the theoretical framework of DFT. Our investigation reveals that the judicious application of these constraints and norms significantly improves the accuracy of electronic structure predictions, thereby extending the applicability of DFT to a broader range of materials and chemical systems. This study underscores the importance of methodological rigor in the development of density functionals, paving the way for more reliable and precise computational tools in quantum chemistry and materials science."}
