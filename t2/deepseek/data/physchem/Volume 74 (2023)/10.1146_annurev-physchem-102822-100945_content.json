{"Abstract": "The study of excited states in molecular organic aggregates is pivotal for advancing optoelectronic applications, including organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. This research delves into the complex excited-state dynamics, focusing on radiative and nonradiative decay processes, conical intersections, and exciton models that govern the behavior of these systems. By employing advanced computational techniques, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms of singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation, which are crucial for enhancing the efficiency of energy conversion and light emission in organic materials. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the photophysical properties of molecular aggregates, offering insights into the design of novel materials with optimized optoelectronic performance. This work underscores the importance of theoretical modeling in predicting and controlling the excited-state dynamics of organic aggregates for future technological innovations."}
