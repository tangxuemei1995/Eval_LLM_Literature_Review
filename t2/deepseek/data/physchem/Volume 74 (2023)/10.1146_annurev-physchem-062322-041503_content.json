{"Abstract": "This study delves into the spectroscopic analysis of atmospheric clusters, pivotal in understanding new particle formation (NPF) and their subsequent impact on climate dynamics. Atmospheric aerosols, originating from both natural and anthropogenic sources, play a crucial role in climate regulation by influencing cloud formation and the Earth's radiative balance. Through advanced spectroscopic techniques, we investigate the molecular composition, structure, and interactions of these clusters, shedding light on the initial stages of aerosol formation. Our findings contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms driving NPF, offering insights into the complex processes that govern atmospheric chemistry and climate change. This research underscores the importance of spectroscopic studies in atmospheric science, providing a foundation for predictive models of aerosol behavior and their climatic effects. The outcomes of this study are instrumental in advancing our understanding of atmospheric processes and in formulating strategies for climate mitigation."}
