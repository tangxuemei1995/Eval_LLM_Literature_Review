{"Abstract": "Photochemical upconversion (UC) represents a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency of solar energy conversion by converting low-energy photons into higher-energy, more usable light. This process primarily relies on tripletâ€“triplet annihilation (TTA) between sensitizer and chromophore molecules, overcoming the spin statistical limit to achieve efficient energy transfer. The kinetics of TTA, influenced by factors such as the magnetic field effect, plays a crucial role in determining the upconversion quantum yield. This study explores the optimization of sensitizer-chromophore pairs to maximize UC efficiency, focusing on the interplay between molecular design, photophysical properties, and external conditions. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying TTA and its impact on UC performance, this research aims to contribute to the development of advanced materials for solar energy harvesting and light-emitting applications."}
