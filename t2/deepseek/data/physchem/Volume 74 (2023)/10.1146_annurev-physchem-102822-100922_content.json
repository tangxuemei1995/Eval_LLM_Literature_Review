{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate optical signatures arising from stochastic processes in many-body exciton scattering, a phenomenon pivotal to understanding quantum dynamics in condensed matter systems. By employing coherent nonlinear spectroscopy, we explore the nuanced interplay between excitation-induced dephasing and many-body effects, which significantly influence the quantum coherence and energy transfer mechanisms. The research leverages quantum stochastic calculus to model the unpredictable behavior of excitons, providing a robust framework to decipher the complex interactions and their optical manifestations. Our findings reveal distinctive patterns in the optical response, attributed to the stochastic nature of exciton scattering, offering new insights into the quantum mechanical underpinnings of many-body systems. This work not only advances our comprehension of quantum dynamics but also paves the way for innovative approaches in the design and analysis of quantum materials and devices."}
