{"Abstract": "The quest for efficient and accurate methods to discover chemical reactions has led to the development of the Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method, a promising approach for ab initio reaction discovery. This method leverages quantum chemical calculations to explore potential energy surfaces (PES) and construct reaction path networks, enabling the identification of novel reaction pathways without prior knowledge of the transition states. By applying artificial forces to molecular systems, AFIR facilitates the exploration of complex PES landscapes, uncovering both expected and unexpected reaction mechanisms. The integration of kinetic simulations further allows for the assessment of reaction feasibility and selectivity, providing valuable insights for organic synthesis. This study highlights the potential of AFIR in revolutionizing reaction discovery by offering a systematic and unbiased exploration of chemical space, thereby accelerating the development of new synthetic methodologies and the discovery of novel chemical entities."}
