{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy in probing elementary molecular events, with a particular focus on the dynamics at conical intersectionsâ€”critical points where potential energy surfaces intersect, facilitating non-adiabatic transitions in photochemical processes. Utilizing the unparalleled temporal and spatial resolution of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), we investigate the real-time electronic and structural dynamics of molecules undergoing photochemical reactions. Our approach leverages the unique capabilities of XFELs to capture snapshots of molecular structures with femtosecond precision, enabling the observation of transient states and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms at the quantum level. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of photochemical pathways, offering insights into the control and manipulation of chemical reactions at the molecular scale. This research underscores the potential of ultrafast X-ray probes in advancing the field of photochemistry and spectroscopy, paving the way for novel applications in material science, energy conversion, and molecular biology."}
