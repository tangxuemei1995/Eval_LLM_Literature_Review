{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel approach for the in situ measurement of evolving excited-state dynamics during the deposition and processing of organic films, utilizing single-shot transient absorption spectroscopy. The development of a specialized instrument design enables real-time monitoring of molecular aggregation and the effects of thermal annealing on organic thin films. By capturing transient absorption signals in a single shot, this method offers unprecedented temporal resolution and sensitivity, allowing for the detailed observation of dynamic processes as they occur. The findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of film formation and the optimization of processing conditions for enhanced performance of organic electronic devices. This research not only advances our understanding of excited-state dynamics in organic materials but also establishes a powerful tool for the in situ characterization of thin films during their fabrication and post-processing stages."}
