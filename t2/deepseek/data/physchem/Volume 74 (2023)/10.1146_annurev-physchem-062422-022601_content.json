{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging of microgels, leveraging advanced nanoscopy techniques to overcome the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy. Microgels, as adaptive materials with intricate polymer networks, play a pivotal role in various applications ranging from drug delivery to tissue engineering. However, their dynamic behavior and structural complexity at the nanoscale have remained elusive. By integrating fluorescence labeling with state-of-the-art super-resolution microscopy, we achieve unprecedented spatial resolution in three dimensions, enabling detailed visualization of the internal architecture and dynamics of microgels. Furthermore, the application of 3D tracking and correlative microscopy provides insights into the real-time interactions and environmental responsiveness of these materials. This work not only advances our understanding of microgel systems but also opens new avenues for the design and optimization of adaptive materials with tailored properties for specific applications."}
