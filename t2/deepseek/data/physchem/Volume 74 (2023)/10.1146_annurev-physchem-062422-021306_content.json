{"Abstract": "The accurate modeling of vibrational spectra, particularly for high-frequency modes, necessitates a comprehensive understanding of anharmonic effects, which significantly influence the vibrational dynamics and energy transfer in molecular systems. This study delves into the intricate role of anharmonicities and mode mixing in shaping the vibrational spectra, with a focus on identifying and characterizing resonances that arise due to these interactions. By employing advanced computational techniques and theoretical frameworks, we explore the impact of anharmonic couplings on the spectral features, including frequency shifts, intensity alterations, and the emergence of combination bands. Our analysis reveals that anharmonic effects not only modify the vibrational frequencies but also facilitate energy redistribution among modes, leading to complex spectral patterns. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating anharmonic corrections in vibrational spectroscopy to achieve a more accurate interpretation of experimental data. This research contributes to the broader understanding of molecular vibrations and provides valuable insights for the design of materials with tailored vibrational properties."}
