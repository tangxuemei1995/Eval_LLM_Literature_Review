{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder through the innovative application of site-specific exciton-coupled dimer (ECD) probe spectroscopy. By integrating 2D spectroscopy techniques with site-specific fluorescence labeling, we provide unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying proteinâ€“DNA interactions and DNA replication processes. Our approach leverages the sensitivity of ECD probes to detect subtle changes in DNA breathing and backbone flexibility, offering a novel perspective on the conformational landscape of DNA. The findings highlight the potential of ECD spectroscopy as a powerful tool for dissecting the complex interplay between DNA structure and function, paving the way for future research in molecular biology and biophysics. This work not only advances our understanding of DNA dynamics but also opens new avenues for the study of nucleic acid interactions at the molecular level."}
