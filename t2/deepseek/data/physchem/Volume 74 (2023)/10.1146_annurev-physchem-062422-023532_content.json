{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate many-body effects in aqueous systems, emphasizing the synergies between advanced interaction analysis techniques and the development of polarizable force fields. By integrating the many-body expansion approach with molecular dynamics simulations, we aim to enhance the accuracy of modeling intermolecular interactions in water. The research focuses on the critical role of polarization and non-additive effects, which are often overlooked in traditional force fields. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate how the incorporation of these effects can significantly improve the predictive power of molecular simulations, leading to a deeper understanding of the structural and dynamic properties of aqueous systems. Our findings highlight the importance of developing sophisticated force fields that accurately capture the complex nature of water interactions, paving the way for more reliable simulations in biophysics, chemistry, and materials science."}
