{"Abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into materials science has revolutionized the way we predict, discover, and design new materials. Central to this advancement is the development of effective representations of materials that capture their essential features for ML models. This abstract explores the critical role of representation and feature engineering in enhancing the performance of ML applications in materials science, with a particular focus on crystal structures. We delve into various strategies for encoding materials' properties, including compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors, and discuss their impact on predictive modeling and generative design. Furthermore, we highlight recent progress in generative models that leverage sophisticated representations to propose novel materials with desired properties. By bridging the gap between materials science and ML, this work underscores the importance of innovative representation techniques in accelerating materials discovery and optimization."}
