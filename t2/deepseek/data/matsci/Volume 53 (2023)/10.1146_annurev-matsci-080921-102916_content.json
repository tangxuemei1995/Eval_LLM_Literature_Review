{"Abstract": "The advent of soft robotics has ushered in a new era of machines that mimic the adaptability and versatility of biological organisms. Central to this innovation are electrically controllable materials, which serve as the cornerstone for the development of soft, bioinspired machines. These materials, capable of undergoing significant deformation in response to electrical stimuli, enable the creation of actuators that are both highly efficient and multifunctional. This research delves into the latest advancements in robotic materials, focusing on their application in soft robotics. By drawing inspiration from nature, we explore the synthesis and characterization of materials that can replicate the complex movements and functionalities of biological systems. The integration of these materials into soft robotic systems promises to revolutionize the field, offering unprecedented levels of control, adaptability, and efficiency. This study highlights the potential of electrically controllable materials in paving the way for the next generation of bioinspired machines, setting a new benchmark for innovation in robotics."}
