{"Abstract": "Grain boundary migration plays a pivotal role in determining the microstructure and properties of polycrystalline materials. This study delves into the mechanisms and kinetics of grain boundary migration, focusing on its impact on grain growth and the evolution of microstructural characteristics. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we explore the factors influencing grain boundary mobility, including temperature, grain boundary energy, and the presence of impurities. The analysis highlights the interplay between grain boundary migration and the overall grain growth process, shedding light on the dynamic nature of microstructural development in polycrystals. Furthermore, the study discusses the implications of grain boundary migration for material properties, such as mechanical strength and electrical conductivity. By integrating theoretical models with empirical observations, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of grain boundary dynamics and its significance in materials science and engineering."}
