{"Abstract": "This study explores the transformative potential of dynamic in situ electron microscopy in the realm of single-atom catalysis, a cutting-edge area of chemical research. By leveraging the unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution of in situ microscopy, we delve into the live-action dynamics of catalytic processes at the atomic level. Our research focuses on the real-time observation of single-atom catalysts (SACs) during chemical reactions, providing unprecedented insights into their structural evolution, stability, and activity. Through the integration of advanced imaging techniques and computational modeling, we aim to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying catalytic efficiency and selectivity. This work not only advances our fundamental understanding of single-atom catalysis but also paves the way for the design of more effective and sustainable catalytic materials. Our findings underscore the critical role of dynamic in situ microscopy in pushing the boundaries of chemical research, offering a new paradigm for the study of catalytic processes at the atomic scale."}
