{"Abstract": "Engineered wood represents a pivotal advancement in sustainable materials, integrating innovative technologies to enhance its properties and applications. This study explores the integration of nanocellulose and the development of transparent wood, highlighting their roles in promoting sustainability and improving thermal management. Nanocellulose, derived from wood fibers, offers exceptional strength and lightweight characteristics, making it an ideal reinforcement in engineered wood products. Transparent wood, achieved through the removal of lignin and infusion with polymers, emerges as a promising material for energy-efficient building applications, offering superior insulation and light transmittance. The research underscores the potential of engineered wood in reducing the environmental footprint of construction materials, while providing solutions for thermal regulation in buildings. Through a comprehensive analysis of current technologies and applications, this paper advocates for the broader adoption of engineered wood in sustainable development initiatives, emphasizing its benefits in energy conservation and environmental preservation."}
