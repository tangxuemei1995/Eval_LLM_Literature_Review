{"Abstract": "The quest for sustainable materials has led to significant advancements in the development of polymers derived from biological matter. This research explores the synthesis and application of biopolymers and biocomposites, emphasizing their role in reducing environmental impact and reliance on non-renewable resources. By harnessing renewable resources, these materials offer a promising alternative to conventional polymers, particularly in industries such as construction, where cementitious materials are prevalent. The study highlights the latest progress in the field, including innovative processing techniques and the integration of biopolymers into existing manufacturing frameworks. Furthermore, it examines the challenges and opportunities associated with the adoption of these sustainable materials, from scalability and cost-effectiveness to performance and durability. The findings underscore the potential of biopolymers and biocomposites to contribute to a more sustainable future, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change and promote environmental stewardship."}
