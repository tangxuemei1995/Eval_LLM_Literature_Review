{"Abstract": "Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has emerged as a pivotal tool in materials science, offering unparalleled insights into the atomic structure and composition of materials. This study delves into the quantitative aspects of STEM, encompassing imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and tomography, to provide a comprehensive understanding of material properties at the nanoscale. By integrating advanced simulation techniques with experimental data, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of quantitative analysis, facilitating the exploration of complex material behaviors. Our approach not only advances the capabilities of STEM in characterizing materials but also bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. This research underscores the significance of STEM in driving innovations in materials science, offering a robust framework for the development of new materials with tailored properties for a wide range of applications."}
