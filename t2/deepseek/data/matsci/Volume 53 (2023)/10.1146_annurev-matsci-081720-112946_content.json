{"Abstract": "The incorporation of tailor-made additives into melt crystallization processes has emerged as a sophisticated strategy to control the morphology, chirality, and polarity of molecular crystals. This study delves into the rationale behind the use of such additives, exploring their impact on the formation of spherulites and twisted crystals, which are pivotal in determining the physical properties of the final crystalline product. By systematically analyzing the interactions between additives and host molecules during the melt crystallization process, we uncover the mechanisms through which these additives influence crystal growth and morphology. The investigation highlights the potential of tailor-made additives to induce chirality and polarity in otherwise achiral or non-polar crystals, offering a pathway to engineer materials with desired optical and electronic properties. However, the study also addresses the challenges and limitations associated with the use of these additives, including the complexity of predicting their effects and the potential for unintended consequences on crystal quality. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements and case studies, this research provides insights into the strategic use of tailor-made additives in melt crystallization, offering a balanced perspective on their benefits and drawbacks."}
