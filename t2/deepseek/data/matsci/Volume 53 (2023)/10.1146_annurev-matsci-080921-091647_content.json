{"Abstract": "This study delves into the phenomenon of extreme abnormal grain growth (AGG), a critical process in materials science that significantly influences the microstructural evolution of polycrystalline materials. By integrating theoretical models with experimental observations, we explore the intricate interplay between grain boundary energy, grain boundary mobility, and Zener pinning effects in driving AGG. Our analysis reveals that the mechanisms underlying AGG are not only governed by the thermodynamic driving forces but are also intricately linked to the kinetic pathways that dictate grain growth dynamics. We further investigate how these mechanisms culminate in the formation of grain growthâ€“induced microstructures, highlighting the role of local heterogeneities and boundary conditions in shaping the final microstructural outcomes. This comprehensive understanding paves the way for the strategic manipulation of AGG processes, offering new avenues for the design and optimization of materials with tailored microstructural properties for advanced applications."}
