{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intriguing realm of low-dimensional and confined ice, exploring its unique structural, optical, and mechanical properties. By leveraging advanced crystal growth techniques and comprehensive characterization methods, we investigate the morphology and interface dynamics of ice under confinement. Our findings reveal that the low-dimensional structure of ice significantly influences its physical properties, leading to deviations from bulk ice behavior. The optical properties of confined ice exhibit notable changes, attributed to the altered electronic and vibrational states in reduced dimensions. Furthermore, mechanical property assessments indicate enhanced strength and flexibility, suggesting potential applications in nanotechnology and materials science. This research not only advances our understanding of ice in confined geometries but also opens new avenues for the development of ice-based materials with tailored properties for specific technological applications."}
