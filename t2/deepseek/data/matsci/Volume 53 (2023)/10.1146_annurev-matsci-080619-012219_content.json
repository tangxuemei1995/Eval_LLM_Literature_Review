{"Abstract": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for dynamically tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of materials, offering unprecedented control over their functional characteristics. This approach leverages the application of an electric field to modulate the carrier density at the interface between an ionic liquid and a material, enabling the exploration of novel physical phenomena. Transition metal oxides, magnetic thin films, and van der Waals 2D materials have been particularly responsive to ionic gating, exhibiting significant changes in conductivity, magnetism, and even superconductivity. The ability to precisely control these properties opens new avenues for the development of advanced electronic devices, including neuromorphic computing systems that mimic the neural architecture of the human brain. This review highlights recent advancements in ionic gating, focusing on its application to various material systems and its potential to revolutionize the field of condensed matter physics and device engineering."}
