{"Abstract": "Noncentrosymmetric materials have garnered significant attention due to their unique physical properties and potential applications in nonlinear optics, magnetism, and topological phenomena. This study delves into the design principles underpinning these materials, focusing on their electronic structure and its influence on nonlinear optical responses, magnetic behaviors, and the emergence of skyrmions with topological protection. By leveraging advanced computational methods and experimental techniques, we explore the intricate relationship between symmetry breaking and the resultant physical properties. Our findings highlight the critical role of crystal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and electron correlation in tailoring the functionalities of noncentrosymmetric materials. Furthermore, we discuss strategies for enhancing nonlinear optical efficiencies and stabilizing skyrmions for spintronic applications. This research provides a comprehensive framework for the rational design of noncentrosymmetric materials, paving the way for novel technological advancements in photonics, magnetism, and quantum computing."}
