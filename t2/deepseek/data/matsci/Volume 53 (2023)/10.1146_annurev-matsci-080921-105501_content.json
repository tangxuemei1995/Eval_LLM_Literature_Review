{"Abstract": "Polar metals, a unique class of materials that combine metallic conductivity with polar structural distortions, challenge the conventional dichotomy between insulating ferroelectrics and non-polar metals. This review delves into the fundamental principles underlying the coexistence of polarity and metallicity, focusing on the role of crystal symmetry, electron-phonon coupling, and the mechanisms that allow polar distortions to persist in the presence of free charge carriers. We explore the diverse family of polar metals, with particular emphasis on perovskite oxides, which exhibit a rich variety of polar and metallic behaviors due to their structural flexibility and strong electronic correlations. The concept of improper ferroelectricity, where polar distortions are driven by non-polar order parameters, is highlighted as a key mechanism for stabilizing polar metals. Finally, we discuss the prospects for polar metals in next-generation electronic devices, including non-volatile memory, sensors, and energy-efficient computing, underscoring the potential for these materials to bridge the gap between ferroelectric and metallic functionalities."}
