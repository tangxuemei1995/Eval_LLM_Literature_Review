{"Abstract": "Microgreens, the young seedlings of vegetables and herbs, have garnered significant attention for their dense nutritional profile and potential contributions to food security. This comprehensive update delves into the most recent developments in microgreen production systems, highlighting innovative approaches for both home and commercial farming. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in microgreen cultivation is explored, showcasing how smart technologies can optimize growth conditions, enhance yield, and reduce resource consumption. Furthermore, the paper examines the burgeoning field of space farming, where microgreens are considered a viable option for providing fresh produce in extraterrestrial environments. By analyzing current research and technological advancements, this study aims to provide insights into the sustainable production of microgreens, addressing the challenges of modern agriculture and the potential for microgreens to play a pivotal role in future food systems on Earth and beyond."}
