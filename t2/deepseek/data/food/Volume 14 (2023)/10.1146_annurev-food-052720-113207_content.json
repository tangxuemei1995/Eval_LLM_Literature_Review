{"Abstract": "Microbubbles, characterized by their minute size and high surface area to volume ratio, are emerging as a transformative technology in the food industry. This review explores the application of microbubbles in enhancing food safety, security, and sustainability, alongside their role in the development of novel foods. By leveraging the unique properties of microbubbles, such as their ability to improve mass transfer and microbial inactivation, this technology offers innovative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in food technology. The integration of microbubbles into food processing and preservation techniques not only promises to extend shelf life and reduce food waste but also contributes to the creation of healthier and more sustainable food products. This paper highlights the potential of microbubbles to revolutionize food technology, paving the way for a more secure and sustainable food future."}
