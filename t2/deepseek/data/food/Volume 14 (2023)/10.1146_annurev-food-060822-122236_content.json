{"Abstract": "Ergothioneine (ET), a naturally occurring thiol compound derived from dietary sources, has garnered significant attention for its unique antioxidant properties. Unlike other antioxidants, ET is specifically transported into cells via the OCTN1 transporter, highlighting its distinct biological role. This review explores the multifaceted functions of ET, emphasizing its potent anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. ET's ability to mitigate oxidative stress and protect cellular components, particularly mitochondria, underscores its potential in combating various oxidative stress-related diseases. The paper delves into the mechanisms underlying ET's protective actions, including its role in scavenging reactive oxygen species and preserving mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the implications of ET's unique uptake mechanism and its potential therapeutic applications are discussed, offering insights into the broader context of diet-derived antioxidants in health and disease prevention."}
