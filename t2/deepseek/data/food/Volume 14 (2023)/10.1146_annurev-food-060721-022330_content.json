{"Abstract": "Mechano-bactericidal surfaces represent a groundbreaking approach in combating microbial contamination, leveraging physical mechanisms to inactivate bacteria without the use of chemicals. This review delves into the underlying principles of these surfaces, exploring how nanofabrication techniques can be tailored to create structures that mechanically disrupt bacterial cells. With a focus on applications within the food industry, the potential of mechano-bactericidal surfaces for enhancing the safety and longevity of food-contact surfaces, processing equipment, and packaging is examined. The prospects for integrating these antimicrobial technologies into food systems are discussed, highlighting their role in reducing microbial load and improving food safety."}
