{"Abstract": "Bovine colostrum, the first milk produced by cows after calving, is rich in immunoglobulins, bioactive proteins, and other nutrients, making it a valuable resource for both veterinary and human health applications. This critical review explores the therapeutic potential of bovine colostrum, focusing on its role in enhancing immune function, promoting gut health, and supporting overall well-being in animals and humans. The paper also examines the use of bovine colostrum in functional foods and its efficacy in preventing and treating various diseases. Despite its promising benefits, challenges related to standardization, safety, and regulatory approval are discussed, highlighting the need for further research to fully harness its potential."}
