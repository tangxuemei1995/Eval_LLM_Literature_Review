{"Abstract": "This study explores innovative strategies to enhance the efficacy of phenolic antioxidants in emulsions by targeting their interfacial location. Lipid oxidation, a major cause of food spoilage, is significantly influenced by the distribution of antioxidants within the emulsion matrix. Phenolic antioxidants, known for their potent radical scavenging activity, are more effective when positioned at the oilâ€“water interface, where oxidation primarily occurs. The research delves into the design of phenolipids, amphiphilic derivatives of phenolic compounds, which spontaneously migrate to the interface, thereby optimizing their antioxidant potential. Furthermore, the concept of antioxidant reservoirs is introduced, proposing a controlled release mechanism to maintain antioxidant activity over time. The findings highlight the benefits of interfacial targeting, including improved oxidative stability of emulsions and extended shelf-life of food products. This approach offers a promising avenue for the development of more effective antioxidant delivery systems in the food industry."}
