{"Abstract": "The exploration of novel colloidal food ingredients has led to significant advancements in the development of protein complexes and conjugates, which are pivotal in enhancing the nutritional and functional properties of food products. This research delves into the intricate interactions between proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols, focusing on the formation of complexes and conjugates that exhibit improved solubility, stability, and bioactivity. Through a comprehensive review of recent studies, we highlight the mechanisms underlying the formation of these colloidal structures, including covalent and non-covalent interactions. The potential applications of these novel ingredients in food systems are vast, ranging from texture modification and emulsification to the encapsulation of bioactive compounds. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of understanding the structure-function relationship of protein complexes and conjugates to optimize their performance in food applications. The findings presented herein contribute to the growing body of knowledge on colloidal food ingredients, paving the way for innovative solutions in food science and technology."}
