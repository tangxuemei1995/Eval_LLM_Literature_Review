{"Abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into food safety protocols offers a transformative approach to safeguarding public health. This research explores the multifaceted role of AI, particularly through machine learning, computer vision, and predictive analytics, in enhancing the safety and integrity of the food supply chain. Machine learning algorithms are adept at analyzing vast datasets to identify patterns and predict potential contamination events before they occur, enabling proactive measures. Computer vision technology, on the other hand, provides real-time monitoring and quality control by visually inspecting food products for defects or contamination at various stages of the supply chain. Furthermore, predictive analytics can forecast supply chain disruptions and assess risk factors, ensuring a more resilient food distribution network. By leveraging these AI technologies, stakeholders can significantly reduce the incidence of foodborne illnesses, improve compliance with safety regulations, and foster consumer trust in the food system. This study underscores the potential of AI as a critical tool in the ongoing effort to enhance food safety and public health outcomes."}
