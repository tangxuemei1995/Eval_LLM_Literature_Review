{"Abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in human health, with dietary fiber serving as a key modulator of its composition and function. This study explores the potential of predicting personalized responses to dietary fiber interventions, focusing on the opportunities for modulating the gut microbiome to enhance health outcomes. By leveraging the concept of precision nutrition, we investigate the interplay between dietary fibers, the gut microbiome, and host metabolism, with a particular emphasis on the role of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in fiber degradation. Our findings suggest that individual variations in the gut microbiome's capacity to ferment dietary fibers can significantly influence the efficacy of prebiotic interventions. This research underscores the importance of a personalized approach to dietary recommendations, aiming to optimize gut microbiome modulation for improved health and disease prevention. The insights gained pave the way for the development of targeted dietary strategies that harness the therapeutic potential of the gut microbiome."}
