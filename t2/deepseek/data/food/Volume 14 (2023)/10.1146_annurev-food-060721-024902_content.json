{"Abstract": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous iron-storage protein, exhibits a dual functionality contingent upon its form: holo ferritin for iron supplementation and apo ferritin as a delivery system. This study elucidates the mechanisms underlying these roles, highlighting the structural adaptability of ferritin that enables it to sequester and release iron in a controlled manner. Holo ferritin, loaded with iron, serves as an efficient vehicle for iron supplementation, addressing iron deficiency with minimal side effects. Conversely, apo ferritin, devoid of iron, emerges as a promising nanocarrier for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, owing to its biocompatibility, stability, and ability to encapsulate diverse molecules. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements, this research underscores the potential of ferritin in both nutritional and pharmaceutical applications, paving the way for innovative strategies in iron supplementation and drug delivery systems."}
