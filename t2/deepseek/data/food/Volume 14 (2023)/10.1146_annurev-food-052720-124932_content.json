{"Abstract": "This study investigates the molecular alterations in meat proteins during various processing techniques and their consequential effects on quality and nutritional values. Through comprehensive analysis, we explore how processing methods such as heating, curing, and fermentation induce structural changes in proteins, affecting their digestibility, bioavailability, and potential health risks. The research highlights the balance between enhancing meat's sensory attributes and preserving its nutritional integrity, emphasizing the importance of optimizing processing conditions to minimize adverse health impacts. Our findings aim to contribute to the development of healthier meat products by understanding the molecular basis of protein changes and their implications for human nutrition and health."}
