{"Abstract": "Starch, a vital carbohydrate in the human diet, plays a crucial role in food processing and product development due to its versatile functionalities. However, native starch often falls short in meeting the specific requirements of various industrial applications, necessitating modifications to enhance its properties. This review focuses on enzymatic approaches as a sustainable and efficient strategy for structuring starch to improve its functionality. Enzymatic modification offers precise control over the molecular structure of starch, enabling the tailoring of its physicochemical properties to suit specific applications. By exploring the relationship between the molecular structure of enzymatically modified starch and its functionality, this paper highlights the potential of enzymatic strategies in enhancing starch's performance in food and non-food industries. The applications of enzymatically structured starch are vast, ranging from improved texture and stability in food products to novel uses in biodegradable plastics and drug delivery systems. This review underscores the importance of enzymatic approaches in advancing starch-based materials, offering insights into future research directions for optimizing starch functionality through enzymatic structuring."}
