{"Abstract": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has emerged as a pivotal tool in the study of food digestion, offering a standardized method to simulate the complex processes occurring in the human gastrointestinal tract. This review explores the applications of the INFOGEST model across various food types, emphasizing its role in assessing the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of nutrients and bioactive compounds. By mimicking the physiological conditions of digestion, the model provides valuable insights into the release and transformation of food components, facilitating the development of functional foods with enhanced nutritional profiles. The review highlights the model's contribution to understanding the impact of food matrix and processing on digestion outcomes, underscoring its importance in food science and nutrition research. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent studies, this paper underscores the INFOGEST model's utility in advancing our knowledge of food digestion and its implications for health and disease prevention."}
