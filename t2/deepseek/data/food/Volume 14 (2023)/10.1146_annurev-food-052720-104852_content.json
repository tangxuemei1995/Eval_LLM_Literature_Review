{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of metabolic engineering and gene editing techniques to enhance the nutritional profile of edible plant oils. By targeting specific pathways, we aim to increase the content of beneficial compounds such as high oleic acid, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E in seed oils. The research focuses on identifying key genes involved in the biosynthesis of these nutrients and employing advanced biotechnological tools to modify their expression. The outcomes of this study could lead to the development of nutritionally superior plant oils, offering significant health benefits and addressing dietary deficiencies in populations worldwide."}
