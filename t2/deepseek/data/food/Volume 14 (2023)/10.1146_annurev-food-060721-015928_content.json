{"Abstract": "The dairy industry has long faced challenges with bacteriophage infections, which can disrupt food fermentations and lead to significant economic losses. This review explores the complex phageâ€“host interactions that occur within dairy fermentation processes, highlighting the mechanisms by which bacteriophages infect bacterial starter cultures. We delve into the latest strategies for developing phage resistance in dairy cultures, including genetic modifications and the use of phage-resistant strains. Additionally, the role of conjugation in spreading resistance genes among bacterial populations is examined, offering insights into how this natural process can be harnessed to combat phage infections. By synthesizing current research, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing battle against bacteriophages in the dairy industry, suggesting that while significant progress has been made, the problem is far from solved. The potential for future innovations in phage control and resistance mechanisms is also discussed, pointing towards a more resilient dairy fermentation process."}
