{"Abstract": "The quest for sustainable food production has led to the exploration of mild fractionation techniques as a means to enhance the efficiency of resource use in the food industry. This study focuses on the application of dry fractionation and mild wet separation methods for the extraction and purification of plant proteins, aiming to preserve their native functionality while minimizing environmental impact. By comparing these gentle processing techniques with conventional methods, we highlight their potential to reduce energy consumption and water usage, thereby contributing to a more sustainable food system. The findings suggest that mild fractionation not only retains the nutritional and functional properties of plant proteins but also offers a pathway towards more resource-efficient food ingredient production. This research underscores the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies to meet the growing demand for sustainable food ingredients without compromising on quality or functionality."}
