{"Abstract": "Functional oligosaccharides, recognized for their prebiotic effects, play a pivotal role in promoting intestinal health through the modulation of gut microbiota. This review focuses on the enzymatic production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, highlighting the advancements in biotechnological methods that enhance their yield and purity. The enzymatic approach offers a sustainable and efficient pathway for synthesizing these oligosaccharides, which are otherwise challenging to extract from natural sources. Furthermore, the paper explores the diverse food applications of these oligosaccharides, emphasizing their incorporation into dietary products to confer health benefits. The prebiotic effects of functional oligosaccharides, including the stimulation of beneficial gut bacteria and the inhibition of pathogenic species, are discussed in the context of improving intestinal health. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of enzymatic production in meeting the growing demand for functional oligosaccharides in the food industry, paving the way for innovative dietary solutions aimed at enhancing gut health."}
