{"Abstract": "This comprehensive review delves into the utilization of nanoparticles for oral delivery within the food sector, focusing on their biological fate, the evaluation models employed to assess their efficacy and safety, and the influences they exert on gut microbiota. As food nanotechnology advances, understanding the journey of nanoparticles through the digestive system becomes paramount. This paper synthesizes current knowledge on how nanoparticles interact with biological systems, the methodologies used to evaluate these interactions, and the impact on the complex ecosystem of the gut microbiota. By examining the latest research, this review aims to provide insights into optimizing nanoparticle design for oral delivery in food, ensuring both functionality and safety, while also considering the broader implications for human health and the microbiome."}
