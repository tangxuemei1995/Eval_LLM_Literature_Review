{"Abstract": "The exploration of metabolic signatures within Genebank collections presents a novel frontier in the intersection of plant metabolomics and human health. This study delves into the untapped potential of natural variance in phytonutrient profiles across diverse plant species, preserved in Genebanks, to uncover novel nutritional compounds beneficial for human health. By leveraging advanced metabolomic technologies, we aim to systematically analyze and catalog the metabolic diversity inherent in these collections, identifying key phytonutrients with potential health-promoting properties. The research underscores the importance of integrating plant metabolomics with nutritional science to harness the therapeutic and preventive capabilities of plant-based compounds. Through this approach, we propose a framework for utilizing Genebank collections as a resource for discovering bioactive compounds that could contribute to dietary interventions and the development of functional foods. This study highlights the critical role of natural variance in plant metabolomics as a foundation for advancing our understanding of the complex relationships between diet, nutrition, and human health."}
