{"Abstract": "The exploration of biotechnology in the realm of future food lipids presents a transformative avenue for enhancing nutritional profiles and sustainability in food production. This study delves into the innovative applications of microbial lipids, metabolic engineering, and enzymatic modification in the development of structural lipids and phospholipids. Microbial lipids, derived from oleaginous microorganisms, offer a renewable and scalable source of essential fatty acids, circumventing the environmental and ethical concerns associated with traditional lipid sources. Metabolic engineering emerges as a pivotal tool, enabling the precise manipulation of lipid biosynthetic pathways to optimize yield and functionality. Furthermore, enzymatic modification techniques are scrutinized for their potential to tailor lipid structures, enhancing their nutritional value and stability. Despite the promising opportunities, this research also addresses the challenges inherent in scaling up biotechnological processes, regulatory hurdles, and consumer acceptance. The findings underscore the critical role of biotechnology in shaping the future of food lipids, balancing innovation with sustainability and safety."}
