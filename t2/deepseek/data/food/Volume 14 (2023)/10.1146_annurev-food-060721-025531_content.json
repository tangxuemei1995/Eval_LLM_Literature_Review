{"Abstract": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a naturally occurring compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has garnered significant attention for its health-beneficial properties. This review explores the occurrence of I3C and its derivative, 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM), in dietary sources, highlighting their roles in promoting human health. The health benefits of I3C and DIM are vast, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, which are mediated through various cellular and molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms involve modulation of phase I and II detoxification enzymes, regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, and interference with signaling pathways such as NF-κB and PI3K/AKT. Furthermore, I3C and DIM have been shown to influence estrogen metabolism, offering protective effects against hormone-dependent cancers. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of I3C and DIM as therapeutic agents, emphasizing the need for further research to fully elucidate their mechanisms of action and to explore their clinical applications."}
