{"Abstract": "The transition towards renewable energy sources has significantly reduced the inertia in power systems, posing challenges to their stability and control. This paper explores advanced control strategies for low-inertia power systems, focusing on the integration of power electronics control and grid-forming techniques. We investigate the role of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs) in enhancing system flexibility and reliability by aggregating distributed energy resources (DERs) to mimic the behavior of traditional power plants. The study highlights the importance of adaptive control algorithms that can respond to rapid changes in system conditions, ensuring stable operation under low-inertia scenarios. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and simulation-based analysis, we propose a framework for the effective management of low-inertia systems, emphasizing the synergy between grid-forming control and DVPPs. Our findings contribute to the development of robust control solutions that support the sustainable integration of renewable energy into the grid."}
