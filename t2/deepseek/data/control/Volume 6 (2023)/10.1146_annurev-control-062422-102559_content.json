{"Abstract": "The exploration of liquid surface tension and capillary forces has opened new avenues in the field of microrobotics, offering innovative solutions for micromanipulation tasks that were previously challenging to achieve. This study delves into the principles of surface tension and its exploitation in the design and operation of microrobots, enabling precise control and manipulation at the microscale. By leveraging the inherent properties of liquid interfaces, microrobots can perform complex tasks such as targeted drug delivery, microassembly, and environmental monitoring with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. The research highlights the development of microrobotic systems that utilize capillary forces for locomotion and manipulation, demonstrating their potential in various applications including biomedical engineering, microelectronics, and environmental science. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental validation, this work provides insights into the optimization of microrobotic designs for enhanced performance and reliability. The findings underscore the significance of surface tension as a fundamental force in microrobotics, paving the way for future advancements in the field and the realization of more sophisticated micromanipulation technologies."}
