{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of crowd behavior through the lens of multiagent systems, focusing on the modeling and control mechanisms that govern such complex interactions. By employing the concept of interacting agent systems, we explore the collective behavior of agents, ranging from pedestrians to autonomous vehicles, under various environmental and social influences. The research emphasizes the significance of the mean-field limit approach in simplifying the analysis of large-scale systems, enabling the derivation of macroscopic models from microscopic interactions. Furthermore, we investigate the role of feedback control strategies in enhancing the efficiency and safety of these systems, particularly in the context of autonomous vehicle navigation and coordination. The findings contribute to the development of robust frameworks for predicting and managing crowd dynamics, offering insights into the design of intelligent systems capable of adapting to the ever-changing demands of urban environments."}
