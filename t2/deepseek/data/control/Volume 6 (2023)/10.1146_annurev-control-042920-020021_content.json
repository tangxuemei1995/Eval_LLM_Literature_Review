{"Abstract": "This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of policy optimization in the context of learning control policies, with a focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and feedback control synthesis. We aim to bridge the gap between empirical successes in RL and the theoretical frameworks that can explain and guide these successes. By examining the convergence properties, stability, and robustness of policy optimization algorithms, we provide insights into their effectiveness for control tasks. Our analysis highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between policy optimization techniques and the dynamics of the controlled system. We propose a set of principles for designing policy optimization algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective, ensuring that they can be reliably applied to a wide range of control problems. This work contributes to the broader goal of developing a comprehensive theoretical foundation for policy optimization in learning control policies, paving the way for more efficient and robust control strategies in complex environments."}
