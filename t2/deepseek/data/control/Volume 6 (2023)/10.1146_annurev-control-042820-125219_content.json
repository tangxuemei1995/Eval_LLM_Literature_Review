{"Abstract": "This study explores the control strategies for multicarrier energy systems, focusing on the transition from individual building energy control to broader network-level management. By integrating energy hubs with advanced control methodologies, including distributed, cooperative, and predictive control, the research aims to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of energy systems. The investigation highlights the importance of adaptive control mechanisms that can respond to dynamic energy demands and supply conditions across different scales. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and case studies, the paper proposes a framework for optimizing energy flows and interactions within multicarrier systems, paving the way for more resilient and intelligent energy networks. The findings underscore the potential of integrated control approaches in achieving a balanced and efficient energy ecosystem."}
