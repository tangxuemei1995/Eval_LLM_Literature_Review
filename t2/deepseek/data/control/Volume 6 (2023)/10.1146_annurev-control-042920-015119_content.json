{"Abstract": "Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, also known as particle filters, have emerged as a powerful set of techniques for state estimation and system identification in nonlinear state-space models. This paper provides a unified review of SMC methodologies, highlighting their theoretical foundations, algorithmic variations, and practical applications. By leveraging the principles of importance sampling and resampling, SMC methods offer a flexible framework for approximating complex posterior distributions and performing real-time inference in dynamic systems. The review covers key developments in the field, including advances in computational efficiency, the treatment of high-dimensional problems, and the integration with other statistical and machine learning techniques. Through a comprehensive examination of the literature, this paper aims to elucidate the strengths and limitations of SMC methods, offering insights into their current state and future directions."}
