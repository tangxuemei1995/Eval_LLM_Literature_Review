{"Abstract": "Networked control systems (NCS) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent a paradigm shift in the design and implementation of control strategies, where information exchange is pivotal for system performance and stability. This paper delves into the multifaceted role of information within these systems, particularly under communication constraints that challenge traditional control methodologies. We explore the implications of decentralized inference, where local decision-making must compensate for the lack of global information, and the criticality of timing information in ensuring the synchronization and efficiency of distributed control actions. Furthermore, we investigate the emerging paradigm of event-triggered control, which optimizes communication by transmitting data only when necessary, thereby reducing network load and enhancing system resilience. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements and theoretical developments, this study highlights the intricate balance between information availability, system complexity, and control performance. Our analysis underscores the necessity for innovative approaches that can navigate the trade-offs inherent in networked estimation and control, paving the way for more robust, efficient, and scalable solutions in the era of interconnected systems."}
