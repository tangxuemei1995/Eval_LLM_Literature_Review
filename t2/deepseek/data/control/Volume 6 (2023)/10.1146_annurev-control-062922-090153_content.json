{"Abstract": "This paper explores the convergence of adaptive control and reinforcement learning (RL), two paradigms that aim to optimize system performance through adaptation. Adaptive control focuses on adjusting controller parameters in real-time to maintain desired system behavior despite uncertainties and changes in system dynamics. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, seeks to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment, guided by reward signals. We investigate how principles from adaptive control, such as stability, robustness, and optimality, can inform and enhance RL algorithms. Specifically, we examine the integration of adaptive control techniques into RL frameworks to improve learning efficiency, ensure stability during the learning process, and enhance robustness to environmental uncertainties. The paper also discusses the potential of RL to address challenges in adaptive control, such as the need for model-free approaches and the handling of complex, high-dimensional systems. Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and practical applications, this study aims to bridge the gap between these two fields, offering a comprehensive perspective on their intersections and potential synergies."}
