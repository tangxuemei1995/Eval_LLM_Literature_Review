{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of robotics and manipulators on spacecraft for in-orbit servicing, focusing on control strategies, trajectory tracking, and the application of dual quaternions in dynamics and kinematics. The research aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of robotic operations in the challenging environment of space. By leveraging dual quaternions, we propose a novel approach to simplify the complex dynamics and kinematics of spacecraft-mounted manipulators, facilitating more accurate control and trajectory tracking. The findings contribute to advancing the capabilities of in-orbit servicing missions, ensuring the sustainability and longevity of space assets."}
