{"Abstract": "The development of broad-spectrum vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV represents a significant challenge in modern immunology. These viruses exhibit high mutation rates, leading to the emergence of new variants that can evade immune responses elicited by traditional vaccines. This review highlights the progress and challenges in designing vaccines that induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and broad-spectrum immunity. Advances in structural biology and computational modeling have facilitated the identification of conserved epitopes across viral strains, enabling the design of universal vaccine candidates. Furthermore, novel vaccine platforms, including mRNA and viral vector technologies, have shown promise in eliciting robust and durable immune responses. However, the induction of bnAbs remains a complex task, requiring precise antigen design and optimization of immunization strategies. This abstract underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in overcoming the hurdles associated with rapid viral evolution and achieving the ultimate goal of universal vaccines capable of providing long-lasting protection against a wide range of viral pathogens."}
