{"Abstract": "The genomic analysis of admixed populations presents unique challenges and opportunities in the field of statistical genetics, particularly in the study of complex traits. Admixed populations, characterized by the blending of genetic material from previously isolated groups, offer a rich source of variation for understanding the genetic architecture of diseases and traits. However, the complexity of their genetic structure requires sophisticated methods to accurately infer ancestry and identify genetic associations. This review highlights key strategies for the genomic analysis of admixed populations, focusing on the development and application of statistical methods tailored to address the intricacies of admixture. We discuss the importance of ancestry inference, the challenges of linkage disequilibrium, and the potential of admixture mapping in uncovering genetic variants associated with complex traits. By leveraging the unique genetic diversity of admixed populations, researchers can gain deeper insights into the genetic underpinnings of human health and disease."}
