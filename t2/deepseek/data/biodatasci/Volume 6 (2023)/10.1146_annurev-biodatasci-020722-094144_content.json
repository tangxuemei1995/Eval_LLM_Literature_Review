{"Abstract": "Noninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) has revolutionized prenatal care by enabling the detection of genetic abnormalities through the analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) in maternal blood. This liquid biopsy approach offers a safer alternative to traditional invasive diagnostic procedures, reducing the risk of miscarriage. Recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics have enhanced the accuracy and scope of NIPT, allowing for the early detection of chromosomal aneuploidies, microdeletions, and single-gene disorders. However, challenges such as the interpretation of complex genomic data, ethical considerations, and the need for improved sensitivity and specificity remain. This review explores the current state of NIPT, highlighting technological advancements, ongoing challenges, and future possibilities. The potential for expanding NIPT to include a broader range of genetic conditions and its integration into routine prenatal care are discussed, underscoring its transformative impact on maternal and fetal health."}
