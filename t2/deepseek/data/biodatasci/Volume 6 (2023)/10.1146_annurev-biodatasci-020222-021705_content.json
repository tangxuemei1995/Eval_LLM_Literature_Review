{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted significant variability in disease severity among infected individuals, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia and death. This study explores the genetic underpinnings of COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on the contributions of both rare and common genetic variants. Utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified several loci associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, including variants in genes related to inborn errors of immunity and the type I interferon pathway. Our findings suggest that rare variants in genes critical for immune defense against viral infections may predispose individuals to severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while common variants may modulate the risk of developing severe disease. This research underscores the importance of human genomics in understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention and risk stratification."}
