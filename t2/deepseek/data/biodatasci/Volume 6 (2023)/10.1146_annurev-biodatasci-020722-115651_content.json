{"Abstract": "Deep generative models (DGMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the analysis and interpretation of complex biological data, particularly in the fields of functional and evolutionary genomics. This overview explores the application of two prominent DGMs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in deciphering the intricate patterns of genomic data. VAEs, with their ability to learn latent representations, have been instrumental in identifying functional elements and understanding gene expression dynamics. GANs, on the other hand, have shown promise in simulating evolutionary processes and generating synthetic genomic sequences that mimic real biological data. By leveraging the strengths of these models, researchers can uncover novel insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation, evolutionary adaptations, and the genetic basis of complex traits. This paper highlights the potential of DGMs to revolutionize our approach to genomic research, offering a new lens through which to explore the vast complexity of life's blueprint."}
