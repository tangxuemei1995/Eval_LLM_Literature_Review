{"Abstract": "The complexity of the transcriptome and proteome is significantly enhanced by alternative splicing, leading to the generation of multiple splice variants and isoforms from a single gene. This study focuses on the identification and characterization of these variants using advanced transcriptomic and proteomic technologies. Short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides high-throughput data for detecting known and novel splice junctions, while long-read RNA-seq offers the advantage of sequencing full-length transcripts, enabling the precise identification of splice variants. On the proteomic front, top-down mass spectrometry (MS) emerges as a powerful tool for the direct analysis of intact protein isoforms, or proteoforms, providing insights into the functional diversity of proteins. By integrating these complementary approaches, we aim to unravel the intricate landscape of splice variants and isoforms, enhancing our understanding of gene expression regulation and its implications in health and disease."}
