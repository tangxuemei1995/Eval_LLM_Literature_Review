{"Abstract": "Single-cell multiomics represents a transformative approach in biological research, enabling the simultaneous analysis of multiple molecular layers within individual cells. This methodology leverages next-generation sequencing technologies to dissect the complexity of cellular heterogeneity and function by integrating genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data. The computational integration of these multimodal datasets poses significant challenges but also offers unprecedented opportunities to uncover novel insights into cellular mechanisms and disease states. Recent advancements in computational algorithms and analytical frameworks have facilitated the efficient processing and interpretation of single-cell multiomics data, enhancing our understanding of cellular diversity and dynamics. This abstract highlights the critical role of single-cell multiomics in advancing precision medicine, developmental biology, and systems biology, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between computational scientists, biologists, and clinicians to harness the full potential of this cutting-edge technology."}
