{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of statistical learning methods in the analysis of neuroimaging data, with a focus on uncovering causal pathways and addressing heterogeneity within datasets. Leveraging advanced neuroimaging techniques, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates image processing analysis with population-based statistical analysis to enhance the precision and reliability of findings. Our approach emphasizes the importance of study design in identifying robust associations and causal relationships in complex neuroimaging data. Through the application of these methods, we aim to contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. This research underscores the potential of statistical learning in advancing our understanding of brain function and pathology, offering new insights into the intricate mechanisms underlying neurological diseases."}
