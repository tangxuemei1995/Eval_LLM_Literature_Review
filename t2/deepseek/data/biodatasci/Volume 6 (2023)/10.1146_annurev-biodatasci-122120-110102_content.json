{"Abstract": "The identification of functional sequences and variants within noncoding DNA is pivotal for understanding gene regulation and its implications in disease. This study leverages advancements in whole genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies to explore the role of enhancers and transcription factors in gene expression. By integrating sequence analysis with machine learning and deep learning techniques, we aim to predict the effects of rare variants on gene regulation. Our approach not only enhances the accuracy of variant effect prediction but also provides insights into the complex mechanisms underlying noncoding DNA functionality. This research contributes to the broader goal of deciphering the regulatory code of the genome, offering potential pathways for therapeutic intervention."}
