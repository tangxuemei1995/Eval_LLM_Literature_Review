{"Abstract": "The field of drug discovery has witnessed significant advancements with the integration of ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches. These methodologies leverage the power of molecular docking, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to efficiently sift through ultralarge chemical libraries, identifying potential drug candidates with high precision. The advent of GPU acceleration has further enhanced the computational efficiency, enabling the rapid processing of billions of compounds. Additionally, free energy simulations have become increasingly important in refining the predictions of molecular interactions, offering a more accurate assessment of binding affinities. This review highlights the recent developments in these technologies, emphasizing their impact on accelerating the drug discovery pipeline. By combining computational power with advanced algorithms, researchers are now able to explore chemical space more thoroughly than ever before, paving the way for the discovery of novel therapeutics with improved efficacy and reduced side effects."}
