{"Abstract": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women worldwide, necessitating advanced strategies for risk assessment to improve early detection and personalized treatment. This study explores the integration of molecular and radiomic features to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer risk prediction models. We focus on the utilization of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to construct a polygenic risk score (PRS), alongside radiomic features extracted from medical imaging, to capture both genetic predispositions and phenotypic tumor characteristics. By combining these diverse data types, our approach aims to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment tool that accounts for the complex interplay between genetic factors and tumor biology. Preliminary results indicate that the integration of PRS with radiomic features significantly improves the predictive performance of risk models compared to using either data type alone. This novel methodology holds promise for advancing personalized medicine in breast cancer, offering a more nuanced understanding of individual risk profiles and informing targeted prevention and intervention strategies."}
