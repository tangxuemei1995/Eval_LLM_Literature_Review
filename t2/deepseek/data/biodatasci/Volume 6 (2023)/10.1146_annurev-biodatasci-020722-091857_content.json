{"Abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative technology in the study of human cancers, offering unprecedented resolution to dissect the complexity of tumor biology. This technique enables the detailed examination of gene expression profiles at the single-cell level, providing insights into the heterogeneity of cancer cells, the composition of the tumor microenvironment, and the dynamics of immune cell interactions. By leveraging advanced bioinformatics tools, researchers can identify novel biomarkers, understand mechanisms of drug resistance, and uncover potential targets for immunotherapy. The application of scRNA-seq in cancer research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of tumorigenesis and progression, paving the way for the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. This abstract highlights the pivotal role of scRNA-seq in advancing cancer biology and its implications for improving patient outcomes through precision medicine."}
