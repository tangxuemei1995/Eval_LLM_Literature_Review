{"Abstract": "Advancements in single-cell proteomics have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and function. This study explores computational methods tailored for analyzing single-cell proteomic data, with a focus on mass cytometry and spatial proteomics. We delve into sophisticated data analysis techniques, including clustering and trajectory inference, which are pivotal for deciphering complex datasets. Clustering algorithms enable the identification of distinct cell populations, while trajectory inference methods offer insights into dynamic cellular processes. Our findings highlight the integration of these computational strategies as essential for advancing single-cell proteomics research, providing a comprehensive toolkit for researchers to unravel the intricacies of cellular systems at an unprecedented resolution."}
