{"Abstract": "Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare to individual genetic profiles, yet its efficacy is contingent upon the diversity of the populations studied. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been pivotal in identifying genetic variants associated with diseases, but the majority of these studies have been conducted in cohorts of European ancestry, limiting the generalizability of findings across different ancestry groups. This paper underscores the critical importance of incorporating diversity in precision medicine research to ensure that genetic associations and polygenic risk scores (PRS) are applicable to all populations. By analyzing data from diverse cohorts and consortia, we highlight the disparities in the identification of disease susceptibility variants and the potential for biased healthcare outcomes. Our findings advocate for a concerted effort to include underrepresented ancestry groups in genetic research, thereby enhancing the robustness and inclusivity of precision medicine. This approach not only improves the identification of disease susceptibility variants across diverse populations but also paves the way for equitable healthcare advancements."}
