{"Abstract": "Aging is a complex biological process characterized by the gradual decline of physiological functions, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of aging by enabling the detailed examination of cellular and molecular changes at an unprecedented resolution. This study focuses on decoding the hallmarks of aging at the single-cell level, leveraging cutting-edge analysis tools and comprehensive data resources. By identifying key intervention targets and elucidating underlying mechanisms, our research aims to pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related decline. The integration of single-cell analysis not only enhances our comprehension of aging but also offers a robust platform for the discovery of biomarkers and potential interventions to promote healthy aging."}
