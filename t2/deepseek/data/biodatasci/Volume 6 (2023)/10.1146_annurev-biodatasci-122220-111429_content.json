{"Abstract": "The discovery of virus-derived small RNAs (vsRNAs) and virally encoded microRNAs (v-miRNAs) has opened new avenues in understanding the complex interactions between viruses and their hosts. This study focuses on the role of these molecules in health and disease, with a particular emphasis on the Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV), a well-known human pathogen associated with various malignancies. Utilizing advanced bioinformatics tools and viral RNA bioinformatics resources, we explore the biogenesis, function, and regulatory mechanisms of vsRNAs and v-miRNAs. Our findings highlight the potential of these viral molecules as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis, as well as targets for therapeutic intervention. This research underscores the importance of integrating bioinformatics approaches in virology to unravel the intricate roles of viral small RNAs in host-pathogen interactions."}
