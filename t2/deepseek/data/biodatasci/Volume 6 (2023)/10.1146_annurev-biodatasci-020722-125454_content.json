{"Abstract": "The integration of data science and machine learning (ML) into the study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of its neuropsychiatric phenotype. This review explores the current landscape of digital phenotyping and ML applications in autism research, highlighting the potential of these technologies to transform diagnostic processes, personalize interventions, and predict outcomes. By leveraging large-scale datasets, including those derived from crowdsourcing and digital health platforms, researchers can uncover complex patterns and biomarkers associated with ASD. Digital psychiatry, through the use of wearable devices, mobile applications, and online platforms, facilitates the continuous monitoring of behavioral and physiological data, providing a more nuanced view of the disorder. However, challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration remain. This paper proposes a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of developing robust, ethical ML models that can be integrated into clinical practice. By addressing these challenges, the field can move towards more accurate, accessible, and personalized approaches to understanding and treating autism, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families."}
