{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay of genetic factors in human diseases has long been a subject of intense research, with epistasis—gene-gene interactions—emerging as a critical component in understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Recent advancements in multiomics technologies have significantly enhanced our ability to dissect these interactions, offering unprecedented insights into the molecular underpinnings of disease. This study synthesizes current evidence on the role of epistasis in human diseases, highlighting how these interactions contribute to disease susceptibility, progression, and response to treatment. By integrating data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, we explore the complex networks of gene interactions that underlie disease phenotypes. Our findings underscore the importance of considering epistasis in the development of precision medicine strategies, as it can significantly impact the identification of therapeutic targets and the prediction of treatment outcomes. This review calls for a paradigm shift in genetic research, advocating for a more nuanced approach that accounts for the multifaceted nature of gene interactions in the quest to unravel the complexities of human diseases and pave the way for more effective, personalized treatments."}
