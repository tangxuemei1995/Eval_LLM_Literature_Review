{"Abstract": "Plant volatiles play a pivotal role in mediating ecological signaling, influencing interactions within and across species. This study delves into the spatial distributions and temporal dynamics of these volatile compounds, exploring how environmental chemistry and physics shape their dispersion and reception. By synthesizing current research, we identify key mechanisms through which plant volatiles facilitate communication, from attracting pollinators to deterring herbivores. However, significant research gaps remain, particularly in understanding the nuanced interplay between volatile emission patterns and environmental variables. Our analysis underscores the importance of integrating multidisciplinary approaches to unravel the complex roles of plant volatiles in ecological networks. This paper aims to bridge these gaps, offering insights into the 'where', 'when', and 'why' of plant volatile-mediated signaling, thereby enhancing our comprehension of plant interactions and their ecological implications."}
