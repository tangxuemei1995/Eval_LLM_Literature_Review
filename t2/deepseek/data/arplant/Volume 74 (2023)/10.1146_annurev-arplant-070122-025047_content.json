{"Abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications and DNA methylation, play pivotal roles in regulating gene expression during plant development and in response to environmental stimuli. This study explores the intricate interplay between these epigenetic modifications and their impact on developmental processes, with a particular focus on the regulation of transposable elements. Furthermore, we investigate the capacity of plants to retain epigenetic memory, especially in the context of heat stress responses, which could provide a basis for enhanced stress resilience. By integrating findings from recent studies, we aim to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in epigenetic regulation and memory, offering insights into how plants adapt to changing environments. This research underscores the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in plant biology and their potential applications in agriculture for improving crop tolerance to abiotic stresses."}
