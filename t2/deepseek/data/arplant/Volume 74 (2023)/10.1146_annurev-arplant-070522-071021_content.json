{"Abstract": "Invasive plants, often referred to as alien or non-native species, have become a significant concern for ecosystems worldwide due to their ability to outcompete native flora and alter ecosystem functions. This study explores the underlying factors contributing to the success of invasive plants, focusing on biotic interactions, competition, ecosystem invasibility, and functional traits. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key characteristics that enhance invasiveness, such as rapid growth rates, high reproductive output, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, we examine how invasive plants exploit weaknesses in native ecosystems, including disturbances and the absence of natural predators, to establish and proliferate. Our findings suggest that a combination of intrinsic plant traits and extrinsic environmental factors drives the invasiveness of non-native plants. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity and ecosystem health."}
