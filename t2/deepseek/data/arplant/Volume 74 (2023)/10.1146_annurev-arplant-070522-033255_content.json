{"Abstract": "Plant glutamate receptor-like channels (GLRs) represent a unique class of ion channels that play pivotal roles in mediating cellular communication and signaling in plants. These channels are integral to the perception and transduction of extracellular signals, facilitating a wide array of physiological processes including excitability, cellâ€“cell communication, and the regulation of calcium transport and signaling. GLRs are activated by a diverse range of ligands, notably amino acids and glutathione, which underscores their versatility in amino acid signaling pathways. This review delves into the structural and functional aspects of GLRs, elucidating their mechanisms of action and their contribution to electric signaling and the generation of action potentials in plants. By integrating signaling with structure, we explore how GLRs orchestrate complex signaling networks that are essential for plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. The emerging understanding of GLRs not only highlights their significance in plant biology but also opens new avenues for research into their potential applications in agriculture and biotechnology. Through a comprehensive analysis of current literature, this article aims to provide a holistic view of the functions and mechanisms of plant GLRs, shedding light on their critical roles in bridging signaling pathways with structural dynamics in plant cells."}
