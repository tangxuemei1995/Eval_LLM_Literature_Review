{"Abstract": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of gene expression and genome stability in plants. This review focuses on the biogenesis, regulatory roles, and functions of major classes of plant sRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs), and mobile siRNAs. miRNAs are key regulators of plant development and stress responses, guiding the cleavage or translational repression of target mRNAs. siRNAs, derived from double-stranded RNA precursors, are involved in the defense against viruses and transposons, as well as in the regulation of endogenous genes. phasiRNAs, a subclass of siRNAs, are produced in a phased manner from long non-coding RNAs and play roles in plant development and stress responses. Mobile siRNAs, capable of moving between cells, contribute to the systemic regulation of gene expression and plant development. Understanding the complex networks of sRNA-mediated regulation offers insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth, development, and adaptation to environmental stresses."}
