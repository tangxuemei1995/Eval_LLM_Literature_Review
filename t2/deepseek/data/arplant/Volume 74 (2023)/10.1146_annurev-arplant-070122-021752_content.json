{"Abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles that play a crucial role in the storage and metabolism of neutral lipids, primarily triacylglycerols (TAGs), within the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm. This review delves into the biogenesis of LDs, highlighting their unique compartmentation that allows for the efficient packing of hydrophobic molecules in a hydrophilic cellular milieu. LDs are not merely inert storage depots but are actively involved in lipid homeostasis, energy metabolism, and signaling pathways. The process of LD formation involves the synthesis of TAGs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, followed by their budding into the cytosol, encapsulated by a phospholipid monolayer and specific proteins. In seeds, LDs, also known as oil bodies, are essential for storing energy reserves that are mobilized during germination. The regulation of LD biogenesis and turnover is complex, involving a myriad of proteins and enzymes that ensure the balance between lipid storage and utilization. Understanding the mechanisms underlying LD dynamics offers insights into cellular lipid management and has implications for addressing metabolic disorders and enhancing the oil content in seeds for agricultural and industrial applications. This review underscores the importance of LDs in cellular physiology and their potential as targets for therapeutic and biotechnological interventions."}
