{"Abstract": "The study of plant photoperiodism has entered a new era with the discovery of mechanisms beyond the traditional external coincidence model. This research explores the metabolic daylength measurement system, a novel approach that integrates internal metabolic signals with external light cues to regulate flowering and other developmental processes. Additionally, we delve into noncanonical photoperiod measurement pathways that plants utilize to adapt to varying light conditions, highlighting the complexity and flexibility of photoperiodic responses. The concept of photosynthetic photoperiod is introduced, emphasizing the role of photosynthesis in modulating photoperiodic signals and its impact on plant growth and productivity. Through a comprehensive review of recent findings, this paper aims to shed light on these emerging paradigms in plant photoperiodism, offering insights into how plants perceive and respond to light, and paving the way for future research in optimizing plant development and agricultural practices."}
