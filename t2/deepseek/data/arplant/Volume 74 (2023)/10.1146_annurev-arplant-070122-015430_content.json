{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate mechanisms of between-plant signaling facilitated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) through common mycelial networks (CMNs). Focusing on the role of these networks in interplant communication, we investigate how systemic signaling influences plant interactions, including those with parasitic plants. Utilizing a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we highlight the pivotal role of AMF in mediating resource allocation, defense responses, and stress signaling among connected plants. Our findings suggest that CMNs not only enhance plant resilience to environmental stressors but also play a crucial role in the ecological dynamics of plant communities, including the regulation of parasitic plant infestations. This research underscores the importance of understanding the complex interactions within plant-fungal networks for advancing our knowledge of plant ecology and developing sustainable agricultural practices."}
