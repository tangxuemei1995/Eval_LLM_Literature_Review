{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by altering nucleosome positioning and chromatin structure, thereby facilitating access to DNA for transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins. These complexes are powered by ATPases that utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, enabling the sliding, ejection, or restructuring of nucleosomes. This review focuses on the diverse functions of SWI/SNF ATPases in various biological processes, including development and stimulus response, highlighting their importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. By integrating findings from recent studies, we discuss how SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers interact with transcription factors to modulate gene expression programs essential for cell differentiation, proliferation, and adaptation to stress. Furthermore, we explore the implications of SWI/SNF complex mutations in human diseases, underscoring the critical role of these chromatin remodelers in health and disease. This comprehensive overview aims to provide insights into the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF complexes regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with chromatin remodeling defects."}
