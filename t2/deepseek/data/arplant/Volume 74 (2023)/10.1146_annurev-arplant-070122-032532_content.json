{"Abstract": "Chloroplasts, the photosynthetic organelles in plant cells, rely on a complex network of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) mechanisms to maintain their function and integrity. This study delves into the intricate processes of chloroplast proteostasis, focusing on protein import, sorting, ubiquitination, and proteolysis. Protein translocation into chloroplasts is a critical first step, involving sophisticated import machinery that recognizes and transports precursor proteins across the chloroplast envelope membranes. Once inside, proteins are sorted to their correct sub-organellar locations, a process essential for chloroplast function and development. Ubiquitination, a post-translational modification, plays a pivotal role in regulating protein stability and function within chloroplasts, marking proteins for degradation or altering their activity. Finally, proteolysis, mediated by the chloroplast proteasome and other proteolytic systems, ensures the removal of damaged or unnecessary proteins, maintaining chloroplast proteostasis. Understanding these processes provides insights into the regulation of chloroplast function and its response to environmental stresses, offering potential avenues for enhancing plant resilience and productivity."}
