{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate engineering themes inherent in plant forms and functions, exploring the biomechanical principles that underpin their biological design. By examining the structureâ€“function relationship, we uncover how plants utilize bilayer systems, slender body architectures, and self-similarity to optimize their survival and efficiency in diverse environments. The research highlights the sophisticated mechanisms through which plants distribute mechanical stresses, maximize resource acquisition, and minimize energy expenditure. Through a multidisciplinary approach, integrating concepts from engineering and biology, this paper sheds light on the evolutionary adaptations that have enabled plants to master the art of structural optimization. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of biological design principles, offering insights that could inspire advancements in biomimetic engineering and sustainable design."}
