{"Abstract": "Proximity labeling has emerged as a powerful technique for mapping protein–protein and protein–nucleotide interactions within the complex cellular environments of plants. This method leverages the spatial proximity of molecules to label interacting partners in vivo, providing insights into the dynamic subcellular and cell type–specific proteomes. By employing enzymes such as biotin ligases or peroxidases, proximity labeling facilitates the covalent tagging of proteins and nucleotides in close vicinity, enabling their subsequent identification and quantification through mass spectrometry. This approach has been instrumental in uncovering novel interactions and elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying plant development, stress responses, and signaling pathways. Recent advancements in proximity labeling techniques have enhanced their specificity, efficiency, and applicability across diverse plant species and tissues. Furthermore, the integration of proximity labeling with quantitative proteomics has allowed for the precise measurement of interaction dynamics under various physiological conditions. This review highlights the principles, methodologies, and applications of proximity labeling in plant research, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize our understanding of plant biology at the molecular level. The challenges and future directions of this technology are also discussed, underscoring its promise for advancing plant science and biotechnology."}
