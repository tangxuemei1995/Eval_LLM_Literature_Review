{"Abstract": "Optogenetics, a revolutionary technique that combines optics and genetics to control cellular processes with light, has recently expanded its application into plant biology. This approach leverages the natural light sensitivity of photoreceptors and engineered rhodopsins to manipulate plant physiological and developmental processes with unprecedented precision. By integrating optogenetic tools such as biosensors and optoswitches, researchers can now monitor and control gene expression, ion fluxes, and signaling pathways in real-time within plant cells. This review highlights the latest advancements in plant optogenetics, focusing on the development and application of light-sensitive proteins and their role in understanding complex plant behaviors. The potential of optogenetics to unravel the intricacies of plant responses to environmental stimuli and to engineer crops with enhanced traits is also discussed. As this field evolves, it promises to provide deeper insights into plant biology and to offer novel strategies for agricultural innovation."}
