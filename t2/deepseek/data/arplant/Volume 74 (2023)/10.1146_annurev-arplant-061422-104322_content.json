{"Abstract": "Addressing the escalating challenge of soil salinity is imperative for ensuring global food security. This paper explores the potential of salt-tolerant crops as a sustainable solution to enhance crop yield in saline environments. By leveraging crop wild relatives (CWRs) and advanced breeding techniques, including neodomestication and genetic modification, we can develop crops that thrive under saline conditions. The integration of traditional and modern biotechnological approaches offers a promising pathway to unlock the genetic potential of CWRs, thereby facilitating the development of salt-tolerant varieties. This study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary research in accelerating the domestication of novel crops and the genetic enhancement of existing ones to withstand salinity stress. The findings advocate for a concerted effort to harness the untapped genetic diversity of CWRs, coupled with innovative breeding strategies, to deliver salt-tolerant crops that can significantly contribute to food security in the face of increasing soil salinity worldwide."}
