{"Abstract": "The 'RNA World' hypothesis posits that RNA molecules were precursors to current life, playing a dual role in both storing genetic information and catalyzing biochemical reactions. This study explores the multifaceted roles of RNA in gene expression, particularly in the context of plant viruses and their impact on disease resistance. By examining the evolutionary trajectory of RNA, we uncover its significance in the development of life and its potential applications in technology-driven agriculture. Furthermore, this research delves into the autobiographical aspects of RNA, tracing its journey from a primordial molecule to a cornerstone of modern biological systems. Through a comprehensive analysis of scientific literature, we aim to shed light on the intricate relationship between RNA, plant viruses, and disease resistance, offering insights into evolutionary biology and the future of agricultural technology."}
