{"Abstract": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis represents a fundamental interaction between fungi and plant roots, playing a pivotal role in plant growth, nutrient exchange, and stress adaptation. This symbiotic relationship enhances the plant's ability to absorb water and essential nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, through an extensive common mycorrhizal network (CMN). Furthermore, mycorrhizae helper bacteria (MHB) significantly contribute to the establishment and efficiency of this symbiosis, promoting plant health and resilience against environmental stresses. The autoregulation of mycorrhizae ensures a balanced symbiotic interaction, optimizing plant growth and stress resistance. Recent advances in molecular biology have begun to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying these processes, offering insights into the complex interplay between mycorrhizal fungi and their plant hosts. This review synthesizes current knowledge on mycorrhizal symbiosis, from genetic interactions to ecosystem-level impacts, highlighting its critical role in sustainable agriculture and ecosystem functioning."}
