{"Abstract": "RNA modifications play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and have been extensively studied across various organisms. In plants, these modifications, including m6A, m5C, and others on mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA, contribute significantly to the functional diversity of RNA molecules. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diversity and functions of RNA modifications in plants, highlighting their roles in plant development, stress responses, and adaptation to environmental changes. We explore the mechanisms by which these modifications influence RNA stability, translation efficiency, and the regulation of gene expression, thereby affecting plant growth and stress tolerance. Despite recent advances, the functional implications of many RNA modifications in plants remain poorly understood. This review identifies key gaps in our understanding and suggests future research directions, including the exploration of novel RNA modifications, their regulatory mechanisms, and their potential applications in crop improvement. By integrating findings from molecular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on plant RNA modifications and to inspire further investigation into this fascinating area of plant biology."}
