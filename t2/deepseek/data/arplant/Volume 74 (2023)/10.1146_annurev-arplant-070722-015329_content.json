{"Abstract": "Plant hormones, or phytohormones, play pivotal roles in regulating growth, development, and stress responses in plants. The precise localization and transport of these signaling molecules are crucial for maintaining hormone homeostasis and ensuring proper physiological functions. This review focuses on the transport mechanisms of key phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). We explore the roles of specific transporters and the molecular pathways involved in the directional movement of these hormones within plant tissues. Understanding the dynamics of hormone transport not only sheds light on the complex signaling networks in plants but also opens avenues for manipulating plant growth and stress responses through targeted hormone regulation. This synthesis of current knowledge highlights the importance of transport mechanisms in the spatial and temporal control of phytohormone action."}
