{"Abstract": "The BAHD acyltransferase gene family plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of a wide array of secondary metabolites in plants, including hydroxycinnamoyl esters, amides, and acylsugars. These compounds are integral to plant defense mechanisms, structural integrity, and interaction with the environment. This study delves into the evolutionary trajectory of the BAHD family across land plants, highlighting the expansion and functional diversification of these enzymes. Through phylogenetic analysis and functional characterization, we uncover the critical roles of hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) and related enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of lignin and other phenolic compounds. Furthermore, we explore the biochemical versatility of BAHD acyltransferases in catalyzing the formation of esters and amides, contributing to the vast chemical diversity observed in plants. Our findings underscore the significance of the BAHD gene family in plant adaptation and evolution, offering insights into their potential applications in agriculture and biotechnology."}
