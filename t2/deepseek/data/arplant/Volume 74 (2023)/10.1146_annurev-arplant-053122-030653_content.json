{"Abstract": "The advent of genome editing technologies has revolutionized the field of plant developmental genetics, offering unprecedented opportunities for the de novo domestication of wild plant species. This approach holds significant promise for addressing the challenges posed by climate change, enabling the rapid development of crops with enhanced resilience, nutritional value, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions. However, the power of genome editing in plant domestication is not without its perils. Ethical considerations, potential impacts on biodiversity, and the socio-economic implications of altering plant genomes necessitate a cautious approach. Drawing on insights from ethnobotany, this study explores the potential of genome editing for de novo domestication, while critically examining the associated risks and ethical dilemmas. By integrating cutting-edge genetic techniques with traditional knowledge, we propose a framework for responsible innovation in plant domestication that balances the urgent need for climate-resilient crops with the imperative to preserve ecological and cultural heritage."}
