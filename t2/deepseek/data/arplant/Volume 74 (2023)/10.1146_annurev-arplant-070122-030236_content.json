{"Abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating gene expression, playing a crucial role in plant development, adaptation, and evolution. These non-coding DNA sequences, through their interaction with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, modulate the transcriptional activity of genes in response to internal and external stimuli. This review delves into the mechanisms by which CREs influence plant development, from embryogenesis to organogenesis, and their contribution to the plant's ability to adapt to environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, and temperature extremes. Furthermore, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of CREs, highlighting their role in the diversification of plant species and the emergence of novel traits. By integrating recent findings from genomics, epigenomics, and functional studies, this abstract underscores the significance of CREs in the transcriptional regulation underlying plant development, stress responses, and evolutionary innovation, offering insights into the molecular basis of plant resilience and adaptability."}
