{"Abstract": "Temperature sensing in plants is a critical mechanism for survival and adaptation to environmental changes. This study focuses on the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana to explore the molecular basis of thermosensing and its role in plant responses to heat and cold stress. Through a comprehensive analysis of thermosensors, we elucidate the pathways that lead to thermomorphogenesis, a process that allows plants to adjust their growth and development in response to temperature variations. Our findings highlight the importance of specific proteins and signaling cascades in mediating temperature perception and the subsequent physiological adaptations. This research provides insights into the complex interplay between environmental temperature and plant biology, offering potential strategies for enhancing crop resilience to climate change-induced temperature fluctuations."}
