{"Abstract": "This study explores the theoretical and practical dimensions of multienzyme organization and encapsulation, focusing on its implications for metabolic engineering. By leveraging protein scaffolds and bacterial microcompartments, we investigate strategies to enhance enzyme efficiency and stability, crucial for optimizing metabolic pathways. The research delves into the design principles of protein scaffolds that facilitate the spatial organization of enzymes, thereby improving substrate channeling and reaction rates. Additionally, the encapsulation of enzymes within bacterial microcompartments is examined as a method to protect enzymes from degradation and to create a controlled environment for metabolic reactions. Through a combination of computational modeling and experimental validation, this work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how multienzyme complexes can be engineered for improved metabolic flux and product yield. The findings have significant implications for the development of synthetic biology tools and the production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and other valuable chemicals."}
