{"Abstract": "The integration of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials into biomolecule sensing platforms has revolutionized the field due to their exceptional properties, such as high specific surface area (SSA) and tunable density of states (DOS). These materials, when incorporated into field-effect transistor (FET) configurations, offer unparalleled sensitivity and selectivity for detecting a wide range of biomolecules. The presence of defects in 2D materials, often considered a limitation, has been ingeniously exploited to enhance sensing capabilities. Furthermore, the development of sophisticated impedance models has provided deeper insights into the interaction mechanisms between biomolecules and 2D material surfaces. However, the lack of standardization in fabrication and characterization techniques poses significant challenges to the reproducibility and reliability of these sensors. This review highlights recent advancements, challenges, and future directions in leveraging graphene and 2D materials for biomolecule sensing, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols to harness their full potential."}
