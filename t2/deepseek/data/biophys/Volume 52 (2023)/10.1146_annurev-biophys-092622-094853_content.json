{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial ion channels play a pivotal role in cellular physiology, regulating ion homeostasis, energy production, and apoptosis. This review focuses on the diverse array of ion channels within the mitochondrial membranes, including calcium channels, potassium channels, chloride channels, the mitochondrial megachannel, and porin (VDAC). Calcium channels are crucial for modulating mitochondrial calcium levels, influencing cellular signaling and energy metabolism. Potassium channels, such as the ATP-sensitive and calcium-activated potassium channels, contribute to the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential and volume. Chloride channels are involved in maintaining ionic balance and osmotic regulation. The mitochondrial megachannel, also known as the permeability transition pore, is central to the regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability and cell death pathways. Porin, or the voltage-dependent anion channel, facilitates the exchange of metabolites and ions across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and physiological roles of these channels is essential for elucidating their contributions to health and disease."}
