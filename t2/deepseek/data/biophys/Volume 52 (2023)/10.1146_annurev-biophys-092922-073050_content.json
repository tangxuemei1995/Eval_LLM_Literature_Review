{"Abstract": "The assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes represent pivotal mechanisms in the innate immune response, orchestrating the defense against pathogens and cellular stress. NLR proteins, characterized by their nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat motifs, undergo autoinhibition in their resting state. Upon ligand recognition, these proteins assemble into high-molecular-weight complexes, forming either inflammasomes, which activate inflammatory caspases, or resistosomes, which can function as NADase holoenzymes or form channels in the plasma membrane. This review delves into the structural and functional aspects of these complexes, highlighting the molecular mechanisms underlying their assembly, the specificity of ligand recognition, and their roles in immune signaling. Understanding the architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes provides insights into their activation and regulation, offering potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases and infections."}
