{"Abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the translocation of a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes, utilizing the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. These transporters are involved in numerous physiological processes, including lipid homeostasis, drug extrusion, and are implicated in various human diseases. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have significantly enhanced our understanding of the structure and mechanism of human ABC transporters at near-atomic resolution. This review focuses on the structural insights gained from cryo-EM studies, highlighting the conformational changes associated with substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these structural findings for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting ABC transporters in the context of drug resistance and lipid-related disorders. The integration of structural biology with functional studies provides a comprehensive framework for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the diverse functions of ABC transporters in human health and disease."}
