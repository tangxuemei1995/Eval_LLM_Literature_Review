{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a pivotal technique in structural biology, enabling the visualization of molecular architectures within their native cellular environments. This review highlights the transformative impact of cryo-ET on in situ structural biology, offering unprecedented insights into the spatial organization and interactions of biomolecules. By integrating quantitative cell biology and biophysical modeling, cryo-ET facilitates a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes at the molecular level. The convergence of these approaches not only advances our knowledge of cellular function but also paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies by elucidating the structural basis of disease mechanisms. Cryo-ET stands as a cornerstone in the quest to bring structure to cell biology, bridging the gap between molecular detail and cellular context."}
