{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate mechanisms of protein dynamics, focusing on hydrogen exchange (HX) as a pivotal tool for understanding allostery in hemoglobin, the process of protein folding, and the operation of protein machines, including AAA+ proteins. Through an autobiographical lens, the research highlights the evolution of HX methodologies and their application in elucidating the conformational changes and functional dynamics of proteins. The findings underscore the significance of HX in advancing our comprehension of protein behavior and machinery."}
