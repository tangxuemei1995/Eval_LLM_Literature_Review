{"Abstract": "Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a pivotal technique in structural biology, enabling the visualization of macromolecular complexes in their native cellular context at near-atomic resolution. This 'resolution revolution' has been significantly propelled by advancements in cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling, facilitating the preparation of thin, vitrified specimens suitable for high-resolution imaging. In virology, cryo-ET has unveiled unprecedented insights into the architecture and life cycle of viruses within host cells, offering a surge of in situ discoveries that are reshaping our understanding of viral infection mechanisms and the host-pathogen interface."}
