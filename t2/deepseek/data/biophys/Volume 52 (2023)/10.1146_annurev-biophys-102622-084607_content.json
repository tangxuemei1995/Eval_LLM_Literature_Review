{"Abstract": "The accurate prediction of protein three-dimensional (3D) structures and protein complexes is a cornerstone in understanding biological functions and designing novel therapeutics. This study critically assesses the methodologies employed in predicting protein structures and interactions, with a focus on the advancements and challenges highlighted by the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and the Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) competitions. We explore the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including deep learning and machine learning algorithms, which have significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of predictions. Despite these advancements, the field faces ongoing challenges in predicting the structures of complex proteins and their interactions with high accuracy. This review synthesizes the current state of the art, identifies key areas for improvement, and discusses the potential of emerging technologies to overcome existing limitations. Our findings underscore the importance of continued innovation and collaboration in advancing the field of protein structure prediction."}
