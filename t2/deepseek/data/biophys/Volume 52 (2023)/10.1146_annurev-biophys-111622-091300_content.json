{"Abstract": "High-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a transformative tool in structural biology, enabling the determination of 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes at near-atomic resolution. This technique has significantly advanced our understanding of biological processes by providing detailed insights into the molecular architecture of complex assemblies. However, the prospects of cryo-EM are tempered by several limitations, including challenges associated with sample preparation, the presence of optical aberrations, and the need for substantial computational resources. Despite these hurdles, ongoing technological advancements in detector sensitivity, image processing algorithms, and aberration correction methods continue to push the boundaries of resolution and applicability. This review highlights the current state of cryo-EM, its potential for future discoveries, and the critical challenges that must be addressed to fully realize its capabilities in structural biology."}
