{"Abstract": "The study of protein dynamics is pivotal for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions. Recent advancements in time-resolved X-ray diffraction techniques, particularly serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) and time-resolved X-ray crystallography (TRX), have opened new avenues for capturing the transient states and structural changes of proteins at atomic resolution. These methods leverage the ultrashort pulses of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) to probe the excited states of proteins, providing insights into their mechanical responses to external stimuli such as electric fields. This review highlights the emerging applications of these techniques in elucidating the dynamic behavior of proteins, from conformational changes to the propagation of mechanical signals. By integrating these approaches with computational modeling, researchers can now explore the intricate interplay between protein structure and function in unprecedented detail, offering a deeper understanding of biological processes and aiding in the design of novel therapeutic strategies."}
