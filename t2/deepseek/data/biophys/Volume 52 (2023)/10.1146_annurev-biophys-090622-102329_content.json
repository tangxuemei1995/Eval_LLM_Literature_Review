{"Abstract": "The process of biological translation, a cornerstone of the universal genetic code, hinges on the precise molecular interactions that facilitate the conversion of mRNA sequences into functional proteins. This study delves into the stereochemical hypothesis, which posits that the specificity of amino acid incorporation is influenced by noncovalent interactions between amino acids and their cognate tRNAs. We explore the role of aminoacyl tRNA-synthetases in ensuring the fidelity of this process, highlighting their ability to discriminate between structurally similar amino acids. Furthermore, we examine the mRNAâ€“protein complementarity hypothesis, which suggests that direct interactions between mRNA and nascent proteins may guide the translation process. By integrating insights from structural biology and biochemistry, this research aims to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of translation, offering a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that sustain the flow of genetic information from nucleic acids to proteins."}
