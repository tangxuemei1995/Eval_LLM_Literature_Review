{"Abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical organelle for protein synthesis, folding, and quality control. This study investigates the mechanisms by which a coordinated Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp90 system ensures protein quality control within the ER. Molecular chaperones, including Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90, play pivotal roles in facilitating proper protein folding, preventing aggregation, and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and experimental data, we elucidate the sequential and cooperative actions of these chaperones in recognizing misfolded proteins, promoting their refolding, or directing them towards ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways. The interplay between these chaperones not only enhances the efficiency of protein folding but also contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis under stress conditions. This research highlights the importance of the Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp90 system in ER protein quality control, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with protein misfolding and ER stress."}
