{"Abstract": "The intricate process of protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices is a fundamental aspect of cellular function, influencing mechanisms such as DNA repair, transcription regulation, and microtubule dynamics. This study delves into the role of electrostatics and disordered regions in modulating the diffusion coefficient of proteins as they navigate these complex structures. By employing a combination of computational modeling and experimental data, we explore how electrostatic interactions facilitate the sliding of proteins along DNA and microtubule lattices, enhancing the efficiency of the DNA search process. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of intrinsically disordered regions within proteins on their diffusion behavior, revealing that these regions can significantly alter the dynamics of protein movement. Our findings provide novel insights into the biophysical principles governing protein diffusion, offering a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying essential cellular processes."}
