{"Abstract": "The field of synthetic biology has significantly advanced the understanding and manipulation of biological systems, leading to the conceptualization of the Expanded Central Dogma. This paradigm extends beyond the traditional flow of genetic information to include genome resynthesis, the development of orthogonal biosystems, and the exploration of synthetic genetics. Central to this expansion is the synthesis of entire genomes, which allows for the creation of organisms with customized genetic codes. Orthogonal biosystems, which operate independently of natural cellular processes, enable the incorporation of unnatural base pairs and xenonucleic acids (XNA), broadening the chemical diversity of genetic information. Synthetic genetics further explores the potential of these novel genetic systems to encode and propagate information, offering insights into the fundamental principles of life and the potential for groundbreaking applications in biotechnology and medicine."}
