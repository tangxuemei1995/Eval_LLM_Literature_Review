{"Abstract": "Rhodopsin, a G proteinâ€“coupled receptor (GPCR) pivotal in the visual transduction pathway, undergoes a complex mechanism of activation upon light absorption. This process involves the photoisomerization of its chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, to all-trans-retinal, triggering a series of conformational changes that lead to the active state of rhodopsin. Structural studies have elucidated the intricate details of these transitions, revealing how rhodopsin interacts with its G protein, transducin, to initiate the visual signal cascade. Understanding the activation mechanism of rhodopsin not only sheds light on the fundamental aspects of vision but also provides insights into the broader family of GPCRs, offering potential therapeutic targets for various diseases."}
