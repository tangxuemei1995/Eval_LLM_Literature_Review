{"Abstract": "Hybrid Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) methods have emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the intricate mechanisms of energy transduction in biomolecular machines. These methods allow for the detailed study of processes such as proton and electron transfers, as well as nucleotide hydrolysis, by combining the accuracy of quantum mechanics for the active site with the efficiency of molecular mechanics for the surrounding environment. This review highlights recent advancements in QM/MM methodologies and their application to understanding the dynamic behavior and energy conversion mechanisms of biomolecular machines. By bridging the gap between quantum and classical descriptions, QM/MM approaches provide invaluable insights into the molecular basis of energy transduction, paving the way for the design of novel biomimetic systems and therapeutic strategies."}
