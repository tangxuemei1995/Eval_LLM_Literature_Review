{"Abstract": "Quantitative Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (qSMLM) represents a transformative approach in super-resolution nanoscopy, enabling the precise localization and quantification of individual molecules within biological specimens. This technique leverages the stochastic blinking of fluorophores to achieve nanometer-scale resolution, surpassing the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy. By integrating advanced algorithms for quantitative analysis, qSMLM facilitates the detailed examination of molecular distributions, interactions, and dynamics in live and fixed cells. This review highlights the principles underlying qSMLM, its application in quantitative cell biology, and the challenges associated with achieving accurate and reproducible measurements. The potential of qSMLM to unravel complex biological processes at the molecular level underscores its significance in advancing our understanding of cellular mechanisms and disease pathology."}
