{"Abstract": "Ball-and-chain inactivation is a critical mechanism in the regulation of ion channel activity, particularly in voltage-gated K+ channels and Ca2+-activated K+ channels, with implications also observed in Na+ channels. This process, often referred to as N-type inactivation, involves a cytoplasmic domain (the 'ball') that physically obstructs the channel pore (the 'chain'), thereby preventing ion conductance. The ball-and-chain model provides a framework for understanding the rapid inactivation of ion channels following activation, a process essential for the proper functioning of excitable cells. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the structural and functional aspects of ball-and-chain inactivation, highlighting its role in the modulation of electrical signaling in neurons and muscle cells. By comparing the mechanisms across different types of ion channels, we aim to elucidate the evolutionary conservation and functional diversity of this inactivation process, offering insights into its physiological significance and potential therapeutic targets."}
