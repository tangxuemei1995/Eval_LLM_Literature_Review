{"Abstract": "The advent of genomic data has revolutionized our understanding of population relationships and history, offering unprecedented insights into demographic inference, admixture, ancestry, effective population size, and the calibration of molecular clocks. This study reviews the methodologies employed in the analysis of genomic data to unravel the complex tapestry of human and non-human populations. We focus on the computational and statistical frameworks that facilitate the estimation of demographic parameters, the detection of admixture events, and the reconstruction of ancestral relationships. Furthermore, we explore the application of molecular clocks in dating evolutionary events, emphasizing the integration of genomic data with fossil and archaeological records to enhance temporal resolution. The review highlights the challenges and opportunities in the field, including the impact of selection, mutation rates, and population structure on the accuracy of demographic inferences. By synthesizing current approaches, this work aims to guide future research in leveraging genomic data to decode the intricate history of populations."}
