{"Abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells, leading to various complications. This review delves into the genetic underpinnings of SCD, highlighting the role of genetic modifiers that influence disease severity. Recent advancements in curative approaches, particularly gene therapy and gene editing technologies, are explored, with a focus on ongoing clinical trials. The utilization of viral vectors for gene delivery and concerns regarding genotoxicity are critically examined. These innovative strategies offer promising avenues for the treatment of SCD, potentially transforming the therapeutic landscape for patients suffering from this debilitating condition."}
