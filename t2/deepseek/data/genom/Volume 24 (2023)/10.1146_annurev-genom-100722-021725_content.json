{"Abstract": "The rapid advancement of genomics has introduced complex legal challenges, particularly in the areas of liability, duty to warn, and data privacy. This paper explores the evolving legal landscape surrounding genomics, focusing on the potential liabilities faced by researchers, healthcare providers, and genetic counselors. It examines the duty to warn in the context of genetic information, highlighting the ethical and legal obligations to inform individuals of potential health risks identified through genetic testing. Additionally, the paper addresses the critical issue of data privacy, discussing the implications of handling sensitive genetic information and the need for robust data protection measures to prevent unauthorized access and misuse. By analyzing current legal frameworks and case studies, this research aims to provide guidance on navigating these legal land mines, ensuring compliance with legal standards while fostering innovation in the field of genomics."}
