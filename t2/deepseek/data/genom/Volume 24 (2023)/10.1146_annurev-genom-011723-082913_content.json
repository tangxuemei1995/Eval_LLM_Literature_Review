{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during development and has been implicated in various diseases. This study focuses on its function in neural crest cell (NCC) development and associated pathologies, including schwannoma and rhabdoid tumors. We explore the involvement of key components such as NF2 and Smarcb1, which are crucial for the proper differentiation and migration of NCCs, particularly Schwann cell precursors. Mutations in these genes disrupt the SWI/SNF complex's activity, leading to aberrant cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and experimental data, we highlight the complex's role in maintaining chromatin architecture and its impact on NCC lineage specification. Our findings underscore the importance of the SWI/SNF complex in neural crest biology and its potential as a therapeutic target in related diseases. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC development and the pathogenesis of associated disorders."}
