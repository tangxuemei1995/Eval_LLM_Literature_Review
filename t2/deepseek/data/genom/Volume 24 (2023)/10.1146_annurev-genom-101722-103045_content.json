{"Abstract": "Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomic research by enabling the direct reading of DNA molecules over tens of kilobases in length. This advancement has significantly improved the detection and characterization of structural variants, repetitive DNA regions, and complex genomic rearrangements that were previously challenging to resolve with short-read sequencing methods. Recent developments in long-read sequencing platforms have enhanced sequencing accuracy, throughput, and cost-effectiveness, facilitating their broader application in diverse research areas, including the identification of pathogenic mutations and the study of epigenetic modifications. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, such as the need for further improvements in sequencing error rates, data analysis algorithms, and the integration of long-read data with other genomic and epigenomic datasets. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for fully leveraging the potential of long-read sequencing in advancing our understanding of genome biology and its implications for human health and disease."}
