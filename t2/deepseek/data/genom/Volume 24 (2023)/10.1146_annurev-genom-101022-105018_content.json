{"Abstract": "This autobiographical research narrative explores the intricate journey from the study of blood cells to the underlying genetic mechanisms and back, highlighting pivotal discoveries in human genetics. Focusing on hemoglobinopathies, G6PD deficiency, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), the study delves into the role of somatic mutations and Darwinian selection in shaping these conditions. Through a personal lens, the research recounts the evolution of understanding from phenotypic observations to molecular genetics, emphasizing the transformative impact of technological advancements in genomics. The narrative underscores the importance of integrating clinical observations with genetic insights to unravel the complexities of blood disorders. By revisiting key milestones and reflecting on the interplay between genetic mutations and natural selection, this work contributes to a deeper comprehension of the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies for these diseases. The journey encapsulates the essence of scientific discovery, bridging the gap between cellular biology and genetic research to illuminate the path forward in hematology and genetics."}
