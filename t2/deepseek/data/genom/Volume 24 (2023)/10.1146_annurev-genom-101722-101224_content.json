{"Abstract": "The discovery of extracellular RNA (exRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs has opened new avenues in understanding RNA's role beyond the intracellular environment. This study delves into the systems and mechanisms facilitating RNA crossing membranes, focusing on the contextualization of exRNA and glycoRNAs on cell surfaces. By integrating findings from recent literature, we explore the biogenesis, trafficking, and functional implications of these RNA species. Special attention is given to the molecular interactions and pathways that enable RNA to traverse cellular membranes and localize on the cell surface, where they partake in cell-to-cell communication and signaling. This research underscores the significance of glycoRNAs in cellular recognition processes and their potential as biomarkers for disease. The findings contribute to a broader comprehension of RNA's extracellular functions and its implications for therapeutic and diagnostic applications."}
