{"Abstract": "Federated analysis represents a transformative approach to privacy-preserving data sharing, enabling collaborative research without the need to centralize sensitive information. This paper provides a comprehensive technical and legal primer on federated analysis, with a particular focus on its application in the field of genomics. We explore the technical underpinnings of federation, including data encryption, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy, which collectively ensure that individual data points remain confidential. Furthermore, we examine the legal landscape surrounding federated analysis, with an emphasis on compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. The paper highlights the challenges and opportunities presented by federated analysis in balancing the imperative of data privacy with the benefits of data sharing for scientific advancement. Through this exploration, we aim to provide researchers and policymakers with a foundational understanding of federated analysis as a tool for enabling privacy-conscious genomic research."}
