{"Abstract": "The axial length of the eye is a critical determinant of its refractive status, with deviations from the norm leading to significant visual impairments such as microphthalmia and high myopia. This study delves into the genetic underpinnings that influence axial length, focusing on the spectrum from microphthalmia, characterized by abnormally small eyes, to high myopia, where the eye is excessively elongated. Through a comprehensive review of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and familial linkage analyses, we identify key genetic loci and pathways implicated in the regulation of ocular growth. Our findings highlight the role of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, signaling pathways governing eye development, and factors influencing scleral biomechanics. Furthermore, we explore the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as near work and outdoor activity, in the manifestation of axial length anomalies. This research underscores the complexity of genetic contributions to axial length and offers insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing or mitigating the progression of refractive errors in childhood."}
