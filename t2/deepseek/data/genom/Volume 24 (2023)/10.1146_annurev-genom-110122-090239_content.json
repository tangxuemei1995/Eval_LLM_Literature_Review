{"Abstract": "Meiosis is a critical process for sexual reproduction, ensuring genetic diversity through the formation of haploid gametes. Central to this process is the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure that facilitates homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination. Disruptions in the formation or function of the SC can lead to meiotic errors, which are implicated in various forms of infertility, including azoospermia, primary ovarian failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss. This review explores the intricate relationship between meiotic chromosome structure, the SC, and infertility, highlighting recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions. By elucidating the role of the SC in meiosis, this research aims to provide insights into the genetic and molecular basis of infertility, offering potential avenues for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention."}
