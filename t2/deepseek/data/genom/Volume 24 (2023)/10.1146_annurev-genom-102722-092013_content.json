{"Abstract": "Padlock probeâ€“based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) represents a cutting-edge approach in spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT), enabling the precise localization and identification of RNA molecules within intact tissue sections. This method leverages the specificity of padlock probes and the amplification power of rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve high-resolution, multiplexed detection of gene expression patterns. By facilitating the construction of detailed spatial cell atlases and enabling in situ cell typing, ISS offers profound insights into the spatial organization and functional states of cells within their native tissue context. This overview highlights the methodological advancements and diverse applications of ISS in advancing our understanding of complex biological systems and disease mechanisms."}
