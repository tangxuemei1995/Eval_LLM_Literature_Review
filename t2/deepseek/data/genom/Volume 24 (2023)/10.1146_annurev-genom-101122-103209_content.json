{"Abstract": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in genomic research has significantly enhanced our understanding of human genetics, yet it also presents complex ethical challenges, particularly concerning the return of results (RoR) to participants. This paper explores the evolving landscape of RoR in the context of genomic research, focusing on the implications of secondary and incidental findings. As WGS becomes increasingly integrated into research protocols, the traditional norms governing RoR are being reevaluated to accommodate the vast amount of data generated. We argue for the establishment of a 'new normal' in RoR practices that balances the ethical obligations to participants with the practical limitations of interpreting and communicating complex genomic information. This discussion underscores the need for clear guidelines, participant autonomy, and the consideration of potential psychological impacts, aiming to foster a more participant-centered approach in genomic research."}
