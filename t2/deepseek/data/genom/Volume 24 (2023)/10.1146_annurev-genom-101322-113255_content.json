{"Abstract": "The advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has introduced significant challenges and opportunities for open data initiatives, particularly in the field of genomics. This paper explores the implications of GDPR on open science through the lens of the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), a pioneering project aimed at mapping all human cells. By analyzing the HCA's approach to data sharing, we identify key lessons for balancing the imperatives of open science with the stringent data protection requirements of GDPR. Our findings highlight the importance of developing robust consent mechanisms, implementing advanced data anonymization techniques, and fostering international collaborations to navigate the complex regulatory landscape. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on biomedical ethics and data protection, offering practical insights for researchers and policymakers striving to advance open science in the era of GDPR."}
