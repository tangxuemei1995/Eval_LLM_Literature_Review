{"Abstract": "This article explores the intersection of LatCrit (Latino Critical Race Theory) and criminology to develop a theoretical framework for understanding Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement. By integrating LatCrit's focus on the unique experiences of Latinos/as/xs with the broader concerns of criminological theory, this study aims to illuminate the complex ways in which race, ethnicity, and legal status intersect to shape criminal behavior and legal outcomes. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, the article argues that traditional criminological theories often fail to account for the specific socio-political contexts that affect Latino/a/x communities, such as immigration policies, racial profiling, and systemic discrimination. Through the lens of LatCrit, the study proposes a more nuanced approach that considers the impact of structural inequalities, cultural factors, and the lived experiences of Latino/a/x individuals. The article concludes with a call for future research to further develop and test this theoretical framework, emphasizing the importance of incorporating Latino/a/x perspectives in criminological studies to better understand and address the root causes of crime and legal system disparities within these communities."}
