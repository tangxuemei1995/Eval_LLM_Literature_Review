{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review and analysis of the impact of homicide measurement on cross-national research. Homicide rates are frequently used as a key indicator of societal violence and are central to comparative studies across countries. However, the methodologies for measuring homicide vary significantly between nations, leading to potential discrepancies in data quality and comparability. This study systematically examines the different approaches to homicide measurement, including police records, vital statistics, and surveys, and assesses their implications for cross-national research. Through a detailed literature review and analysis of existing datasets, we identify the main challenges in homicide measurement, such as underreporting, differences in legal definitions, and variations in data collection practices. The paper also explores the consequences of these measurement issues for the validity and reliability of cross-national studies, particularly in the context of criminological and sociological research. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions and best practices for improving the accuracy and consistency of homicide data across countries. The findings highlight the need for standardized measurement protocols and enhanced international cooperation to ensure more reliable and comparable homicide statistics. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on methodological challenges in cross-national research and provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners aiming to understand and address global patterns of violence."}
