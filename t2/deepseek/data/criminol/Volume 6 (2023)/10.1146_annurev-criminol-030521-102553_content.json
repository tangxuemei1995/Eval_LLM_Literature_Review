{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolution of terrorism within the United States from the September 11th attacks to the January 6th Capitol riot, focusing on the dynamics of far-right and jihadi extremism. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of incidents, ideologies, and responses, the research highlights the shifting landscape of domestic terrorism. The September 11th attacks marked a pivotal moment in U.S. history, catalyzing a global war on terror primarily aimed at jihadi extremism. However, the subsequent years have witnessed a significant rise in far-right extremism, culminating in the January 6th insurrection. This paper explores the ideological underpinnings, recruitment strategies, and operational tactics of both far-right and jihadi groups, drawing parallels and distinctions in their approaches to violence and hate crimes. Furthermore, it assesses the effectiveness of counter-terrorism measures and the challenges posed by the evolving nature of these threats. The findings underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of domestic terrorism, emphasizing the importance of addressing both far-right and jihadi extremism to safeguard national security and uphold democratic values."}
