{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to carceral systems worldwide, including prisons and jails, which are characterized by overcrowding and limited healthcare resources. This review synthesizes current literature on the incidence, mitigation strategies, and vaccination efforts within these settings. Studies indicate that the incidence of COVID-19 in carceral facilities is significantly higher than in the general population, attributed to close living quarters and difficulties in implementing social distancing measures. Mitigation strategies, such as cohorting, testing, and the use of personal protective equipment, have been employed with varying degrees of success. However, the effectiveness of these measures is often hindered by logistical and infrastructural limitations. Vaccination campaigns have been initiated in many jurisdictions, yet vaccine uptake among incarcerated populations and staff remains a challenge due to vaccine hesitancy and access issues. This review highlights the critical need for targeted public health interventions to control COVID-19 transmission in carceral systems, emphasizing the importance of equitable vaccine distribution and the implementation of comprehensive mitigation strategies to protect this vulnerable population."}
