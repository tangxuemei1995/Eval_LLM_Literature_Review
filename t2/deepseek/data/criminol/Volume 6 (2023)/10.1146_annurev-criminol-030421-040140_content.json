{"Abstract": "The opioid crisis has reignited debates over the efficacy and morality of the War on Drugs, a decades-long campaign that has disproportionately impacted communities of color, particularly during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. This paper examines the shifting narratives and policies surrounding drug use and addiction, highlighting the stark contrasts in societal and governmental responses to the crack and opioid crises. While the crack epidemic was met with punitive measures and mass incarceration, the opioid crisis has seen a more compassionate approach, emphasizing treatment and rehabilitation. This divergence raises critical questions about the role of race and class in shaping drug policy and public perception. By analyzing historical and contemporary drug policies, this study seeks to uncover the underlying factors that have influenced these disparate responses. Furthermore, it explores the implications of these policies for the future of drug treatment and the ongoing battle against substance abuse. The findings suggest that while the War on Drugs may be officially over, its legacy continues to influence the strategies and attitudes towards drug addiction, underscoring the need for a more equitable and effective approach to drug policy."}
