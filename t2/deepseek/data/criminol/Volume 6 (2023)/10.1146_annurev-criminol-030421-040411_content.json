{"Abstract": "This paper addresses six pivotal questions concerning the phenomenon of overcriminalization, a growing concern in contemporary legal systems. Overcriminalization refers to the excessive and often unnecessary expansion of criminal laws, leading to a plethora of offenses that may not warrant criminal sanctions. The first question explores the definition and scope of overcriminalization, distinguishing it from legitimate criminalization. The second question examines the role of discretion in the enforcement of criminal laws, highlighting how it can both mitigate and exacerbate the effects of overcriminalization. The third question delves into the concept of harm, questioning whether all criminalized behaviors result in significant harm to individuals or society. The fourth question scrutinizes the proportionality of punishment, considering whether the penalties for overcriminalized offenses are just and appropriate. The fifth question investigates the impact of overcriminalization on the legal system, including the burden it places on courts, law enforcement, and correctional facilities. Finally, the sixth question considers potential defenses and reforms to counteract overcriminalization, suggesting ways to refine the criminal justice system to focus on truly harmful behaviors. Through this exploration, the paper aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of overcriminalization and to stimulate debate on how to achieve a balanced and just criminal legal framework."}
