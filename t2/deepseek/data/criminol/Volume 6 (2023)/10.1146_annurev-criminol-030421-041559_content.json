{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving trends in women's incarceration rates within US prisons and jails, highlighting the disparities and inequalities that characterize the mass incarceration phenomenon. By analyzing data from the past few decades, the research identifies key factors contributing to the rise in female imprisonment, including changes in sentencing laws, the war on drugs, and socio-economic inequalities. The paper also explores the gendered consequences of incarceration, such as the impact on families, mental health, and reentry challenges. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and statistical analysis, this research aims to shed light on the systemic issues that disproportionately affect women in the criminal justice system. The findings underscore the need for policy reforms that address the root causes of women's incarceration and mitigate its long-term effects on individuals and communities."}
