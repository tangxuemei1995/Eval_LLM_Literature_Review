{"Abstract": "The American criminal justice system is currently facing a profound crisis, characterized by mass incarceration, police killings, and persistent criminal violence. This paper conducts a structural analysis to explore the underlying factors contributing to this crisis, focusing on the interplay between social control mechanisms and the political economy. By examining the historical evolution of the welfare state and its transformation, the study highlights how economic policies and social welfare cuts have exacerbated inequalities, leading to increased reliance on the criminal justice system as a tool for social control. The analysis reveals that mass incarceration and police violence are not merely outcomes of individual actions but are deeply embedded in the structural fabric of American society, reflecting broader socio-economic and political dynamics. The paper argues for a comprehensive reform of the criminal justice system, emphasizing the need to address the root causes of criminal behavior through social and economic policies that promote equity and justice. This structural approach offers a pathway towards resolving the current crisis and building a more just and humane criminal justice system."}
