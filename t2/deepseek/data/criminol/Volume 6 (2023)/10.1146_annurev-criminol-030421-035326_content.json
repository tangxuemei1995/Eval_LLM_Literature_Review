{"Abstract": "This study explores the paradigm of Expanded Criminal Defense Lawyering, a transformative approach that integrates the principles of holistic defense, effective assistance of counsel, and the right to counsel within the context of indigent defense systems. Amidst the backdrop of mass incarceration, the research underscores the critical role of defense counsel in not only addressing the immediate legal needs of the accused but also in tackling the underlying socio-economic factors that contribute to criminal behavior. By employing a multidisciplinary strategy, defense attorneys are positioned to advocate more comprehensively for their clients, thereby enhancing the quality of legal representation and potentially reducing recidivism rates. The paper critically examines the challenges and opportunities inherent in implementing expanded defense practices, including resource allocation, training, and systemic barriers. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, this research aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on criminal justice reform, advocating for a more equitable and effective defense system that upholds the constitutional rights of all individuals, particularly the indigent."}
