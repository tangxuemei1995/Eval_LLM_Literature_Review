{"Abstract": "The integration of advanced surveillance technologies into law enforcement practices has sparked significant debate within the realm of constitutional law, particularly concerning the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. This paper examines the evolving relationship between surveillance technologies and constitutional safeguards, focusing on the implications for privacy rights and the legal standards governing the use of such technologies in crime prevention and investigation. Through a comprehensive review of case law, legislative developments, and scholarly commentary, the study highlights the challenges in balancing the benefits of surveillance for public safety against the potential for overreach and infringement on individual liberties. The analysis concludes with recommendations for legal reforms and policy measures aimed at ensuring that the deployment of surveillance technologies adheres to constitutional principles, thereby safeguarding citizens' rights in the digital age."}
