{"Abstract": "This paper explores the evolving field of historical criminology, emphasizing its scope, significance, and potential future directions. Historical criminology, by integrating insights from criminal justice history and historical time, offers a unique lens through which to understand the complexities of crime and justice across different periods. The interdisciplinary nature of this field, drawing from history, sociology, law, and criminology, enriches our comprehension of the socio-political and cultural contexts that shape criminal behavior and justice responses. This study highlights the importance of historical criminology in uncovering patterns and continuities in crime and punishment, thereby informing contemporary criminal justice policies and practices. Furthermore, it discusses the challenges and opportunities for future research, advocating for a more nuanced and inclusive approach that considers diverse historical narratives and perspectives. By renewing interest in historical criminology, this paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical dimensions of crime and justice, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration."}
