{"Abstract": "This study explores the minimal thresholds of supervision necessary within probation, parole, and broader community supervision frameworks, amidst the context of mass supervision. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, the research investigates the efficacy of reduced supervision levels on recidivism rates, rehabilitation outcomes, and community safety. By analyzing various supervision models, from intensive to minimal oversight, the paper aims to identify the point at which supervision becomes counterproductive, potentially exacerbating the challenges faced by individuals under supervision. The findings suggest that a nuanced approach, tailored to individual risk levels and needs, may offer a viable path towards reducing the reliance on mass supervision without compromising public safety. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on criminal justice reform, offering insights into how systems can evolve to support rehabilitation and reintegration more effectively, while questioning the necessity and impact of extensive supervision regimes."}
