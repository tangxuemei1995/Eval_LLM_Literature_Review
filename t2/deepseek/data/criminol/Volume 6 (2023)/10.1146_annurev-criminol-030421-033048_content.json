{"Abstract": "This study seeks to revitalize ethnographic approaches to understanding the complex relationship between immigration and crime, drawing on the rich tradition of the Chicago School of sociology. By employing qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews and participant observation, the research focuses on the lived experiences of new immigrants in urban settings. The aim is to challenge prevailing stereotypes and simplistic narratives by providing nuanced insights into how immigrants navigate the challenges of integration, social exclusion, and legal systems. Through ethnographies of migration, this work highlights the diversity of immigrant experiences and the socio-economic factors that influence crime rates among immigrant communities. The findings underscore the importance of context and the need for policies that address the root causes of crime, rather than scapegoating immigrants. This research contributes to a more informed and empathetic understanding of the immigrant experience in contemporary society."}
