{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate relationship between police unionism, accountability mechanisms, and instances of police misconduct, with a particular focus on the use of force. By analyzing the role of collective bargaining agreements and the Law Enforcement Bill of Rights, the research aims to uncover how these frameworks influence the oversight and disciplinary processes within law enforcement agencies. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the paper explores the extent to which police unions contribute to or hinder the establishment of effective accountability measures. The findings suggest that while police unions play a crucial role in protecting officers' rights, they may also inadvertently shield members from accountability, thereby complicating efforts to address misconduct. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on police reform by highlighting the need for balanced policies that ensure both the protection of officers' rights and the accountability necessary to maintain public trust in law enforcement."}
