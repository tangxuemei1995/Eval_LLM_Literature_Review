{"Abstract": "This study explores the viability of conservative criminal justice reform in the context of rising crime rates, focusing on the balance between public safety and the common good. By analyzing recent trends in crime statistics and the evolution of conservative policies, particularly within the Republican Party, the research assesses the impact of reform measures on recidivism rates and community safety. The investigation draws on a comprehensive review of legislative changes, policy debates, and empirical studies to evaluate whether conservative approaches to criminal justice reform can sustain their momentum amidst increasing public concern over crime. The findings aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on effective, equitable, and sustainable criminal justice policies that align with conservative principles while addressing the challenges posed by rising crime rates."}
