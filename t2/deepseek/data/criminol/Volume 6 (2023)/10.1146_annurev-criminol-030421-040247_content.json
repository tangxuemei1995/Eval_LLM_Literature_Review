{"Abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of police killings in the United States through a comparative lens, highlighting the country's exceptional rates of lethal force by law enforcement when contrasted with other developed nations. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates criminology, sociology, and political science, the research delves into the structural and cultural factors that contribute to this disparity. Key among these are the decentralized nature of American policing, which lacks a unified national standard for the use of deadly force, and the pervasive influence of American exceptionalism, which shapes both public expectations and police behavior. The analysis also explores the mechanisms of police accountability in the U.S., identifying systemic weaknesses that fail to deter excessive use of force. By comparing the U.S. with countries that have lower rates of police killings, this study aims to identify best practices and policy reforms that could reduce the incidence of lethal encounters with law enforcement. The findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive reform to address the uniquely American problem of police violence."}
