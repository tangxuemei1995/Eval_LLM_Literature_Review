{"Abstract": "Carjacking, a violent form of robbery involving the theft of a motor vehicle directly from its owner, has emerged as a significant concern in urban crime trends. This study delves into the scope, structure, and process of carjacking incidents, utilizing data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) to analyze patterns and characteristics of these crimes. By examining the decision-making processes of offenders and the victimization experiences, the research aims to uncover the underlying factors that contribute to the occurrence of carjacking. Furthermore, the study explores effective prevention strategies, drawing on empirical evidence to propose measures that can deter potential offenders and protect potential victims. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of carjacking as a distinct crime category, offering insights for law enforcement agencies and policymakers to develop targeted interventions. This research underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to crime prevention, emphasizing the need for community engagement, technological solutions, and legal reforms to address the multifaceted nature of carjacking."}
