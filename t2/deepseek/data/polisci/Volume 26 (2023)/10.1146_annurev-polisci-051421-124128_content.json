{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex dynamics between nonviolent resistance and the presence of violence within protest movements, focusing on the roles of violent flanks, unarmed collective violence, and riots. While nonviolent resistance is often championed for its moral and strategic advantages, the emergence of violent elements within these movements can significantly alter their trajectory and outcomes. Through an analysis of historical and contemporary case studies, this research investigates how the presence of violence, whether from within the movement or external forces, impacts the effectiveness, public perception, and longevity of nonviolent campaigns. The findings suggest that while violent flanks can sometimes escalate tensions and provoke harsher repression, they may also draw attention to the movement's cause and catalyze broader support. However, the study underscores the importance of strategic nonviolence in maintaining moral high ground and achieving sustainable political change, highlighting the delicate balance movements must navigate to harness the potential benefits of violent elements without undermining their core principles."}
