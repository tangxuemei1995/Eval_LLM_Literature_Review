{"Abstract": "This study investigates the economic backgrounds of politicians, focusing on the interplay between political elites, class, education, wealth, and representation. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of political figures across various democracies, the research aims to uncover patterns and disparities in the socioeconomic origins of elected officials. The analysis reveals a significant overrepresentation of individuals from affluent backgrounds and elite educational institutions within political ranks, suggesting a persistent class bias in political representation. Furthermore, the study explores the implications of this bias on policy-making and democratic governance, highlighting potential barriers to equitable representation and the perpetuation of socioeconomic inequalities. The findings underscore the need for reforms aimed at diversifying political leadership to better reflect the socioeconomic diversity of the electorate, thereby enhancing the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic institutions."}
