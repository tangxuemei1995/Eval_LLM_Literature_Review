{"Abstract": "This study explores the pivotal role of the South in shaping American political development, with a particular focus on the enduring legacies of Jim Crow laws, authoritarian governance, and white supremacy. By examining the intricate dynamics of southern politics and its profound influence on national policies, including the New Deal, the research sheds light on how the South has historically been a crucible for political ideologies that have both challenged and reinforced the United States' democratic ideals. Through an analysis of historical documents, legislative records, and political discourse, this paper argues that the South's political culture, characterized by its resistance to federal intervention and its commitment to maintaining racial hierarchies, has significantly impacted the trajectory of American political evolution. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of southern influence on the broader American political landscape, offering insights into the ongoing debates over race, governance, and democracy in the United States."}
