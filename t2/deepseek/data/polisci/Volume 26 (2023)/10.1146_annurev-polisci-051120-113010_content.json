{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between democracy and the corporation from a historical and theoretical perspective, focusing on the interplay of republicanism, constitutionalism, and the foundational principles of enterprise. It argues that the evolution of corporate entities has significantly influenced democratic governance, often exacerbating inequalities within societies. By examining the long view of this relationship, the study highlights how corporations have both supported and undermined democratic ideals, from their role in fostering economic growth to their impact on political power dynamics. The analysis draws on a wide range of historical examples and theoretical frameworks to assess the implications of corporate power for democratic institutions and practices. Ultimately, the paper calls for a reevaluation of the constitutional and republican principles that govern the corporation, suggesting pathways towards a more equitable alignment between corporate practices and democratic values."}
