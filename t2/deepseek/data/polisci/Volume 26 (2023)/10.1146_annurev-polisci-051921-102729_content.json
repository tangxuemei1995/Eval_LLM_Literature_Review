{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of citizenship policies in Western Europe, focusing on the causes and consequences of naturalization processes. By analyzing the interplay between immigration trends and integration strategies, the research sheds light on how citizenship laws influence societal cohesion and individual identity. Utilizing a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the paper aims to uncover the policy mechanisms that either facilitate or hinder the naturalization of immigrants. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of citizenship in shaping multicultural societies and the implications for policy-making in the context of increasing global migration."}
