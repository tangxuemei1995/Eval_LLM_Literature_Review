{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between gender, sexuality, and international relations, with a particular focus on how these elements influence political economy and foreign policy. By analyzing a wide range of scholarly articles, policy documents, and case studies, the research highlights the often-overlooked role of gender and sexuality in shaping international political dynamics. It argues that a deeper understanding of these factors can lead to more inclusive and effective foreign policies. The paper also examines the impact of gender norms and sexual identities on economic policies and international negotiations, suggesting that a gender-sensitive approach to international relations could foster greater global cooperation and peace. Through this analysis, the study aims to contribute to the growing body of literature that seeks to integrate gender perspectives into the study of international relations, offering new insights for policymakers and scholars alike."}
