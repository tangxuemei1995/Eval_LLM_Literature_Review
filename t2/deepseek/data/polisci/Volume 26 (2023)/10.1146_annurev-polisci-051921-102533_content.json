{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between agenda setting and democracy, focusing on the role of social movements, petitions, and advocacy in shaping public and political agendas. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of social movements and their outcomes, alongside a review of existing literature on democratic processes, we investigate how non-state actors influence the prioritization of issues within democratic systems. Our findings suggest that social movements and advocacy groups play a pivotal role in agenda setting, often acting as catalysts for change by mobilizing public opinion and pressuring policymakers. Petitions emerge as a significant tool for advocacy, enabling citizens to directly influence the political agenda. This research contributes to the broader discourse on democracy by highlighting the mechanisms through which societal demands are integrated into political decision-making processes, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics between civil society and state institutions in the context of agenda democracy."}
