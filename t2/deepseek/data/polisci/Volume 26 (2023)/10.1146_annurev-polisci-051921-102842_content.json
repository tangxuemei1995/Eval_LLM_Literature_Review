{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between the state and trust, focusing on the impact of sanctions and corruption on public confidence in governmental institutions. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the research synthesizes findings from political science, sociology, and economics to analyze how state actions, particularly those involving sanctions and corruption, influence trust levels among citizens. The investigation reveals that while sanctions can erode trust by highlighting state vulnerabilities and inefficiencies, corruption significantly undermines it by fostering perceptions of injustice and inequality. Through a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, this paper argues that rebuilding trust requires transparent governance, accountability, and effective anti-corruption measures. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on state legitimacy and the mechanisms through which trust can be restored or maintained in the face of governance challenges."}
