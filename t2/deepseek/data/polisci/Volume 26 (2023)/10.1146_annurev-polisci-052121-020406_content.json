{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of authoritarian power sharing, exploring its foundational concepts, operational mechanisms, and strategic implementations within authoritarian regimes. By integrating insights from authoritarian politics, civil wars, commitment problems, coups, and institutional frameworks, the research elucidates how power-sharing arrangements are devised and sustained among elite factions to mitigate internal conflicts and stabilize regimes. The analysis highlights the pivotal role of institutions in facilitating credible commitments among power contenders, thereby reducing the likelihood of coups and civil wars. Furthermore, the study examines the strategic use of power-sharing mechanisms as tools for co-optation, repression, and negotiation, offering a comprehensive understanding of their impact on regime durability and political stability. Through a multidisciplinary approach, this research contributes to the broader discourse on authoritarian resilience and the complexities of governance in non-democratic contexts."}
