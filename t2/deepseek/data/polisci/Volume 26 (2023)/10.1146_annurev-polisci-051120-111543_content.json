{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of supply chain governance through a multi-level lens, emphasizing the interplay between structure and context. By integrating concepts from network theory, environmental studies, and labor economics, we propose a framework that addresses the complexity and polycentricity inherent in modern supply chains. Our analysis reveals that effective governance requires a nuanced understanding of the diverse actors, institutions, and environmental factors that shape supply chain operations. We argue that a multi-level approach, which considers both macro and micro contexts, is essential for fostering resilience, sustainability, and equity in global supply networks. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how contextual factors such as regulatory environments, labor conditions, and ecological constraints influence governance mechanisms. The findings underscore the importance of adaptive, context-sensitive strategies in navigating the challenges of supply chain governance, offering valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers aiming to enhance the robustness and fairness of supply chain systems."}
