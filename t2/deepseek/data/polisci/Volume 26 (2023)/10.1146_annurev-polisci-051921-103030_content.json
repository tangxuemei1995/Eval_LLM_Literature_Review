{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolution of growth and welfare regimes across different temporal and spatial contexts, focusing on the transition from Fordism to financialization and the emergence of the knowledge-based economy. Utilizing a comparative political economy framework, it examines how these shifts have influenced the development of welfare states and their capacity to adapt to changing economic paradigms. The analysis highlights the divergent paths taken by various countries in reconciling economic growth with social welfare objectives, underscoring the role of institutional configurations and policy choices in shaping these outcomes. By integrating historical and contemporary perspectives, the research sheds light on the complex interplay between economic transformations and welfare state resilience, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by the ongoing transition to a knowledge-based economy. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics driving growth and welfare regimes in the 21st century."}
