{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of bureaucratic politics, shedding light on its blind spots and untapped opportunities within the realm of political science. By examining the interplay between personnel appointments, bureaucratic performance, and oversight mechanisms, the research underscores the pivotal role of accountability in shaping bureaucratic behavior. Furthermore, it explores the nuanced ways in which influence and lobbying intersect with procurement processes, revealing the complex web of interactions that define bureaucratic decision-making. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and case studies, this paper aims to bridge gaps in understanding and propose avenues for future research. It advocates for a more nuanced approach to studying bureaucracy, one that considers the multifaceted influences on its operations and the potential for reform to enhance its efficacy and transparency in governance."}
