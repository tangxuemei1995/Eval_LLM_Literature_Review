{"Abstract": "This paper explores the evolution of global health governance from the era of imperialism through the so-called 'Golden Age' of international health cooperation, culminating in the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, referred to as the 'Great Lockdown'. It critically examines the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health organizations in shaping the politics of global health, highlighting the interplay between national interests and global health priorities. The study argues that the trajectory of global health governance has been significantly influenced by geopolitical dynamics, economic interests, and the shifting landscape of international relations. By analyzing the response to COVID-19, the paper sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of the current global health governance framework, including issues of equity, sovereignty, and the effectiveness of multilateral cooperation. The findings suggest that while the 'Golden Age' represented a period of optimism and progress in global health, the 'Great Lockdown' has exposed critical vulnerabilities and the need for a more resilient and inclusive approach to global health governance in the face of future pandemics."}
