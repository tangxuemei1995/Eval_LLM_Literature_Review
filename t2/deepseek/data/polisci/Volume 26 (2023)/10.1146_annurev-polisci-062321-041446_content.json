{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of racist dehumanization in the United States, focusing on its political underpinnings and societal ramifications. By examining historical and contemporary instances of dehumanization against Black and Indigenous populations, alongside the perpetuation of white supremacy, the research highlights the mechanisms through which racial prejudice is sustained and normalized. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates sociology, political science, and psychology, the analysis reveals how dehumanizing rhetoric and policies are strategically employed to marginalize and oppress racial minorities, thereby reinforcing systemic inequalities. The paper also explores the role of racial attitudes in shaping public opinion and policy, arguing that a deeper understanding of these processes is crucial for dismantling racist structures. Through this exploration, the study aims to contribute to the broader discourse on race and racism, offering insights into the challenges and possibilities for achieving racial justice in the United States."}
