{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolving role of Asian Americans in the political landscape of the twenty-first century, focusing on their political participation, civic engagement, and the impact of policies on their communities. As one of the fastest-growing racial groups in the United States, Asian Americans are increasingly influencing electoral outcomes and policy debates. Through an analysis of recent elections, civic activities, and policy developments, this research highlights the challenges and opportunities faced by Asian Americans in asserting their political voice. The findings suggest that while significant strides have been made in political representation and civic involvement, barriers such as voter suppression and underrepresentation persist, underscoring the need for targeted policies to enhance political engagement among Asian Americans."}
