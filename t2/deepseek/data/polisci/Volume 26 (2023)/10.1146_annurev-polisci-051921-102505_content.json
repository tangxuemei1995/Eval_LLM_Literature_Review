{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted political role of business leaders, focusing on their influence through financial contributions, lobbying efforts, and civic engagement. By analyzing the intersection of business, money, and politics, the research highlights how corporate leaders leverage their resources and platforms to shape public policy and societal norms. The investigation delves into the phenomenon of CEO activism, where business executives take public stands on social and political issues, and examines the implications of such actions for corporate social responsibility (CSR) and stakeholder relations. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of the evolving dynamics between business leadership and political engagement, offering insights into the potential benefits and challenges of this increasingly prominent role in the contemporary socio-political landscape."}
