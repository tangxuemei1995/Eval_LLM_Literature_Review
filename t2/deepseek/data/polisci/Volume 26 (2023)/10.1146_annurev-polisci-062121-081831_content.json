{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted dimensions of women's empowerment in the developing world, focusing on their roles in politics, the impact of electoral quotas, and the dynamics of intrafamily bargaining. Through a comparative analysis of political development across various states, it examines how gender equality initiatives have influenced state formation processes and the broader socio-political landscape. The research highlights the significance of women's participation in political arenas, not only as a matter of justice and rights but also as a catalyst for more inclusive and effective governance. By analyzing the implementation and outcomes of electoral quotas, the study sheds light on the mechanisms that can enhance women's political representation and leadership. Furthermore, it delves into the complexities of intrafamily bargaining, revealing how power dynamics within households can both reflect and shape broader societal attitudes towards gender roles. This comprehensive approach offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for advancing women's power and gender equality in the developing world."}
