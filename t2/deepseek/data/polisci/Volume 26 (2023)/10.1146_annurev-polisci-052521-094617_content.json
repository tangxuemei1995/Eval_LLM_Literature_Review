{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted dimensions of political inequality within the context of rich democracies, focusing on the interplay between participation, representation, congruence, and responsiveness. By analyzing the impact of income inequality and the role of trade unions, the research sheds light on how economic disparities influence political engagement and the quality of democratic representation. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from various rich democracies, the study employs quantitative methods to assess the extent to which political inequality undermines the principles of democracy. Findings suggest that higher levels of income inequality correlate with reduced political participation and representation, particularly among lower-income groups. Furthermore, the presence of strong trade unions is shown to mitigate some effects of political inequality by enhancing the political voice of the working class. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on the challenges facing democratic governance in the era of growing economic disparities."}
