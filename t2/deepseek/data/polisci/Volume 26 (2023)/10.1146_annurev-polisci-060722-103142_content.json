{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate relationship between democracy and policing in the United States, with a particular focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by the pursuit of a multiracial democracy. Against the backdrop of racial authoritarianism, the research explores how policing practices and the broader criminal justice system intersect with issues of identity, influencing the democratic experience of diverse communities. Through a critical analysis of historical and contemporary case studies, the paper examines the ways in which policing can both undermine and support democratic principles, especially in contexts marked by racial and ethnic diversity. The conversation extends beyond the ballot box to consider how law enforcement policies and practices shape the lived realities of citizens, affecting their sense of belonging, security, and rights within the democratic framework. By highlighting the tensions between democratic ideals and the realities of policing, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in achieving a truly inclusive and equitable democracy in the United States."}
