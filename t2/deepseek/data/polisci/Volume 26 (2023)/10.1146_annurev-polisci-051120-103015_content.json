{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of political science and public health through the lens of political economy, aiming to elucidate how political structures and economic policies influence population health and health equity. By integrating theories from political science with empirical research on health systems and social determinants of health, we argue that political decisions and economic arrangements are fundamental to understanding disparities in health outcomes. The analysis highlights the role of governance, policy-making processes, and economic systems in shaping access to healthcare and the distribution of health resources. Through a comprehensive review of literature, this study underscores the necessity of incorporating political economy perspectives into public health research and practice to address the root causes of health inequities and to foster more equitable health systems."}
