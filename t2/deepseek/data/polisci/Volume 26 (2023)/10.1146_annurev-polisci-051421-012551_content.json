{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between environmental factors and political behavior, focusing on the dual lenses of context and contact theory. By integrating insights from ethnic politics, neighborhood effects, and the built environment, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how spatial and social contexts influence political attitudes and actions. The research delves into the mechanisms through which physical and social environments shape political engagement, particularly in the context of inequality and ethnic diversity. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, we analyze the role of direct and indirect contact in fostering political cohesion or division within communities. Our findings suggest that both the built environment and social interactions play pivotal roles in shaping political behavior, offering new perspectives on the interplay between environmental factors and political dynamics. This study contributes to the broader discourse on environmental effects on politics, highlighting the importance of context and contact in understanding political behavior."}
