{"Abstract": "Historical Political Economy (HPE) represents a burgeoning field that bridges the gap between history and political science, focusing on how historical events and institutions shape contemporary political and economic outcomes. This paper explores the evolution of HPE, emphasizing its methodological advancements in causal inference and the integration of formal theory to understand the persistence of legacies. By examining key studies, we highlight how HPE has illuminated the long-term effects of historical phenomena, such as colonialism, state formation, and institutional development, on modern governance and economic performance. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities facing HPE, including the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the application of innovative analytical techniques. Looking ahead, we argue that HPE is poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of the complex interplay between history, politics, and economics, offering insights into the mechanisms of persistence and the pathways of institutional change."}
