{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of bureaucratic autonomy, a critical yet contested element in the nexus of political control and administrative efficiency. By synthesizing insights from comparative politics and comparative administrative law, we delineate the parameters within which bureaucratic entities operate with varying degrees of independence from direct political oversight. Central to our analysis is the examination of delegation and discretion as mechanisms that either constrain or enable bureaucratic autonomy. Through a comparative lens, we assess how different political and legal systems balance the imperative for political accountability with the need for administrative expertise and efficiency. Our findings suggest that bureaucratic autonomy is not a monolithic concept but varies significantly across contexts, influenced by institutional design, legal frameworks, and political culture. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the dynamics between political control and bureaucratic independence, offering implications for both theory and practice in public administration."}
