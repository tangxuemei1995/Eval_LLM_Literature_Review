{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of turbulent spots, pivotal in the transition from laminar to turbulent flow across various fluid systems. By examining boundary layer, pipe flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, turbomachinery flow, and hypersonic flow, we uncover novel insights into the formation, growth, and interaction of these spots. Our analysis leverages advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques and experimental data to elucidate the mechanisms driving the transition process. The findings highlight the critical role of initial disturbances and flow conditions in the evolution of turbulent spots, offering a deeper understanding of turbulence onset. This research not only advances the fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics but also has significant implications for enhancing the design and efficiency of engineering systems subjected to turbulent flows."}
