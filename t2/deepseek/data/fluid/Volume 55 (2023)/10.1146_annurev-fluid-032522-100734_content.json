{"Abstract": "The accelerated melting of icebergs, a critical component of the Earth's cryosphere, has profound implications for global sea levels and oceanic ecosystems. This study synthesizes recent research on the mechanisms driving iceberg melting, focusing on the interplay between atmospheric warming, oceanic currents, and ice dynamics. Utilizing satellite imagery, in situ measurements, and climate models, we assess the spatial and temporal variability of iceberg melt rates across polar regions. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of iceberg melting to sea level rise, with particular emphasis on the role of basal melting and calving processes. Furthermore, we explore the cascading effects of freshwater influx on ocean stratification, marine biodiversity, and global climate feedback loops. The study underscores the urgency of integrating iceberg dynamics into climate models to improve predictions of future sea level rise and to inform mitigation strategies in the face of ongoing climate change."}
