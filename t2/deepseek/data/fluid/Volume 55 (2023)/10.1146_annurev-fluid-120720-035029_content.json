{"Abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of face masks in mitigating the spread of respiratory infections, particularly those caused by airborne pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. This study delves into the flow physics of face masks, examining their efficacy in filtering airborne particles and reducing the transmission of coronavirus. By analyzing the interaction between respiratory droplets and mask materials, we explore the mechanisms of particle capture, including inertial impaction, diffusion, and electrostatic attraction. Our findings highlight the importance of mask fit and material properties in enhancing filtration efficiency and minimizing leakage. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of mask usage on airflow dynamics, shedding light on how masks alter the trajectory and dispersion of exhaled aerosols. Through a combination of experimental measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulations, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the protective capabilities of face masks against airborne transmission. The insights gained from this study are instrumental in guiding public health recommendations and the design of more effective respiratory protection devices in the fight against COVID-19 and future respiratory pandemics."}
