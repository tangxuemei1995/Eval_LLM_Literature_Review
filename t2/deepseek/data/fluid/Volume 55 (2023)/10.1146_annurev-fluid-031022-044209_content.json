{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of mathematical methods derived from quantum mechanics to linear flow analysis, focusing on the interplay between symmetries, degeneracy, and perturbations in fluid dynamics. By leveraging concepts such as spectral analysis and eigenvalues, we investigate the stability of fluid flows under various conditions. The research highlights the significance of exceptional points in the spectrum of linear operators, which are pivotal in understanding the transition from stable to unstable flow regimes. Through a comprehensive examination of these quantum-inspired techniques, we aim to provide new insights into the complex behavior of linear flows, offering a novel perspective on the analysis of fluid dynamics systems. This approach not only bridges the gap between quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics but also opens up new avenues for the exploration of stability and perturbation effects in a wide range of physical systems."}
