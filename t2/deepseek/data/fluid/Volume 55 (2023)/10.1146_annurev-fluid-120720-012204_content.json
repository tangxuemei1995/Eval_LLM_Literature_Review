{"Abstract": "This study investigates the self-propulsion mechanisms of chemically active droplets, a class of microswimmers that exhibit autonomous motion through the generation of Marangoni flows. By leveraging the interplay between advectionâ€“diffusion processes and viscous flows, these droplets achieve symmetry-breaking, enabling their propulsion in a fluid medium. The research focuses on understanding the underlying physical principles that govern the motion of active droplets, including the role of chemical gradients and surface tension variations. Through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental observations, we elucidate the conditions under which these droplets can sustain directed motion, highlighting the significance of the Marangoni effect in driving their propulsion. The findings contribute to the broader field of active matter by providing insights into the design and control of synthetic microswimmers, with potential applications in targeted drug delivery, microfluidics, and environmental remediation."}
