{"Abstract": "The dynamics of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (3D SBLIs) represent a complex and critical area of study in fluid dynamics, with significant implications for aerospace engineering and high-speed vehicle design. This research delves into the intricate interplay between shock waves and boundary layers in three-dimensional flows, focusing on the mechanisms of turbulence generation, flow separation, and the formation of shear layers. By employing advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques and experimental methods, we investigate the stability characteristics of these interactions and their impact on fluid/structure dynamics. The study also explores innovative flow control strategies aimed at mitigating adverse effects such as increased drag and structural loads, thereby enhancing the performance and safety of high-speed vehicles. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of 3D SBLIs, offering valuable insights for the development of more efficient aerodynamic designs and the optimization of flow control technologies in challenging high-speed environments."}
