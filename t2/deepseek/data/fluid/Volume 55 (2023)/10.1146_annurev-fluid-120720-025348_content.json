{"Abstract": "This study explores the transformative potential of tabletop experiments in advancing scientific research and education, particularly under resource constraints prevalent in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). By leveraging compact, cost-effective experimental setups, we demonstrate how tabletop science can democratize access to cutting-edge research, fostering innovation and inclusivity in the global scientific community. The paper also examines the role of such experiments in graduate education and professional development, highlighting their capacity to enhance hands-on learning and critical thinking skills. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate the successful integration of tabletop experiments in diverse research settings, underscoring their versatility and impact. Our findings advocate for the broader adoption of tabletop science as a viable strategy to overcome resource limitations, thereby accelerating scientific progress and nurturing the next generation of researchers in LMICs and beyond."}
