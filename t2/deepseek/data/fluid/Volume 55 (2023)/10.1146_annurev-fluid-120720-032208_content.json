{"Abstract": "This study explores the fluid dynamics of polar vortices on Earth, Mars, and Titan, employing a comparative planetology approach to understand the atmospheric circulation patterns unique to each celestial body. By analyzing vortex dynamics and the role of potential vorticity, we investigate how Rossby waves influence the stability and structure of these vortices. Our research leverages observational data and numerical simulations to compare the atmospheric behaviors, focusing on the interplay between planetary rotation rates, atmospheric composition, and thermal gradients. The findings reveal significant differences in vortex persistence and morphology, attributed to the varying environmental conditions and planetary characteristics. This work contributes to the broader understanding of atmospheric dynamics in planetary atmospheres, offering insights into the mechanisms driving polar vortex formation and evolution across different planetary contexts."}
