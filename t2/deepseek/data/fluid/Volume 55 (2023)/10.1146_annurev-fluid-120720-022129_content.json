{"Abstract": "Immersed Boundary Methods (IBMs) have emerged as a pivotal computational framework for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems, offering a versatile approach to modeling fluid-structure interactions without the need for body-conforming grids. This paper provides a comprehensive historical perspective on the evolution of IBMs, tracing their origins from the pioneering work of Peskin in the 1970s to the sophisticated, high-fidelity simulations enabled by modern computational resources. We explore the fundamental principles underlying IBMs, including the treatment of immersed boundaries, the incorporation of wall models, and the challenges associated with accurately capturing the physics of complex flows. Furthermore, we discuss recent advancements in IBM techniques, such as adaptive mesh refinement, parallel computing, and the integration with machine learning algorithms, which have significantly enhanced their efficiency and applicability. The paper concludes with a forward-looking discussion on the potential of IBMs to address emerging challenges in computational fluid dynamics, including the simulation of multiphase flows, turbulent flows, and bio-inspired systems. By highlighting both the historical milestones and future directions, this work aims to inspire further innovation and application of IBMs in tackling complex, real-world problems."}
