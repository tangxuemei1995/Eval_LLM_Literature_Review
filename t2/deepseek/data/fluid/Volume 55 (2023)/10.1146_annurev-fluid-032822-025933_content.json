{"Abstract": "Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) represents a complex flow regime that emerges in viscoelastic fluids, characterized by the interplay between elastic and inertial forces. This phenomenon, distinct from classical Newtonian turbulence, is marked by the formation of coherent structures and elastic instabilities, which significantly alter the flow dynamics and energy transfer mechanisms. The study of EIT is crucial for understanding polymer drag reduction, a process with wide-ranging applications in fluid transport and energy efficiency. Recent advancements in numerical simulation and viscoelastic models have provided deeper insights into the transitional flows leading to EIT, shedding light on the mechanisms driving elastic turbulence. This research explores the fundamental aspects of EIT, including the conditions under which it arises, its impact on flow behavior, and the potential for controlling or mitigating its effects. By integrating theoretical analysis with computational approaches, this study aims to contribute to the broader understanding of non-Newtonian fluid dynamics and the optimization of industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids."}
