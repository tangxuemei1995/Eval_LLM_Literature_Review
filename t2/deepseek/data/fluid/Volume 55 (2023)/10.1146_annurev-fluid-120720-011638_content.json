{"Abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system, facilitating nutrient transport, waste removal, and mechanical protection. This study delves into the intricate dynamics of CSF flow, employing principles of biological fluid mechanics to unravel its complex behavior. By examining the viscous flow characteristics within the confined spaces of the brain and spinal cord, we aim to enhance our understanding of the glymphatic system's functionalityâ€”a recently discovered waste clearance pathway. Our analysis integrates computational fluid dynamics with empirical data to model CSF movement, shedding light on the interplay between fluid viscosity, flow rate, and the structural anatomy of the central nervous system. The findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of CSF dynamics, offering insights into its implications for neurological health and disease, and paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the glymphatic system."}
