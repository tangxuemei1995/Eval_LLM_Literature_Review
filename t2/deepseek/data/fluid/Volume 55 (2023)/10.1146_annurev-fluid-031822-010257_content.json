{"Abstract": "Deep-sea mining operations have the potential to significantly impact marine ecosystems through the generation of sediment plumes and the alteration of natural sediment transport processes. This study investigates the fluid mechanics underlying these phenomena, focusing on the dynamics of turbidity currents, particle settling, and flocculation in the deep-sea environment. Utilizing a combination of physical oceanography principles and advanced numerical modeling, we analyze the behavior of sediment plumes generated by mining activities and their interaction with the surrounding water column. Special attention is given to the role of flocculation in enhancing particle settling rates and the implications for plume dispersion and sediment deposition. Our findings provide critical insights into the environmental consequences of deep-sea mining and offer a scientific basis for the development of more sustainable mining practices that minimize ecological disruption."}
