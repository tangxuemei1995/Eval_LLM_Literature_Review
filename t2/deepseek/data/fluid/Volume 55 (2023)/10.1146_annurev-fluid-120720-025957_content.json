{"Abstract": "The transition to turbulence in pipe flow represents a fundamental problem in fluid dynamics, characterized by the emergence of complex flow structures from initially laminar conditions. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying this transition, focusing on the roles of shear flow, transient growth, and the formation of turbulent puffs and slugs. Through a combination of experimental observations and numerical simulations, we explore the intermittency and transient chaos that precede the onset of fully developed turbulence. Our findings suggest that the transition process can be described within the framework of directed percolation, providing new insights into the universal aspects of turbulence onset. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of pipe flow and the broader implications for controlling turbulence in engineering applications."}
