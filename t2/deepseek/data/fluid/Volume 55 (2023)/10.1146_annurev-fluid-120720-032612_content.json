{"Abstract": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) represent a promising advancement in pressure gain combustion technology, offering potential improvements in thermodynamic efficiency over conventional deflagration-based systems. However, the practical implementation of RDEs is hindered by several nonidealities that affect their performance and stability. This study investigates the complex dynamics within RDEs, focusing on the formation and interaction of detonation waves, unsteady mixing processes, and the occurrence of secondary combustion. Particular attention is given to the detrimental effects of deflagration losses, which can significantly reduce the pressure gain achieved by the engine. Additionally, the presence of multiple competing waves and secondary waves is analyzed, revealing their impact on the uniformity and sustainability of the detonation process. Through a combination of experimental observations and computational modeling, this research aims to identify strategies for mitigating these nonidealities, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency and reliability of RDEs. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of detonation-based propulsion systems and provide valuable insights for the development of next-generation combustion technologies."}
