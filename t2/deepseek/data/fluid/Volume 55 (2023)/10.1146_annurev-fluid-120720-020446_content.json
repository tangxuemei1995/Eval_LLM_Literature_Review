{"Abstract": "This study delves into the complex dynamics of turbulent rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection, a fundamental process in geophysical and astrophysical flows, where buoyancy-driven turbulence is significantly influenced by rotation. By integrating theoretical analysis, precise measurements, and direct numerical simulations, we explore the intricate interplay between buoyancy and rotational forces on heat transport mechanisms. Our findings reveal that rotation introduces a Coriolis force that modifies the convective structures, leading to the formation of columnar vortices and altering the heat transfer efficiency. The research highlights the critical role of the Rossby and Rayleigh numbers in determining the transition between different flow regimes, from weakly rotating to strongly rotating turbulence. Furthermore, we present novel insights into the scaling laws governing heat transport in rotating convection, challenging existing theories and providing a refined understanding of the underlying physics. This work not only advances our theoretical knowledge of rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection but also has implications for improving models of planetary atmospheres, oceans, and stellar interiors."}
