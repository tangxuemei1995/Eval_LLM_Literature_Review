{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of free surface flows, particularly focusing on phenomena involving singularities such as breakup and coalescence, which are pivotal in applications ranging from ink jet printing to microfluidics and sprays. Utilizing sharp interface methods, we present a comprehensive framework for the simulation and analysis of drops, jets, and filaments undergoing these complex processes. Our approach leverages finite element techniques to accurately capture the evolution of interfaces, including the critical moments of pinch-off and merging. Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in handling the mathematical and computational challenges posed by singularities in free surface flows. The insights gained from this research not only advance our understanding of the fundamental physics underlying these phenomena but also offer practical implications for the design and optimization of devices and processes in various industrial and technological domains."}
