{"Abstract": "This study delves into the evolution of fluid mechanics in France during the first half of the twentieth century, a period marked by significant advancements and contributions to the field. The research highlights the pivotal role of French scientists and engineers in shaping the theoretical and practical aspects of fluid mechanics, particularly in the context of aeronautics. Through a comprehensive analysis of historical documents, scientific publications, and archival materials, the paper explores the key figures, institutions, and technological innovations that propelled France to the forefront of fluid mechanics research. The interplay between theoretical developments and practical applications is examined, shedding light on how French contributions influenced global advancements in aeronautics and beyond. The study also considers the socio-political and economic factors that facilitated the growth of fluid mechanics in France, offering insights into the broader historical context of scientific progress during this era. By charting the trajectory of fluid mechanics in France, this research underscores the enduring legacy of French scholarship and its impact on the modern understanding of fluid dynamics."}
