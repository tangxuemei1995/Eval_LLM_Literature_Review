{"Abstract": "This study explores the evaporation dynamics of sessile droplets, focusing on the development and application of mathematical models to understand diffusion-limited evaporation processes. It examines various evaporation modes, their impact on droplet lifetimes, and the resulting deposition patterns. Special attention is given to the interactions and collective behavior in systems of multiple droplets, providing insights into the complex interplay between evaporation rates, droplet geometry, and environmental conditions. The findings contribute to advancing the predictive modeling of droplet evaporation in diverse applications."}
