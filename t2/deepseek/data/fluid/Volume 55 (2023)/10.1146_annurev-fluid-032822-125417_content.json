{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of gas-liquid foams, bridging the gap between microscopic structural elements and macroscopic continuum descriptions. By integrating principles from interfacial mechanics, rheology, and fluid mechanics, we explore the complex behaviors of thin films and interfaces that define foam stability and rheological properties. The research focuses on the interplay between the discrete elements of foam, such as bubbles and thin liquid films, and their collective behavior as a soft matter system. Through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental validation, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework that captures the transition from individual bubble interactions to the bulk mechanical response of foams. This work not only advances our fundamental understanding of foam dynamics but also offers insights into the design and control of foam-based materials in various industrial applications."}
