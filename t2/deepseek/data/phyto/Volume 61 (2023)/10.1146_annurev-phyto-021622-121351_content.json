{"Abstract": "Kitaviruses represent a unique group of atypical plant viruses that have garnered attention due to their distinctive biological and molecular characteristics. This study delves into the enigmatic world of Kitaviruses, focusing on the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, which are primarily associated with nonsystemic diseases in plants, notably citrus leprosis. These viruses are transmitted by Brevipalpus mites, adding a layer of complexity to their epidemiology and control. The research highlights the evolutionary relationship between Kitaviruses and the recently discovered Negeviruses, shedding light on their shared ancestry and divergent paths. Through comprehensive genomic analysis and field studies, this paper aims to unravel the mechanisms underlying the nonsystemic infection patterns of Kitaviruses, their interaction with host plants and vectors, and the implications for disease management. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of these atypical plant viruses and open new avenues for research into their biology, ecology, and potential control strategies."}
