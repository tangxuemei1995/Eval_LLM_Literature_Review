{"Abstract": "In the face of global agricultural challenges, Integrated Nematode Management (INM) emerges as a pivotal strategy to safeguard root health and ensure sustainable crop production. This review delves into the multifaceted approach of INM, highlighting the integration of advanced technologies such as genome editing and genetics, alongside traditional practices, to combat nematode infestations effectively. The role of the microbiome in enhancing plant resilience and the potential of remote sensing for early detection of nematode threats are explored. Furthermore, the paper examines the constraints and policy frameworks that shape the adoption of INM practices globally. By synthesizing current research and technological advancements, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the processes and technologies that will drive the future of nematode management, ensuring food security in a world in transition."}
