{"Abstract": "The Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV), a member of the Tobamovirus genus, has emerged as a significant threat to global tomato and pepper production. This highly contagious pathogen is transmitted through seeds, mechanical contact, and contaminated tools, leading to severe economic losses. The virus causes distinctive symptoms, including leaf mottling, fruit discoloration, and deformation, drastically reducing marketability. Despite the implementation of strict hygiene protocols, such as seed disinfection and sanitation measures, ToBRFV continues to spread, highlighting the need for more effective control strategies. Recent research has focused on identifying and developing resistant tomato and pepper varieties through traditional breeding and biotechnological approaches. However, the rapid evolution of the virus poses challenges to the durability of resistance. This review underscores the importance of integrated management practices, combining seed hygiene, cultural controls, and genetic resistance, to mitigate the impact of the ToBRFV pandemic and safeguard the future of tomato and pepper cultivation."}
