{"Abstract": "Microbiomes, complex communities of microorganisms, play pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning and host health. Traditional approaches to studying these communities often focus on taxonomic composition, overlooking the intricate interactions that define their organization and function. This study leverages network analyses to explore the coassociation and co-occurrence patterns within plant and soil microbiomes, revealing the underlying structure that governs microbial interactions. By identifying modules—groups of densely interconnected taxa—we uncover the functional significance of these networks, demonstrating how they contribute to the resilience and adaptability of microbiomes. Our findings underscore the importance of considering network structure in microbial ecology, offering new insights into the mechanisms driving microbiome assembly and function. This research paves the way for targeted interventions aimed at harnessing the power of microbiomes for sustainable agriculture and environmental management."}
