{"Abstract": "The phenomenon of induced resistance in fruits and vegetables represents a critical host physiological response that significantly limits the development of postharvest diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying induced resistance, focusing on the role of physiological factors such as ripening and maturation delay in enhancing the host's defense capabilities. Through an extensive analysis of recent studies, we explore how these physiological changes can be strategically manipulated to bolster the natural resistance of produce against pathogens. The discussion extends to the implications of induced resistance for postharvest management practices, highlighting its potential to reduce reliance on chemical fungicides and improve the sustainability of fruit and vegetable storage. By integrating findings from diverse research areas, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of induced resistance as a promising approach to mitigating postharvest losses, thereby contributing to food security and the reduction of agricultural waste."}
