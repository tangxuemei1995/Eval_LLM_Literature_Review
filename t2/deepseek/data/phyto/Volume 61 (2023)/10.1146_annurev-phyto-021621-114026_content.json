{"Abstract": "Plant-pathogenic bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to exploit host metabolites as signals to regulate virulence. This study delves into the intricate interplay between host-derived metabolic signals and bacterial virulence factors, focusing on the role of these signals in modulating the type III secretion system (T3SS) and effector proteins. We explore how inter-kingdom signaling facilitates the adaptation of pathogens to the host environment, enabling them to suppress plant immunity and promote infection. By integrating findings from recent studies, we highlight the significance of metabolic signaling in the co-evolutionary arms race between plants and pathogens. This review underscores the potential of targeting host-pathogen metabolic interactions for developing novel strategies to control plant diseases, offering insights into the complex regulatory networks that govern bacterial virulence and host immunity."}
