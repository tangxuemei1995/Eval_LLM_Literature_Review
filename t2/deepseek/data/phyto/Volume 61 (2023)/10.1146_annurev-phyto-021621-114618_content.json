{"Abstract": "The global trade of ornamental plants has significantly contributed to the spread of viral and bacterial diseases, posing substantial risks to local ecosystems and agricultural productivity. This study investigates the impact of international trade on the dissemination of pathogens affecting ornamental plants, with a focus on the regulatory frameworks designed to mitigate these risks. Through a comprehensive review of scientific literature and case studies, we analyze the pathways of disease transmission, the economic and ecological consequences of outbreaks, and the effectiveness of current quarantine and inspection protocols. Our findings highlight the critical need for enhanced international cooperation and the development of more robust biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction and spread of harmful pathogens. The study underscores the importance of balancing trade benefits with the protection of local plant health, offering recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders in the ornamental plant industry."}
