{"Abstract": "The study of phycopathology, focusing on algal diseases, has gained renewed interest due to its implications for algal aquaculture, ecology, and biosecurity. This research explores the intricate relationships between algal hosts and their pathogens, shedding light on the ecological dynamics and the potential threats to algal cultivation systems. By integrating algal biology with ecological and biosecurity perspectives, we aim to understand the mechanisms of disease spread and its impact on algal populations. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring and managing algal diseases to safeguard aquatic ecosystems and the burgeoning algal aquaculture industry, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches in addressing these challenges."}
