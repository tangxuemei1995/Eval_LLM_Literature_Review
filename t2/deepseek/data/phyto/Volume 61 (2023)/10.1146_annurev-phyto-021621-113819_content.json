{"Abstract": "The intricate dance between viruses and their plant hosts has shaped the evolutionary trajectories of both, particularly within geographic centers of plant diversity. This study delves into the coevolutionary dynamics of host–pathogen interactions, focusing on the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) as a case study within these biodiversity hotspots. By integrating insights from host–microbe interactions and the geological movements dictated by plate tectonics, we explore how the historical and ongoing coevolutionary pressures have influenced the development of host resistance mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that the centers of crop diversity not only serve as reservoirs of genetic variation but also as arenas for intense evolutionary arms races between plants and pathogens. The findings underscore the importance of understanding these coevolutionary processes for the conservation of plant genetic resources and the development of sustainable agricultural practices. This research contributes to the broader discourse on the role of coevolution in shaping the resilience of ecosystems to emerging viral threats, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to tackle the challenges posed by plant viruses in a changing world."}
