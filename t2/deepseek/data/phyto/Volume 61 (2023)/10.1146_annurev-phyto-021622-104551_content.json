{"Abstract": "Ralstonia solanacearum, a devastating plant pathogen, is the causative agent of bacterial wilt disease, affecting a wide range of host plants across diverse environments. This pathogen employs an extensive arsenal of virulence strategies, including type III secretion systems, extracellular polysaccharides, and cell wall-degrading enzymes, to colonize and disrupt host plant vascular systems. The evolution of R. solanacearum has been shaped by its interaction with host plants and environmental factors, leading to a complex pathogen-host-environment interplay. Recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of its pathogenicity and the role of plant-associated microbiota in disease suppression have opened new avenues for biological control strategies. This review highlights the multifaceted virulence mechanisms of R. solanacearum, its evolutionary dynamics, and the potential for leveraging plant microbiota and genetic resistance to mitigate the impact of bacterial wilt disease."}
