{"Abstract": "The escalating demand for sustainable agricultural practices has spurred interest in the development of novel biopesticides, with functional peptides emerging as a promising avenue for plant disease control. This review delves into the mechanisms of action by which functional peptides combat plant pathogens, highlighting their ability to disrupt microbial cell membranes, interfere with essential cellular processes, and modulate plant immune responses. Sourced from natural reservoirs such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, these peptides offer an eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides, reducing the risk of resistance development and environmental contamination. The production of functional peptides, through both natural extraction and synthetic biology approaches, is explored, underscoring the advancements in peptide synthesis and modification techniques that enhance their stability, efficacy, and specificity. The potential of functional peptides as novel biopesticides is further discussed, with emphasis on their application in integrated pest management strategies to safeguard crop health and productivity. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of functional peptides in the quest for sustainable and effective plant disease control solutions, paving the way for their broader adoption in agriculture."}
