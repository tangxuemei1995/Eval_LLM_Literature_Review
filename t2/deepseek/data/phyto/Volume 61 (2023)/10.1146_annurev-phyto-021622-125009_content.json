{"Abstract": "Agrobacterium species are renowned for their unique ability to transfer DNA to plant cells, a process central to their role as phytopathogens and to the development of plant biotechnology. This study delves into the virulence mechanisms and ecological dynamics of Agrobacterium, framed within the broader context of evolutionary genomics. By integrating genomic data from diverse Agrobacterium strains, we explore the evolutionary trajectories that have shaped their pathogenic strategies, particularly focusing on the role of plasmids in virulence and horizontal gene transfer. Our analysis reveals how genomic plasticity and environmental interactions drive the adaptation of Agrobacterium to various hosts and ecological niches. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these evolutionary processes for the management of Agrobacterium-related diseases and the optimization of Agrobacterium-mediated genetic engineering. This research underscores the importance of evolutionary genomics in understanding the complex interplay between Agrobacterium virulence, ecology, and host interactions."}
