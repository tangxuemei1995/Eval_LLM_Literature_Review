{"Abstract": "The escalating global forest health crisis represents a quintessential public-good social dilemma, necessitating urgent international collective action. This crisis, exacerbated by biological invasions, climate change, and global change, poses significant threats to biodiversity conservation and natural resource sustainability. Biological invasions, in particular, have emerged as a leading cause of forest degradation, disrupting ecosystems and diminishing their capacity to provide essential services. The complexity of these challenges underscores the inadequacy of isolated national efforts and highlights the imperative for a coordinated global response. This paper explores the multifaceted dimensions of the forest health crisis, emphasizing the role of natural resource policy in fostering international cooperation. It argues for the development of integrated strategies that address the root causes of forest degradation, including invasive species management, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation. By framing the crisis as a global public good issue, the paper advocates for collective action mechanisms that transcend national boundaries, ensuring the preservation of forest ecosystems for future generations."}
