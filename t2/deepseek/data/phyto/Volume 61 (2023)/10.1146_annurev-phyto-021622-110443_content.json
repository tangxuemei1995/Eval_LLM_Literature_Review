{"Abstract": "The ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system (UPS) plays a pivotal role in maintaining proteostasis and regulating numerous cellular processes in plants, including immune responses. Pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate the UPS to their advantage, often through the secretion of effector proteins that interfere with ubiquitination processes or proteasomal degradation. This review explores the intricate interplay between the plant UPS and microbial pathogens, highlighting how pathogens exploit the UPS to suppress plant immunity and promote infection. We discuss the mechanisms by which microbial effectors target the UPS, including the modulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes, and the implications for plant-pathogen interactions. Understanding these microbial manipulation strategies offers insights into the development of novel disease resistance mechanisms in plants, potentially leading to the engineering of crops with enhanced immunity against a broad spectrum of pathogens."}
