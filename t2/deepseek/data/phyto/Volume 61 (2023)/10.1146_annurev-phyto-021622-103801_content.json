{"Abstract": "Phytophthora capsici, a devastating oomycete pathogen, has been a significant threat to vegetable production worldwide since its description a century ago. This review highlights recent advancements in understanding the fundamental biology of P. capsici, including its life cycle, genetic diversity, and mechanisms of infection. Additionally, it explores the challenges in disease management posed by the pathogen's ability to develop resistance to fungicides and adapt to various environmental conditions. The integration of traditional and modern approaches, such as genetic resistance breeding, biological control, and precision agriculture, is discussed as a strategy to mitigate the impact of P. capsici on vegetable crops. This synthesis of current knowledge aims to provide a foundation for future research and the development of sustainable management practices to combat this persistent plant pathogen."}
