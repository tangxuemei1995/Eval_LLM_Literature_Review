{"Abstract": "Pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to subvert plant immune responses, with a particular focus on manipulating host membrane trafficking pathways. This review explores the mechanisms by which microbial effectors interfere with plant endomembrane trafficking, autophagy, and protein secretion to promote infection. Special attention is given to the role of the haustorium, a specialized infection structure, in redirecting host resources. By hijacking these critical cellular processes, pathogens effectively suppress plant immunity and establish a conducive environment for their proliferation. Understanding these interactions not only sheds light on the complex interplay between plants and pathogens but also opens new avenues for developing targeted strategies to enhance plant resistance against infectious diseases."}
