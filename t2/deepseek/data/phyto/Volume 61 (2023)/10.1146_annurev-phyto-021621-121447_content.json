{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between crops and their associated microbiota plays a pivotal role in plant health, productivity, and resilience to environmental stresses. This study explores the potential of leveraging host genetics to engineer the crop microbiota, focusing on the domestication process, root architecture, and the rhizosphere environment. By analyzing the genetic basis of plant-microbe interactions, we aim to identify key genetic loci that influence microbial community composition and function. Our research highlights the importance of integrating traditional plant breeding techniques with modern genomic tools to select for beneficial microbial traits. We propose that targeted manipulation of the crop microbiota through host genetics can enhance nutrient uptake, disease resistance, and stress tolerance, thereby contributing to sustainable agricultural practices. This approach not only opens new avenues for crop improvement but also underscores the significance of the plant microbiome in the context of global food security. Our findings suggest that a deeper understanding of the genetic factors shaping the crop microbiota is essential for the development of next-generation crops with optimized microbial partnerships."}
