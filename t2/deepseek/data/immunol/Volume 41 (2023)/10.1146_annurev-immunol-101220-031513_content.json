{"Abstract": "Systems immunology integrates computational biology with high-throughput technologies to unravel the complex interplay between the immune system and metabolism. This interdisciplinary approach leverages transcriptomics and metabolomics to provide a comprehensive understanding of immunometabolism, the study of how metabolic processes influence immune cell function and vice versa. By employing advanced metabolic imaging techniques, researchers can visualize and quantify metabolic activities in immune cells within their native tissue environments. This review highlights the pivotal role of systems immunology in identifying metabolic pathways that are crucial for immune responses, offering insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for metabolic and immune-related disorders. The convergence of computational models with experimental data paves the way for a deeper understanding of the metabolic regulation of immunity, emphasizing the potential of systems immunology to transform our approach to disease prevention and treatment."}
