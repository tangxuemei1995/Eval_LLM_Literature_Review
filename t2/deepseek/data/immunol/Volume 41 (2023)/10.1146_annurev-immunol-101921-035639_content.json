{"Abstract": "The complement system, traditionally recognized for its role in immune defense, has emerged as a critical player in brain physiology and pathology. This review explores the multifaceted contributions of complement components, particularly C1q, to neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. We delve into the mechanisms by which complement influences synaptic pruning, a process essential for the refinement of neural circuits during development and in response to injury. The involvement of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, in complement-mediated synaptic remodeling is highlighted, alongside the implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. By synthesizing recent findings, this abstract underscores the dual role of the complement system in maintaining brain homeostasis and contributing to disease progression, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions."}
