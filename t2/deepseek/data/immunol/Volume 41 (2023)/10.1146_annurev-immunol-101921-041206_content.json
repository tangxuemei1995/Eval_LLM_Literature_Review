{"Abstract": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-13 (IL-13) are pivotal cytokines in the orchestration of type 2 immunity, playing critical roles in the regulation of inflammation and the promotion of wound repair. These cytokines are instrumental in modulating the immune response to tissue injury and helminth infections, facilitating the activation of macrophages and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Through their actions, IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to the resolution of inflammation and the restoration of tissue integrity. This review delves into the mechanisms by which IL-4 and IL-13 influence wound healing processes, highlighting their dual roles as regulators and effectors. By examining the interplay between these cytokines and the ECM, as well as their impact on immune cell behavior, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of their contributions to tissue repair and the potential therapeutic implications for enhancing wound healing in clinical settings."}
