{"Abstract": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases through its interaction with high-affinity (FcεRI) and low-affinity (CD23) receptors. This review delves into the structural intricacies of IgE and its receptors, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning their interactions. The unique architecture of IgE, characterized by its flexibility and allosteric properties, facilitates its binding to FcεRI on mast cells and basophils, triggering the allergic cascade. Similarly, the interaction between IgE and CD23 influences IgE homeostasis and antigen presentation. Recent advancements in structural biology have elucidated the conformational changes in IgE and its receptors upon binding, offering insights into the design of anti-IgE biologics. These therapeutic agents, by targeting specific epitopes on IgE or its receptors, aim to disrupt the allergic response without compromising the immune system's integrity. This abstract underscores the importance of understanding the structural and mechanistic aspects of IgE and its receptors in developing novel anti-allergic therapies."}
