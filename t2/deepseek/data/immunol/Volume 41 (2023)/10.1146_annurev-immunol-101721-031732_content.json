{"Abstract": "Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) represents a critical layer of plant innate immunity, activated upon recognition of pathogen virulence factors, known as effectors, by plant resistance proteins. This sophisticated defense mechanism is a cornerstone of the plant immune system, providing a robust response to pathogen invasion. ETI is often contrasted with Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI), which is initiated by the recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). However, ETI is distinguished by its specificity and the intensity of the immune response, often leading to programmed cell death at the infection site to prevent pathogen spread. The concept of guard immunity further elucidates the molecular basis of ETI, where plant resistance proteins 'guard' host proteins targeted by pathogen effectors, triggering a defense response upon effector detection. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying ETI, its role in plant-pathogen interactions, and its implications for developing disease-resistant crops, highlighting the intricate balance between pathogen virulence strategies and plant defense mechanisms."}
