{"Abstract": "The study of immunology has long relied on mouse models to understand human diseases, particularly infectious diseases and immunodeficiency. However, the translation of findings from mouse to human immunology has been fraught with challenges, primarily due to genetic differences between the species. This research aims to bridge the gap by leveraging advances in human and mouse genetics to reconcile these differences. By focusing on genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases and inborn errors of immunity, we explore how genetic variations influence immune responses across species. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of genetic data from both humans and mice, identifying conserved pathways and species-specific adaptations. This study not only enhances our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of immune responses but also provides a framework for improving the translational relevance of mouse models in human immunology. Through this genetic lens, we aim to refine our strategies for combating infectious diseases and immunodeficiency, paving the way for more effective treatments and therapies."}
