{"Abstract": "The human uterine mucosa harbors a unique population of natural killer (NK) cells, known as uterine NK (uNK) cells, which play a pivotal role in reproduction. These cells are distinct from their peripheral counterparts in phenotype, function, and regulation. uNK cells are most abundant during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy, where they interact closely with the invading trophoblast cells. This interaction is crucial for the remodeling of spiral arteries, a process essential for adequate placental perfusion and successful pregnancy outcomes. uNK cells are characterized by their ability to produce a wide array of cytokines and angiogenic factors, which facilitate trophoblast invasion and vascular transformation. Despite their cytotoxic potential, uNK cells exhibit a tolerant phenotype towards the semi-allogeneic fetus, highlighting their specialized role in immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface. This review summarizes current knowledge on the biology of uNK cells, their interaction with trophoblasts, and their contribution to decidualization and pregnancy maintenance, providing insights into their potential implications in reproductive health and disease."}
