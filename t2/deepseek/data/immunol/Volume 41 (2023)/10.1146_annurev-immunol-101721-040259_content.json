{"Abstract": "The integration of biomaterials into immunotherapeutic strategies has revolutionized the field of immune system engineering, offering unprecedented control over immune responses. This review explores the pivotal role of biomaterials in enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies and vaccine adjuvants, with a particular focus on nanoparticle-based systems. Biomaterials, by virtue of their tunable physicochemical properties, enable precise delivery of immunomodulatory agents to target cells, thereby optimizing immune activation or suppression as required. Furthermore, the use of nanoparticles as vaccine adjuvants has shown remarkable potential in eliciting robust and durable immune responses, attributed to their ability to mimic pathogen-associated molecular patterns and enhance antigen presentation. This abstract highlights the latest advancements in biomaterials-mediated immune engineering, underscoring their transformative impact on the development of next-generation immunotherapies and vaccines. The convergence of biomaterials science and immunology holds great promise for addressing complex challenges in disease prevention and treatment, paving the way for innovative therapeutic modalities."}
