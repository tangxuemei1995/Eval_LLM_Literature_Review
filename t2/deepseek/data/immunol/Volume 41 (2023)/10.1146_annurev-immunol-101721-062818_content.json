{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between the immune system and epithelial tissues plays a pivotal role in the processes of regeneration and repair, particularly in the context of inflammatory diseases. This review delves into the mechanisms of immune-epithelial cross talk, highlighting how immune cells and epithelial stem cells collaborate to restore tissue integrity and function following injury. We explore the signaling pathways and molecular mediators that facilitate this cross talk, emphasizing their significance in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and promoting tissue repair. Furthermore, we discuss the dysregulation of these interactions in chronic inflammatory diseases, which can lead to impaired regeneration and pathological tissue remodeling. By understanding the complex dialogue between immunity and epithelium, we can uncover novel therapeutic targets to enhance tissue repair and mitigate the effects of inflammatory diseases, offering new avenues for regenerative medicine and the treatment of epithelial disorders."}
