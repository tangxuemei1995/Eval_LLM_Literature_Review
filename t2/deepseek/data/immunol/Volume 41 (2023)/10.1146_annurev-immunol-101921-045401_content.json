{"Abstract": "This study explores the pivotal role of RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), in regulating the immune system's response to viral infections and tumor development. By analyzing the epitranscriptome, we uncover how m6A modifications influence antiviral and antitumor immunity, highlighting their impact on the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that manipulating RNA modifications could offer novel therapeutic strategies for enhancing immune responses against viruses and cancer, providing a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immune regulation and offering potential targets for immunotherapy."}
