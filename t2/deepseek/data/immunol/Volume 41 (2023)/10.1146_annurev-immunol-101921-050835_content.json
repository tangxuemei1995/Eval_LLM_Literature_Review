{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has underscored the critical role of the immune system in determining disease severity. This study delves into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host immune response, focusing on the interference with type I interferons (IFNs), pivotal antiviral cytokines. We explore the genetic predisposition in humans that may lead to a deficient IFN response, thereby exacerbating the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, the presence of anticytokine autoantibodies, particularly those targeting type I IFNs, is investigated as a potential factor contributing to critical illness. Through a comprehensive review of human genetics and immunological studies, this research highlights the importance of the IFN pathway in the host defense against SARS-CoV-2 and identifies potential therapeutic targets to mitigate the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings underscore the necessity of personalized medicine approaches in the treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes."}
