{"Abstract": "Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of T cell biology. This study delves into the multifaceted effects of TGF-β on various T cell subsets, including CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), and γδ T cells. We explore the dual role of TGF-β in promoting T cell quiescence and activation, highlighting its context-dependent functions in immune responses. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which TGF-β influences T cell differentiation, function, and homeostasis. This research underscores the importance of TGF-β signaling in maintaining immune tolerance and its implications in autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases. Understanding the complex regulatory networks governed by TGF-β in T cells could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting immune dysregulation."}
