{"Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in oncology, leveraging the body's immune system to combat malignancies. This study focuses on the design of immunotherapies that simultaneously engage T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, two pivotal components of the immune response against cancer. T cells, with their antigen-specific cytotoxicity, and NK cells, known for their innate ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells without prior sensitization, offer complementary mechanisms of action. By integrating strategies that enhance the activation, proliferation, and tumor infiltration of both cell types, we aim to develop more effective and durable cancer treatments. Our approach includes the use of bispecific antibodies, cytokine therapies, and engineered immune cells to create a synergistic immune response. Preliminary findings suggest that such dual-targeting immunotherapies can significantly improve tumor control and patient outcomes, highlighting the potential of harnessing the combined power of T cells and NK cells in cancer immunotherapy."}
