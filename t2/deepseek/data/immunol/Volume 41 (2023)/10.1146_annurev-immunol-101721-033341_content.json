{"Abstract": "Endogenous retroelements, including endogenous retroviruses, represent a significant portion of the human genome and have been implicated in both physiological processes and pathological conditions. These elements, remnants of ancient viral infections, pose a unique immunological conundrum: they are recognized as 'self' due to their integration into the host genome, yet they retain features that can trigger 'non-self' immune responses. This review explores the dual role of endogenous retroelements in modulating the immune system, focusing on their capacity to elicit interferon responses and influence adaptive immunity. We delve into the mechanisms by which these elements are regulated to prevent autoimmunity and how their dysregulation can contribute to disease. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting endogenous retroelements in autoimmune diseases and cancer, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in harnessing these ancient viral remnants for modern medicine."}
