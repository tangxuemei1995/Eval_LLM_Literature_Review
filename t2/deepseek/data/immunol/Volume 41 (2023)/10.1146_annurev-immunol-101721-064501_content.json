{"Abstract": "Aging is characterized by a progressive decline in immune function, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence, which significantly impacts health and longevity. This study explores the role of extremely differentiated T cell subsets in tissue deterioration during aging. With the thymus undergoing involution and the immune system's capacity to generate naive T cells diminishing, the body increasingly relies on memory T cells. However, these cells, particularly the highly differentiated subsets, exhibit signs of senescence and contribute to chronic inflammation, a hallmark of aging. Through a comprehensive analysis of lymphocyte populations in aged tissues, we identify specific T cell subsets that are disproportionately involved in promoting tissue deterioration. Our findings suggest that targeting these subsets could mitigate age-related tissue damage, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention to enhance healthspan in the elderly."}
