{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, leading to widespread inflammation and tissue damage. The pathogenesis of SLE involves a multifaceted interplay between genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Central to this process is the dysregulation of the interferon (IFN) pathway, particularly type I IFNs, which play a pivotal role in the activation of the immune system and the promotion of autoimmunity. Beyond the IFN signature, recent research has highlighted the importance of aberrant cell death mechanisms, including apoptosis and necroptosis, in the release of autoantigens and the initiation of autoimmune responses. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also emerged as a critical factor, contributing to the oxidative stress and metabolic disturbances observed in SLE patients. Furthermore, the extrafollicular pathway of B cell activation has been implicated in the rapid production of autoantibodies, bypassing the conventional germinal center response. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of SLE pathogenesis, with a focus on the role of IFN signaling, cell death pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extrafollicular B cell activation, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for this debilitating disease."}
