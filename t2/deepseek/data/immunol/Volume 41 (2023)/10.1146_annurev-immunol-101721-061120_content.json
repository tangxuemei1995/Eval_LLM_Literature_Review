{"Abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic, with T cell responses playing a crucial role in controlling COVID-19 infection and influencing disease severity. This study explores the dynamics of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the impact of viral variants, the efficacy of vaccination in eliciting T cell immunity, and the identification of immunodominant epitopes. We review recent findings on how T cell responses contribute to protection against severe disease and the potential for cross-reactivity with emerging variants. Additionally, we discuss the implications of T cell memory in long-term immunity and the challenges in designing vaccines that elicit robust T cell responses. Understanding the nuances of T cell immunity is essential for developing effective strategies to combat COVID-19 and mitigate the impact of future variants."}
