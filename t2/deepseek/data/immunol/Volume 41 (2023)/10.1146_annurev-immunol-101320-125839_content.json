{"Abstract": "Inflammatory anemia represents a complex interplay between immune mechanisms and erythropoiesis, often exacerbated by underlying conditions such as malaria, sickle cell anemia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This review delves into the pathophysiological roles of hemophagocytes and inflammatory cytokines in disrupting red blood cell (RBC) homeostasis, leading to anemia. In malaria, the immune response to Plasmodium infection can result in excessive hemophagocytosis, while in sickle cell anemia, chronic inflammation contributes to RBC destruction and impaired erythropoiesis. HLH, characterized by uncontrolled immune activation, further exemplifies the detrimental effects of inflammation on RBC survival. Understanding these immune mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies to mitigate inflammatory anemia. By exploring the intricate relationships between inflammation, hemophagocytes, and anemia, this study aims to shed light on potential therapeutic avenues for managing these challenging conditions."}
