{"Abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response by mediating the activation of caspase-1, leading to the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18, and pyroptosis. Despite its critical function, the structural mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes recent advances in the structural biology of the NLRP3 inflammasome, focusing on the roles of the adaptor protein ASC and the formation of ASC filaments in the assembly process. We discuss the structural insights into NLRP3 activation by diverse stimuli, including microbial components and endogenous danger signals, and the subsequent recruitment of ASC and caspase-1. Furthermore, we highlight the implications of these structural findings for understanding the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases. This comprehensive overview aims to bridge the gap between structural data and functional implications, providing a foundation for future research in this field."}
