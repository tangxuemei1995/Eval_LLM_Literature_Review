{"Abstract": "The origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, particularly those derived from granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP), have been subjects of intense research. This study focuses on the differentiation pathways of GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, employing fate-mapping techniques to trace their lineage commitment and functional specialization within various tissue niches. We explore the dynamic interplay between intrinsic cellular programs and extrinsic niche signals that drive the tissue-specific reprogramming of these myeloid cells. Our findings highlight the plasticity of GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, revealing their capacity to adapt to local tissue environments and contribute to both homeostatic and pathological processes. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying their heterogeneity and functional diversity, this research provides new insights into the regulation of myeloid cell fate and its implications for immune responses and disease progression."}
