{"Abstract": "The advent of mobile applications has significantly transformed the landscape of assistive technologies for individuals with vision impairments. This study explores the impact of mobile apps as assistive devices, focusing on their role in enhancing accessibility and facilitating vision rehabilitation. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of user feedback, we identify key features that contribute to the effectiveness of these apps, including voice navigation, object recognition, and text-to-speech functionalities. Our findings reveal that mobile apps not only improve the independence and quality of life for visually impaired persons but also present a cost-effective and scalable solution to traditional assistive devices. However, challenges such as user interface complexity and the need for continuous updates to accommodate evolving technology standards are noted. The study concludes with recommendations for developers and policymakers to prioritize user-centered design and ensure the inclusivity of mobile apps in the digital ecosystem. This research underscores the potential of mobile applications to bridge the accessibility gap for visually impaired individuals, advocating for their integration into broader vision rehabilitation strategies."}
