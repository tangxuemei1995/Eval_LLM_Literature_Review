{"Abstract": "The aging retina undergoes significant structural and functional changes, impacting visual perception and quality of life. This study delves into the molecular landscapes that define the aging process within the retinal tissue, focusing on the alterations in synaptic integrity and neuronal health. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and analysis of recent findings, we explore the mechanisms underlying synaptic degeneration and neuronal loss, which are hallmark features of retinal aging. Our investigation highlights the role of oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation in driving these pathological changes. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving retinal function and mitigating the effects of aging. By elucidating the complex interplay between molecular pathways and cellular components in the aging retina, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of age-related retinal diseases and paves the way for innovative interventions to enhance visual health in the elderly population."}
