{"Abstract": "This study delves into the perceptual science of augmented reality (AR), focusing on how display systems influence visual perception. By examining the interplay between AR technologies and human visual processing, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that underpin the effectiveness of AR in altering or enhancing perception. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we explore the factors that contribute to the seamless integration of virtual elements into the real world, including display resolution, field of view, and latency. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing these parameters to improve user experience and perceptual accuracy in AR applications. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AR, offering insights that could inform the design of future AR systems for various domains, including education, entertainment, and professional training."}
