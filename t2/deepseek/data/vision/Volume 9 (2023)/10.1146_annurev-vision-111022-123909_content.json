{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of the Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL), a critical adaptation mechanism in individuals experiencing central vision loss, particularly due to conditions like macular degeneration. The PRL refers to an area of the retina that patients subconsciously use to fixate on objects, compensating for the loss of central vision. Our research delves into the factors influencing the selection and stability of the PRL, including the role of binocular viewing in enhancing fixation stability. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of clinical data, we aim to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying PRL development and its implications for visual rehabilitation strategies."}
