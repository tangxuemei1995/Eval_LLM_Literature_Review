{"Abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as powerful computational models, achieving remarkable success in tasks such as object recognition, a core aspect of human visual perception. This study investigates the adequacy of DNNs as behavioral models of human visual perception, focusing on their performance in visual psychophysics tasks. By comparing the responses of DNNs to those of human observers across a range of stimuli and conditions, we aim to assess the extent to which these models can replicate human perceptual behavior. Our analysis leverages advancements in deep learning and computer vision, employing state-of-the-art neural network architectures to explore the alignment between artificial and biological vision systems. The findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the suitability of DNNs for modeling human visual perception, offering insights into their strengths and limitations as computational models in the field of visual psychophysics."}
