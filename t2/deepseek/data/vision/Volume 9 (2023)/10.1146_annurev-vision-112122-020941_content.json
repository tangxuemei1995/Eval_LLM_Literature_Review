{"Abstract": "The human visual system is a marvel of biological engineering, adept at both efficiently encoding vast amounts of sensory information and predicting future states of the environment. This study delves into the dual aspects of neural coding: efficiency and prediction, within the context of visual processing. By employing the information bottleneck principle, we explore how the brain balances the trade-off between compressing sensory data and retaining predictive information. Our findings suggest that efficient coding strategies are inherently linked to predictive coding mechanisms, revealing that these two processes are not mutually exclusive but rather two sides of the same coin. Through computational modeling and analysis of neural data, we demonstrate that the visual system optimizes for both efficiency and prediction, ensuring robust and adaptive responses to dynamic environments. This research sheds light on the fundamental principles underlying neural computation and offers insights into the design of artificial systems inspired by biological vision."}
