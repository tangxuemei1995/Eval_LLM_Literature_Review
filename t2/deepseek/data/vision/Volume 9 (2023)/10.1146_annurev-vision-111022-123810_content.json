{"Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent metabolic disorder that significantly impacts visual health, leading to a spectrum of retinal complications. This study explores the underlying mechanisms of visual dysfunction in diabetes, focusing on the physiological alterations in retinal neurons across human and rodent models, including mice and rats. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and experimental data, we investigate the pathological changes in the retina induced by hyperglycemia, such as neuronal apoptosis, vascular abnormalities, and impaired synaptic signaling. The research highlights the similarities and differences in diabetic retinopathy progression between species, providing insights into the translational potential of rodent models for understanding human disease. Our findings underscore the critical role of neuronal physiology in the onset and progression of diabetic visual impairment, offering a foundation for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to preserve vision in diabetic patients."}
