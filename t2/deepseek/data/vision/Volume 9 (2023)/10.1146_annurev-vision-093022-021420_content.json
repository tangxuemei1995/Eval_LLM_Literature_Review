{"Abstract": "Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a complex vascular disorder affecting preterm infants, characterized by abnormal retinal angiogenesis due to interrupted vascular development. This condition is primarily driven by oxygen-induced retinopathy, where fluctuating oxygen levels disrupt the delicate balance of growth factors and cell signaling pathways essential for normal vascularization. Key players include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), whose dysregulation leads to pathological neovascularization. Maternalâ€“fetal interactions also play a crucial role, influencing the intrauterine environment and subsequent susceptibility to ROP. Understanding the pathophysiology of ROP involves dissecting these intricate mechanisms to identify potential therapeutic targets. This review highlights the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular underpinnings of ROP, emphasizing the importance of angiogenesis, growth factors, and cell signaling in its development and progression."}
