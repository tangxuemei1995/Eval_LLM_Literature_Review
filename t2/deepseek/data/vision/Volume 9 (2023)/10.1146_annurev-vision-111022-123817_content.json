{"Abstract": "The primate superior colliculus (SC) plays a pivotal role in the integration of visual information and the generation of orienting behaviors, including eye movements. This subcortical structure is essential for the transformation of sensory inputs into motor outputs, facilitating the rapid localization of and response to visual stimuli in the environment. Recent studies have highlighted the SC's involvement in active vision, where it contributes to the dynamic interplay between sensory processing and motor action, enabling primates to navigate complex visual scenes effectively. The SC's layered organization allows for the segregation of visual, multisensory, and motor-related functions, with the superficial layers primarily processing visual information and the deeper layers involved in the initiation of orienting movements. This review synthesizes current understanding of the SC's visual functions, emphasizing its role in eye movement control, spatial attention, and the coordination of active vision, thereby underscoring its significance in the primate visual system."}
