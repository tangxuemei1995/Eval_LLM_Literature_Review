{"Abstract": "This study investigates the cerebral cortex's involvement in visual search within natural scenes, utilizing rhesus monkeys as a model organism. By analyzing saccadic eye movements and neural activity in the visual cortex and frontal eye field, we aim to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the efficient processing of complex visual environments. Our findings suggest that natural scenes engage a distributed network of cortical areas, highlighting the importance of integrating sensory information with top-down attentional control. This research advances our understanding of the cerebral cortex's role in visual search, offering insights into the neural basis of visual perception and attention in dynamic, real-world contexts."}
