{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between perception and memory is a cornerstone of cognitive neuroscience, with the ventral visual stream (VVS) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) playing pivotal roles. This study delves into the mechanisms by which these brain regions interact to facilitate the encoding, storage, and retrieval of visual information. The VVS, known for its role in object recognition, processes visual stimuli in a hierarchical manner, culminating in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) of the MTL, which is crucial for the integration of perceptual and mnemonic information. We explore how the PRC acts as a nexus between perception and memory, enabling the discrimination of novel from familiar stimuli and supporting the formation of complex, multimodal memories. Through a synthesis of neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and lesion studies, this research highlights the dynamic interplay between the VVS and MTL, offering insights into the neural substrates of memory and perception and their implications for understanding cognitive disorders."}
