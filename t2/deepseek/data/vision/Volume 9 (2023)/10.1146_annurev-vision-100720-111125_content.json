{"Abstract": "Eye morphogenesis in vertebrates is a complex and highly regulated process that involves the coordinated development of multiple structures, including the optic cup, retina, lens, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This process begins with the formation of the optic vesicle, which invaginates to form the optic cup, a structure that gives rise to the neural retina and the RPE. The lens, derived from the surface ectoderm, plays a crucial role in focusing light onto the retina. The RPE, located between the neural retina and the choroid, is essential for photoreceptor function and maintenance. This review highlights the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development of these structures, emphasizing the importance of signaling pathways, transcription factors, and cell-cell interactions in ensuring proper eye formation. Understanding these processes provides insights into congenital eye disorders and potential therapeutic strategies."}
