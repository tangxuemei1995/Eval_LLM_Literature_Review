{"Abstract": "Emerging viral infections pose significant challenges to global health, with the eye being a critical site for both viral entry and manifestation of disease. This review focuses on the ophthalmic manifestations of emerging viral infections, including COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease, highlighting the mechanisms of viral persistence and the spectrum of ocular involvement. Recent studies have identified uveitis as a notable complication, underscoring the need for heightened awareness and understanding of these pathogens' impact on ocular health. By synthesizing current literature, this paper aims to provide insights into the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management strategies for viral infections affecting the eye, contributing to the broader discourse on emerging infectious diseases."}
