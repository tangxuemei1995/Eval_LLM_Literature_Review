{"Abstract": "Nonvisual opsins, a class of photosensitive proteins, have emerged as pivotal players in the realm of extraocular light sensing, extending their influence beyond traditional visual pathways to modulate physiological processes. This review delves into the expanding role of nonvisual opsins in detecting environmental light cues, thereby orchestrating a myriad of biological functions including the regulation of the circadian clock and metabolic homeostasis. Recent advancements have illuminated the presence of these opsins in various non-retinal tissues, suggesting a complex network of light-responsive mechanisms that contribute to systemic physiological adaptations. By integrating findings from molecular, cellular, and organismal studies, we highlight the significance of nonvisual opsins in mediating light's effects on behavior, physiology, and health. This synthesis underscores the necessity for further exploration into the mechanisms by which nonvisual opsins translate light signals into biological responses, offering novel insights into their therapeutic potential for circadian and metabolic disorders."}
