{"Abstract": "Understanding and predicting visual fixations is a cornerstone in the study of human visual attention and eye movements. This research delves into the mechanisms underlying fixations, employing a multifaceted approach that integrates saliency models, information theory, and model comparison techniques. We propose a unifying framework that not only benchmarks existing models against a comprehensive taxonomy of fixation prediction but also explores the potential of transfer learning to enhance model generalizability across diverse visual contexts. Our methodology involves a rigorous evaluation of model performance, leveraging a rich dataset of eye-tracking data to assess the predictive accuracy of various saliency models. Through this analysis, we aim to identify the key factors that contribute to effective fixation prediction, offering insights into the interplay between visual saliency, cognitive processes, and eye movement dynamics. The findings of this study are expected to advance our understanding of visual attention, providing a robust foundation for future research in cognitive science, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. This work also sets a new standard for model comparison in the field, facilitating the development of more accurate and efficient algorithms for predicting visual fixations."}
