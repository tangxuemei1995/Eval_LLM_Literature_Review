{"Abstract": "Retinal degeneration, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, has seen promising advancements through stem cell–based regenerative approaches. This study explores the critical factors influencing the efficacy of these therapies, focusing on the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, and ganglion cells. The immune microenvironment's role in graft survival and integration is also examined, highlighting the challenges posed by immune rejection and inflammation. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we identify key strategies to enhance cell survival, functionality, and immune compatibility, including the optimization of cell delivery methods and the use of immunomodulatory agents. Our findings underscore the importance of a multifaceted approach to overcome the barriers in stem cell–based treatments for retinal degeneration, paving the way for more effective and durable therapeutic outcomes."}
