{"Abstract": "This study investigates the pivotal role of the basal ganglia, particularly the striatum and pallidum, in visual perceptual decision-making processes. Utilizing a combination of saccade tracking, choice behavior analysis, and reaction time measurements, we explore how these subcortical structures contribute to the integration of sensory information and the execution of decision-related actions. Sequential analysis techniques and signal detection theory are employed to dissect the neural mechanisms underlying the accuracy and speed of perceptual decisions. Our findings suggest that the basal ganglia not only facilitate the selection of appropriate motor responses but also play a crucial role in the temporal dynamics of decision-making, highlighting their importance in the complex interplay between perception and action."}
