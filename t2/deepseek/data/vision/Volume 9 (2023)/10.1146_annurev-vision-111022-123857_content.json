{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neuronal mechanisms underlying three-dimensional (3D) vision in nonhuman primates, focusing on the integration of stereopsis, perspective, depth, orientation, and motion cues. Utilizing a combination of electrophysiological recordings and behavioral assays, we identified specific neural populations within the visual cortex that are preferentially activated by 3D stimuli. Our findings reveal that these neurons exhibit a remarkable capacity to encode depth information through binocular disparity and motion parallax, suggesting a sophisticated neural architecture dedicated to the perception of 3D space. Furthermore, we observed that the orientation and motion of objects in space modulate the activity of these neurons, indicating a dynamic interplay between different visual cues in the construction of a coherent 3D representation. This research provides critical insights into the neural basis of 3D vision, offering a foundation for understanding the complex processes that enable primates to navigate and interact with their environment effectively."}
