{"Abstract": "Photoreceptor degenerative disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, are leading causes of blindness worldwide, characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors and subsequent retinal remodeling. This remodeling includes synaptic plasticity changes that further impair vision by disrupting the neural circuitry essential for visual signal processing. This study explores therapeutic strategies aimed at suppressing retinal remodeling to mitigate vision loss. By targeting the underlying mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and neuronal reorganization, we aim to preserve retinal function and delay the progression of vision impairment. Our findings suggest that interventions focusing on the stabilization of synaptic connections and inhibition of maladaptive plasticity could offer a promising avenue for the treatment of photoreceptor degenerative disorders. This research underscores the importance of addressing retinal remodeling as a critical component in the development of effective therapies for preserving vision in affected individuals."}
