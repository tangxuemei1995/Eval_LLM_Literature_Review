{"Abstract": "Self-reflection at work is a critical yet underexplored process that influences leadership effectiveness, emotion regulation, and overall job performance. This study delves into the dual nature of self-reflection, distinguishing between its constructive form, which fosters personal growth and decision-making, and its detrimental counterpart, rumination, which can lead to stress and decreased productivity. By employing strategies such as psychological distancing, individuals can harness the benefits of self-reflection while mitigating its pitfalls. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical evidence, this research highlights the importance of cultivating a balanced approach to self-reflection in the workplace. It offers practical recommendations for leaders and employees alike to optimize their reflective practices, thereby enhancing emotional well-being and organizational outcomes."}
