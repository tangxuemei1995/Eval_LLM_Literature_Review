{"Abstract": "This review explores the intersection of race and organizational justice, scrutinizing the premise that justice is colorblind within workplace settings. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we examine how racioethnic differences influence perceptions and experiences of fairness, equity, and inclusion in organizations. The study highlights the pervasive nature of discrimination and bias, which often undermine the principles of organizational justice for minority groups. By integrating theories of justice with critical race perspectives, this paper sheds light on the mechanisms through which racial disparities are perpetuated in the workplace. Our findings suggest that achieving true organizational justice requires a nuanced understanding of race and ethnicity, advocating for policies and practices that actively address and mitigate racial inequities. This review contributes to the ongoing discourse on diversity, equity, and inclusion, offering insights for both academic research and practical organizational strategies."}
