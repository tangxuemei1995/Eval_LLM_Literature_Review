{"Abstract": "The Challengeâ€“Hindrance Stressor Framework (CHSF) has significantly advanced our understanding of workplace stress by distinguishing between stressors that can potentially promote growth (challenge stressors) and those that impede progress (hindrance stressors). Building upon the foundational principles of the Transactional Theory of Stress and the Conservation of Resources theory, this paper proposes the CHSF 2.0, an evolved framework that integrates recent insights into appraisals and negativity bias. By examining the nuanced interplay between job demands and resources, CHSF 2.0 offers a more comprehensive lens through which to view the impact of stressors on employee well-being and performance. This paper lays the groundwork for future research by highlighting the importance of individual differences in stressor appraisal and the role of organizational support in mitigating the adverse effects of hindrance stressors, thereby fostering a more resilient and productive workforce."}
