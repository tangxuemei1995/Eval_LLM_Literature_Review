{"Abstract": "In the quest for environmentally sustainable organizations, Employee Green Behavior (EGB) emerges as a pivotal element. This study delves into the intricate dynamics of EGB, exploring its underpinnings in ecological behavior and environmental psychology. By synthesizing a broad spectrum of scientific literature, we examine how individual pro-environmental actions contribute to the broader objective of environmental sustainability. The research highlights the significance of fostering a workplace culture that encourages and rewards green behaviors, thereby aligning individual actions with organizational environmental goals. Furthermore, it investigates the role of the natural environment as both a motivator and a beneficiary of EGB, offering insights into how organizations can leverage environmental psychology to enhance their sustainability efforts. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of EGB as the cornerstone of environmentally sustainable organizations, offering practical recommendations for integrating green behaviors into the fabric of organizational culture."}
