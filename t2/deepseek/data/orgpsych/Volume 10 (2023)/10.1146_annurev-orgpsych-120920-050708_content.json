{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes a century of research on personnel selection to explore the impact of noise—unwanted variance in judgments—on workplace decision-making. By analyzing historical and contemporary data, we identify strategies to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of judgments in personnel selection and strategic decision-making. Our findings highlight the importance of structured decision-making processes, the use of forecasting models, and the minimization of cognitive biases. The paper concludes with actionable recommendations for organizations aiming to enhance their decision-making frameworks, thereby improving the quality of workplace judgments and the overall effectiveness of personnel selection and strategic planning."}
