{"Abstract": "Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has become a cornerstone in organizational research, offering a robust framework for testing complex theoretical models involving latent variables and their interrelations. This paper reviews the current state of SEM in organizational studies, highlighting its strengths in addressing issues of model fit, latent interactions, and the integration of multiple data sources. Despite its widespread application, challenges remain, particularly in the areas of model specification, the treatment of measurement error, and the interpretation of latent variable interactions. We propose several directions for future research, including the development of more flexible modeling frameworks that can accommodate the dynamic and often non-linear nature of organizational phenomena. Additionally, we advocate for greater emphasis on the practical implications of SEM findings, ensuring that they contribute meaningfully to both theory and practice in organizational settings."}
