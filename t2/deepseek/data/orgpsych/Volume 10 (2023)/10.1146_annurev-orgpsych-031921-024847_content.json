{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate relationship between decent work and meaningful work, exploring how these concepts intersect within the psychology of working and job design. Decent work, characterized by fair income, security, and equal opportunities, lays the foundation for meaningful work, which is imbued with personal significance and purpose. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research examines the psychological mechanisms that link work conditions to the experience of meaningfulness in one's job. It highlights the role of job design in fostering environments that not only meet the criteria for decent work but also enhance the meaningfulness of work for individuals. The findings suggest that integrating principles of decent work with strategies aimed at increasing meaningfulness can lead to improved job satisfaction, well-being, and productivity. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on work psychology by offering insights into how organizations can design jobs that are both decent and meaningful, thereby promoting a more fulfilling work experience for employees."}
