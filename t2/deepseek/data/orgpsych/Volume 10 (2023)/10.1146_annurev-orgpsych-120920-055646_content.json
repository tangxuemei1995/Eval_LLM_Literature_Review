Grounded in action theory, it explores how entrepreneurs navigate uncertainty through bricolage and effectuation, leveraging available resources to forge new paths. The research highlights the critical roles of cognition and emotion in shaping entrepreneurial motivation and decision-making processes. By examining the psychological underpinnings of entrepreneurial actions, this paper sheds light on the cognitive frameworks and emotional resilience that drive individuals to pursue and persist in entrepreneurial ventures.
