{"Abstract": "A decade has passed since the seminal work on employee voice and silence reshaped our understanding of upward communication in organizations. This paper takes stock of the advancements in the field, focusing on the dynamics of employee voice and silence as forms of proactive behavior and information sharing. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we explore the antecedents, processes, and outcomes associated with these constructs, highlighting the evolving role of organizational culture, leadership, and technology in facilitating or hindering upward communication. Our analysis reveals a nuanced landscape where employee voice and silence are not merely opposites but are influenced by a complex interplay of individual, relational, and contextual factors. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies and the integration of diverse theoretical perspectives to further our understanding of these critical organizational phenomena."}
