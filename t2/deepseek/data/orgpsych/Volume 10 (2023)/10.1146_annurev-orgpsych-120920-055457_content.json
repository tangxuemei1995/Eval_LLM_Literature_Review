{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamic interplay between actors (individuals and teams) and their contexts in fostering creativity and innovation. By examining person-context and team-context interactions, alongside person-situation and team-situation dynamics, we aim to uncover how these relationships influence creative outcomes. Our review highlights progress in understanding these interactions and identifies desirable directions for future research, emphasizing the need for more nuanced models that account for the complexity of real-world creative processes. This work contributes to the broader discourse on creativity by offering insights into the mechanisms that facilitate innovative thinking and problem-solving."}
