{"Abstract": "Meta-analysis has emerged as a pivotal methodological tool in organizational research, enabling the synthesis of findings across studies to draw more generalized conclusions. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the methodological options available for conducting meta-analyses, with a focus on enhancing the accuracy and reliability of research synthesis. Key considerations include the selection of appropriate effect size metrics, the correction for psychometric artifacts, and the application of validity generalization techniques to account for variability across studies. By addressing these methodological challenges, researchers can improve the validity of their meta-analytic findings, thereby contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field of organizational studies."}
