{"Abstract": "A decade has passed since the introduction of the Job Demandsâ€“Resources (JD-R) theory, a framework that has significantly influenced our understanding of workplace well-being and performance. This theory posits that job characteristics can be categorized into demands and resources, which respectively lead to strain and motivation, ultimately affecting employee health and organizational outcomes. Over the years, the JD-R theory has been expanded to incorporate proactive work behavior, emphasizing the role of employees in shaping their work environment. This review highlights the evolution of the JD-R theory, focusing on its application in job design, the interplay between job demands and resources, and their impact on burnout and work engagement. By synthesizing a decade of research, this paper aims to provide insights into the theory's contributions to organizational psychology and suggest directions for future research to further enhance workplace well-being and productivity."}
