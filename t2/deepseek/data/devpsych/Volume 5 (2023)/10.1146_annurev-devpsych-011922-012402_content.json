{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes current research on the intersection of poverty, brain development, and mental health, highlighting the profound impact of socioeconomic adversity on neurobiological and psychological outcomes. Drawing on advances in neuroimaging and developmental psychopathology, we explore how poverty-related stressors can alter brain structure and function, predisposing individuals to mental health disorders. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in ensuring the replicability and reproducibility of findings across diverse populations and contexts. We discuss methodological innovations and interdisciplinary approaches that promise to enhance our understanding of these complex relationships. Finally, we outline paths forward for research, policy, and intervention, emphasizing the need for scalable, evidence-based strategies to mitigate the effects of poverty on brain development and mental health. This work underscores the critical importance of addressing socioeconomic disparities to promote neurodevelopmental and psychological well-being."}
