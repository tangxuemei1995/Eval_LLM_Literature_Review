{"Abstract": "The integration of life-course epidemiology with causal inference presents a unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of health trajectories and their determinants. This paper explores the tensions and synergies between these two fields, focusing on the challenges of applying causal inference methods to life-course research. We discuss the limitations of traditional epidemiological approaches in capturing the complexity of life-course processes and the potential of natural experiments and advanced quantitative methods to address these issues. By reviewing recent methodological advancements and case studies, we highlight how causal inference can be leveraged to disentangle the temporal and contextual factors influencing health outcomes across the life span. The paper concludes with recommendations for bridging the methodological divide, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of innovative research designs that can accommodate the dynamic nature of life-course epidemiology while adhering to the principles of causal inference."}
