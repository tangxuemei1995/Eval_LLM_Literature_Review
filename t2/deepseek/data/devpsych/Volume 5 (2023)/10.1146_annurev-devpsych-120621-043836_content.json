{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of emotion regulation within couples across different stages of adulthood, with a particular focus on the impact of aging. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, we investigate how couples navigate emotional challenges and maintain relational satisfaction over time. The research highlights the role of adaptive emotion regulation strategies in fostering resilience and well-being among aging couples. Findings suggest that as individuals age, there is a notable shift towards more effective emotion regulation techniques, which are crucial for sustaining healthy relationships. The study also examines the interplay between individual and dyadic emotion regulation processes, revealing how these mechanisms evolve with age. By shedding light on the complexities of emotion regulation in couples across adulthood, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the factors that promote enduring and fulfilling partnerships in later life."}
