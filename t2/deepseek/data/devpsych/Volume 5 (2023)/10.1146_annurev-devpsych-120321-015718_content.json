{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes current research on the cognitive mechanisms and socialization processes that shape children's understanding of race and ethnicity. By integrating findings from developmental psychology, sociology, and education, we explore how ethnic-racial socialization—the transmission of cultural values, beliefs, and practices related to race and ethnicity—interacts with children's cognitive development to influence their racial learning. The review highlights the role of family, peers, and educational settings in this process, emphasizing the importance of context in shaping children's racial attitudes and identities. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between cognitive development and socialization in the formation of children's racial awareness, offering insights for future research and interventions aimed at promoting positive ethnic-racial identity development."}
