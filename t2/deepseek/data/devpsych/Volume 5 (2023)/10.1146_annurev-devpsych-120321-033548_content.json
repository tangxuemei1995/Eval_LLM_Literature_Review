{"Abstract": "The capacity to understand and engage in helping behaviors is a fundamental aspect of human social cognition, emerging early in development. This study investigates the representation of third-party helping interactions in infancy, focusing on infants' ability to attribute goals and intentions to others in social contexts. Utilizing a combination of eye-tracking technology and behavioral experiments, we examined how infants aged 12 to 24 months perceive and interpret helping actions between third parties. Our findings reveal that infants as young as 12 months old can distinguish between helpful and hindering behaviors, demonstrating an early sensitivity to the goals of others. Furthermore, infants showed a preference for individuals who engaged in helping actions, suggesting an innate predisposition towards prosocial behavior. These results provide new insights into the developmental trajectory of social cognition and the mechanisms underlying infants' understanding of helping interactions. The study underscores the importance of early social experiences in shaping infants' ability to navigate complex social environments and highlights the potential for targeted interventions to foster prosocial behavior from a young age."}
