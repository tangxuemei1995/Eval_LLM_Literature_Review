{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate process of children's acquisition and application of norms, focusing on the interplay between norm psychology and social-cognitive development. By examining young children's understanding and enforcement of normativity and morality, we aim to shed light on the foundational mechanisms that guide their social interactions and moral reasoning. Through a series of observational and experimental methodologies, we investigate how children distinguish between conventional and moral norms, and how these distinctions influence their behavior and judgments in various social contexts. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on developmental psychology by highlighting the critical role of early social experiences in shaping children's normative understanding and moral development. This research underscores the importance of fostering environments that promote healthy norm acquisition and application, offering insights for educators, parents, and policymakers in supporting children's social-cognitive growth."}
