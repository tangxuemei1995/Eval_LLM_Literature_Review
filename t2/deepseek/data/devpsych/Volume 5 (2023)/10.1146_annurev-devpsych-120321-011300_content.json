{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate neurodevelopment of attention, learning, and memory systems during infancy, a critical period for cognitive development. By synthesizing findings from recent neuroimaging and behavioral studies, we examine how infant attention mechanisms evolve and lay the groundwork for subsequent learning and memory capabilities. Attention development in infancy is characterized by rapid changes in neural connectivity and the maturation of key brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These neurodevelopmental processes facilitate the emergence of selective attention, which is crucial for effective learning and memory formation. Furthermore, we discuss the role of environmental stimuli and caregiver interactions in shaping these cognitive systems. Our findings underscore the importance of early experiences in influencing the trajectory of cognitive development, highlighting potential implications for early intervention strategies aimed at optimizing neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk populations."}
