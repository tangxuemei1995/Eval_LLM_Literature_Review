{"Abstract": "The functioning of offspring of depressed parents has garnered significant attention due to its implications for psychobiological development and mental health outcomes. This review synthesizes current research on the psychobiological and brain structural alterations observed in these offspring, highlighting the increased vulnerability to mood disorders. Despite advancements, unresolved issues persist, including the delineation of genetic versus environmental influences and the impact of early intervention. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional stressors, potentially exacerbating risks for offspring of depressed parents. Future directions should focus on longitudinal studies to track developmental trajectories, the role of resilience factors, and the efficacy of targeted interventions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing preventive strategies and support systems for at-risk populations, especially in the context of global crises like COVID-19."}
