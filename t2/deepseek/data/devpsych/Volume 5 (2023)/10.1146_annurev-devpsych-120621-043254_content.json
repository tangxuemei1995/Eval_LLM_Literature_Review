{"Abstract": "This study explores the efficacy of socioemotional interventions aimed at enhancing the parent–infant relationship during the critical early stages of development. Focusing on the constructs of parental sensitivity and attachment, the research synthesizes findings from a comprehensive review of existing literature to identify effective strategies for early intervention. The analysis highlights the importance of timely support in fostering secure attachments and promoting socioemotional well-being in infants. By examining various intervention models, including those that incorporate direct parent training and those that utilize observational feedback, the study underscores the potential of these approaches to improve parental responsiveness and infant outcomes. The findings suggest that early socioemotional interventions can significantly impact the developmental trajectory of children, emphasizing the need for accessible and scalable programs to support at-risk families. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence advocating for early, targeted interventions to strengthen the parent–infant bond and enhance socioemotional development."}
