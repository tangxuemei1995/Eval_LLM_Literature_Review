{"Abstract": "Prenatal substance exposure represents a significant public health concern, with profound implications for developmental outcomes. This study explores the multifaceted impact of prenatal adversity, focusing on the effects of substance use during pregnancy on early childhood development. Drawing from a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the biological, psychological, and social consequences of prenatal substance exposure, including its association with cognitive deficits, behavioral problems, and increased risk of mental health disorders. Furthermore, this research highlights the role of early adversity in shaping long-term developmental trajectories, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and support for affected families. By synthesizing findings from epidemiological, clinical, and neurobiological studies, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of the challenges posed by prenatal substance exposure and to inform evidence-based strategies for mitigating its impact on child development and well-being."}
