{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of developmental social neuroscience and early interventions for infants at risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Drawing on recent advances in neuroimaging and behavioral research, we examine how early brain development in infants can be influenced by targeted interventions aimed at enhancing social communication skills. The review highlights the critical periods of brain plasticity in infancy, during which neural circuits underlying social behavior are particularly malleable. We discuss various intervention strategies, including parent-mediated approaches and direct infant engagement techniques, that leverage this plasticity to promote more typical developmental trajectories. Furthermore, the paper addresses the challenges of identifying infants at risk for ASD and the importance of early detection for the effectiveness of interventions. By integrating findings from developmental neuroscience with clinical practice, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for designing and implementing early interventions that can alter the course of autism development, ultimately improving outcomes for affected individuals and their families."}
