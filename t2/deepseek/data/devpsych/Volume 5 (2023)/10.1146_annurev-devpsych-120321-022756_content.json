{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate processes of identity development among youth, employing an interdisciplinary lens that integrates critical race theory and intersectionality. By adopting a mixed-methods approach, the research explores how various social identities intersect and influence the developmental trajectories of young individuals. The investigation is grounded in the premise that identity is not a monolithic construct but a dynamic interplay of multiple, overlapping social categories such as race, gender, class, and sexuality. Through qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys, the study captures the nuanced experiences of youth as they navigate their social worlds, shedding light on the mechanisms through which intersectionality shapes identity formation. The findings underscore the importance of considering the complex, interwoven nature of social identities in developmental research and practice. This conversation about the 'what' and the 'how' of development aims to contribute to a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of youth identity, advocating for approaches that recognize and address the multifaceted realities of young people's lives."}
