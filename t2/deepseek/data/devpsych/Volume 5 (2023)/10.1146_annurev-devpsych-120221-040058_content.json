{"Abstract": "This study presents a rational account of cognitive control development in childhood, integrating insights from developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. We propose that the maturation of cognitive control can be understood as an optimization process, where children gradually learn to allocate their cognitive resources in a manner that maximizes expected value. This framework posits that developmental changes in cognitive control are not merely a function of biological maturation but also reflect the increasing competence of children in evaluating the costs and benefits of different control strategies. By synthesizing empirical findings with theoretical models, we argue that a rational account offers a comprehensive explanation for the observed patterns of cognitive control development. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering both the computational demands of control tasks and the developmental trajectory of children's decision-making abilities. This perspective has significant implications for understanding individual differences in cognitive development and for designing interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive control in childhood."}
