{"Abstract": "This study explores the Two-Hit Model of Behavioral Inhibition and Anxiety, investigating the developmental origins of anxiety disorders through the lens of behavioral inhibition (BI) in infancy and its persistence into adolescence. Behavioral inhibition, characterized by a temperamental predisposition to withdraw from unfamiliar stimuli, is identified as a significant early-life risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders. The Two-Hit Model posits that the interaction between an initial 'hit' of high BI in infancy and a second 'hit' of environmental stressors or biological vulnerabilities during adolescence significantly increases the risk for anxiety. Through a comprehensive review of longitudinal studies and empirical research, this paper examines the mechanisms by which these two developmental periods interact to influence the trajectory of anxiety. The findings underscore the importance of early identification and intervention strategies targeting behavioral inhibition to mitigate the risk of anxiety disorders in later life."}
