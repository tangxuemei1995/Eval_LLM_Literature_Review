{"Abstract": "Cognitive flexibility, a core component of executive function, is crucial for adapting to changing environments and is intricately linked to neurodevelopment. This review synthesizes recent advancements in developmental neuroimaging, particularly task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to elucidate the neural underpinnings of cognitive flexibility across different stages of development. We highlight key findings from studies that have employed diverse cognitive tasks to probe flexibility, revealing dynamic changes in brain activation patterns and connectivity associated with age-related improvements in cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the developmental trajectory of executive functions and the potential impact of individual differences and environmental factors. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies, the integration of multimodal neuroimaging techniques, and the exploration of interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive flexibility in developmental populations. This review underscores the importance of developmental neuroimaging in advancing our understanding of cognitive flexibility and its neural basis."}
