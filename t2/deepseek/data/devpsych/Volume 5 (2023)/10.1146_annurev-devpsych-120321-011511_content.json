{"Abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period of development, marked by significant biological, psychological, and social changes. This paper adopts a neuroecosocial perspective to explore the multifaceted influences on adolescent development, emphasizing the interplay between neural processes, ecological contexts, and social determinants. We investigate how youth-led methods can empower adolescents to navigate challenges related to mental health, social inequalities, urbanicity, and the climate crisis. By integrating insights from neuroscience, ecology, and social sciences, we propose a holistic framework that addresses the complex needs of adolescents in diverse environments. Our findings highlight the importance of fostering resilience and agency among adolescents, advocating for inclusive policies and practices that support their well-being and development in the face of global challenges. This research underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understand and enhance adolescent development in a rapidly changing world."}
