{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of resilience and vulnerability through the lens of phenomenology, focusing on the autobiographical narratives of individuals who have navigated unforeseen life pathways. By examining the interplay between identity formation and socialization processes, the research sheds light on how personal and social identities are continuously reshaped in response to life's unpredictabilities. Utilizing a qualitative approach, the study delves into the lived experiences of participants, revealing the complex ways in which resilience is cultivated amidst vulnerability. The findings highlight the significance of narrative identity in fostering a sense of coherence and continuity, even in the face of disruptive life events. This research contributes to the broader discourse on human adaptability, offering insights into the mechanisms that enable individuals to reconstruct their identities and social roles in the aftermath of unforeseen challenges. The study underscores the importance of understanding resilience as a dynamic, context-dependent process that is deeply intertwined with the social and cultural fabric of individuals' lives."}
