{"Abstract": "This review explores the current concepts in gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth, focusing on the use of pubertal blockers and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to delay puberty, and gender-affirming hormone treatment to align physical characteristics with gender identity. It highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, including psychological support, to address the unique needs of this population. The paper also discusses the ethical considerations, potential benefits, and risks associated with these interventions, emphasizing the need for individualized care plans to support the well-being and mental health of transgender and gender-diverse youth."}
