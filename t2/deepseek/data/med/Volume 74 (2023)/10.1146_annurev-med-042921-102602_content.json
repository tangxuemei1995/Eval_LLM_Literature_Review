{"Abstract": "The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays a pivotal role in the regulation of erythropoiesis, primarily through the modulation of erythropoietin (EPO) production in response to oxygen availability. This study explores the effects of genetic and pharmacological perturbations on the HIF pathway and their implications for erythropoiesis, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigate the therapeutic potential of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and their efficacy compared to traditional EPO therapy. Additionally, the study addresses the risk of thromboembolism associated with HIF pathway activation, a critical consideration in the clinical application of HIF-PHIs. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and experimental data, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which the HIF pathway regulates erythropoiesis and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HIF-PHIs in treating anemia associated with CKD, providing insights into the optimization of therapeutic strategies targeting the HIF pathway."}
