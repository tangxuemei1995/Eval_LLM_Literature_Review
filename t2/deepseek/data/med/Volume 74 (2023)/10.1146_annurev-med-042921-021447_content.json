{"Abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to impaired chloride and bicarbonate transport. Recent advancements in CF treatment have focused on CFTR modulators, which target the underlying defect by enhancing CFTR protein function. This review explores the development, efficacy, and limitations of CFTR modulator therapies, including correctors, potentiators, and combination treatments. By analyzing clinical trial data and real-world outcomes, we assess the impact of these therapies on lung function, quality of life, and survival rates in CF patients, highlighting the transformative potential of precision medicine in CF care."}
