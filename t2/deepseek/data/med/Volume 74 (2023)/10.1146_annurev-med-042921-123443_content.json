{"Abstract": "Club Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP), also known as CC10, uteroglobin, or secretoglobin 1A1 (SCGB1A1), plays a pivotal role in lung biology and has emerged as a significant biomarker in various lung diseases. This protein, predominantly secreted by club cells in the respiratory epithelium, is involved in anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and protective functions within the lung. Recent studies have highlighted its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and lung cancer. The mechanisms by which CCSP exerts its effects are under active investigation, with research focusing on its role in modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue repair. This review synthesizes current knowledge on CCSP, exploring its emerging concepts in lung disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic agent, thereby offering new insights into the management of respiratory disorders."}
