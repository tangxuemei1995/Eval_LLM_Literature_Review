{"Abstract": "The integration of race into clinical algorithms for kidney function estimation has sparked significant debate, highlighting the tension between historical medical practices and the pursuit of health equity. This paper examines the implications of race-based medicine on kidney function estimation, critiquing the scientific validity and ethical considerations of such practices. Through a review of current literature and case studies, we explore the lessons learned from the use of race in these algorithms and propose a path forward that prioritizes health justice. Our findings advocate for the development of race-neutral clinical algorithms that ensure equitable healthcare outcomes for all patients, irrespective of racial or ethnic background."}
