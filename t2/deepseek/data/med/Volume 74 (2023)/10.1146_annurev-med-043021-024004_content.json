{"Abstract": "This study investigates the origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies, focusing on disparities in pulse oximetry and pulmonary function testing. By examining the design and implementation of medical devices and algorithms, we uncover how structural racism has historically influenced these technologies, leading to inaccuracies and inequities in healthcare outcomes for minority populations. Our analysis highlights the need for a critical reevaluation of the assumptions and methodologies underlying these technologies to ensure they are equitable and effective for all racial and ethnic groups. This research contributes to the broader discourse on health disparities and the imperative for inclusive medical technology development."}
