{"Abstract": "Valvular heart disease (VHD) encompasses a range of conditions affecting heart valves, including rheumatic heart disease, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and bicuspid aortic valve disease. Recent advancements have shed light on novel pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies. This review highlights emerging concepts in VHD pathophysiology and explores cutting-edge therapeutic approaches aimed at improving patient outcomes and quality of life."}
