{"Abstract": "Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating advanced strategies for risk prediction and prevention. The advent of polygenic scores (PGS) has revolutionized the field of genomics by enabling the aggregation of genetic variants to estimate an individual's predisposition to complex diseases like CAD. This review highlights the latest advances in the development and application of PGS for CAD, emphasizing their role in enhancing risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors. We explore the integration of PGS with clinical and lifestyle factors to improve the accuracy of CAD risk assessment, facilitating personalized prevention strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the implementation of PGS in clinical practice, including issues related to genetic diversity, data interpretation, and ethical considerations. The potential of PGS to transform CAD prevention through early identification of at-risk individuals and targeted interventions is underscored, paving the way for a new era in cardiovascular genomics."}
