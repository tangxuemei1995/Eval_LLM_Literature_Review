{"Abstract": "The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed syndromes, particularly those suspected to be of genetic origin. Exome and genome sequencing have emerged as powerful tools in the identification of pathogenic variants underlying rare and ultrarare diseases, including Mendelian disorders. This study explores the efficacy of exome and genome sequencing in elucidating the genetic basis of undiagnosed syndromes, highlighting their role in uncovering novel disease-causing mutations and expanding the phenotypic spectrum of known genetic conditions. By analyzing a cohort of patients with undiagnosed diseases, we demonstrate the diagnostic yield of these sequencing approaches and discuss the challenges in variant interpretation and the integration of genomic data into clinical practice. Our findings underscore the importance of exome and genome sequencing in the diagnostic odyssey of patients with undiagnosed syndromes, offering hope for personalized medicine and targeted therapeutic interventions."}
