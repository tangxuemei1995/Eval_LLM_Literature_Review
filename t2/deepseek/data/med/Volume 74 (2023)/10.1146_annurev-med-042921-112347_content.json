{"Abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) represents a prevalent biological phenomenon characterized by the expansion of hematopoietic stem cell clones due to acquired somatic mutations, predominantly in individuals over the age of 50. This condition, while often asymptomatic, has been increasingly recognized for its significant associations with aging, coronary artery disease (CAD), and malignancy. The underlying mechanisms linking CHIP to these adverse health outcomes are complex and multifaceted, involving inflammatory pathways, DNA methylation alterations, and clonal trajectories that may predispose to disease progression. Recent studies have highlighted the role of CHIP in accelerating atherosclerosis and increasing the risk of hematologic cancers, thereby underscoring the importance of understanding the molecular and cellular dynamics of clonal hematopoiesis. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on CHIP, focusing on its impact on human health, the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors, and the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate its associated risks."}
