{"Abstract": "Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) represents a critical, life-threatening condition characterized by an uncontrolled and excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to systemic hyperinflammation and potential multi-organ failure. This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of disorders, including Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), each sharing the common pathophysiological hallmark of cytokine dysregulation. The pathogenesis of CSS involves complex interactions between immune cells, particularly macrophages and T lymphocytes, culminating in a vicious cycle of cytokine production and immune activation. Key cytokines implicated in this process include interleukins (IL-6, IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The clinical manifestations of CSS are diverse, ranging from fever and cytopenia to severe organ dysfunction. Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial for improving outcomes, with treatment strategies focusing on immunosuppression and cytokine blockade. This review aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, clinical features, and therapeutic approaches for CSS, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing this complex syndrome."}
