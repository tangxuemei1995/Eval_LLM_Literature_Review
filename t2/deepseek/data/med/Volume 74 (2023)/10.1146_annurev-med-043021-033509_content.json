{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has unveiled complex interactions between viral infections and the endocrine system. This review explores the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine disorders, focusing on obesity, thyroid, adrenal, pituitary, and reproductive health. Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect endocrine organs, leading to dysregulation of hormone production and exacerbation of pre-existing endocrine conditions. Obesity has been identified as a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, attributed to its pro-inflammatory state and metabolic disturbances. Thyroid dysfunction, including both thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, has been observed in COVID-19 patients, potentially linked to the virus's direct effects or immune-mediated responses. The adrenal and pituitary glands may also be affected, with reports of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis. Furthermore, COVID-19 has implications for reproductive health, affecting menstrual cycles and fertility. Understanding these endocrine manifestations is crucial for the comprehensive management of COVID-19 patients, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary approaches in their care."}
