{"Abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has posed significant challenges to global efforts in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants, characterized by mutations in the spike protein, have shown increased transmissibility, potential immune evasion, and varying degrees of resistance to existing vaccines and therapeutic agents. This review highlights the biological and epidemiological implications of VOCs, including their impact on vaccine efficacy and public health strategies. Understanding the dynamics of viral evolution and the mechanisms underlying these variants is crucial for developing effective countermeasures and adapting vaccination strategies to mitigate the ongoing threat of COVID-19."}
