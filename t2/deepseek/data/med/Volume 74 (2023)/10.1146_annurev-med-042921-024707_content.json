{"Abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents a group of heterogeneous malignancies with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Recent advancements in molecular profiling have identified Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) alterations, including mutations, fusions, amplifications, and in-frame deletions, as key drivers in a subset of CCA patients. These genetic alterations lead to the constitutive activation of FGFR2 signaling pathways, promoting tumor growth and survival. Consequently, FGFR2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in CCA. However, the clinical efficacy of FGFR2 inhibitors is often hampered by the development of resistance mechanisms, including the activation of alternative signaling pathways such as RAS, EGFR, and MEK. This review focuses on the role of FGFR2 alterations in CCA pathogenesis, the current landscape of FGFR2-targeted therapies, and the mechanisms underlying resistance to these agents. Understanding the molecular basis of resistance is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance and improve outcomes for patients with FGFR2-altered CCA."}
