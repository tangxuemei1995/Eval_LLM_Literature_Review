{"Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite significant advancements in understanding the molecular underpinnings of AD, the role of tau pathology in disease progression remains elusive. This review focuses on the 'invisible' aspects of tau biology that are not readily detectable with current imaging and biochemical techniques but are crucial for the development of effective biomarkers and therapeutics. We explore the potential of novel tau isoforms, post-translational modifications, and tau interactions with other cellular components as targets for early diagnosis and intervention. The insights gained could pave the way for innovative strategies to combat tauopathies, including AD."}
