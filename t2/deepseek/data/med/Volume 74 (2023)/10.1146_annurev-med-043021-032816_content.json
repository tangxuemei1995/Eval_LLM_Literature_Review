{"Abstract": "Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, plays a pivotal role in health and disease by controlling iron absorption and distribution. This peptide hormone, synthesized in the liver, responds to iron levels, inflammation, and erythropoietic demand, modulating iron availability through its interaction with ferroportin. Dysregulation of hepcidin expression is implicated in various pathological conditions, including anemia of chronic disease, where elevated hepcidin levels restrict iron availability, and iron overload disorders, where insufficient hepcidin leads to excessive iron absorption. Understanding the intricate balance of hepcidin and iron metabolism offers insights into therapeutic strategies for managing iron-related diseases, highlighting the importance of targeting hepcidin pathways in treating anemia and iron overload."}
