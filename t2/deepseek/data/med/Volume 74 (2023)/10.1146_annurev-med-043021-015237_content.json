{"Abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been pivotal in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, rare cases of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have been reported, presenting a serious immunologic complication. This condition is characterized by the development of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following vaccination, particularly with adenoviral vector-based vaccines. The pathogenesis of VITT involves the production of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), leading to platelet activation and a prothrombotic state. This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying VITT, its clinical manifestations, and the challenges in diagnosis and management. Despite its rarity, the severity of VITT necessitates heightened awareness among healthcare providers to ensure prompt recognition and treatment. Understanding the immunologic basis of VITT is crucial for the development of safer vaccination strategies and for mitigating the risk of this adverse event in future vaccine campaigns."}
