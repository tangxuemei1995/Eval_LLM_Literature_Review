{"Abstract": "Maternal mortality in the United States remains a significant public health challenge, with notable disparities across racial and socioeconomic groups. This study examines recent trends in maternal mortality rates, identifying key factors contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we highlight the critical role of preconception health and counseling in mitigating risks associated with pregnancy. Our findings suggest that targeted interventions aimed at improving preconception health can significantly reduce maternal mortality rates. Furthermore, we explore the potential of preconception counseling to address health disparities and improve outcomes for at-risk populations. This research underscores the importance of integrating preconception care into public health strategies to prevent maternal mortality and enhance the well-being of mothers and their children across the United States."}
