{"Abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients, including those undergoing solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The introduction of letermovir, a novel antiviral agent, has marked a pivotal advancement in the prophylaxis and treatment of CMV in this vulnerable population. Letermovir inhibits the viral terminase complex, a mechanism distinct from traditional antiviral therapies, offering a new avenue for managing CMV with potentially reduced toxicity and resistance. This review synthesizes current evidence on the efficacy and safety of letermovir in preventing and treating CMV infections among transplant recipients. Clinical trials and real-world data highlight its role in significantly reducing the incidence of CMV reactivation and disease, particularly in HCT recipients, while also demonstrating a favorable safety profile. The integration of letermovir into CMV management protocols represents a promising strategy to improve outcomes in transplant medicine, underscoring the need for ongoing research to optimize its use across different transplant settings."}
