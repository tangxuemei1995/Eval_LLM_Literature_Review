{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to severe clinical complications. Recent advancements in gene therapy have opened new avenues for its treatment, offering hope for a potential cure. This review explores diverse approaches to gene therapy for SCD, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), gene addition using lentiviral vectors, and gene editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9. HSCT remains the only curative option but is limited by donor availability and graft-versus-host disease. Lentiviral vector-mediated gene therapy has shown promise in clinical trials by introducing functional hemoglobin genes into patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells. Meanwhile, CRISPR-Cas9 offers precise genome editing to correct the underlying genetic mutation. Each approach has unique advantages and challenges, and ongoing research aims to optimize safety, efficacy, and accessibility for patients worldwide."}
