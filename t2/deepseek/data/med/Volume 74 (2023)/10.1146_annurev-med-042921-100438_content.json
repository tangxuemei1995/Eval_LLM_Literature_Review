{"Abstract": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a significant cause of secondary hypertension, characterized by excessive aldosterone production independent of the renin-angiotensin system. This condition not only contributes to the development of hypertension but also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have emerged as a cornerstone in the management of PA, offering protective effects on both the heart and kidneys. By blocking the deleterious actions of aldosterone, MRAs mitigate the progression of CVD and CKD, highlighting their therapeutic potential beyond blood pressure control. This review explores the pathophysiology of PA and the pivotal role of MRAs in attenuating its adverse effects on cardiovascular and renal health, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and targeted treatment to improve patient outcomes."}
