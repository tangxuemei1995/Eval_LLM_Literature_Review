{"Abstract": "Chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure (CNRF) represents a significant challenge in respiratory medicine, necessitating innovative approaches for management and care. This study explores the efficacy and impact of home assisted ventilation (HAV), particularly noninvasive ventilation (NIV), on patients with CNRF. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and clinical trials, we assess the benefits of HAV in improving quality of life, reducing hospital admissions, and enhancing survival rates. Our findings suggest that NIV, as a cornerstone of HAV, offers a viable and effective solution for managing CNRF, emphasizing the importance of tailored ventilation strategies to meet individual patient needs. This research underscores the potential of HAV to transform the management of CNRF, advocating for its broader adoption in home care settings."}
