{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has significantly impacted individuals with kidney disease, particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and those undergoing kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT), including dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. This review synthesizes current evidence on the interplay between COVID-19 and kidney disease, highlighting the increased risk of severe outcomes in this vulnerable population. Patients with kidney disease exhibit a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are more likely to experience complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and progression to more severe stages of kidney disease. The management of COVID-19 in patients with kidney disease presents unique challenges, including the need for modified treatment protocols and the optimization of dialysis and transplant care during the pandemic. This abstract underscores the importance of targeted interventions and research to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with kidney disease."}
