{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled a significant association between the disease and thrombotic complications, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality among affected individuals. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19-induced thrombosis, highlighting the role of endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and platelet activation. We delve into the current therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating these thrombotic events, including the use of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors. The efficacy and safety profiles of these interventions are critically evaluated, with a focus on optimizing patient outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges in therapeutic decision-making, such as balancing the risk of bleeding against the benefits of thrombosis prevention. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of personalized medicine in the management of COVID-19-related thrombotic complications, advocating for further research to refine therapeutic protocols and improve patient care in the context of this global health crisis."}
