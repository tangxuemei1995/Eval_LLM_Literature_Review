{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of SLE have highlighted the central role of interferon (IFN) signaling pathways, leading to the development of novel diagnostic tools and targeted biologic therapies. This review focuses on the latest diagnostic approaches that leverage biomarkers and genetic profiling to improve early detection and disease monitoring. Furthermore, it explores emerging biologic therapies aimed at modulating the IFN pathway and other immune system components, offering new hope for personalized treatment strategies. These advancements represent a paradigm shift in the management of SLE, promising improved outcomes and reduced side effects compared to traditional therapies."}
