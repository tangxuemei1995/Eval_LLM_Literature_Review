{"Abstract": "The escalating global obesity epidemic necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies. This review explores the burgeoning field of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and nascent nutrient-stimulated hormone (NuSH)-based therapies as pivotal antiobesity medications. GLP-1 receptor agonists have demonstrated efficacy in weight management, prompting the development of dual and triple receptor agonists that target multiple pathways for enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Concurrently, NuSH-based therapies, leveraging the body's nutrient-sensing mechanisms, offer a novel approach to obesity treatment. This article synthesizes current research, highlighting the potential of these advanced therapies to redefine obesity management and improve patient outcomes in the face of this growing public health challenge."}
