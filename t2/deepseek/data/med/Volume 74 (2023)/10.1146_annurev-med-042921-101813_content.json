{"Abstract": "The exploration of genetic kidney diseases has unveiled the significant impact of rare disorders on the broader spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Utilizing collapsing analysis and massively parallel sequencing, researchers have identified novel genetic variants that contribute to the pathogenesis of CKD, challenging traditional views on its genetic architecture. This study highlights the unexpected role of rare genetic disorders in CKD, emphasizing the importance of genomics in uncovering the complex genetic underpinnings of kidney disease. By integrating precision medicine approaches, this research paves the way for targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies, offering new hope for patients with genetic kidney diseases. The findings underscore the necessity of incorporating genetic screening into routine clinical practice to enhance diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making in CKD."}
