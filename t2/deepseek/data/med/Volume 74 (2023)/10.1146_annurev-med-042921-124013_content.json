{"Abstract": "The ISCHEMIA trial has significantly influenced the management of stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), offering critical insights into the comparative effectiveness of invasive versus conservative treatment strategies. This landmark study underscores the importance of optimal medical therapy (OMT) as the cornerstone of SIHD management, demonstrating that an initial invasive approach does not reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared to a conservative strategy in patients with moderate to severe ischemia. However, it highlights the role of invasive procedures in alleviating symptoms of stable angina, thereby improving quality of life. These findings advocate for a patient-centered approach, integrating clinical judgment and patient preferences in decision-making processes."}
