{"Abstract": "Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) represents a unique and increasingly recognized clinical entity characterized by evidence of myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. This condition challenges traditional diagnostic paradigms and necessitates a comprehensive approach to identify underlying etiologies, including coronary spasm, takotsubo syndrome, and other forms of myocardial injury. The pathophysiology of MINOCA is multifactorial, involving mechanisms such as endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, and plaque disruption without significant luminal obstruction. Accurate diagnosis and management require a combination of advanced imaging techniques, biomarker assessment, and clinical acumen. Despite its nonobstructive nature, MINOCA is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, underscoring the importance of tailored therapeutic strategies. This review highlights the current understanding of MINOCA, emphasizing diagnostic criteria, etiological factors, and evidence-based management approaches to improve patient outcomes."}
