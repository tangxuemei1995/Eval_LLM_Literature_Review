{"Abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary approach in the treatment of lymphomas, offering hope where traditional therapies have failed. However, the efficacy of CAR T cells is often compromised by tumor escape mechanisms, notably antigen loss, which allows cancer cells to evade immune detection. This study explores the potential of multispecific CAR T cells, including bispecific and trispecific CAR constructs, to counteract this challenge. By targeting multiple tumor-associated antigens simultaneously, these advanced CAR T cells aim to reduce the likelihood of antigen escape, thereby enhancing the durability of therapeutic responses. Through a comprehensive review of preclinical and clinical data, we assess the design, efficacy, and safety profiles of multispecific CAR T cells in lymphoma treatment. Our findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cells represent a promising strategy to overcome antigen loss, potentially leading to more effective and long-lasting remissions in patients with refractory or relapsed lymphomas."}
