{"Abstract": "This paper explores the transformative role of text algorithms in economics, focusing on the utilization of text as data to uncover insights from unstructured information. We delve into the application of topic models, word embeddings, and large language models, including transformer models, to analyze economic texts. These methodologies enable the extraction of thematic structures, semantic relationships, and predictive patterns from vast corpora, offering novel perspectives on economic phenomena. By bridging computational linguistics and economic analysis, this research highlights the potential of advanced text algorithms to enhance our understanding of economic dynamics, policy impacts, and market behaviors in the digital age."}
