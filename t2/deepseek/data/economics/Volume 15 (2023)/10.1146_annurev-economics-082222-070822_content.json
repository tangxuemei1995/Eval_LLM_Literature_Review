{"Abstract": "This paper examines the economic implications of antitrust reform, focusing on the balance between fostering competition and regulating monopolistic practices. Through a comprehensive analysis of historical and contemporary antitrust cases, we explore the effectiveness of current antitrust laws in promoting market competition and preventing the formation of monopolies. The study highlights the role of mergers and acquisitions in shaping market dynamics and assesses the impact of regulatory interventions on innovation and consumer welfare. By employing economic models and empirical data, we argue for a nuanced approach to antitrust reform that considers the complexities of modern markets. Our findings suggest that while antitrust laws are crucial for maintaining competitive markets, they must be adapted to address the challenges posed by digital economies and global market integration. The paper concludes with policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the efficacy of antitrust regulations in promoting economic efficiency and protecting consumer interests."}
