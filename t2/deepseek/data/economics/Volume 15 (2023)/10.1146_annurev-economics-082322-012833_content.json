{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of micro propagation and macro aggregation within production networks, focusing on how firm-level decisions and interactions culminate in aggregate productivity outcomes. By integrating theories of misallocation and comovement, we analyze the mechanisms through which shocks propagate across firms and sectors, influencing overall economic performance. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple industries, we employ network analysis to trace the pathways of shock transmission and assess their impact on productivity. Our findings reveal that the structure of production networks significantly affects the extent and direction of propagation, with implications for policy interventions aimed at mitigating misallocation. This research contributes to the understanding of economic resilience and the role of network architecture in shaping aggregate productivity, offering insights for both academic inquiry and practical economic strategy."}
