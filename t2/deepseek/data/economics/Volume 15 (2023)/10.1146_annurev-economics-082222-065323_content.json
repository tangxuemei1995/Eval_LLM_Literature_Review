{"Abstract": "This study explores the econometric challenges and methodologies associated with analyzing nonlinear budget sets, focusing on the application of the random utility model, budget set regression, bunching, and instrumental variables. Nonlinear budget sets, characterized by kinks and notches, present unique estimation challenges due to the discontinuities and non-convexities they introduce. We delve into how the random utility model can be adapted to account for these complexities, the role of budget set regression in estimating behavioral responses, the phenomenon of bunching at kink points, and the use of instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of consumer behavior in the presence of nonlinear budget constraints."}
