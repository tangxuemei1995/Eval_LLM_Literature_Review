{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of non-CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) aggregators, delving into their theoretical underpinnings and practical implications within economic models. Unlike their CES counterparts, non-CES aggregators accommodate nonhomothetic preferences, allowing for a more nuanced representation of consumer behavior and production processes. We examine the role of constant returns to scale (CRS) production functions in facilitating the aggregation of diverse inputs, highlighting the significance of implicit additivity in ensuring consistent aggregation across different sectors. The analysis further distinguishes between gross substitutes and gross complements, elucidating their impact on market dynamics and resource allocation. Additionally, the paper investigates the categorization of goods into essentials and inessentials, shedding light on how non-CES aggregators can capture the varying degrees of necessity and luxury in consumption patterns. Through this guided tour, we aim to enhance the understanding of non-CES aggregators and their pivotal role in advancing economic theory and empirical research."}
