{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving landscape of collusion regulation, focusing on the challenges posed by the Twombly standard in establishing the burden of proof. It explores the efficacy of safe tests and consent orders as regulatory tools, while also considering the potential role of artificial intelligence in detecting and preventing collusive practices. By analyzing recent legal precedents and technological advancements, the research aims to provide insights into more effective regulatory frameworks that balance the need for robust enforcement with the protection of competitive markets."}
