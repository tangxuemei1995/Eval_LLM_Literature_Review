{"Abstract": "This study explores the pivotal role of parenting in fostering social mobility both within and across generations, addressing the intricate dynamics between skill development, inequality, and human development. Drawing on a comprehensive review of interdisciplinary literature, we examine how parental investment in children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills serves as a critical mechanism for breaking the cycle of poverty and enhancing upward mobility. Our analysis highlights the significance of early childhood education, parental involvement, and the transmission of social capital as key factors that influence children's future socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we investigate the intergenerational effects of parenting practices, demonstrating how they can perpetuate or mitigate social inequalities over time. By synthesizing empirical evidence from economics, sociology, and psychology, this research underscores the importance of targeted interventions that support effective parenting strategies to promote equitable opportunities for all children. The findings advocate for policy measures that address systemic barriers to social mobility, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to human development that leverages the transformative power of parenting in creating a more just and inclusive society."}
