{"Abstract": "The concept of Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) has emerged as a pivotal policy tool in the global effort to mitigate climate change, addressing the critical issue of carbon leakage while promoting fair competition. This paper explores the economic rationale behind implementing BCAs, focusing on their potential to level the playing field for domestic industries subject to stringent carbon regulations. By imposing carbon tariffs on imports from countries with laxer environmental standards, BCAs aim to prevent the relocation of carbon-intensive industries and ensure that global climate efforts are not undermined. Furthermore, the study examines the impacts of BCAs on international trade, environmental outcomes, and the formation of climate clubs, which are coalitions of countries committed to ambitious climate action. Through a comprehensive analysis, this research highlights the complexities and challenges of designing effective BCAs, offering insights into their role in achieving global carbon neutrality."}
