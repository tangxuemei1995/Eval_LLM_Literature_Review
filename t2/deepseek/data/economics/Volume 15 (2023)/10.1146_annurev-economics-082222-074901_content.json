{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate relationship between global risk shocks, non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI), and emerging market vulnerabilities, with a particular focus on the role of investment funds and international capital flows. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple emerging markets, we analyze how benchmark investing and tail risk considerations influence the transmission of global risk shocks through NBFI channels. Our findings reveal that NBFI significantly amplifies the impact of global risk shocks on emerging markets, primarily through heightened volatility in international capital flows. Moreover, the prevalence of benchmark investing exacerbates these vulnerabilities by encouraging herding behavior and reducing market liquidity during periods of stress. The study underscores the importance of monitoring NBFI activities and implementing robust regulatory frameworks to mitigate the adverse effects of global risk shocks on emerging market economies. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on financial stability and the systemic risks posed by the growing prominence of NBFI in the global financial system."}
