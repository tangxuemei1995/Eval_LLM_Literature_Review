{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate economics of digital privacy, focusing on the interplay between data externalities and privacy regulation. In the digital age, personal data has become a valuable commodity, often traded without the explicit consent of individuals, leading to significant privacy concerns. The research delves into how data externalities—unintended consequences of data collection and use—affect both individuals and the broader economy. It examines the role of privacy regulation in mitigating these externalities, balancing the need for innovation and economic growth with the imperative to protect individual privacy rights. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and case studies, the paper proposes a framework for understanding the economic implications of digital privacy and suggests policy recommendations to enhance privacy protections while fostering a thriving digital economy. The findings underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to privacy regulation that considers the complex dynamics of data externalities."}
