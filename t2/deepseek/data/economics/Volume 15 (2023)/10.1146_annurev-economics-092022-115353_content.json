{"Abstract": "This study investigates gender differences in negotiation outcomes and the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing these disparities. Despite advancements in gender equality, women often negotiate less favorable terms than men, particularly in salary discussions. This research explores the impact of various strategies, including negotiation training, the implementation of 'ban the salary history' (BAN) policies, and increased transparency in compensation practices. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, we assess how these interventions influence negotiation behaviors and outcomes for men and women. Our findings suggest that targeted negotiation training and policies like BAN can empower women to negotiate more assertively, thereby narrowing the gender gap. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varies across contexts, highlighting the need for tailored approaches. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on gender equality in the workplace by providing actionable insights for organizations seeking to foster more equitable negotiation environments."}
