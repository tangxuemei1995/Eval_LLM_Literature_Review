{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate dynamics of US-China trade relations, focusing on the implications of trade policy shifts and the so-called 'China shock' on US manufacturing employment. Utilizing a framework of dynamic spatial economics and input-output linkages, we analyze how trade wars and policy adjustments have influenced the spatial distribution of economic activities and employment patterns across the United States. Our findings suggest that the 'China shock' has had a profound impact on local labor markets, with significant variations across regions due to differences in industrial composition and trade exposure. The analysis underscores the importance of considering spatial and sectoral interdependencies in understanding the broader economic consequences of US-China trade tensions. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on trade policy by providing a nuanced perspective on the complex interplay between global trade dynamics and local economic outcomes."}
