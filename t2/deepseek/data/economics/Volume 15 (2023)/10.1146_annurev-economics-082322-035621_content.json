{"Abstract": "In the rapidly evolving labor market of the twenty-first century, traditional unemployment insurance systems are increasingly complemented by innovative labor market insurance policies such as partial unemployment insurance, wage insurance, and short-time work schemes. These policies aim to provide more nuanced support to workers facing underemployment, wage losses, or temporary reductions in working hours, thereby enhancing labor market flexibility and security. This study examines the design, implementation, and effectiveness of these policies across different countries, highlighting their role in mitigating the adverse effects of economic downturns, technological disruptions, and global competition. By analyzing empirical data and case studies, the research identifies best practices and challenges in adapting these insurance mechanisms to the needs of a diverse workforce. The findings contribute to the ongoing debate on how to balance the protection of workers' incomes with the promotion of labor market dynamism, offering insights for policymakers aiming to foster resilient and inclusive labor markets in the face of twenty-first-century challenges."}
