{"Abstract": "This study explores cognitive limitations through the lens of behavioral theory and cognitive economics, focusing on failures of contingent thinking. Utilizing controlled experiments, we investigate deviations from the sure-thing principle, a cornerstone of rational decision-making. Our findings reveal significant cognitive biases that impede contingent reasoning, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying decision-making processes. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of cognitive limitations and their implications for economic models and behavioral predictions."}
