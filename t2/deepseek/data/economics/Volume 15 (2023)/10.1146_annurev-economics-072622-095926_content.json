{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of China's financial system and its pivotal role in the nation's economic development. Since the inception of economic reforms in the late 1970s, China's financial markets have undergone significant transformation, evolving from a state-dominated system to a more market-oriented framework. The study highlights the dual role of the government in both promoting and regulating financial markets, with a particular focus on the concept of implicit guarantees and their impact on market stability and risk. Furthermore, the paper explores the rapid rise of fintech in China, examining how technological innovations are reshaping financial services and contributing to financial inclusion. Through a detailed analysis of policy developments, market trends, and empirical data, this review sheds light on the challenges and opportunities facing China's financial system as it continues to support the country's economic growth and global integration."}
