{"Abstract": "Tropical deforestation remains a critical issue at the intersection of environmental economics and climate change, with profound implications for biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, and natural resource management. This study explores the economic drivers and consequences of land use change in tropical regions, employing remote sensing data to quantify deforestation rates and their environmental impacts. By analyzing the externalities associated with deforestation, including carbon emissions and the depletion of common-property resources, the research highlights the complex interplay between economic incentives and environmental outcomes. Furthermore, the political economy of deforestation is examined, revealing how governance structures and policy frameworks influence land use decisions. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated approaches to mitigate deforestation, balancing economic development with environmental sustainability. This research contributes to the broader discourse on environmental economics by providing empirical evidence on the costs of tropical deforestation and offering insights into effective strategies for sustainable natural resource management."}
