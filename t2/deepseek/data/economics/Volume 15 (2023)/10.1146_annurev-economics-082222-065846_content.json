{"Abstract": "This paper explores the application of local projections in the field of applied economics, offering a robust alternative to traditional vector autoregressions (VARs) for estimating impulse responses. By leveraging panel data, we demonstrate how local projections can provide more flexible and interpretable estimates of dynamic causal effects, particularly in settings where the assumptions of VARs may not hold. Our analysis highlights the method's alignment with the potential outcomes framework, facilitating a clearer understanding of causal relationships in economic data. Through a series of empirical examples, we illustrate the advantages of local projections in capturing the heterogeneity and nonlinearities often present in economic phenomena, thereby contributing to more accurate and policy-relevant economic analysis."}
