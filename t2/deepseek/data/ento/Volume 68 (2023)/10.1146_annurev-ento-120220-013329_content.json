{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of phoresy among mites (Acari), a phenomenon often oversimplified as mere hitchhiking. By examining the spectrum of interactions ranging from mutualistic symbiosis to parasitism, we uncover the complexity of these conditional relationships. Our research highlights how mites utilize phoresy not only for dispersal but also as a strategic mechanism to access new resources and habitats, thereby influencing their evolutionary trajectories. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key factors that determine the nature of host relationships, including host specificity, environmental conditions, and the life history traits of both mites and their carriers. This investigation sheds light on the multifaceted roles of phoresy in mite ecology and evolution, challenging the traditional view of phoresy as a simple free ride and emphasizing its significance in shaping biodiversity and ecological networks."}
