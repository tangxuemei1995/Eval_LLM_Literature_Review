{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of dehydration in terrestrial arthropods, focusing on their physiological and behavioral adaptations to maintain water balance amidst changing climatic conditions. By examining the mechanisms of humidity sensing and the subsequent responses to drought, we shed light on how these organisms detect and react to water scarcity. Furthermore, the research delves into the impact of dehydration on trophic interactions, revealing how water stress influences predator-prey relationships and community structure. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by terrestrial arthropods in the context of global climate change, offering insights into their resilience and the potential ecological consequences of altered water availability."}
