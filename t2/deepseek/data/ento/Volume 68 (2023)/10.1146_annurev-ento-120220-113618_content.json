{"Abstract": "The postcopulatory behavior of Tephritid flies, a subject of significant interest in both evolutionary biology and pest management, involves complex interactions between sperm and accessory gland peptides (AGPs) that influence female remating behavior and reproductive success. This study explores the role of AGPs in modulating female receptivity post-copulation, with a focus on how these peptides affect the likelihood of remating and the competitive success of sperm from different males. Additionally, the implications of these findings for the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), a method used in controlling Tephritid fly populations, are examined. By understanding the mechanisms underlying postcopulatory behavior, this research aims to enhance the effectiveness of SIT by potentially manipulating AGP production or function to reduce female remating rates, thereby increasing the impact of sterile males in suppressing pest populations."}
