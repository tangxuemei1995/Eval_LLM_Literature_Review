{"Abstract": "The chemical ecology of floral resources plays a pivotal role in conservation biological control, influencing the interactions between parasitoids, hyperparasitoids, and their food sources within agroecosystems. This study explores the intricate relationships mediated by floral volatiles and nectar-associated microorganisms, which significantly affect the foraging behavior and reproductive success of parasitoids. By analyzing the chemical cues emitted by flowers and the microbial communities inhabiting nectar, we aim to elucidate how these factors can be manipulated to enhance the efficacy of parasitoids in controlling pest populations. Our findings suggest that specific floral volatiles can attract beneficial parasitoids while deterring hyperparasitoids, thereby optimizing the biological control process. Additionally, the role of nectar-associated microorganisms in altering the nutritional quality of floral resources and their impact on parasitoid fitness is examined. This research underscores the importance of integrating chemical ecological principles into the design of agroecosystems to promote sustainable pest management strategies."}
