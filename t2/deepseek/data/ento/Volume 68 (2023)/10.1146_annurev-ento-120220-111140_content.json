{"Abstract": "The Spotted Lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), an invasive planthopper native to Asia, has emerged as a significant pest in the United States, posing threats to agriculture, particularly viticulture, and natural ecosystems. This study reviews the biology, invasion potential, and management strategies of L. delicatula, focusing on its host plant preferences and impact on grapevines. The lanternfly's polyphagous nature facilitates its spread across diverse habitats, complicating control efforts. Effective management requires an integrated approach, including biological control, chemical treatments, and cultural practices. Understanding the ecological interactions and life cycle of L. delicatula is crucial for developing sustainable management strategies to mitigate its impact on agriculture and biodiversity in the United States."}
