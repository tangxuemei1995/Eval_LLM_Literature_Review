{"Abstract": "Stingless bees (Apidae: Apinae: Meliponini) represent a diverse group of highly eusocial bees, playing a crucial role in the pollination of tropical ecosystems. This study delves into the ecological aspects of stingless bees, focusing on their unique behaviors, such as bee-keeping practices, honey and pollen collection, and the utilization of resin for nest construction. These bees exhibit complex social structures and are integral to maintaining the biodiversity and productivity of their habitats. By examining their foraging patterns, nesting habits, and interactions with flora, this research sheds light on the ecological significance of stingless bees in tropical regions. The findings underscore the importance of conserving these vital pollinators, highlighting the need for sustainable bee-keeping practices to support both ecological balance and human livelihoods. This study contributes to the broader understanding of stingless bee ecology, offering insights into their role in tropical ecosystems and the challenges they face in a changing environment."}
