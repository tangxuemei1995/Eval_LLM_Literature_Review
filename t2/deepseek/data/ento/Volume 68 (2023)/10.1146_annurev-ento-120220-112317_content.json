{"Abstract": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a crucial model organism in the study of insect immunity and host-pathogen interactions, particularly in its resistance to the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV). This review delves into the mechanisms underlying silkworm resistance to BmNPV, focusing on the identification and characterization of resistant genes, the intricate virus–host interactions, and the genetic analysis of resistance. Recent advancements have highlighted several genes associated with BmNPV resistance, offering insights into the molecular basis of antiviral defense mechanisms in silkworms. The exploration of virus–host interactions has revealed complex signaling pathways and immune responses that are activated upon viral infection, providing a deeper understanding of the silkworm's innate immunity. Furthermore, genetic analysis and gene location studies have mapped resistance loci, facilitating the development of antiviral breeding strategies. These strategies aim to enhance silkworm resistance to BmNPV through selective breeding and genetic engineering, thereby improving silk production and sustainability. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of integrating molecular biology, genetics, and breeding techniques to combat viral pathogens in silkworms, offering valuable implications for pest management and the broader field of insect immunity."}
