{"Abstract": "Forest insect biosecurity is a critical component of global ecosystem management, aimed at preventing the introduction and spread of non-native species that can cause significant ecological and economic damage. This research explores the multifaceted processes involved in forest insect biosecurity, including the identification of invasion pathways, the implementation of phytosanitary measures, and the development of surveillance strategies to detect and monitor potential threats. By analyzing patterns of biological invasions, the study highlights the importance of predictive modeling in assessing the risk of new invasions and the effectiveness of eradication efforts. However, the research also identifies several pitfalls in current biosecurity practices, such as gaps in surveillance coverage, challenges in early detection, and the limitations of eradication programs. Through a comprehensive review of scientific literature and case studies, this paper provides insights into improving forest insect biosecurity measures, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that combine scientific research, policy development, and community engagement to protect forest ecosystems from invasive species."}
