{"Abstract": "This study explores the functional diversity of vibrational signaling systems in insects, a critical yet understudied aspect of biotremology. By examining the evolution and ecological significance of substrate-borne communication, we highlight the complexity of signaling contexts and the adaptive roles these systems play in insect behavior and survival. Our analysis delves into the vibrosensory evolution, revealing how insects have developed sophisticated mechanisms to detect and interpret vibrational signals. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of vibrational signaling with other communication modalities, emphasizing the importance of multimodal signaling in enhancing the efficacy of insect communication networks. The findings underscore the potential of leveraging vibrational communication in pest management strategies, offering novel insights into sustainable agricultural practices. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of insect communication systems and their implications for ecological and agricultural sciences."}
