{"Abstract": "Plant–pollinator networks are critical components of terrestrial ecosystems, facilitating the reproduction of a vast majority of flowering plants and the sustenance of pollinator populations. This study investigates the resilience of these mutualistic networks in the face of global environmental change, focusing on their robustness to ecosystem shifts. By synthesizing recent empirical and theoretical research, we explore the structural and functional attributes that confer resilience to plant–pollinator networks, including network architecture, species redundancy, and interaction rewiring. Our analysis reveals that while these networks exhibit a remarkable capacity to withstand perturbations, their resilience is increasingly challenged by anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species. We highlight the importance of conserving diverse pollinator communities and their habitats to maintain the stability and functionality of these networks. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for ecosystem management and conservation strategies, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that address the multifaceted drivers of global environmental change to safeguard plant–pollinator interactions and the ecosystem services they underpin."}
