{"Abstract": "The Paleozoic era marks a pivotal period in the evolutionary history of Hexapoda, particularly Insecta, showcasing an extraordinary diversification in form, function, and developmental strategies. This study delves into the diversity and morphological adaptations of Paleozoic insects, emphasizing their evolutionary significance and the deep divergences that have shaped their lineage. By examining fossil records and employing comparative functional morphology, we uncover the intricate relationship between form and ecological adaptation. Furthermore, the investigation into postembryonic development, including metamorphosis, provides insights into the evolutionary innovations that facilitated the colonization of diverse habitats. Our findings highlight the complexity of Paleozoic insect evolution, offering a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving their diversification and the foundational role these ancient organisms played in shaping terrestrial ecosystems. This research underscores the importance of integrating paleontological and developmental perspectives to unravel the evolutionary history of Insecta."}
