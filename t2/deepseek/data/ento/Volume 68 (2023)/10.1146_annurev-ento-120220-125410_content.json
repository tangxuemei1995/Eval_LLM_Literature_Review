{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of remote sensing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imagery, for the early detection and monitoring of wood-boring pests in forest ecosystems. By leveraging high-resolution imagery and spectral analysis, we aim to identify infestation signs before they become visible to the naked eye, enabling timely and targeted pest management strategies. The research highlights the potential of integrating UAV and satellite data for comprehensive forest health surveillance, offering a scalable and efficient approach to mitigate the impact of wood-boring pests on forest biodiversity and productivity."}
