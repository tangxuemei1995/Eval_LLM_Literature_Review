{"Abstract": "Spodoptera frugiperda, commonly known as the fall armyworm, is a highly invasive pest species that poses significant threats to global agriculture. This study delves into the ecology and evolutionary biology of S. frugiperda, with a focus on its taxonomy, population genetics, host plant use, strain hybridization, mate attraction mechanisms, and insecticide resistance. By synthesizing recent research findings, we explore the genetic diversity and adaptability of S. frugiperda populations, highlighting the role of strain hybridization in its rapid spread and adaptation to new environments. The review also examines the pest's host plant preferences and the implications for crop damage and management strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms of mate attraction and their impact on population dynamics, as well as the emerging challenges of insecticide resistance. This comprehensive analysis aims to inform the development of effective management options to mitigate the impact of S. frugiperda on agriculture worldwide."}
