{"Abstract": "The global resurgence of bed bugs, primarily Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, has prompted a reevaluation of historical and contemporary control strategies. This review synthesizes the evolution of management practices, from traditional methods to modern integrated pest management (IPM) approaches. Chemical control, once the cornerstone of bed bug eradication, faces challenges due to resistance development, necessitating the exploration of alternative strategies. Nonchemical control methods, including heat treatment, vacuuming, and the use of mattress encasements, have gained prominence for their efficacy and reduced environmental impact. The integration of chemical and nonchemical tactics within an IPM framework offers a sustainable solution to bed bug infestations. This paper highlights the importance of understanding bed bug biology and behavior in developing effective control measures, emphasizing the need for ongoing research to address the challenges posed by these resilient pests in a global context."}
