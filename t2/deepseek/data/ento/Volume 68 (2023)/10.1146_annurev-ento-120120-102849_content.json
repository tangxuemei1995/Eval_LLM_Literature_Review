{"Abstract": "The study of arthropod and pathogen damage on fossil and modern plants offers a unique window into the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. This research explores the intricate relationships between plants and their herbivores through the lens of damage types and functional feeding groups, spanning significant geological periods including the Cretaceous–Paleogene ecologic crisis, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, and the Permian–Triassic ecologic crisis. By analyzing continental scale patterns of plant-arthropod interactions, we aim to uncover the evolutionary dynamics that have shaped terrestrial ecosystems over millions of years. Our findings highlight the resilience and adaptability of plant-herbivore interactions through periods of dramatic environmental change, providing insights into the mechanisms of ecological recovery and the evolutionary pressures that drive the diversification of herbivory strategies. This study not only contributes to our understanding of the historical context of plant-arthropod interactions but also offers a framework for predicting future ecological responses to ongoing global changes."}
