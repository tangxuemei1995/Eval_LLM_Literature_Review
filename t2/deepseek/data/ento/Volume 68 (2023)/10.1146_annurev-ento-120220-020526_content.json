{"Abstract": "Aphids, as one of the most significant agricultural pests, exhibit remarkable host plant specificity, a phenomenon that is crucial for their survival and proliferation. This specificity is governed by complex molecular mechanisms involving plantâ€“insect interactions, where aphids have evolved specific adaptations to overcome plant defenses. Recent studies have highlighted the role of effectors, small proteins secreted by aphids, in manipulating host plant physiology to the aphids' advantage. Furthermore, genetic variation among aphid populations contributes to the diversity in host plant preferences and resistance mechanisms. Epigenetic regulation has also emerged as a key player in modulating gene expression in response to environmental cues, thereby influencing host plant specificity. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular underpinnings of host plant specificity in aphids, emphasizing the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors, and discusses the implications for pest management strategies."}
