{"Abstract": "The adoption of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops in the United States has revolutionized the management of insect pests, particularly targeting Coleoptera and Lepidoptera species in major crops such as corn and cotton. Bt crops express insecticidal proteins that are toxic to specific pests, reducing the reliance on chemical insecticides and contributing to environmental sustainability. However, the widespread use of Bt crops has raised concerns about the development of insect resistance, prompting the implementation of insect resistance management (IRM) strategies. Among these, the refuge strategy, which involves planting non-Bt crops alongside Bt crops, has been pivotal in delaying resistance by maintaining a population of susceptible insects. This review examines the effectiveness of Bt crops in pest management, the challenges posed by insect resistance, and the role of IRM strategies, particularly the refuge strategy, in sustaining the efficacy of Bt technology in the United States."}
