{"Abstract": "Diapause, a period of suspended development, is a critical adaptation in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, enabling organisms to survive adverse environmental conditions. This study explores the mechanisms and ecological significance of diapause, with a focus on bet-hedging strategies, circannual rhythms, and phenotypic plasticity. Bet-hedging allows populations to spread risk across multiple generations, ensuring survival in unpredictable climates. Circannual rhythms, internal biological clocks, synchronize diapause timing with seasonal changes, optimizing resource utilization and reproductive success. Phenotypic plasticity enables individuals to adjust diapause duration in response to environmental cues, enhancing resilience to climate warming. Prolonged diapause, observed in semivoltine species, extends survival over multiple years, providing a buffer against extreme climatic events. Seasonal adaptation through diapause is increasingly crucial as climate warming disrupts traditional environmental patterns. This research synthesizes findings from diverse taxa to elucidate the evolutionary and ecological implications of diapause in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles. Understanding these adaptive strategies is essential for predicting species responses to ongoing climate change and informing conservation efforts."}
