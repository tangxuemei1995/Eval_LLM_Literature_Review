{"Abstract": "Fatty acids (FAs) play a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism, signaling, and structural integrity. This review delves into the mechanisms of FA transport and signaling, highlighting the critical roles of CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 receptors in mediating these processes. CD36 facilitates the uptake of long-chain FAs, while FFAR1 and FFAR4, as G protein-coupled receptors, are instrumental in FA signaling pathways that regulate insulin secretion, inflammation, and energy homeostasis. The involvement of caveolin in organizing FA transport and signaling complexes within membrane microdomains is also discussed, underscoring its importance in cellular FA dynamics. Furthermore, the review explores the physiological implications of FA signaling, including its impact on Î²-oxidation and tissue repair processes. Understanding these mechanisms offers insights into the therapeutic potential of targeting FA transport and signaling pathways in metabolic diseases and tissue regeneration."}
