{"Abstract": "Flexible decision-making is a cornerstone of adaptive behavior, allowing organisms to adjust their actions in response to changing environmental demands. This study delves into the neural mechanisms underpinning the flexibility of perceptual decisions, focusing on the interplay between sensory-guided behavior and task-switching capabilities. By examining stimulus-action mapping and decision policy adjustments within distributed neural networks, we uncover the dynamic processes that facilitate rapid and efficient transitions between different decision-making strategies. Our findings highlight the critical role of neural plasticity and the reconfiguration of functional connectivity in enabling the brain to navigate complex and unpredictable environments. Through a synthesis of empirical data and computational modeling, we propose a framework that elucidates how distributed neural networks support flexible decision-making, offering insights into the neural basis of cognitive adaptability and its implications for understanding behavioral flexibility in both health and disease."}
