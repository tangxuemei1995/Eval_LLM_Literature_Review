{"Abstract": "Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) is a complex biological process where endothelial cells lose their specific markers and acquire a mesenchymal or stem cell-like phenotype. This transition plays a pivotal role in both physiological processes, such as embryonic development and wound healing, and pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, and cancer. In the context of cardiovascular health, EndMT contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and cardiac fibrosis by promoting vascular remodeling and tissue fibrosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT, including the roles of TGF-Î², Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways, offers potential therapeutic targets for mitigating its adverse effects in disease states. This review highlights the dual role of EndMT in health and disease, emphasizing the need for further research to unravel its complexities and therapeutic implications in cardiovascular and other diseases."}
