{"Abstract": "Pericytes, multifunctional mural cells embedded within the microvascular walls of the brain and heart, play a pivotal role in the regulation of blood flow, ensuring the metabolic demands of these organs are met. This review delves into the intricate mechanisms by which pericytes contribute to neurovascular coupling in the brain and electro-metabolic signaling in the heart, highlighting their involvement in the modulation of ion channels, particularly calcium and potassium channels. Through these pathways, pericytes influence vascular tone and blood flow, thereby supporting the high metabolic rates required for neuronal activity and cardiac function. The emerging understanding of pericyte function underscores their potential as therapeutic targets in conditions characterized by impaired blood flow regulation, such as ischemic stroke and heart failure. This synthesis of current knowledge aims to bridge gaps in our understanding of pericyte biology and its implications for cardiovascular and neurological health."}
