{"Abstract": "The advent of molecular tools has revolutionized our comprehension of breathing control, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms that govern respiratory rhythm and pattern generation. Central to this understanding is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), identified as the kernel for inspiratory rhythm generation. Molecular studies have elucidated the role of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in processing lung sensory information, integrating it with the Hering-Breuer reflex to modulate breathing. Furthermore, the serotonergic system has been implicated in the modulation of respiratory output, highlighting its significance in the neural control of breathing. This review synthesizes recent molecular insights into the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying breathing control, emphasizing the contributions of the preBötC, NTS, and serotonin. By leveraging molecular tools, researchers have unveiled novel aspects of respiratory physiology, offering potential therapeutic targets for respiratory disorders. This transformative knowledge underscores the complexity of breathing control and the pivotal role of molecular approaches in advancing our understanding of respiratory neurobiology."}
