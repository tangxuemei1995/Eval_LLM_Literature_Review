{"Abstract": "Myostatin, also known as Growth Differentiation Factor 8 (GDF-8), is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and plays a critical role as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. This protein acts as a chalone, a tissue-specific inhibitor of cell proliferation, to control muscle tissue size by limiting the number and size of muscle fibers. Myostatin is synthesized as a latent precursor that requires activation to exert its inhibitory effects on muscle growth. Its mechanism involves binding to activin type II receptors, initiating a signaling cascade that ultimately suppresses muscle differentiation and growth. Understanding the regulation and function of myostatin has significant implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at muscle wasting diseases and enhancing muscle mass in both clinical and agricultural contexts."}
