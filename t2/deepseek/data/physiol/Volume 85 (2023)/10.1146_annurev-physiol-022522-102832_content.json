{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between iron metabolism and the pathophysiology of diabetes, focusing on the roles of hepcidin, hemochromatosis, and adipocytes in insulin regulation. Iron, an essential nutrient, plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, yet its dysregulation is implicated in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis, is influenced by iron stores and inflammation, affecting iron absorption and distribution. Hemochromatosis, a condition of iron overload, is closely associated with an increased risk of diabetes, highlighting the detrimental effects of excessive iron on pancreatic Î²-cell function and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, adipocytes, beyond their role in energy storage, are emerging as key players in iron metabolism, with implications for systemic insulin resistance. This review synthesizes current evidence on the mechanisms by which iron imbalance contributes to diabetes, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for managing diabetes through the modulation of iron homeostasis."}
