{"Abstract": "The mammalian liver exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity and maintains homeostasis through complex mechanisms involving cellular heterogeneity and plasticity. Liver zonation, a key feature of hepatic architecture, underpins the organ's functional diversity and response to injury. This review explores the multifaceted aspects of liver homeostasis and regeneration, focusing on the roles of distinct cell populations within the liver's lobular structure. We delve into the cellular and molecular pathways that facilitate recovery from acute and chronic injuries, highlighting the adaptive plasticity of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver repair and mitigate the progression of liver diseases. The interplay between liver zonation, cellular heterogeneity, and regenerative mechanisms offers insights into the liver's resilience and potential targets for intervention in pathological conditions."}
