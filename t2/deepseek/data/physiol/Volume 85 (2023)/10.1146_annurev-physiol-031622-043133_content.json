{"Abstract": "Insulin clearance plays a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, with its efficiency varying significantly across different physiological and pathological states. This review explores the mechanisms of insulin action and clearance, highlighting the impact of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia on these processes. Special attention is given to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition increasingly recognized for its association with altered insulin dynamics. Furthermore, the influence of age and ethnicity on insulin clearance is examined, shedding light on the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. By synthesizing current evidence, this paper aims to enhance understanding of insulin clearance in health and disease, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for conditions characterized by insulin dysregulation."}
