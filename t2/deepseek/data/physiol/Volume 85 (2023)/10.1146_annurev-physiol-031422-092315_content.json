{"Abstract": "Cough, a common symptom of respiratory tract infections, serves as a critical defense mechanism but also facilitates disease transmission. This study explores the infectious and inflammatory pathways leading to cough, focusing on the role of sensory neurons in the respiratory tract. By analyzing the interaction between pathogens, immune responses, and neural pathways, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cough reflex sensitization. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between microbial invasion, inflammatory mediators, and neuronal activation, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for cough management and prevention of disease spread."}
