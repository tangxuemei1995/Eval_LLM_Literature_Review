{"Abstract": "Proprioception, the sense of body position and movement, is fundamental for motor control and coordination. Recent advancements in genetic and bionic strategies have opened new avenues for understanding and enhancing proprioceptive functions. This research explores the roles of proprioceptive sensory neurons, muscle spindles, and Golgi tendon organs in kinesthetic perception, alongside the neural pathways involving the dorsal column nuclei and somatosensory cortex. Emerging technologies, such as neural machine interfaces, offer promising solutions for restoring proprioception in prosthetic limbs, potentially revolutionizing rehabilitation for individuals with sensory deficits. This study highlights the integration of genetic insights and bionic innovations in advancing proprioceptive research and its applications in neuroprosthetics."}
