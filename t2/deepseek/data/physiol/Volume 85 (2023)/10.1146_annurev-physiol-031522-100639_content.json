{"Abstract": "Protein trafficking and quality control are fundamental processes that ensure the proper localization and function of proteins within cells, particularly in the kidney where these mechanisms are crucial for maintaining homeostasis. This review delves into the intricate pathways of protein trafficking, focusing on the roles of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and vesicular transport systems in the kidney and other tissues. We explore the significance of transmembrane emp24 domain-containing proteins (TMEDs) in cargo selection and vesicle formation, highlighting their impact on the secretory pathway and lysosomal function. Additionally, we examine the proteome's role in quality control, emphasizing how dysregulation of these processes can lead to kidney disease. By integrating recent findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying protein trafficking and quality control, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for kidney-related pathologies and beyond."}
