{"Abstract": "Polycystin channel complexes play a pivotal role in cellular signaling and are integral to the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. These complexes, comprising polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), function as non-selective cation channels, with PC2 also belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. The gating mechanism of these channels, influenced by mechanical and chemical stimuli, is crucial for their function in primary cilia, sensory organelles implicated in a variety of ciliopathies. This review explores the structural and functional aspects of polycystin channel complexes, their role in ADPKD, and the broader implications for understanding ciliopathies. Insights into the molecular mechanisms governing these channels may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting ADPKD and related disorders."}
