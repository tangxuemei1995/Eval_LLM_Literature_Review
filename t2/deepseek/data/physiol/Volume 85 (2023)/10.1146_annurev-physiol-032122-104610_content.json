{"Abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) form specialized junctions known as membrane contact sites (MCSs), which play a pivotal role in cellular signaling and homeostasis. This study investigates the role of ER-PM junctions in depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling within excitable cells, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles, as well as neurons. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that these junctions serve as critical hubs for the rapid transmission of Ca2+ signals following membrane depolarization. The spatial organization of ion channels and second messengers at ER-PM junctions facilitates efficient Ca2+ influx and subsequent intracellular Ca2+ release, highlighting their importance in the regulation of muscle contraction and neuronal activity. Our findings underscore the significance of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying Ca2+ signaling and its implications for cellular function and disease."}
