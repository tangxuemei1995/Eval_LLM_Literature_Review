{"Abstract": "Salt taste, a fundamental aspect of gustation, plays a critical role in dietary sodium intake and overall health. This review delves into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the perception of saltiness, focusing on the role of sodium ions (Na+) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in taste transduction. ENaC, expressed in taste receptor cells, is pivotal for the detection of low concentrations of salt, contributing to the appetitive valence of salt taste. Additionally, the involvement of other ion channels and receptors in sensing higher salt concentrations is explored, highlighting the complexity of salt taste perception. The interplay between these molecular entities not only elucidates the physiological basis of salt taste but also sheds light on its hedonic value, offering insights into the neural encoding of taste valence. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for addressing health issues related to excessive salt consumption and for developing strategies to modulate salt taste perception."}
