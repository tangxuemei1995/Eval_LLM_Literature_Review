{"Abstract": "Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid (TRPV) channels play a pivotal role in sensory physiology, particularly in the perception of pain, temperature, and mechanical stimuli. Despite significant advancements in understanding their structure and function, controversies persist regarding their activation mechanisms, modulation, and physiological roles. This review delves into the molecular physiology of TRPV channels, highlighting the ongoing debates and the challenges that lie ahead. We explore the structural intricacies that govern channel gating and permeability, alongside the functional implications in health and disease. The integration of structural biology, electrophysiology, and pharmacology has begun to unravel the complex behavior of these ion channels, yet many questions remain unanswered. Future research directions are proposed, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of TRPV channel function and their potential as therapeutic targets in pain management and beyond."}
