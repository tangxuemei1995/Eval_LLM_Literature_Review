{"Abstract": "This study investigates the intricate metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes in brain tissue, focusing on the utilization of glucose, lactate, and oxygen. Neurons and astrocytes exhibit a symbiotic relationship, where astrocytes support neuronal function through the provision of metabolic substrates. We explore the role of glycolysis in astrocytes, which converts glucose into lactate, a crucial energy substrate for neurons under high activity demands. The transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons, known as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS), highlights the compartmentalization of energy metabolism in the brain. Furthermore, we examine the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, which efficiently utilizes oxygen to generate ATP, ensuring sustained neuronal activity. Our findings underscore the importance of metabolic recruitment in maintaining brain energy homeostasis, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in supporting cognitive functions and neuronal survival."}
