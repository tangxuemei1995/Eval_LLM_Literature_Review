{"Abstract": "Over the past four decades, meta-analysis has significantly advanced our understanding of youth psychotherapy, offering a comprehensive lens through which the efficacy of various interventions can be evaluated. By aggregating findings from numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated that evidence-based psychotherapies yield substantial treatment benefits for young individuals, with effect sizes indicating moderate to large improvements in psychological outcomes. This synthesis of research has not only highlighted the most effective therapeutic approaches but also identified critical moderators of treatment success, such as age, diagnosis, and intervention duration. Furthermore, the evolution of meta-analytic techniques has enhanced the precision of effect size estimates, enabling a more nuanced understanding of treatment mechanisms and the conditions under which psychotherapy is most beneficial. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of meta-analytic findings into clinical practice and policy-making holds the promise of optimizing mental health care for youth, underscoring the indispensable role of research synthesis in advancing the science of psychotherapy."}
