{"Abstract": "This review critically examines the literature on risk and resilience among children with incarcerated parents, employing an intersectional lens to explore the multifaceted challenges and protective factors that influence their development. While existing research predominantly highlights the adverse outcomes associated with parental incarceration, such as increased risk of behavioral problems, academic difficulties, and emotional distress, this paper argues for a more nuanced understanding that also considers the potential for resilience. By integrating perspectives from social justice, the review emphasizes the importance of addressing systemic inequalities and advocating for interventions that support the well-being of these children. The paper calls for a reframing of the discourse from a deficit-focused approach to one that recognizes the strengths and agency of children with incarcerated parents, suggesting that future research and policy should aim to empower these children and their families through culturally responsive and community-based support systems."}
