{"Abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) have emerged as pivotal tools in capturing real-time data across various research domains. Despite their growing popularity, these methodologies are not without challenges. This study critically evaluates pressing issues inherent in EMA/ESM, focusing on content validity, the establishment of a gold standard, training requirements, missingness, reliability, selection bias, and the development of robust comparison standards. Content validity is scrutinized to ensure that the measures accurately reflect the constructs of interest. The quest for a gold standard in EMA/ESM is explored, highlighting the need for consensus on methodological best practices. Training emerges as a crucial factor in enhancing data quality and participant compliance. Missingness and reliability are examined to address data integrity concerns, while selection bias is analyzed to understand its impact on study generalizability. Finally, the importance of establishing comparison standards is emphasized to facilitate meaningful interpretation of EMA/ESM findings. This comprehensive review aims to guide researchers in navigating the complexities of EMA/ESM, thereby advancing the field's methodological rigor and the validity of its findings."}
