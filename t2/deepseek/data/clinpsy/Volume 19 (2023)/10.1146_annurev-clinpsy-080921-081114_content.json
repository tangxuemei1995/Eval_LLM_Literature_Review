{"Abstract": "This study explores the phenomenon of supernatural attributions, where individuals perceive events as being caused by entities such as God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma. Drawing on a comprehensive review of scientific literature, we examine the psychological and cultural factors that influence these attributions, particularly in the context of supernatural and paranormal beliefs. The research highlights the role of anomalous experiences and spiritual struggles in shaping individuals' interpretations of events, suggesting a complex interplay between cognitive processes, emotional states, and cultural narratives. Furthermore, the study investigates how religion and spiritual experiences contribute to the development and reinforcement of supernatural attributions, offering insights into the diverse ways people make sense of the world around them. By integrating findings from psychology, sociology, and religious studies, this research aims to deepen our understanding of the human tendency to attribute causality to supernatural forces."}
