{"Abstract": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) explores the intricate interactions between psychological processes, the nervous system, and the immune system, offering insights into how immune-to-brain communication influences behavior and mental health. This field has illuminated the role of inflammation in mediating the effects of psychosocial stress on the development of psychiatric conditions, such as depression, through mechanisms like sickness behavior. Translational science approaches within PNI have been pivotal in bridging the gap between basic research and clinical applications, providing a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of mental health disorders. This introduction to PNI underscores the importance of immune-to-brain communication in clinical psychology, highlighting the potential for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the immune system to mitigate the impact of stress and inflammation on mental health."}
