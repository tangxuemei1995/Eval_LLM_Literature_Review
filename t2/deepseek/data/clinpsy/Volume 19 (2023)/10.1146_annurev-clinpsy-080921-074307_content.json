{"Abstract": "Tic disorders, including Tourette disorder, present significant challenges to affected individuals, impacting their daily functioning and quality of life. This study explores the efficacy of behavioral interventions, such as habit reversal training (HRT) and Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT), in managing tic symptoms across different age groups. By systematically reviewing recent literature, we assess the effectiveness of these therapies in reducing tic severity and improving psychological well-being. Our findings highlight the role of exposure and response prevention techniques as integral components of behavioral therapy, offering a non-pharmacological approach to tic management. The results underscore the importance of tailored behavioral strategies in enhancing treatment outcomes for children and adults with tic disorders, advocating for their inclusion in standard care protocols."}
