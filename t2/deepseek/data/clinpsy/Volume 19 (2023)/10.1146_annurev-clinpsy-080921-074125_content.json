{"Abstract": "Eating disorders, traditionally perceived as predominantly affecting females, are increasingly recognized in boys and men, necessitating a deeper understanding of their epidemiology, intervention strategies, and outcomes in this population. This study aims to explore the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical presentations of eating disorders among males, highlighting the unique challenges they face in diagnosis and treatment. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, we identify gaps in current research and propose targeted interventions tailored to the needs of boys and men. The findings underscore the importance of gender-sensitive approaches in both clinical practice and public health initiatives to improve detection rates, treatment efficacy, and long-term recovery outcomes. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence advocating for a more inclusive understanding of eating disorders, emphasizing the need for further studies to address the disparities in care and support for affected males."}
