{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted resilience factors that contribute to the mental health of African American youth amidst the challenges posed by racism. Focusing on the roles of racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity, spirituality, family dynamics, and parenting practices, the research aims to uncover how these elements collectively foster resilience and psychological well-being. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical studies, the paper highlights the protective mechanisms that mitigate the adverse effects of racial discrimination and stress. The findings underscore the importance of culturally informed interventions and support systems that leverage these resilience factors to promote mental health and resilience among African American youth. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between racial, ethnic, and cultural factors in shaping mental health outcomes."}
