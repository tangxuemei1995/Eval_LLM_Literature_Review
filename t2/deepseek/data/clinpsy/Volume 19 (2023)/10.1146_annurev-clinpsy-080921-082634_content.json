{"Abstract": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act (GLSMA) represents a pivotal initiative in the United States aimed at reducing suicide rates among youth through comprehensive prevention strategies. This paper provides a detailed description and critical review of the GLSMA, focusing on its implementation, effectiveness, and impact on suicide prevention efforts. By analyzing existing evaluations and studies, we explore the multifaceted approaches employed by the GLSMA, including community-based interventions, educational programs, and the enhancement of mental health services. The review highlights the significance of the GLSMA in fostering collaboration among stakeholders, increasing awareness, and providing resources for suicide prevention. Despite its achievements, challenges such as variability in program implementation and the need for long-term outcome assessments are discussed. This paper underscores the importance of continued evaluation and adaptation of the GLSMA to ensure its efficacy in addressing the complex issue of youth suicide."}
