{"Abstract": "This study critically examines the practice of partialing in psychological research, a method often employed to refine scores and inferences about measures of psychological constructs by statistically controlling for extraneous variables. Despite its widespread use, the implications of partialing on construct validity and the interpretation of residualized variables remain contentious. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis, we explore the conditions under which partialing may lead to questionable measurement practices, particularly focusing on the distortion of semipartial effects and the potential misrepresentation of the underlying constructs. Our findings suggest that while partialing can be a useful tool for isolating specific aspects of psychological constructs, its application requires careful consideration of the theoretical and methodological assumptions involved. We conclude with recommendations for researchers to enhance the rigor and transparency of their measurement practices, thereby improving the validity and reliability of inferences drawn from psychological assessments."}
