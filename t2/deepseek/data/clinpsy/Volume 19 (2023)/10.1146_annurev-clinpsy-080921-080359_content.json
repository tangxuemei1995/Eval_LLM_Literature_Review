{"Abstract": "This review explores the prevalence, mechanisms, and treatment options for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among refugees, a population significantly affected by traumatic experiences due to war, persecution, and displacement. Refugees are at a heightened risk for developing PTSD, with studies indicating varying prevalence rates influenced by factors such as pre-migration trauma, post-migration stressors, and social support. The mechanisms underlying PTSD in refugees involve complex interactions between neurobiological, psychological, and social factors, including altered stress responses and memory processing. Effective treatment strategies are crucial and include trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and pharmacological interventions, alongside culturally sensitive approaches to address the unique needs of this population. This review highlights the importance of understanding the multifaceted nature of PTSD in refugees to develop targeted interventions that can improve mental health outcomes and facilitate integration into host societies."}
