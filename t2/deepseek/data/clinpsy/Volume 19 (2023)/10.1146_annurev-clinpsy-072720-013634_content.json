{"Abstract": "Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a pervasive issue with profound implications for child development, extending beyond the immediate physical harm to encompass long-term psychological and emotional consequences. This study explores the developmental trajectories of children exposed to IPV, focusing on the interplay between prenatal stress, disrupted attachment processes, and subsequent developmental outcomes. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key mechanisms through which IPV impacts children, including altered stress response systems, impaired cognitive and emotional regulation, and compromised social functioning. The findings underscore the critical role of early intervention and support systems in mitigating the adverse effects of IPV on child development. By elucidating the complex pathways linking IPV exposure to developmental outcomes, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by children in violent households and informs the development of targeted interventions aimed at fostering resilience and promoting healthy development."}
