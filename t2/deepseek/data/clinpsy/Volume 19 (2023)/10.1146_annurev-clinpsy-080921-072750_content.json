{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of culturally responsive practices into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address mental health disparities among ethnically diverse populations. Recognizing the limitations of traditional CBT in fully addressing the unique cultural contexts of minority groups, this research emphasizes the importance of cultural adaptation and clinician training in enhancing therapeutic outcomes. By reviewing existing literature and case studies, we identify key strategies for incorporating cultural competence into CBT, including the adaptation of therapeutic techniques to align with clients' cultural values and beliefs. The findings suggest that culturally responsive CBT not only improves engagement and treatment adherence but also contributes to reducing mental health disparities. This paper advocates for the systematic inclusion of cultural competence training in clinician education programs, aiming to equip mental health professionals with the skills necessary to deliver effective, culturally adapted CBT interventions. The implications for practice, policy, and future research are discussed, highlighting the potential of culturally responsive CBT to transform mental health care for ethnically diverse populations."}
