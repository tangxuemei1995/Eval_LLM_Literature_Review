{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of evidence-based practices (EBP) with alter-Native psy-ence in community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Recognizing the unique cultural, historical, and social contexts of AI/AN communities, the research emphasizes the necessity of incorporating Indigenized therapies that resonate with traditional healing practices and worldviews. The paper critically examines the challenges posed by postcolonial anomie, a condition characterized by the loss of cultural identity and social cohesion, and its impact on mental health outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the study identifies key strategies for reconciling EBP with alter-Native psy-ence, including community-based participatory research, culturally adapted interventions, and the empowerment of local healers. The findings underscore the importance of a hybrid approach that respects indigenous knowledge systems while leveraging the strengths of conventional mental health practices. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on culturally competent mental health care and offers practical recommendations for policymakers and practitioners working with AI/AN populations."}
