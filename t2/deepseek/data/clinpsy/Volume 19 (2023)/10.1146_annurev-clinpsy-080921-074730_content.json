{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between racism, social determinants, and the onset of psychosis, with a particular focus on racial discrimination and its impact on psychotic experiences. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine how structural racism and neighborhood factors contribute to the development of early psychosis among marginalized racial groups. The analysis highlights the role of social determinants, such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and community safety, in exacerbating the risk of psychosis in environments marked by racial inequality. By synthesizing findings from epidemiological studies, psychological research, and sociological investigations, this paper aims to shed light on the pathways through which racism influences mental health outcomes. The findings underscore the urgent need for interventions that address the root causes of racial disparities in psychosis, advocating for policies that promote equity and social justice to mitigate the impact of racism on mental health."}
