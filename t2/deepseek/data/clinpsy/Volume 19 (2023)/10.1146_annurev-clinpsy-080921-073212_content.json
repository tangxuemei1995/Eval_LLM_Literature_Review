{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of machine learning and digital phenotyping in the measurement of psychological health. By leveraging digital biomarkers, we aim to enhance the precision and scalability of psychometric assessments. Our research focuses on the development of algorithms capable of interpreting complex behavioral data collected through digital devices, offering a novel approach to mental health monitoring. The findings suggest that machine learning models can effectively identify patterns indicative of psychological well-being, paving the way for more personalized and timely interventions in mental health care."}
