{"Abstract": "This study investigates the inferential and behavioral implications of measurement error in agricultural data, focusing on the consequences of bias, misperception, and misreporting. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from agricultural surveys, we employ advanced statistical techniques to quantify the extent of measurement error and its impact on statistical inference. Our findings reveal that measurement error significantly distorts parameter estimates, leading to biased conclusions and potentially misguided policy decisions. Furthermore, we explore the behavioral underpinnings of misreporting, identifying key factors that contribute to data inaccuracies. The results underscore the importance of addressing measurement error in agricultural research to enhance the reliability of statistical analyses and inform more effective agricultural policies."}
