{"Abstract": "The global rise in chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has prompted governments to implement sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes as a strategy to curb obesity and promote healthy diets. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these taxes in meeting their policy goals, focusing on their impact on consumption patterns, health outcomes, and revenue generation. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies from various countries, we assess whether SSB taxes have successfully reduced the intake of sugary drinks and contributed to a decline in obesity rates. Additionally, we explore the potential for enhancing the design and implementation of these taxes to maximize their public health benefits. Our findings suggest that while SSB taxes have shown promise in reducing consumption and generating revenue, their impact on obesity and overall dietary quality remains limited. We propose several recommendations for policymakers to refine SSB tax policies, including adjusting tax rates, targeting a broader range of sugary products, and reinvesting tax revenues into health promotion programs. This research underscores the importance of continuous evaluation and adaptation of SSB taxes to ensure they effectively contribute to the global fight against NCDs."}
