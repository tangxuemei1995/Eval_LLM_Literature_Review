{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics in understanding environmental values and their impact on individual decision-making regarding common pool resources. By integrating insights from both disciplines, we aim to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie the valuation of environmental goods and the propensity for sustainable behavior. Our analysis highlights the role of heuristics, biases, and emotional responses in shaping environmental decisions, offering a nuanced perspective on the challenges of managing common pool resources. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for the design of effective environmental policies, emphasizing the importance of aligning policy interventions with the psychological and neural underpinnings of human behavior. This research contributes to the growing body of literature seeking to bridge the gap between economic theory and neuroscientific evidence, providing a comprehensive framework for addressing environmental issues through informed policy-making."}
