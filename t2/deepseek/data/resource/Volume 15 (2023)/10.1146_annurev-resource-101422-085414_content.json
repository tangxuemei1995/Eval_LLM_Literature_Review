{"Abstract": "The Economics of Ecosystem Restoration explores the intricate balance between ecological recovery and economic viability, emphasizing the critical role of biodiversity in sustaining ecosystem services. This study delves into the socioeconomic impacts of environmental policies aimed at ecosystem restoration, highlighting the dual benefits of ecological health and economic prosperity. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we assess the cost-effectiveness of restoration projects, the valuation of ecosystem services, and the integration of biodiversity considerations into economic planning. Our findings suggest that investing in ecosystem restoration not only mitigates environmental degradation but also fosters sustainable development by enhancing resilience, supporting livelihoods, and promoting equitable growth. This research underscores the necessity of aligning environmental policies with economic incentives to achieve long-term conservation goals, offering a roadmap for policymakers to navigate the complex interplay between ecological preservation and economic advancement."}
