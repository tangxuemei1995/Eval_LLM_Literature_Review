{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), focusing on its role in stabilizing carbon prices and reducing surplus allowances. By analyzing the interaction between the MSR and overlapping climate policies, the study highlights the challenges and effectiveness of the MSR in achieving long-term emission reductions. The findings suggest that while the MSR enhances market stability, its impact is contingent on the broader policy landscape and market conditions."}
