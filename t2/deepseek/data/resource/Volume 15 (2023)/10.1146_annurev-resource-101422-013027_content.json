{"Abstract": "Food fraud, encompassing practices such as adulteration and mislabeling, poses significant risks to public health and undermines consumer trust. This study explores the underlying causes of food fraud, including asymmetric information and the credence goods nature of food products, which complicate consumer verification of quality. The consequences of such fraudulent activities are far-reaching, affecting not only consumer health but also the economic stability of the food industry. To combat these issues, the paper evaluates deterrence strategies, emphasizing the role of certification schemes and the challenges of costly and imperfect enforcement mechanisms in ensuring food authenticity and safety."}
