{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, focusing on the role of competition analysis and antitrust regulations in fostering or hindering sustainability agreements among firms. By integrating insights from industrial organization theory, we examine how firm green preferences and cooperative strategies can align with competitive practices to promote environmental objectives. The research highlights the potential for antitrust frameworks to adapt to the challenges of sustainability, suggesting that regulatory bodies could play a pivotal role in encouraging eco-friendly innovations while maintaining market competition. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing debate on how competition policy can be effectively designed to support environmental goals without compromising the principles of fair competition."}
