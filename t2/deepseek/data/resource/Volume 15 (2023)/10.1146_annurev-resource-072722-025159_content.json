{"Abstract": "Food losses within agrifood systems represent a critical challenge to global food security, economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. This study synthesizes current knowledge on food losses, focusing on their measurement, determinants, and potential interventions across various stages of the value chain. By reviewing a comprehensive body of literature, we identify key factors contributing to food losses, including technological, managerial, and socio-economic determinants. The analysis highlights the complexity of agrifood systems and the multifaceted nature of food loss, which varies significantly across different regions, commodities, and stages of the supply chain. Furthermore, the paper explores a range of interventions aimed at reducing food losses, from technological innovations to policy measures and behavioral changes. The findings underscore the importance of a holistic approach that considers the entire agrifood system to effectively address food losses. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable food systems by providing insights into the mechanisms of food loss and offering recommendations for stakeholders across the value chain."}
