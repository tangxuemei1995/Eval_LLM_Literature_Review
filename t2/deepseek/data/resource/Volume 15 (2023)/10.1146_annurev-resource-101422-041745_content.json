{"Abstract": "This study explores the pivotal role of mathematical programming in addressing complex challenges within agricultural systems, natural resource management, and climate change analysis. By leveraging advanced optimization techniques, the research highlights how mathematical models facilitate the assessment of climate change effects, enabling the identification of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. The paper reviews various applications of mathematical programming, from optimizing resource allocation to minimizing environmental impacts, and discusses its potential in enhancing decision-making processes under uncertainty. Through a comprehensive analysis of case studies, the study underscores the importance of integrating mathematical programming with interdisciplinary approaches to tackle the multifaceted issues posed by climate change. The findings advocate for the continued development and application of mathematical programming tools to support sustainable agricultural practices, conserve natural resources, and mitigate climate change impacts, thereby contributing to the resilience of ecosystems and communities."}
