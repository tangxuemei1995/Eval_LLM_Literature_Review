{"Abstract": "The field of international agricultural research for development is undergoing a significant transformation, marked by the adoption of more rigorous standards of evidence for impact assessment. This 'Rigor Revolution' emphasizes the importance of robust measurement techniques and the establishment of causality to accurately evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of interventions. Traditional approaches, often criticized for their reliance on anecdotal evidence and lack of methodological rigor, are being replaced by innovative methodologies that leverage advanced statistical tools and experimental designs. These new standards aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how agricultural research contributes to development outcomes, ensuring that investments are directed towards interventions with proven impact. By focusing on causality and scale, this revolution seeks to enhance the credibility and utility of impact assessments, ultimately supporting more informed decision-making and policy formulation in the realm of agricultural research for development."}
