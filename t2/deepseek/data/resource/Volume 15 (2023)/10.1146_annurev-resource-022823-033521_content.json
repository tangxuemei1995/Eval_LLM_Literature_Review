{"Abstract": "This study investigates the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy across developed and developing countries, utilizing a comprehensive global dataset. Obesity, a significant public health concern, has been linked to various chronic diseases and increased mortality rates. However, its impact on life expectancy varies considerably between nations, influenced by factors such as healthcare quality, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle choices. Our analysis reveals that in developed countries, where healthcare systems are more robust, the negative impact of obesity on life expectancy is somewhat mitigated. Conversely, in developing countries, the lack of access to adequate healthcare and preventive measures exacerbates the detrimental effects of obesity, leading to a more pronounced reduction in life expectancy. Furthermore, we explore the role of public health interventions and policies in addressing obesity and its consequences. The findings underscore the need for tailored strategies that consider the unique challenges and resources of each country to effectively combat the global obesity epidemic and its impact on life expectancy."}
