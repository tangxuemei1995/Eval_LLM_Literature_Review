{"Abstract": "This study investigates the extent to which different estimation methods yield implausible differences in the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. By comparing the MIMIC (Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes) estimation approaches, micro survey approaches, survey techniques, and the consumption-income gap approach, we aim to identify the methodological disparities that lead to significant variations in shadow economy estimates. Preliminary findings suggest that each method carries inherent biases and assumptions that can substantially affect the outcomes. The MIMIC approach, for instance, often results in higher estimates due to its reliance on macroeconomic indicators, whereas micro survey approaches tend to provide lower estimates, reflecting the challenges in capturing informal activities. This research underscores the importance of methodological transparency and the need for a consensus on a standardized approach to accurately measure the shadow economy."}
