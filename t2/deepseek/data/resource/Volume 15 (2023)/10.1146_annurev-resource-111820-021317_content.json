{"Abstract": "Nutrient pollution from agricultural practices, particularly the overapplication of fertilizers, represents a significant environmental and economic challenge. This nonpoint-source pollution contributes to the degradation of water quality, leading to eutrophication, loss of biodiversity, and adverse effects on human health. The economic implications of these environmental externalities are profound, encompassing costs related to water treatment, loss of recreational value, and impacts on fisheries and tourism. This study explores the economic dimensions of nutrient pollution from agriculture, focusing on the inefficiencies in fertilizer use and the external costs imposed on society. By analyzing the relationship between agricultural practices and nutrient runoff, the research aims to identify policy interventions that can mitigate these externalities while maintaining agricultural productivity. The findings suggest that a combination of regulatory measures, economic incentives, and technological innovations can significantly reduce nutrient pollution. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of integrated approaches that consider the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of agricultural nutrient management. The insights provided by this research contribute to the ongoing debate on sustainable agriculture and the need for policies that balance economic growth with environmental protection."}
