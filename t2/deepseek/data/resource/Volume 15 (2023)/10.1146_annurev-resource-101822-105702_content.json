{"Abstract": "Climate change poses significant risks to the global financial sector, with potential impacts ranging from increased frequency and severity of natural disasters to long-term shifts in climate patterns. This review synthesizes current research on how these risks affect banking, insurance, and financial markets. It highlights the direct and indirect consequences of climate-related events on financial institutions, including asset devaluation, increased insurance claims, and disrupted financial services. The paper also explores the role of financial markets in pricing climate risks and the challenges in accurately assessing and managing these risks. Furthermore, it discusses the adaptive strategies employed by the financial sector to mitigate the impacts of climate change, such as the development of green financial products and the integration of climate risk into investment decisions. The review concludes with a call for enhanced collaboration among financial institutions, policymakers, and researchers to develop robust frameworks for climate risk assessment and management, ensuring the resilience of the financial sector in the face of ongoing climate change."}
