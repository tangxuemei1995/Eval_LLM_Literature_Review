{"Abstract": "This paper delves into the life and contributions of Sir Partha Dasgupta, a distinguished economist whose work has significantly influenced the fields of environmental and development economics. Through an autobiographical lens, it explores Dasgupta's journey from his early academic pursuits to his groundbreaking research on sustainability and the economics of natural resources. The study highlights his innovative approaches to integrating environmental considerations into economic models, thereby addressing the critical challenges of sustainable development. Dasgupta's seminal works, including his critiques of traditional economic measures and his advocacy for incorporating ecological assets into national accounts, are examined for their impact on policy and academic discourse. The paper also reflects on his role in shaping global conversations on environmental sustainability and economic development, underscoring his legacy as a pioneer in bridging the gap between economics and environmental science. This exploration not only celebrates Dasgupta's achievements but also emphasizes the ongoing relevance of his work in tackling contemporary environmental and developmental issues."}
