{"Abstract": "The management of crop residues presents a critical intersection of agricultural productivity, environmental sustainability, and economic viability, particularly for smallholder farmers. This study explores the economics of crop residue management, focusing on the trade-offs between residue burning and alternative practices such as incorporation into the soil or use as bioenergy feedstock. Residue burning, while cost-effective, contributes significantly to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change and health issues. Conversely, adopting sustainable residue management technologies can mitigate environmental effects and potentially offer economic benefits through improved soil health and energy production. However, the adoption of such technologies by smallholder farmers is hindered by financial constraints, lack of access to technology, and insufficient knowledge. This research highlights the need for policy interventions and support mechanisms to promote sustainable crop residue management practices, balancing economic incentives with environmental and health considerations."}
