{"Abstract": "The transition towards sustainable agriculture and food systems is imperative to address the pressing challenges of food security, environmental degradation, and climate change. This paper explores the role of agroecology as a transformative approach that integrates ecological principles into agricultural practices, fostering resilience, biodiversity, and sustainability. By examining case studies from diverse geographical contexts, we highlight how local agroecological solutions can be scaled up to achieve broader impacts. The study emphasizes the importance of multiactor approaches, involving farmers, policymakers, researchers, and consumers, in co-creating knowledge and strategies for sustainable agricultural transformation. Furthermore, we analyze the interplay between agricultural and food policies in facilitating the adoption of agroecological practices at multiple scales. The paper also investigates the potential of emerging technologies to enhance agroecological systems, ensuring their efficiency and scalability. Our findings suggest that agroecology, supported by coherent policies and innovative technologies, can significantly contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture and food systems, offering a pathway towards ecological balance and food sovereignty."}
