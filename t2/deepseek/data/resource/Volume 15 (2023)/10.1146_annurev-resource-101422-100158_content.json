{"Abstract": "This study explores the nexus between social protection programs and rural transformation in Africa, with a particular focus on the role of cash transfers in fostering sustainable development. By employing rigorous impact evaluation methodologies, the research assesses how these financial interventions influence income levels, agricultural production, and broader socio-economic dynamics within rural communities. The analysis draws on a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data to elucidate the mechanisms through which social protection initiatives can catalyze rural transformation. Findings suggest that cash transfers not only provide immediate financial relief but also enhance agricultural productivity by enabling investments in inputs and technology. Moreover, these programs contribute to long-term rural development by improving access to education and healthcare, thereby fostering human capital accumulation. The study underscores the importance of integrating social protection strategies with agricultural policies to maximize their transformative potential. Ultimately, this research provides valuable insights for policymakers aiming to design and implement effective social protection programs that drive rural transformation in Africa."}
