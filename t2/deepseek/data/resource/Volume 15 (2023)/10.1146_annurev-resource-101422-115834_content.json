{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between environmental regulation and labor demand, synthesizing evidence from a comprehensive review of empirical studies. While concerns persist that stringent environmental policies may lead to job losses, the analysis reveals a more nuanced picture. Findings indicate that the impact of environmental regulation on employment varies across industries, with some sectors experiencing job creation due to innovation and the development of green technologies. Conversely, industries reliant on traditional, polluting processes may face reduced labor demand. The evidence suggests that the net effect on employment is contingent upon the adaptability of the workforce and the broader economic context. This research underscores the importance of designing environmental policies that balance ecological objectives with labor market considerations."}
