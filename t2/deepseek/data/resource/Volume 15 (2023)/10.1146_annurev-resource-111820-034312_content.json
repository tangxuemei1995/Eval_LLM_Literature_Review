{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of research and development (R&D) lags in the agricultural and industrial sectors, focusing on the interplay between knowledge stocks and flows, adoption rates, and technological change. By comparing the R&D lag models specific to each sector, we aim to uncover the underlying factors that contribute to the slower pace of innovation adoption in agriculture compared to industry. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical data, we investigate how differences in R&D investment, knowledge dissemination, and sector-specific challenges influence the rate of technological advancement. Our findings suggest that the agricultural sector experiences longer R&D lags due to its unique biological constraints, regulatory hurdles, and the complexity of integrating new technologies into diverse ecosystems. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving innovation in both sectors and offers insights for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to accelerate technological adoption and enhance productivity."}
