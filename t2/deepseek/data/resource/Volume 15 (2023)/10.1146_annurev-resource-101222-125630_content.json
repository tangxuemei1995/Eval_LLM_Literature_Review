{"Abstract": "This study investigates the multifaceted effects of temperature on labor productivity, encompassing both physical and mental dimensions. By analyzing data across various sectors, we explore how temperature fluctuations influence work efficiency and the capacity for cognitive tasks. Special attention is given to the role of adaptation mechanisms and early-life exposure to temperature extremes in shaping productivity outcomes. Additionally, the research highlights the distributional effects of temperature on labor productivity, revealing disparities across different demographic and socioeconomic groups. Our findings underscore the importance of considering environmental factors in labor policy and workplace design to mitigate productivity losses."}
