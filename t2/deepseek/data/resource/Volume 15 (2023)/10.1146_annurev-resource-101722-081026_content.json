{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in causal inference methodologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the complex relationship between air pollution and health outcomes. Leveraging natural experiments and sophisticated epidemiological designs, researchers are now better equipped to isolate the causal effects of air pollutants on various health conditions. This progress is further supported by integrated science assessments that synthesize evidence across disciplines, offering a more comprehensive view of the health impacts of air pollution. These developments not only improve the accuracy of risk assessments but also inform policy decisions aimed at mitigating the adverse health effects of air pollution. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of causal inference techniques with environmental health research promises to uncover new insights into the mechanisms linking air quality to public health."}
