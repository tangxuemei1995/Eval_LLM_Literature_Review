{"Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach for change-point analysis in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data settings. Traditional methods often struggle with the complexities inherent in network data and the absence of Euclidean structure. Our proposed methodology leverages graph-based tests and scan statistics to effectively identify change-points without relying on parametric assumptions, making it particularly suitable for nonparametric analysis. By focusing on tail probabilities, we enhance the sensitivity of our tests to subtle changes in data distributions, even in the presence of high-dimensionality. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world applications, showcasing its robustness and versatility across various data types. This research contributes to the growing body of work on graph-based statistical methods, offering a powerful tool for change-point detection in complex data environments."}
