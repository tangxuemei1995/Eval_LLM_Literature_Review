{"Abstract": "Model-based clustering represents a sophisticated approach to identifying groups within data by assuming that the data is generated from a mixture of probability distributions. This method leverages mixture models to capture the underlying structure of the data, offering a probabilistic framework for clustering that can accommodate various data types and complexities. The expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly employed to estimate the parameters of these models, iteratively refining the cluster assignments and model parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. Bayesian inference further enhances this approach by incorporating prior knowledge, allowing for more robust and flexible clustering solutions. The development of specialized software has significantly facilitated the application of model-based clustering across diverse fields, enabling researchers to efficiently analyze complex datasets. This paper reviews the theoretical foundations, methodological advancements, and practical implementations of model-based clustering, highlighting its advantages and challenges in contemporary data analysis."}
