{"Abstract": "Generative models have emerged as a pivotal tool across various disciplines, offering a robust framework for simulation, decision-making, and experimental design. This paper explores the interdisciplinary applications of generative models, emphasizing their role in agent-based models, particle filters, and the critical evaluation of model performance through goodness-of-fit measures. By synthesizing insights from diverse fields, we highlight the versatility of generative models in capturing complex systems and phenomena. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in model evaluation, advocating for a nuanced approach to assessing model accuracy and reliability. This interdisciplinary perspective not only enriches our understanding of generative models but also paves the way for innovative applications in science and engineering, underscoring the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in advancing model-based research."}
