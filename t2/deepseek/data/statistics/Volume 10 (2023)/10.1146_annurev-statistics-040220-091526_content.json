{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of innovation diffusion processes, exploring the pivotal roles of competition, critical diffusion thresholds, and structured interventions in shaping the adoption trajectories of new technologies or ideas. By integrating advanced nonlinear regression techniques with established innovation diffusion models, we aim to enhance the predictive accuracy of diffusion patterns across diverse contexts. Special attention is given to the influence of word-of-mouth mechanisms and competitive landscapes on the rate and extent of innovation adoption. Our findings underscore the importance of tailoring intervention strategies to leverage critical diffusion points, thereby optimizing the diffusion process. This research contributes to the theoretical understanding of innovation diffusion and offers practical insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to facilitate the widespread adoption of beneficial innovations."}
