{"Abstract": "This study delves into the realm of second-generation functional data, exploring its multifaceted dimensions through advanced analytical frameworks. By leveraging functional principal component analysis (FPCA), we dissect the intricate structures inherent in spatial functional data, longitudinal functional data, functional time series, and multivariate functional data. Our approach facilitates a deeper understanding of the dynamic patterns and relationships within these complex datasets, enabling more precise modeling and prediction capabilities. The research highlights the significance of FPCA in reducing dimensionality while preserving essential information, thus offering a robust foundation for analyzing functional data across various domains. Through comprehensive case studies, we demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our methodologies in real-world scenarios, paving the way for innovative solutions to contemporary challenges in functional data analysis. This work contributes to the expanding body of knowledge on second-generation functional data, offering insights and tools that enhance the interpretability and utility of functional datasets in scientific research and practical applications."}
