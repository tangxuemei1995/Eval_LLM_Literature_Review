{"Abstract": "This paper explores the advancements and applications of simulation-based Bayesian analysis, a cornerstone in modern statistical inference. Focusing on Bayesian computation, we delve into the methodologies of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), alongside their implementation in statistical software such as BUGS, Stan, and JAGS. The discussion extends to Gibbs sampling and graphical models, highlighting their role in simplifying complex Bayesian analyses. Additionally, we introduce Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) as an emerging tool for efficient Bayesian computation. Through a comprehensive review, this study aims to provide insights into the selection and application of these techniques, offering a guide for researchers in navigating the landscape of Bayesian inference tools and methodologies."}
