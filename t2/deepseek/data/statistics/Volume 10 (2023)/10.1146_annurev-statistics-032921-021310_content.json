{"Abstract": "This review explores recent advancements in shared frailty methods for analyzing complex survival data, addressing challenges such as clustered data, recurrent events, and competing risks. We delve into the application of accelerated failure time models and Cox regression within the shared frailty framework, highlighting their adaptability to various data structures. Additionally, the integration of machine learning techniques, including regression trees and random survival forests, is examined for their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and model flexibility in survival analysis. The paper synthesizes current methodologies, offering insights into their strengths and limitations, and discusses future directions for research in this evolving field. This comprehensive overview aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate models for complex survival data analysis."}
