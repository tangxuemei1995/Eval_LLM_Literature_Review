{"Abstract": "High-dimensional survival analysis has emerged as a pivotal area in precision medicine and data science, addressing the challenge of analyzing datasets where the number of predictors vastly exceeds the number of observations. This paper reviews cutting-edge methodologies and applications in the field, focusing on feature screening techniques that efficiently identify relevant predictors from a vast pool, and machine learning approaches, including artificial neural networks, that model complex relationships between predictors and survival outcomes. We also delve into the role of statistical inference in validating these models, ensuring their reliability and interpretability in clinical and research settings. Through a comprehensive examination of recent advancements, this study highlights the transformative potential of high-dimensional survival analysis in enhancing predictive accuracy and personalizing treatment strategies, thereby contributing significantly to the evolution of precision medicine."}
