{"Abstract": "The detection of exoplanets through radial velocity (RV) measurements is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, yet it is fraught with challenges due to the presence of correlated noise, uneven sampling, and model misspecification. This study explores advanced statistical methods tailored for the analysis of multivariate time series data in the context of exoplanet detection. We focus on the development and comparison of models that account for the complex noise structures inherent in RV datasets, including the effects of stellar activity and instrumental artifacts. By employing a rigorous model comparison framework, we aim to enhance the reliability of exoplanet detection and characterization. Our approach addresses the critical issue of model misspecification, ensuring that the statistical models used are robust against the diverse sources of noise and variability in RV measurements. This research contributes to the refinement of statistical tools for exoplanet discovery, paving the way for more accurate and comprehensive studies of planetary systems beyond our own."}
