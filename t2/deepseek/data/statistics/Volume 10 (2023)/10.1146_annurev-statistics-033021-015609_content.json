{"Abstract": "The development of sustainable statistical capacity in Africa is pivotal for informed decision-making and policy formulation across various sectors. This paper focuses on the role of biostatistics in enhancing this capacity, emphasizing the importance of education, human capital development, and research. Through a detailed examination of Southâ€“North collaboration, we explore how consulting and partnerships between African institutions and their counterparts in the Global North can foster a robust statistical infrastructure. The study highlights the challenges and opportunities in building statistical expertise, particularly in biostatistics, and proposes a framework for sustainable capacity-building. This framework integrates educational programs, research initiatives, and professional development to create a self-sustaining ecosystem of statistical expertise. By leveraging international collaboration and focusing on local needs, the paper argues for a tailored approach that respects the unique contexts of African countries. The findings underscore the critical role of biostatistics in addressing public health challenges and contributing to the broader agenda of statistical capacity-building in Africa."}
