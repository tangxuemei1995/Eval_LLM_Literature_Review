{"Abstract": "In the era of open science, the role of statistics in enhancing data reusability and research transparency has become increasingly pivotal. This study explores how statistical methodologies contribute to the improvement of data quality, thereby facilitating data sharing and reuse across various scientific disciplines. By employing rigorous statistical analysis, researchers can ensure the reproducibility and replicability of their findings, which are fundamental to the advancement of knowledge. The paper delves into the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of statistical practices in the management of research data, highlighting the importance of adopting standardized protocols for data documentation and analysis. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this research underscores the critical need for statistical expertise in promoting open science initiatives, ultimately leading to more transparent, reliable, and accessible scientific research."}
