{"Abstract": "This paper explores the formulation and application of three-decision methods in the context of statistical and significance tests, offering a nuanced approach to decision theory. By integrating considerations of power, multiple testing, and sensitivity analysis, the study presents a comprehensive framework that enhances the interpretability and utility of statistical findings. The three-decision method, which includes options to accept, reject, or remain undecided about a hypothesis, provides a more flexible and sensible approach to hypothesis testing compared to traditional binary decision models. This approach is particularly beneficial in complex research scenarios where the implications of Type I and Type II errors are significant. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper demonstrates how three-decision methods can improve the robustness and reliability of statistical conclusions, thereby contributing to more informed and nuanced scientific decision-making."}
