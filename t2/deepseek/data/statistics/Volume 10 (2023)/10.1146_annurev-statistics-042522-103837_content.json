{"Abstract": "This review delves into the critical concepts of generalizability and transportability within the realm of causal inference, emphasizing their pivotal roles in enhancing external validity across diverse populations and settings. Generalizability refers to the extent to which findings from a study can be applied to broader populations, while transportability focuses on the ability to apply causal effects estimated in one population to another, potentially different, population. The paper systematically explores the challenges posed by treatment effect heterogeneity, a key factor that complicates the extrapolation of causal effects. By synthesizing recent advancements in statistical methodologies and theoretical frameworks, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate or hinder the generalization and transportation of causal inferences. Furthermore, it discusses practical strategies for researchers to assess and improve the external validity of their findings, thereby contributing to more robust and applicable causal evidence in various scientific domains."}
