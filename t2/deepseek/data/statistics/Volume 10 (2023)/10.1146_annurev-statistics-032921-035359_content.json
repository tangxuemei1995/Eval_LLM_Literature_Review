{"Abstract": "The utilization of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials has become a pivotal strategy for accelerating the development of new therapies, especially in scenarios where direct measurement of clinical outcomes is challenging due to time constraints or ethical considerations. This research delves into the intricate relationship between surrogate markers and clinical endpoints, employing causal inference frameworks to evaluate the validity and reliability of surrogate endpoints. By scrutinizing the Prentice criteria, which serve as a foundational benchmark for surrogate validation, the study explores the nuances of causal effectiveness and causal association in the context of surrogate endpoints. Furthermore, it addresses the surrogate paradox, a phenomenon where a treatment shows a positive effect on the surrogate marker but a negative or null effect on the clinical outcome, through the lens of principal stratification. This comprehensive analysis aims to enhance the understanding of surrogate endpoints, offering insights into their appropriate application and interpretation in clinical trials to ensure the advancement of patient-centered therapeutic strategies."}
