{"Abstract": "In the era of big data, the balance between privacy and utility in statistical data has become a paramount concern. This paper delves into the intricate dance of Statistical Data Privacy, exploring the methodologies of Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) and Formal Privacy, with a particular focus on Differential Privacy. We examine the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of these approaches, highlighting their strengths and limitations in safeguarding individual privacy while maintaining the utility of data for analysis and inference. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key challenges in achieving an optimal trade-off between privacy and utility, including the risk of inference attacks and the complexity of implementing privacy-preserving mechanisms in diverse data environments. Our findings underscore the importance of continued innovation in privacy-preserving technologies and the need for a nuanced understanding of privacy risks in the context of evolving data landscapes."}
