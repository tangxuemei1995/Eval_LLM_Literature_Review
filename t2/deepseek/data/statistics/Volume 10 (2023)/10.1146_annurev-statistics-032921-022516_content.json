{"Abstract": "This paper explores advanced models tailored for integer data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models that effectively capture the discrete nature of such data. We delve into the application of thinning operators, a pivotal tool in constructing integer-valued time series, and examine their role in enhancing model flexibility and accuracy. Special attention is given to the Skellam distribution, a discrete probability distribution that is particularly suited for modeling the difference between two independent Poisson-distributed random variables. Through a comprehensive review and analysis, we demonstrate how these models and techniques can be applied to real-world data, offering insights into their practical utility and limitations. Our findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate models for integer data to ensure robust and meaningful statistical analysis."}
