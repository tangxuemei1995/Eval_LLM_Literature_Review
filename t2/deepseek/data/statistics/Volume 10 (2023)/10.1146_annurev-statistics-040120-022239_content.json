{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of the empirical bootstrap method in high-dimensional data analysis, focusing on its integration with the high-dimensional central limit theorem for robust statistical inference. We investigate the efficacy of the multiplier bootstrap in addressing challenges associated with multiple testing and simultaneous inference in high-dimensional settings. Through comprehensive simulations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the method's ability to accurately approximate the distribution of high-dimensional test statistics, offering a powerful tool for researchers dealing with complex datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of bootstrap techniques in enhancing the reliability of high-dimensional statistical analyses."}
