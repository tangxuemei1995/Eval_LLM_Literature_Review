{"Abstract": "The 2020 US Census of Population and Housing introduced significant advancements in confidentiality protection through the implementation of differential privacy, a state-of-the-art statistical disclosure limitation technique. This approach was designed to safeguard individual privacy while ensuring the utility of census data for redistricting and other critical applications. By adding carefully calibrated noise to the data, differential privacy minimizes the risk of re-identification, addressing growing concerns over data privacy in the digital age. This paper examines the implications of these privacy measures on data accuracy, the challenges faced during their implementation, and their impact on the redistricting process and policy-making."}
