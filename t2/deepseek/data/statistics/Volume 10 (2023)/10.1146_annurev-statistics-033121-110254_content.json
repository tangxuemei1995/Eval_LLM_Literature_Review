{"Abstract": "This paper explores approximate methods for Bayesian computation, focusing on techniques such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), Bayesian synthetic likelihood, coresets, divide and conquer strategies, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and subsampling. These methods address the computational challenges posed by complex models and large datasets, offering scalable and efficient alternatives to traditional Bayesian inference. By leveraging approximation and parallelization, the discussed approaches enable the application of Bayesian methods to a broader range of problems, enhancing their practicality in data-intensive research domains."}
