{"Abstract": "The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced by Sir David Cox in 1972, has profoundly influenced the field of survival analysis over the past fifty years. This seminal work provided a flexible framework for analyzing time-to-event data, accommodating time-dependent covariates and enabling the estimation of hazard ratios without specifying the baseline hazard function. The model's reliance on partial likelihood for estimation has facilitated its widespread application across various disciplines, from medical research to engineering. Over the decades, extensions of the Cox model have addressed complex data structures, including competing risks, recurrent events, and scenarios with independent censoring. These advancements have led to the development of intensity and marginal rate models, further broadening the scope of survival analysis. Despite its limitations, such as the proportional hazards assumption, the Cox model remains a cornerstone in statistical methodology for time-to-event analysis. This paper reviews the evolution of the Cox model, highlighting its foundational principles, key extensions, and ongoing challenges. By reflecting on fifty years of progress, we aim to underscore the model's enduring relevance and its pivotal role in advancing our understanding of survival data."}
