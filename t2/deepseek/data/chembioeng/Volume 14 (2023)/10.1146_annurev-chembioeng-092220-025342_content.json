{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques with established physical knowledge to enhance the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures. By leveraging the predictive power of ML and the interpretability of physical models, we propose a hybrid modeling approach that significantly improves accuracy and efficiency in predicting thermodynamic properties. The methodology involves training ML algorithms on extensive datasets derived from experimental measurements and simulations, while incorporating physical constraints to ensure consistency with thermodynamic principles. Our findings demonstrate that this hybrid model outperforms traditional methods in capturing complex interactions within fluid mixtures, offering a promising direction for future research in thermodynamic modeling and its applications in chemical engineering and material science."}
