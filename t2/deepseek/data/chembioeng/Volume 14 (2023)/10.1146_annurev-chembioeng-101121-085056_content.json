{"Abstract": "This study investigates the drying dynamics of colloidal dispersions through sessile drop evaporation, focusing on the formation of evaporative patterns and the underlying evaporation-driven flows. By examining the drying process of complex fluids in various configurations, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the deposition of particles and the emergence of distinct morphological features. Our analysis leverages advanced imaging techniques and computational models to capture the intricate interplay between fluid dynamics, evaporation rates, and colloidal interactions. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of drying in complex configurations, offering insights into the control and manipulation of evaporative patterns for applications in materials science, coatings, and biotechnology."}
