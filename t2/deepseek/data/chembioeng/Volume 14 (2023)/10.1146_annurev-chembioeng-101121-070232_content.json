{"Abstract": "The development of peptide-based vectors represents a cutting-edge biomolecular engineering strategy for gene delivery, addressing the critical need for efficient, targeted, and safe therapeutic delivery systems. This approach leverages intracellular targeting peptides to facilitate the delivery of nucleic acids, including silencing RNA (siRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and oligonucleotides, into specific cellular compartments. The unique properties of these peptides, such as their ability to mediate endosomal escape, enhance the intracellular bioavailability of therapeutic nucleic acids, thereby overcoming one of the major barriers in gene therapy. Recent advancements in peptide engineering have led to the design of vectors with improved specificity, reduced immunogenicity, and enhanced stability, paving the way for their application in clinical trials. This review highlights the potential of peptide-based vectors in revolutionizing gene delivery, offering insights into their mechanism of action, current challenges, and future directions in the field of biomolecular engineering."}
