{"Abstract": "The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) presents a promising pathway for sustainable fuel production and carbon cycle closure. This study delves into the in situ/operando characterization techniques pivotal for unraveling the complex mechanisms underlying CO2 electroreduction. By employing advanced spectroscopic and microscopic methods, we aim to provide mechanistic insights into the roles of catalysts and electrolytes, and the nature of reaction intermediates. These techniques enable real-time observation of the electrochemical processes, offering a deeper understanding of the factors influencing efficiency and selectivity. Our findings underscore the importance of in situ/operando approaches in optimizing CO2 reduction technologies for enhanced performance and sustainability."}
