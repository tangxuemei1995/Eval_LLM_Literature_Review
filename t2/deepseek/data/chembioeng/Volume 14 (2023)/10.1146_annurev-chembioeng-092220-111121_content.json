{"Abstract": "Nonconjugated redox-active polymers (NRAPs) have emerged as a promising class of materials for energy storage applications, owing to their unique electron transfer mechanisms, chemical versatility, and potential for high energy density. Unlike their conjugated counterparts, NRAPs rely on redox-active moieties embedded within a nonconductive polymer backbone, facilitating electron transfer through hopping mechanisms rather than extended Ï€-conjugation. This review delves into the fundamental aspects of electron transfer kinetics in NRAPs, exploring how structural modifications can enhance conductivity and overall electrochemical performance. Additionally, the chemical versatility of NRAPs allows for tailored synthesis to meet specific energy storage requirements, making them adaptable for various battery technologies. By examining recent advancements and challenges, this study highlights the potential of NRAPs in revolutionizing energy storage systems, offering insights into future research directions for optimizing their performance in practical applications."}
