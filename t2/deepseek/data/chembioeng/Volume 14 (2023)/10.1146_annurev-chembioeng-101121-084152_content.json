{"Abstract": "The transition towards a sustainable bioeconomy necessitates the development of lignocellulosic biorefineries capable of converting biomass into valuable biobased polymers, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This paper explores the engineering innovations, challenges, and opportunities associated with the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass within biorefineries. Key focus areas include the optimization of biomass conversion processes, the development of efficient catalytic systems, and the integration of life-cycle management strategies to enhance sustainability. Despite significant advancements, challenges such as feedstock variability, process scalability, and economic viability remain. However, the potential for producing high-performance biobased polymers offers promising opportunities for industrial applications and environmental benefits. This study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary research and policy support in overcoming barriers and realizing the full potential of lignocellulosic biorefineries in contributing to a circular economy."}
