{"Abstract": "In the relentless battle against infectious diseases, antibody engineering emerges as a pivotal strategy to outmaneuver pathogens. This review delves into the cutting-edge advancements in passive immunization, highlighting the role of engineered antibodies in circumventing immune evasion tactics employed by pathogens. We explore the innovative approaches of Fc engineering and the development of bispecific antibodies, which enhance the efficacy of immune responses. Furthermore, the integration of antibodyâ€“drug conjugates represents a promising frontier in targeted therapy, offering a dual mechanism of action against resistant strains. By leveraging these sophisticated technologies, the scientific community is poised to revolutionize the landscape of vaccines and therapeutic interventions, paving the way for more effective and precise combat against infectious diseases."}
