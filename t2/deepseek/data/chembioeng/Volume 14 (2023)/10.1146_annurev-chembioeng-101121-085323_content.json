{"Abstract": "Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) have emerged as a pivotal innovation in green chemistry, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional solvents. This study delves into the fundamental principles underlying DESs, focusing on their unique solidâ€“liquid equilibrium properties and the role of hydrogen bonding in their formation. By examining the mechanisms of melting temperature depression, we elucidate how DESs achieve their liquid state at significantly lower temperatures than their individual components, a phenomenon central to their utility in various applications. Furthermore, this research explores the composition and behavior of eutectic mixtures, providing insights into their design and optimization for specific chemical processes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and experimental data, we aim to demystify DESs, highlighting their potential to revolutionize industries by offering environmentally benign solutions without compromising on efficiency or performance."}
