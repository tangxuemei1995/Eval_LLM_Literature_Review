{"Abstract": "Oxidative stress, induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), poses a significant threat to bacterial survival, necessitating robust stress response mechanisms. Recent advancements have highlighted the role of RNAs as pivotal sensors of oxidative stress in bacteria, offering a novel perspective on bacterial stress response strategies. This review delves into the mechanisms by which RNA molecules detect and respond to oxidative stress, including the direct oxidation of RNA and the subsequent activation of stress response pathways. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these findings for synthetic biology, where engineered RNA sensors could enhance bacterial resilience to oxidative stress. Understanding the interplay between RNA sensors and oxidative stress not only sheds light on bacterial survival mechanisms but also opens new avenues for biotechnological applications."}
