{"Abstract": "The transition of photochemical reactions from laboratory scale to industrial production presents unique challenges and opportunities. This study explores the critical aspects of scaling up photochemical processes, focusing on strategies such as numbering up and sizing up, alongside the integration of flow chemistry. By examining the interplay between photocatalysis efficiency, reactor design, and process optimization, we aim to identify key factors that facilitate the successful scale-up of photochemical reactions. Our findings highlight the importance of innovative reactor technologies and process intensification techniques in achieving scalable, efficient, and sustainable photochemical production methods for industrial applications."}
