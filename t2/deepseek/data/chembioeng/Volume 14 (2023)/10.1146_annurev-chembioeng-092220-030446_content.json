{"Abstract": "The transition towards net-zero emissions is a pivotal challenge for the global energy sector, with international oil companies (IOCs) playing a crucial role in this transformation. This study explores the evolving responsibilities of IOCs in the context of energy carriers, transport, storage, and the inherent energy density of various fuels. As the world seeks sustainable energy solutions, IOCs are uniquely positioned to leverage their expertise in hydrocarbon management to innovate and invest in cleaner energy technologies. The research highlights the potential for IOCs to contribute to the development of low-carbon energy carriers, enhance energy transport and storage systems, and optimize energy density to reduce environmental impact. By analyzing current strategies and future opportunities, this paper underscores the importance of IOCs in achieving net-zero emissions, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts between industry, governments, and communities to ensure a successful energy transition."}
