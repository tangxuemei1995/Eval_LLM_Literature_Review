{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between serialism and opacity within the framework of phonological theory, focusing on the challenges and insights provided by Optimality Theory (OT) and Harmonic Serialism (HS). Opacity, a phenomenon where phonological processes obscure the conditions that trigger them, poses significant problems for parallel models of OT due to their inherent limitations in handling rule ordering. Through a detailed analysis, we argue that HS, with its serial derivation approach, offers a more nuanced mechanism for accounting for opaque interactions by allowing intermediate steps that are not visible in the final output. This study revisits classic cases of opacity, comparing the predictions of parallel OT and HS, and demonstrates how serialism can provide a more coherent account of these phenomena. The findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the nature of phonological computation, highlighting the importance of serial derivations in understanding complex phonological patterns."}
