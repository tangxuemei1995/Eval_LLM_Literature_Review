{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex dynamics of heritage languages, focusing on the processes of language acquisition, loss, and potential reactivation among heritage speakers. Heritage languages, typically acquired in a bilingual context, often undergo attrition when the dominant language of the environment overshadows the native language (L1). This research delves into the factors contributing to L1 attrition and examines the mechanisms through which heritage speakers can regain proficiency in their heritage language through relearning and reactivation strategies. By comparing heritage speakers with native speakers, the study highlights the unique linguistic profiles and challenges faced by bilingual individuals. The findings underscore the importance of supportive linguistic environments and targeted educational interventions in facilitating the maintenance and revival of heritage languages. This investigation contributes to the broader understanding of bilingualism and the resilience of linguistic identity in multilingual contexts."}
