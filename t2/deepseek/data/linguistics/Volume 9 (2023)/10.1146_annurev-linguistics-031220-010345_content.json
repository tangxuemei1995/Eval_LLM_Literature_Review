{"Abstract": "This paper explores effective methodologies for analyzing (psycho)linguistic data, emphasizing the integration of experimental linguistics with robust data analysis techniques. We advocate for the adoption of Bayesian methods as a superior framework for hypothesis testing, particularly through the use of Bayes factors, which provide a nuanced measure of evidence for competing hypotheses. Additionally, we highlight the importance of uncertainty quantification in linguistic research, offering strategies to accurately represent and interpret the variability inherent in experimental data. By comparing traditional frequentist approaches with Bayesian alternatives, we demonstrate how the latter can offer more informative and flexible analyses, especially in the context of complex linguistic phenomena. This work aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate analytical tools that enhance the reliability and interpretability of their findings in the field of (psycho)linguistics."}
