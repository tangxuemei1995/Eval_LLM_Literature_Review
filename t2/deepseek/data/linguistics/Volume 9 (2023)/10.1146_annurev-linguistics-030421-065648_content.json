{"Abstract": "Recent advances in the study of Chinese developmental dyslexia have highlighted the unique linguistic profiles and neurobiological underpinnings associated with this condition. Unlike alphabetic languages, Chinese dyslexia is characterized by difficulties in character recognition and writing, attributed to the language's logographic nature. Neuroimaging studies have identified specific brain abnormalities, particularly in the left middle frontal gyrus, which plays a crucial role in Chinese character processing. Genetic research has begun to uncover susceptibility genes that may contribute to the disorder, offering insights into its heritability and potential biomarkers. Furthermore, investigations into the universality versus specificity of dyslexia across languages have revealed both shared and distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms, underscoring the importance of considering language-specific factors in dyslexia research. These findings not only enhance our understanding of Chinese developmental dyslexia but also contribute to the broader discourse on language processing and learning disabilities."}
