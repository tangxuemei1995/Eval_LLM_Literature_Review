{"Abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenon of hyperraising, a syntactic operation that involves the movement of a constituent out of a finite clause, challenging traditional constraints on movement. By examining a range of crosslinguistic data, we investigate the conditions under which hyperraising occurs, focusing on the interplay between movement constraints and clause structure. We critically assess three major theoretical approaches to hyperraising: defectiveness/nonphase analyses, which argue that certain clauses lack phase properties, thereby permitting movement; deactivation analyses, suggesting that phase properties can be deactivated under specific conditions; and phase-edge analyses, which propose that movement targets the edge of a phase. Our analysis reveals significant crosslinguistic variation in the acceptability and realization of hyperraising, shedding light on the underlying syntactic mechanisms and constraints. This study contributes to the broader understanding of movement operations and phase theory, offering new insights into the syntax of finite clauses and the limits of syntactic movement."}
