{"Abstract": "This study investigates the manifestation and perception of prosodic prominence across a diverse range of languages, focusing on the interplay between pitch accent, lexical stress, and metrical phonology. Utilizing the Rapid Prosody Transcription (RPT) method, we collected and analyzed data from native speakers of languages with varying prosodic typologies. Our findings reveal significant cross-linguistic differences in the realization of prosodic prominence, particularly in the use of pitch accents and the distribution of lexical stress. Languages with fixed stress systems exhibit more predictable patterns of prominence, whereas those with free stress systems show greater variability. Additionally, we observed that the perception of prominence is influenced by both phonetic cues and metrical structure, with listeners relying on a combination of pitch, duration, and intensity to identify prominent syllables. The results contribute to our understanding of prosodic typology and highlight the importance of considering both production and perception in the study of prosodic prominence. This research has implications for theories of metrical phonology and the development of computational models of prosody."}
