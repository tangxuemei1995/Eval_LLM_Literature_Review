{"Abstract": "This study delves into the multifaceted phenomenon of homesign, a gestural communication system developed by deaf individuals without exposure to a conventional sign language. Through the lens of linguistic ethnography and sociolinguistics, we explore the contested issues surrounding homesign, including its classification as a language, its role in the emergence of new sign languages, and its implications for understanding language acquisition and development in deaf communities. By analyzing case studies and existing literature, this research highlights the unique linguistic structures of homesign systems and their significance in the broader context of language evolution. The findings underscore the importance of recognizing homesign as a legitimate form of communication and its potential to inform theories of language emergence and sociolinguistic diversity."}
