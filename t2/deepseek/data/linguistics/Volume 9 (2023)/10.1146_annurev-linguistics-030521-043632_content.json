{"Abstract": "This study explores the complexities of verb classification across diverse languages, leveraging multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance the understanding and categorization of verbs. By integrating knowledge augmentation strategies into neural models, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of verb classification tasks in a multilingual context. The research employs a novel approach that combines advanced NLP algorithms with crowdsourced linguistic data, enabling the capture of nuanced verb semantics and usage patterns across languages. Our methodology not only addresses the challenges posed by linguistic diversity but also contributes to the development of more robust and versatile NLP systems. The findings highlight the potential of combining machine learning with human expertise to advance the field of verb classification, offering insights into the cross-linguistic similarities and differences in verb semantics and usage."}
