{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between language change and poetic form, drawing on the foundational work of Pāṇini in grammar. Through a retrospective analysis of linguistic evolution and its impact on poetic structures, the research highlights the enduring influence of Pāṇini's grammatical principles. Additionally, the paper adopts an autobiographical approach to reflect on the personal journey of understanding these complex interactions. The prospect of future research directions is also discussed, emphasizing the potential for interdisciplinary studies to further illuminate the dynamics of language and literature."}
