{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate patterns of adjective ordering preferences across diverse languages, shedding light on the underlying principles that govern word order in modification structures. By analyzing a wide range of linguistic data, we identify cross-linguistic regularities that suggest a universal hierarchy influencing the sequence of adjectives. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the nature of syntactic and semantic factors in adjective ordering, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms that facilitate language processing and production. This research underscores the importance of cross-linguistic studies in understanding the universal aspects of human language."}
