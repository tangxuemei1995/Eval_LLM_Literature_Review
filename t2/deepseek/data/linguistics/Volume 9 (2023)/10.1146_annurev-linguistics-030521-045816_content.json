{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on language development and processing, with a focus on the 'meaningful differences' hypothesis. It examines how variations in parental input and sociolinguistic environments influence syntactic parsing and language acquisition in children from diverse SES backgrounds. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research combines quantitative analysis of language processing tasks with qualitative assessments of parental communication styles. Findings reveal significant disparities in language development trajectories, attributed to differences in the quantity and quality of linguistic input provided by parents across SES strata. The study underscores the critical role of early language exposure in shaping cognitive and linguistic abilities, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to bridge the gap in language development among children from lower SES families. This research contributes to the broader discourse on educational equity and the sociolinguistic factors that underpin language learning disparities."}
