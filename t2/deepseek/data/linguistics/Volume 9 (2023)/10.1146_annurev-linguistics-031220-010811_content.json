{"Abstract": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework represents a significant advancement in the field of probabilistic pragmatics, offering a computational model that bridges the gap between linguistic theory and cognitive processing. This framework posits that language understanding is a process of recursive social reasoning, where listeners infer speakers' intentions by considering the context and the probabilistic nature of language use. By integrating principles from computational pragmatics and experimental pragmatics, the RSA framework provides a robust tool for predicting and interpreting linguistic behavior in various contexts. It also contributes to experimental semantics by offering a method to quantitatively assess how semantic meanings are modulated by pragmatic factors. This paper reviews the foundational concepts of the RSA framework, its applications in understanding language use and interpretation, and its implications for future research in cognitive science and linguistics. Through this exploration, we aim to highlight the RSA framework's role in advancing our understanding of the complex interplay between language, cognition, and social interaction."}
