{"Abstract": "This study addresses the actuation problem in linguistic change, focusing on how individual differences in cognitive processing styles influence the initiation, incrementation, and propagation of sound changes. By integrating insights from cognitive psychology and sociolinguistics, we propose a novel agent-based modeling approach to simulate the dynamics of sound change within a speech community. Our model incorporates variability in cognitive processing styles among individuals, hypothesizing that these differences play a crucial role in the actuation and spread of linguistic innovations. Through a series of computational experiments, we explore the conditions under which new sound variants emerge, gain traction, and eventually become established within the community. The results highlight the significance of individual cognitive diversity in the actuation problem, suggesting that the interplay between cognitive processing styles and social networks is key to understanding the mechanisms of linguistic change. This research contributes to the broader field of language evolution by providing a computational framework that bridges the gap between individual cognition and community-level linguistic patterns, offering new perspectives on the actuation problem and the role of cognitive processing styles in sound change."}
