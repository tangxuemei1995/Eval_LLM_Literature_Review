{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of environmental linguistics, biodiversity, and decolonization through the lens of native science, with a focus on the Tuva region. Environmental linguistics, as a field, examines the intricate relationships between language, culture, and the environment, offering insights into how indigenous knowledge systems contribute to environmental intelligence and sustainable practices. By analyzing the linguistic and cultural practices of the Tuvan people, this research highlights the role of native science in preserving biodiversity and fostering a decolonized approach to environmental management. The findings underscore the importance of integrating indigenous linguistic and ecological knowledge into broader environmental strategies, advocating for a more inclusive and respectful engagement with native sciences. This paper contributes to the growing discourse on environmental linguistics by demonstrating how indigenous languages and knowledge systems can inform and enhance global efforts towards biodiversity conservation and environmental sustainability."}
