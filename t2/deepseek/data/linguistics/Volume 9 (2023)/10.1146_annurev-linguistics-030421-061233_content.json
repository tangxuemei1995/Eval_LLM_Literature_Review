{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between animal communication and cognitive processes from a linguistic perspective, drawing on foundational research by Washburn and Ladygina-Kohts, alongside Grice's theories of communication. By examining the principles of duality of patterning and generativity, we aim to bridge the gap between human language and animal communication systems. Our analysis focuses on the cognitive underpinnings that facilitate complex communication in non-human species, challenging the traditional boundaries of linguistic capabilities. Through a comparative cognition lens, we investigate how animals utilize signals and symbols to convey information, negotiate social hierarchies, and solve problems, thereby shedding light on the evolutionary roots of language. This research not only contributes to our understanding of animal cognition but also offers insights into the fundamental aspects of language development and the cognitive processes that support it."}
