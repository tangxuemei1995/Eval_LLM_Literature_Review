{"Abstract": "This paper explores the principle of compositionality within computational linguistics, emphasizing its pivotal role in understanding and generating human language through computational models. Compositionality, the concept that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them, is scrutinized in the context of neural networks and neurosymbolic models. These advanced computational frameworks are analyzed for their ability to perform semantic parsing, a task that requires the decomposition of sentences into their semantic components. The study highlights the challenges and advancements in achieving compositional understanding in machines, offering insights into the future of natural language processing technologies."}
