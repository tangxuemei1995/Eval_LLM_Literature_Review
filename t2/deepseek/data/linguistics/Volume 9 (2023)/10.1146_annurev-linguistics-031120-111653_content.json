{"Abstract": "This study explores the advancements in computational models of anaphora, focusing on anaphora resolution and coreference within natural language processing. By leveraging neural models for coreference, the research delves into the complexities of bridging reference and discourse deixis, utilizing diverse corpora for anaphora to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Special attention is given to the Winograd Schema Challenge as a benchmark for evaluating the nuanced understanding of context and reference in computational systems. The findings highlight the potential of neural approaches in overcoming traditional limitations, offering insights into the development of more sophisticated models capable of handling the intricacies of anaphoric references in varied linguistic contexts."}
