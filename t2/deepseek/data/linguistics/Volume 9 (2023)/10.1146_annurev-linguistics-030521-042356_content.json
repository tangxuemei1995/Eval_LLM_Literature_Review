{"Abstract": "The Unity and Diversity of Altaic languages presents a complex tapestry of linguistic evolution, shaped by diachronic, areal, and contextual linguistics. This study delves into the intricate web of language contacts and typological interactions that have influenced the Altaic language family over centuries. By examining the historical development and geographical spread of these languages, we uncover the shared features and distinct divergences that characterize the Altaic linguistic landscape. The research highlights the role of external influences and internal innovations in shaping the phonological, morphological, and syntactic structures of Altaic languages. Through a comprehensive analysis of linguistic data, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing debate on the genetic unity of the Altaic languages, offering new insights into their historical connections and the dynamic processes of language change and adaptation in the context of broader Eurasian linguistic and cultural interactions."}
