{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between postcolonial language policy and planning (LPP) and the concept of the modern nation-state, with a particular focus on Sudan. Employing a postcolonial approach, it critically examines how the legacy of colonialism continues to influence language policies in postcolonial states, challenging the universal applicability of the modern state model. By integrating Southern perspectives, the research highlights the limitations of traditional LPP frameworks in addressing the linguistic diversity and complex socio-political landscapes of postcolonial societies. Through an analysis of Sudan's language policy evolution, the study reveals the tensions between national identity construction and the recognition of linguistic plurality. It argues for a reimagined LPP that transcends the confines of the nation-state paradigm, advocating for policies that are more inclusive and reflective of the postcolonial condition. This research contributes to the broader discourse on LPP by offering insights into the challenges and possibilities of language planning in postcolonial contexts, emphasizing the need for approaches that are sensitive to local histories and realities."}
