{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between impersonal pronouns and the first-person perspective, focusing on their roles in attitude reports, de se interpretations, and the expression of genericity. Impersonal pronouns, often overlooked in traditional analyses, serve as a crucial linguistic tool for conveying a speaker's stance without explicit reference to the self, thereby facilitating a nuanced understanding of indexicality and perspective in language. Through a comprehensive examination of linguistic data and theoretical frameworks, we argue that impersonal pronouns are not merely placeholders for generic statements but are deeply embedded in the speaker's cognitive and linguistic strategies to navigate the complexities of self-reference and other-reference. Our analysis reveals that these pronouns play a pivotal role in the construction of de se attitudes, enabling speakers to project their perspectives onto generic or hypothetical scenarios. This research contributes to the broader discourse on the semantics and pragmatics of pronouns, offering new insights into how language encodes and manipulates perspective and attitude."}
