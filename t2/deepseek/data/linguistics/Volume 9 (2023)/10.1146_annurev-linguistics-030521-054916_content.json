{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex sociolinguistic landscape of North Africa, focusing on the recognition and institutionalization of Tamazight alongside the prevalent use of Arabic and DƒÅrija. It examines the historical impact of colonization on language dynamics and the ongoing efforts towards the revitalization of indigenous languages. The research highlights the challenges of fostering multilingualism and multiculturalism in a region marked by linguistic diversity and political sensitivities. By analyzing current policies and societal attitudes, this paper aims to contribute to the discourse on language rights and cultural identity in North Africa, offering insights into the potential pathways for achieving linguistic equity and social cohesion."}
