{"Abstract": "This study explores the typology of reciprocal constructions across languages, focusing on the interplay between symmetry, valency, and morphosyntax. Reciprocal constructions, which denote mutual actions or relationships between participants, exhibit significant diversity in their structural encoding and semantic nuances. By analyzing a broad sample of languages, we identify key parameters that influence the formation and interpretation of reciprocal markers, including the degree of symmetry in participant roles and the valency adjustments required by the verb. Our findings reveal that while some languages employ dedicated reciprocal morphemes, others utilize periphrastic strategies or rely on context for interpretation. The research underscores the importance of considering both syntactic and semantic factors in understanding the cross-linguistic variation of reciprocal constructions, contributing to a more comprehensive typological framework."}
