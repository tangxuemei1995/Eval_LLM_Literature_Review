{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between speech prosody and mental disorders, focusing on both prosody recognition and production. Speech prosody, encompassing pragmatic and affective dimensions, plays a pivotal role in communication, conveying emotions and intentions beyond the literal meaning of words. Individuals with mental disorders often exhibit distinct prosodic patterns, which can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research identifies key prosodic features associated with various mental disorders, including but not limited to depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder. The analysis highlights the challenges in prosody recognition and production faced by individuals with these conditions, shedding light on the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the study discusses the implications of these findings for clinical practice, emphasizing the potential of prosody-based interventions in improving communication skills and emotional expression in patients. By bridging the gap between linguistic research and psychiatric practice, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of speech prosody in mental health and disorder."}
