{"Abstract": "The discovery of interstellar interlopers, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has opened a new frontier in the study of cometary science and the dynamics of protoplanetary disks. These objects, originating from beyond our solar system, provide unique insights into the processes of planetary system formation and the chemical diversity of the galaxy. This research delves into the characteristics and trajectories of these interstellar visitors, comparing them with native comets to understand their origins and the conditions of their parent systems. By analyzing the spectral data and orbital mechanics of these interlopers, we aim to shed light on the early stages of planetary system evolution and the potential for interstellar exchange of organic materials. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of the cosmos and the mechanisms driving the diversity of planetary systems."}
