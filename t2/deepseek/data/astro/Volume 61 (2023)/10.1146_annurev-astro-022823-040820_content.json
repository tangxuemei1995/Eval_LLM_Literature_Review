{"Abstract": "The study of protoplanetary disk chemistry is pivotal in understanding the complex processes leading to planet formation. This research delves into the astrochemical pathways that govern the evolution of molecular species within protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets. By examining the interplay between gas-phase reactions, grain-surface chemistry, and the dynamic physical conditions of disks, we aim to elucidate the chemical inventory available for planet formation. Advanced observational techniques and sophisticated chemical models are employed to trace the distribution and evolution of key molecular species, from simple diatomic molecules to complex organic compounds. This investigation not only sheds light on the chemical diversity of protoplanetary disks but also provides insights into the initial conditions for planetary systems, including our own. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of astrochemistry and its implications for the origins of planetary systems, offering a chemical perspective on the processes that shape the architecture of nascent planetary systems."}
