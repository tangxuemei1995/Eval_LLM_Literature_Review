{"Abstract": "The formation of the first stars marks a pivotal epoch in the history of the Universe, setting the stage for the cosmic evolution that followed. This study delves into the intricate processes governing the birth of Population III stars, the Universe's inaugural stellar generation, characterized by their primordial composition devoid of metals. We explore the theoretical frameworks and observational evidence that shed light on their formation mechanisms, properties, and the subsequent emergence of Population II stars, which contain trace amounts of metals. Utilizing the tools of galactic archeology and insights from the high-redshift Universe, we investigate the impact of these early stellar populations on the reionization of the Universe, the enrichment of the intergalactic medium with heavy elements, and the formation of the first galaxies. Our analysis underscores the significance of understanding the first stars in unraveling the complexities of cosmic dawn and the evolutionary pathways of galaxies. This research contributes to the broader field of cosmology by providing a comprehensive overview of the first stars' role in shaping the Universe's structure and composition, offering new perspectives on the origins of cosmic diversity."}
