{"Abstract": "Circumbinary accretion plays a pivotal role in the evolution of binary systems, ranging from stellar binaries to massive binary black holes. This process involves the transfer of mass and angular momentum from a circumbinary disk to the binary components, significantly influencing their orbital dynamics and growth. In the context of star formation, circumbinary disks around young stellar binaries are crucial for understanding the formation of planets and the distribution of angular momentum. Similarly, in the realm of black hole physics, circumbinary accretion disks around supermassive binary black holes are key to deciphering the mechanisms of black hole growth and the emission of gravitational waves. This study delves into the hydrodynamics of circumbinary accretion, employing both analytical models and numerical simulations to explore the complex interactions between the disk and the binary. We examine the impact of various parameters, such as the binary mass ratio, eccentricity, and disk viscosity, on the accretion process and the resulting observational signatures. Our findings shed light on the formation and evolution of exoplanets in binary star systems and the coalescence of supermassive black holes, providing insights into the broader astrophysical implications of circumbinary accretion."}
