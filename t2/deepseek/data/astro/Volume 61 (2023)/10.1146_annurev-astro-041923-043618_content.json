{"Abstract": "Hydrodynamical simulations have become a cornerstone in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, offering detailed insights into the complex interplay between gas dynamics, star formation, and feedback mechanisms within galaxy halos. These simulations have successfully replicated key observational features of the galaxy population, such as the galaxy luminosity function and the distribution of galaxy morphologies. However, challenges remain in accurately modeling the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium, the impact of feedback from active galactic nuclei, and the role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution. This paper reviews the enduring successes of hydrodynamical simulations in capturing the essence of galaxy formation, while also highlighting the outstanding challenges that must be addressed to further our understanding of the cosmic evolution of galaxies."}
