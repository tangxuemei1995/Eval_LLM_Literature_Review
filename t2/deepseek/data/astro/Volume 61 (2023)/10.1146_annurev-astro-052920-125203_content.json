{"Abstract": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies, acting as a reservoir for gas that fuels star formation and as a repository for feedback from stellar and supermassive black hole activity. This study delves into the key physical processes governing the CGM, including hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and the interaction between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galactic halos. By synthesizing observations and theoretical models, we explore the mechanisms of gas accretion, cooling, and heating within the CGM, and how these processes influence galaxy formation and evolution. Special attention is given to the role of feedback mechanisms in regulating the thermal and dynamic state of the CGM, and the implications for cosmological theory. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between the CGM and its host galaxy, underscoring the importance of multi-wavelength observations and advanced numerical simulations in unraveling the mysteries of the CGM. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the cosmic baryon cycle and the intricate relationship between galaxies and their surrounding environments."}
