{"Abstract": "The generation and maintenance of large-scale magnetic fields in spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, are phenomena of significant astrophysical interest, primarily attributed to the action of galactic dynamos. This study delves into the intricate mechanisms of galactic dynamos, focusing on the role of the circumgalactic medium and the magnetic Reynolds number in shaping the magnetic architecture of spiral galaxies. By synthesizing observational data and theoretical models, we explore how differential rotation and turbulent motions within the interstellar medium contribute to the amplification and organization of magnetic fields on galactic scales. Special attention is given to the interplay between the magnetic fields and the circumgalactic medium, which serves as a crucial interface for the exchange of matter and energy between galaxies and their surroundings. Our analysis highlights the importance of the magnetic Reynolds number in determining the efficiency of magnetic field generation and the transition from small-scale turbulent fields to coherent large-scale structures. This research underscores the complex dynamics of galactic magnetic fields and their implications for galaxy evolution, offering new insights into the magnetic nature of the universe."}
