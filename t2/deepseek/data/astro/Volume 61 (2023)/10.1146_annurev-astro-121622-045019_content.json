{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in optical and infrared interferometry have significantly enhanced our understanding of various astronomical phenomena, ranging from the intricate dynamics of the Galactic Center to the detailed characterization of exoplanets. This paper reviews the latest developments in interferometric instrumentation, which have enabled unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We explore the application of these technologies in studying active galactic nuclei (AGN), where interferometry has provided insights into the structure and kinematics of the central regions, shedding light on the mechanisms of accretion and jet formation. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of interferometry in the observation of young stellar objects (YSOs), offering a closer look at the processes of star formation and the evolution of circumstellar disks. The study of stars, particularly in the context of stellar surfaces and atmospheres, has also benefited from these advancements, allowing for detailed measurements of stellar diameters, limb darkening, and surface features. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent findings, this paper underscores the transformative impact of optical and infrared interferometry on astrophysical research, paving the way for future discoveries in the field."}
