{"Abstract": "The analysis of astronomical time series data presents unique challenges due to its irregular sampling, noise characteristics, and the complex nature of the underlying astrophysical processes. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) emerges as a powerful tool in this context, offering a flexible, non-parametric approach to model and predict time series data. This paper explores the application of GPR in the field of time-domain astronomy, highlighting its advantages in handling the intricacies of astronomical datasets. We discuss the theoretical foundations of GPR, including kernel selection and optimization, which are crucial for accurately capturing the temporal correlations and variability in astronomical observations. Furthermore, we present case studies demonstrating the efficacy of GPR in various astronomical applications, such as the detection of exoplanets, the study of variable stars, and the analysis of transient events. These examples illustrate how GPR can be integrated into the astrostatistics toolkit to enhance the interpretation of time-domain data. The paper also addresses computational considerations, providing insights into the scalability and efficiency of GPR methods when applied to large-scale astronomical surveys. By bridging the gap between statistical theory and astronomical practice, this work aims to foster the adoption of GPR in the astronomical community, paving the way for more sophisticated analyses of the dynamic universe."}
