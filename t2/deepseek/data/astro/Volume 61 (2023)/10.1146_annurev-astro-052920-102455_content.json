{"Abstract": "The epoch of cosmic dawn marks a pivotal phase in the universe's history, characterized by the formation of the first stars, galaxies, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). This study delves into the intricate relationship between quasars, powered by SMBHs, and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during this transformative era. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of observational data and theoretical models, we explore how quasars contribute to the process of cosmic reionization, a critical event that led to the ionization of hydrogen in the IGM. Our findings highlight the significant role of quasars in shaping the thermal and ionization state of the IGM, thereby influencing the subsequent evolution of galaxies. We also investigate the feedback mechanisms between quasars and their host galaxies, shedding light on the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies. The study underscores the importance of quasars as probes of the early universe, offering insights into the properties of the IGM and the timeline of cosmic reionization. By integrating observations from the latest generation of telescopes with advanced cosmological simulations, this research advances our understanding of the complex interplay between quasars, the IGM, and galaxy evolution during the cosmic dawn."}
