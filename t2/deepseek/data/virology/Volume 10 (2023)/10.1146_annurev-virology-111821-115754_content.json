{"Abstract": "The human microbiota, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms residing in and on the human body, plays a pivotal role in modulating host immune responses and influencing the outcome of viral infections. This review explores the intricate interactions between the microbiota, its metabolites, and the virome, highlighting how these interactions can either exacerbate or mitigate viral pathogenesis. We delve into the mechanisms by which microbial metabolites influence host immune signaling pathways, particularly those involving interferons, which are crucial for antiviral defense. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of manipulating the microbiota as a therapeutic strategy to enhance antiviral immunity and reduce viral load. Understanding the dynamic interplay between the microbiota and viral infections opens new avenues for research and therapeutic interventions, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a balanced microbiome for optimal health and disease resistance."}
