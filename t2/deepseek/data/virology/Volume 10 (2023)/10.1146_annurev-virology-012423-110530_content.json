{"Abstract": "The escalating crisis of antibiotic resistance necessitates innovative approaches to combat bacterial infections. Phage therapy, the use of bacteriophages to target and kill bacteria, presents a promising alternative. However, the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria poses a significant challenge to its efficacy. This study explores the development of phage therapy strategies that mitigate the emergence of resistance through understanding and leveraging evolutionary trade-offs. By analyzing the genetic and phenotypic changes in bacteria that confer phage resistance, we identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to design more effective phage treatments. Our research highlights the importance of a dynamic approach to phage therapy, incorporating the principles of evolutionary biology to stay ahead of bacterial adaptation. The findings suggest that a combination of phage cocktails, engineered phages, and the exploitation of fitness costs associated with resistance could offer a sustainable solution to the problem of antibiotic resistance."}
