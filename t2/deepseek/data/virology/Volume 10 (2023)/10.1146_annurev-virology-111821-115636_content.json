{"Abstract": "The discovery of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream signaling effector, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), has revolutionized our understanding of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense and innate immunity. This review delves into the evolutionary origins and mechanistic underpinnings of the cGAS-STING pathway, juxtaposing it with the recently identified CBASS (cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system) and cGLR (cyclic GMP-AMP receptor) systems. These systems collectively represent a sophisticated network of nucleotide second messenger signaling that orchestrates the host's defense against viral infections. By synthesizing current literature, we explore the molecular mechanisms through which these pathways detect viral nucleic acids, the generation and function of cyclic dinucleotides as second messengers, and the subsequent activation of immune responses. This comprehensive analysis not only highlights the complexity and diversity of nucleotide second messenger signaling in innate immunity but also underscores the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these pathways in the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer."}
