{"Abstract": "Viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and assembly, often forming specialized structures known as viral factories or viroplasms. These biomolecular condensates, which are liquid-like compartments formed through phase transitions, play a crucial role in the life cycle of viruses, particularly those with segmented RNA genomes like rotaviruses. This review explores the biophysical principles underlying the formation and function of these condensates, emphasizing their role in virus assembly. By examining the interplay between viral components and host factors, we highlight how viruses exploit phase separation to concentrate viral proteins and nucleic acids, thereby enhancing replication efficiency. Understanding these processes not only sheds light on fundamental aspects of virology but also opens new avenues for antiviral strategies targeting the formation and dynamics of viral condensates."}
