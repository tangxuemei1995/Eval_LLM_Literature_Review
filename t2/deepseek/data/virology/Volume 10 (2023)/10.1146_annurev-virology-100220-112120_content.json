{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between viral evolution and host proteostasis networks represents a pivotal aspect of viral adaptation and survival. This study delves into the mechanisms by which viruses exploit and manipulate the host's protein folding biophysics, stress response pathways, and quality control systems, including chaperones, to enhance their replication and evade drug and immune system resistance. By analyzing the dynamic interactions between viral proteins and host proteostasis networks, we uncover novel insights into the biophysical constraints and evolutionary pressures that shape viral adaptation. Our findings highlight the critical role of host proteostasis in determining viral fitness and the emergence of resistance mechanisms, offering new perspectives for the development of antiviral strategies that target the virus-host proteostasis interface. This research underscores the importance of understanding the molecular underpinnings of viral evolution in the context of host cellular environments, paving the way for innovative approaches to combat viral infections."}
