{"Abstract": "The human microbiome plays a pivotal role in regulating immune homeostasis and inflammation, with emerging evidence highlighting its influence on HIV persistence and immune dysfunction. This review explores the intricate interplay between the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids in modulating immune responses and their potential impact on HIV infection. SCFAs, produced through microbial fermentation of dietary fibers, have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and enhance gut barrier integrity, thereby influencing systemic immune activation. Bile acids, on the other hand, are not only crucial for lipid digestion but also serve as signaling molecules that can modulate immune cell function and microbial composition. The dysbiosis observed in HIV-infected individuals underscores the importance of the microbiome in viral persistence and the chronic immune activation characteristic of the disease. By elucidating the mechanisms through which microbial metabolites like SCFAs and bile acids regulate immune homeostasis and inflammation, this review aims to shed light on novel therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome to mitigate HIV-associated immune dysfunction and enhance viral eradication efforts."}
