{"Abstract": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a critical translational recoding mechanism utilized by viruses to regulate gene expression from overlapping open reading frames. This process is essential for the replication of many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, making it a potential target for antiviral therapies. PRF is typically induced by specific RNA structures, such as pseudoknots, which cause the ribosome to slip and shift reading frames during translation. This review provides structural and functional insights into the mechanisms of viral PRF, focusing on the role of RNA secondary structures and the ribosome's response to these signals. We discuss recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography that have elucidated the molecular details of frameshifting in the context of the ribosome. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these findings for understanding viral replication and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. By integrating structural biology with virology, this review highlights the intricate interplay between viral RNA elements and the host translation machinery, offering new perspectives on combating viral infections through the modulation of PRF."}
