{"Abstract": "Enteric viruses, including norovirus, play a pivotal role in modulating the host immune response within the intestinal environment. This review explores the complex interactions between enteric viruses and the host immune system, highlighting the mechanisms of immunomodulation that contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis. The intestinal virome, a dynamic component of the gut microbiota, is implicated in shaping immune responses and maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Through various strategies, enteric viruses can evade immune detection, suppress immune responses, or induce immune tolerance, thereby facilitating their survival and replication. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of enteric viruses is crucial for developing novel therapeutic and preventive strategies against viral infections and associated diseases. This study underscores the importance of the virome in immune regulation and its potential implications for human health and disease."}
