{"Abstract": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses represent a significant class of pathogens affecting human health, including influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). These viruses possess genomes divided into multiple segments, a feature that facilitates genetic reassortment and contributes to their evolutionary adaptability and pandemic potential. Recent advancements in virology have enabled the development of reporter strains of these viruses, incorporating fluorescent or bioluminescent markers. These genetically modified strains offer powerful tools for studying viral replication, pathogenesis, and host-virus interactions in real-time. By leveraging these reporter strains, researchers can gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying viral infections, assess the efficacy of antiviral drugs, and develop novel vaccine strategies. This review highlights the genetic systems of segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses and explores the experimental applications of reporter strains in advancing our understanding of these human pathogens."}
