{"Abstract": "Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV), have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to navigate the complex process of nuclear egress, a critical step in their replication cycle. Central to this process is the nuclear egress complex (NEC), which orchestrates the formation and release of primary enveloped virions (PEVs) from the nucleus. Despite significant advances in understanding the roles of NEC components in mediating nuclear membrane fusion and PEV budding, numerous questions remain regarding the precise molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms involved. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the herpesvirus nuclear egress pathway, highlighting the contributions of the NEC to viral replication and the challenges in elucidating the detailed mechanisms of nuclear membrane remodeling. By integrating findings from HSV and PRV studies, we aim to identify key unknowns in the field and propose directions for future research to enhance our understanding of herpesvirus biology and inform the development of novel antiviral strategies."}
