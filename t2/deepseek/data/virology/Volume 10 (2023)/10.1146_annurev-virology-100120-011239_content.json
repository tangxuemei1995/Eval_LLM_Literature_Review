{"Abstract": "Microviruses, members of the family Microviridae, represent a fascinating group of single-stranded DNA phages that extend far beyond the well-studied model organism phiX174. This review delves into the intricate world of Microviridae, exploring their taxonomy, evolutionary dynamics, and ecological significance. Through the lens of advanced metagenomic techniques, we uncover the vast diversity and distribution of microviruses within various ecosystems, shedding light on their roles in microbial communities and their impact on host evolution. The integration of virome studies has revealed the ubiquity and genetic variability of these phages, challenging our understanding of virus-host interactions and the mechanisms driving virus evolution. By examining the latest research, this abstract highlights the importance of microviruses in the broader context of virology and microbial ecology, offering insights into their potential applications in biotechnology and medicine."}
