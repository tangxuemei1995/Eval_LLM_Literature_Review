{"Abstract": "The study of ancient viral genomes, or paleovirology, offers a unique window into the evolutionary history of viruses and their interactions with human populations over millennia. By analyzing ancient DNA (aDNA) extracted from archaeological remains, researchers can reconstruct the genomes of ancient viruses, shedding light on historical epidemics and their impact on human societies. This interdisciplinary approach combines techniques from paleogenomics, archaeology, and virology to explore the co-evolution of viruses and humans. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification and characterization of ancient viruses, providing insights into their origins, transmission, and adaptation. These findings not only enhance our understanding of past viral dynamics but also inform current and future strategies for managing viral diseases. This paper reviews the contributions of paleovirology to our knowledge of human history, highlighting the significance of ancient viral genomes in unraveling the complex interplay between pathogens and their hosts."}
