{"Abstract": "The intricate structure and function of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins have garnered significant attention in virology, particularly for their roles in viral pathogenesis and immune evasion. This study delves into the mucin-like domains rich in O-linked glycosylation, which are pivotal for the attachment of viruses to host cells, often mediated through interactions with heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. These glycans not only facilitate virion entry but also play a crucial role in the egress of newly formed viral particles, thereby influencing the viral life cycle. Furthermore, the variability in O-linked glycan structures presents a challenge for the immune system, complicating the development of effective vaccines. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins, this research aims to contribute to the design of novel antiviral strategies and vaccine candidates, potentially offering new avenues for combating viral infections."}
