{"Abstract": "The study of cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses unveils a complex web of ecological and evolutionary dynamics that challenge our understanding of virus-host relationships. This research delves into the mechanisms of cross-kingdom infection, focusing on the transmission pathways and virus-virus interactions that facilitate the movement of viruses between plants and fungi. By examining the role of extracellular transfer in these interactions, we aim to shed light on the potential for biocontrol strategies that leverage these natural processes. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between plant and fungal viruses, offering new insights into their co-evolution and the implications for agricultural practices. This study not only advances our knowledge of viral ecology but also opens up novel avenues for the development of sustainable disease management techniques in crops and fungi."}
