{"Abstract": "The dynamic interaction between tobamoviruses and plant immune systems represents a fascinating area of study in plant pathology. This research delves into the mechanisms by which plants deploy pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and resistance genes to combat viral infections, focusing on the role of RNA silencing and salicylic acid (SA) pathways in defense responses. Specifically, the study examines the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), two prominent members of the tobamovirus family, to understand how they evade or suppress plant immune mechanisms. By analyzing the interplay between viral proteins and plant immune components, this research aims to uncover novel strategies for enhancing plant resistance to tobamoviruses. The findings could pave the way for the development of more robust plant varieties and innovative antiviral strategies, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture in the face of evolving viral threats."}
