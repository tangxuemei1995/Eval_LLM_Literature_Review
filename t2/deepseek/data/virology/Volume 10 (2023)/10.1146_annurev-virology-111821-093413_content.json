{"Abstract": "Viral membrane fusion represents a critical step in the infection process, where viral and host cell membranes merge to facilitate viral entry. This complex process is orchestrated by viral fusion proteins, categorized into classes I, II, and III, each adopting distinct structural conformations and mechanisms to mediate fusion. The transition through conformational intermediates, including the formation of trimers-of-hairpins, is pivotal for driving the fusion energetics. Fusion peptides and loops play essential roles in initiating membrane juxtaposition and merger, while lipid dynamics significantly influence the fusion process. Additionally, fusion restriction factors can modulate the efficiency of viral entry, highlighting the intricate interplay between viral components and host cell defenses. This review delves into the molecular choreography of viral membrane fusion, emphasizing the contributions of viral fusion proteins and lipids, and the regulatory mechanisms that govern this vital biological event."}
