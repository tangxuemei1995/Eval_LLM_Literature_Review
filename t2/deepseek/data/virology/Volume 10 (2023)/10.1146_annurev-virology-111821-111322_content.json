{"Abstract": "The interaction between mammalian cells and bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, is an emerging area of interest in cellular biology and immunology. This study explores the mechanisms by which mammalian cells process bacteriophages, focusing on endocytosis and intracellular trafficking pathways. We investigate how these processes contribute to the mammalian immune response, including the induction of inflammation and the potential role of bacteriophages in shaping the host's virome. By analyzing the cellular uptake and processing of bacteriophages, this research sheds light on the complex interplay between bacteriophages and mammalian cells, offering insights into their impact on immunity and inflammation. Our findings suggest that mammalian cells possess sophisticated mechanisms to recognize and respond to bacteriophages, highlighting the importance of these interactions in health and disease. This study provides a foundational understanding of the cellular processing of bacteriophages, paving the way for future research into their therapeutic potential and role in the mammalian immune system."}
