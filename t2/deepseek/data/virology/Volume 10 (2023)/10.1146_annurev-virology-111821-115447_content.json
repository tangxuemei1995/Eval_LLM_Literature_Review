{"Abstract": "Influenza viruses pose a significant public health challenge due to their ability to spread rapidly through airborne and respiratory routes. This study explores the multifaceted barriers to influenza virus transmission, emphasizing the roles of vaccines, antivirals, and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masks and improved ventilation. We delve into the mechanisms by which UV light and the physical properties of mucus can disrupt virus persistence and transmission. By synthesizing current research, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of effective strategies to block the spread of influenza, highlighting the importance of integrating medical and environmental approaches to mitigate transmission risks. Our findings underscore the need for a layered defense strategy, combining vaccination, antiviral use, and environmental controls to protect public health against influenza outbreaks."}
