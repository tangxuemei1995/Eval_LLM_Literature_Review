{"Abstract": "The replication and transcription of nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs) are facilitated by their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), which are complex, multifunctional enzymes. This study delves into the structural and mechanistic aspects of RdRps from the order Mononegavirales, encompassing families such as Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. Through a comprehensive review of recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures and biochemical studies, we elucidate the intricate architecture of these polymerases, highlighting conserved motifs and unique features that underpin their function. The mechanisms of RNA synthesis, including initiation, elongation, and termination, are explored, with a focus on the role of the polymerase in ensuring fidelity and processivity. Additionally, the interplay between the polymerase and other viral and host factors is examined, shedding light on the regulatory mechanisms that govern viral replication. This research provides critical insights into the molecular biology of nsNSVs, offering potential avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics targeting the viral polymerase."}
