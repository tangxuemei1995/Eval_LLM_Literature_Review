{"Abstract": "The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) accessory protein Vpu plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle and pathogenesis, despite its small size. This multifunctional protein is instrumental in immune evasion, primarily through the downregulation of CD4 receptors and counteraction of the host restriction factor tetherin, thereby facilitating viral release and spread. Vpu's interaction with the NF-ÎºB pathway further underscores its significance in modulating host immune responses, contributing to the establishment and persistence of HIV infection. Additionally, Vpu has been implicated in the inhibition of superinfection, a mechanism that ensures the dominance of the initial infecting virus, and in the modulation of DNA damage repair processes, highlighting its versatility beyond immune evasion. This review synthesizes current understanding of Vpu's diverse roles, emphasizing its impact on viral fitness and the broader implications for HIV pathogenesis. By elucidating the mechanisms through which Vpu manipulates host cellular machinery, this study aims to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this critical viral protein."}
