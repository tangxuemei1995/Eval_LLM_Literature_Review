{"Abstract": "The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, with adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) emerging as a promising strategy. This approach leverages the immune system's specificity and potency, particularly through the use of T cell receptor (TCR)-based therapies targeting driver oncogenes and public neoantigens. Driver oncogenes, pivotal in tumorigenesis, and public neoantigens, shared among patients with similar genetic backgrounds or tumor types, present unique targets for TCR-engineered T cells. This review explores the development and application of TCR-based cellular therapies, focusing on the identification and targeting of these antigens. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in harnessing TCR-engineered T cells for cancer immunotherapy, including the optimization of TCR affinity, the management of off-target effects, and the enhancement of T cell persistence and function within the tumor microenvironment. The potential of combining TCR-based therapies with other immunotherapeutic strategies to overcome resistance and improve clinical outcomes is also examined, highlighting the future directions of this rapidly evolving field."}
