{"Abstract": "Natural Killer (NK) cells have emerged as a pivotal component in the realm of immunotherapy, particularly in the fight against cancer. The advent of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology has further revolutionized this field, enabling the engineering of CAR NK cells that can specifically target and eliminate cancer cells with enhanced precision and efficacy. Unlike CAR T cells, CAR NK cells offer the advantage of being an 'off-the-shelf' product, reducing the time and complexity associated with personalized cell therapies. This review delves into the latest advancements in CAR NK cell therapy, highlighting its potential as a transformative approach in cancer treatment. By harnessing the innate and adaptive immune responses, CAR NK cells represent a promising frontier in the development of effective and accessible immunotherapies."}
