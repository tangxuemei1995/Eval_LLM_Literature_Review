{"Abstract": "Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) represents a significant challenge in cancer treatment, influencing the efficacy of cancer immunosurveillance and immunotherapy. This study explores the impact of clonal heterogeneity on the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells, with a particular focus on the role of immune checkpoint inhibition. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and analysis of clinical data, we investigate how diverse tumor clones evade immune detection and the implications for therapeutic strategies. Our findings suggest that ITH contributes to the complexity of tumor-immune interactions, necessitating personalized approaches to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. This research underscores the importance of understanding clonal heterogeneity in developing targeted treatments that can overcome immune evasion mechanisms, offering new avenues for improving patient outcomes in cancer therapy."}
