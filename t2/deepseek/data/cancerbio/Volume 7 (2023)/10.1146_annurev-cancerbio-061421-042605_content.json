{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between immune cell metabolism and immuno-oncology has emerged as a pivotal area of research, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying immune responses and cancer progression. This study delves into the complex interplay of immunometabolism within the tumor microenvironment, highlighting how metabolic reprogramming of immune cells influences their function and the overall anti-tumor immune response. By examining the metabolic pathways that are altered in immune cells upon interaction with cancer cells, we uncover potential therapeutic targets that could enhance the efficacy of immuno-oncology treatments. Our findings suggest that targeting metabolism not only has the potential to modulate immune cell activity but also to reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby improving patient outcomes. This research underscores the importance of integrating metabolic insights into immuno-oncology strategies, paving the way for the development of more effective and personalized cancer therapies."}
