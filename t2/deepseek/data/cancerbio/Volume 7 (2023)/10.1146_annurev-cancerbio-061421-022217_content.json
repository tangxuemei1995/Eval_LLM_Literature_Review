{"Abstract": "FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) represents a groundbreaking advancement in the field of radiobiology, offering a paradigm shift from conventional radiotherapy (CRT) through the utilization of ultrahigh dose rates. This innovative approach has demonstrated remarkable potential in sparing normal tissues while maintaining isoefficient tumor killing, a feat that challenges the traditional understanding of radiation biology. By delivering radiation doses at rates significantly higher than those used in CRT, FLASH-RT minimizes the exposure time, thereby reducing the damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor. This abstract explores the mechanisms underlying the differential effects of FLASH-RT on normal and tumor tissues, reviews the current evidence supporting its efficacy, and discusses the implications of this technology for the future of cancer treatment. The reinvention of radiobiology in the light of FLASH radiotherapy opens new avenues for enhancing the therapeutic ratio, promising a new era in oncology where the balance between tumor control and normal tissue preservation is optimized."}
