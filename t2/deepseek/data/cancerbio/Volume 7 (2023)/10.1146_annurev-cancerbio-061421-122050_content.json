{"Abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a fundamental mechanism organizing cellular biochemistry, leading to the formation of biomolecular condensates. These condensates play pivotal roles in various cellular processes, including transcription and signaling. Fusion oncoproteins, resulting from chromosomal translocations, are implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. Recent studies suggest that the oncogenic potential of these fusion proteins may be significantly influenced by their ability to undergo LLPS, facilitated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and specific sequence features. This review explores the role of phase-separated condensates in the function of fusion oncoproteins, focusing on their impact on transcription and kinase signaling pathways. By integrating recent findings, we aim to elucidate how LLPS contributes to the oncogenic activity of fusion proteins and discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these condensates in cancer treatment."}
