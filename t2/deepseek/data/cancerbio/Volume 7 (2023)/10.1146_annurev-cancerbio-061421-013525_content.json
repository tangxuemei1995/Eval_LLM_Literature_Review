{"Abstract": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women worldwide, with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors representing the majority of cases. The development of next-generation estrogen receptorâ€“targeted therapeutics is pivotal in overcoming resistance mechanisms and improving patient outcomes. This research focuses on the advancement of selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs), which offer promising avenues for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. SERMs function by competitively binding to ERs, modulating their activity, whereas SERDs induce ER degradation, thereby inhibiting ER signaling pathways. The study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of these agents, their potential in overcoming endocrine resistance, and their application in personalized medicine. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and ongoing clinical trials, this research aims to highlight the therapeutic potential of next-generation SERMs and SERDs, offering insights into their role in the evolving landscape of breast cancer treatment."}
