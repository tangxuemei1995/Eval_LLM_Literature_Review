{"Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents a formidable challenge in the development of effective therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) tumors. This highly selective barrier restricts the passage of substances from the bloodstream into the brain, thereby limiting the efficacy of many chemotherapeutic agents. Understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug delivery across the BBB is crucial for the advancement of experimental cancer therapeutics. Recent research has focused on innovative strategies to enhance drug penetration into the brain, including the use of nanoparticles, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and temporary disruption of the BBB. These approaches aim to improve the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs while minimizing systemic toxicity. This review highlights the implications of the BBB for the treatment of CNS tumors and discusses the latest developments in therapeutic strategies designed to overcome this barrier. The integration of these novel drug delivery systems into clinical practice holds promise for improving outcomes in patients with brain tumors."}
