{"Abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary approach in cancer immunotherapy, offering new hope for patients with refractory malignancies. Despite its remarkable success, a significant proportion of patients either do not respond to CAR T cell therapy or experience relapse after initial remission, highlighting the challenges posed by resistance mechanisms. This review delves into the intricate landscape of resistance to CAR T cell therapies, categorizing these mechanisms into intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic resistance encompasses tumor-intrinsic properties such as antigen loss, downregulation, or mutation, as well as the tumor's ability to evade immune detection through various immunosuppressive strategies. Extrinsic resistance, on the other hand, involves factors within the tumor microenvironment (TME), including the presence of immunosuppressive cells, cytokines, and the physical barriers that impede CAR T cell infiltration and function. Understanding these resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to overcome them, thereby enhancing the efficacy and durability of CAR T cell therapies in combating cancer."}
