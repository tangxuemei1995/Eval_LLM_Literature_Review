{"Abstract": "The integration of combination therapies in cancer treatment has emerged as a pivotal strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome drug resistance. This study explores the underlying rationales for combining therapies, focusing on independent action, response correlation, collateral sensitivity, and synergy. Independent action allows for the simultaneous targeting of different pathways, reducing the likelihood of resistance development. Response correlation leverages the predictive relationship between treatments to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Collateral sensitivity, a phenomenon where resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another, offers a novel approach to counteract resistance mechanisms. Synergy, the interaction of therapies resulting in a greater effect than the sum of their individual effects, is particularly promising in enhancing the efficacy of treatments such as PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. Through a comprehensive review of clinical trials and experimental studies, this research underscores the importance of understanding these mechanisms to design more effective combination therapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cancer treatment."}
