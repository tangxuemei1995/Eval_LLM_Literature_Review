{"Abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into computational pathology represents a transformative shift in the diagnosis and management of cancer. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms, this study explores the potential of AI to enhance diagnostic workflows and improve clinical outcomes in oncology. By analyzing histopathological images, AI models can identify tumor characteristics and biomarkers with unprecedented accuracy, offering a more objective and reproducible assessment than traditional methods. This research highlights the development of AI-driven tools that assist pathologists in detecting and classifying tumors, predicting patient prognosis, and tailoring personalized treatment strategies. Furthermore, the study addresses the challenges and ethical considerations of implementing AI in clinical settings, including data privacy, algorithm transparency, and the need for multidisciplinary collaboration. The findings underscore the promise of AI in revolutionizing cancer care, emphasizing its role in augmenting human expertise to achieve more precise and efficient diagnostic processes."}
