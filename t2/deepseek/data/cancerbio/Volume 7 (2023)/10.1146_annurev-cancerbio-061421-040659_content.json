{"Abstract": "The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and response to therapy, yet its complexity poses significant challenges for study and therapeutic targeting. Recent advances in organoid technology have opened new avenues for modeling the TIME in vitro, offering a more physiologically relevant platform than traditional two-dimensional cultures. This review focuses on the integration of immune cells into patient-derived tumor organoids to create coculture systems that more accurately mimic the TIME. We discuss the methodologies for establishing these coculture organoids, including the selection and incorporation of immune cell types, and the maintenance of organoid-immune cell interactions. Furthermore, we explore the applications of these models in drug screening, personalized medicine, and the study of immune-tumor interactions. By engineering the immune microenvironment into organoid models, researchers can gain deeper insights into the mechanisms of immune evasion and resistance, paving the way for the development of more effective immunotherapies."}
