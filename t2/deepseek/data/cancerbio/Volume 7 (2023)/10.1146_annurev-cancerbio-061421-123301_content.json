{"Abstract": "Understanding the complex dynamics of tumor evolution and metastasis is crucial for advancing cancer biology. This study introduces innovative tools for lineage tracing in vivo, leveraging single-cell analysis and cell barcoding techniques to unravel the clonal architecture and evolutionary pathways of cancer cells. By employing these cutting-edge methodologies, we aim to provide a detailed map of cellular lineages within tumors, shedding light on the mechanisms driving cancer progression and metastasis. Our approach enables the precise tracking of individual cells over time, offering unprecedented insights into the heterogeneity and adaptability of cancer populations. The findings from this research have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of cancer biology, paving the way for the development of targeted therapies and personalized medicine strategies. This study represents a significant step forward in the quest to combat cancer by providing new tools to dissect the intricate processes of tumor evolution and metastasis."}
