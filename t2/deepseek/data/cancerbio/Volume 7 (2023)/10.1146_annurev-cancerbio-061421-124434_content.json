{"Abstract": "Cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, plays a dual role in cancer biology, acting both as a tumor suppressor mechanism and a promoter of tumor progression. This paradoxical effect is largely mediated by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can induce immune surveillance to eliminate senescent cells or, conversely, foster a tumor-supportive microenvironment. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) has emerged as a therapeutic strategy, leveraging the tumor-suppressive aspects of senescence. However, the persistence of senescent cells post-therapy poses a risk for cancer relapse and resistance. The development of senolytic agents, designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells, offers a promising avenue to mitigate these risks. The 'one-two punch' therapy, combining TIS with senolytics, represents a novel approach to enhance cancer treatment efficacy. This review explores the complex biology of cellular senescence in cancer, highlighting the therapeutic potential and challenges of targeting senescence in oncology."}
