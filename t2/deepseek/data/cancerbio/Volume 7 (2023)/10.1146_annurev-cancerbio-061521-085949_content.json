{"Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and response to therapy, with mononuclear phagocytes, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), being key components. These cells exhibit dual roles in cancer, either promoting tumor growth and immune evasion or enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Macrophages, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), often adopt a pro-tumorigenic phenotype, supporting angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. Conversely, DCs are crucial for initiating and regulating anti-tumor immune responses, though their function can be suppressed within the TME. This review explores the biology of macrophages and DCs in cancer, highlighting their interactions within the TME and their impact on tumor progression. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at reprogramming these cells to enhance their anti-tumor functions, including targeting specific signaling pathways, utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors, and employing cell-based therapies. Understanding and modulating the roles of macrophages and DCs offer promising avenues for improving cancer treatment outcomes."}
