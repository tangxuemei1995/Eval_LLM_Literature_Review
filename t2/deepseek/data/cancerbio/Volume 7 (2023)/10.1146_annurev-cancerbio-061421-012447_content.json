{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in genomic technologies have unveiled the presence of somatic mutations in normal tissues, challenging traditional views on the origins of cancer. This study explores the implications of these mutations in the context of early carcinogenesis, with a focus on the roles of stem cells, aging, and environmental carcinogens. By analyzing the accumulation of mutations over time, we highlight the complex interplay between genetic alterations and cellular aging, which may predispose individuals to cancer. Furthermore, we investigate how exposure to carcinogens accelerates mutation rates, potentially leading to the early onset of cancer. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding somatic mutations in normal tissues as a critical step towards developing effective cancer prevention strategies. This research opens new avenues for early detection and intervention, offering hope for reducing the global burden of cancer."}
