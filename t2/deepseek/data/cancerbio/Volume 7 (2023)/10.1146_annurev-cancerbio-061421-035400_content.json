{"Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by a dense desmoplastic stroma. This stroma is predominantly composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which play a pivotal role in tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. This review delves into the multifaceted roles of CAFs within the pancreatic cancer TME, highlighting their contribution to desmoplasia, tumor heterogeneity, and the modulation of immune responses. By examining the dynamic interactions between CAFs, tumor cells, and other stromal components, we aim to shed light on the mechanisms by which CAFs influence tumor biology and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, we explore the potential of targeting CAFs as a therapeutic strategy, discussing recent advances in CAF-directed therapies and their implications for overcoming treatment resistance in pancreatic cancer. Through a comprehensive analysis of current literature, this review underscores the importance of understanding CAF biology in the context of pancreatic cancer, offering insights into novel therapeutic avenues that could improve patient prognosis."}
