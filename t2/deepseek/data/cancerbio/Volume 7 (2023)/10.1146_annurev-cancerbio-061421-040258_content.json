{"Abstract": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet its efficacy is limited in 'cold' tumors characterized by a non-inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME). This review explores innovative strategies to transform cold tumors into 'hot' tumors, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies. We delve into the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive TME and discuss emerging approaches, including oncolytic viruses, cytokine therapies, and combination treatments, aimed at stimulating immune cell infiltration and activation. Clinical trials evaluating these strategies are highlighted, offering insights into their potential to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes in immunotherapy-refractory cancers."}
