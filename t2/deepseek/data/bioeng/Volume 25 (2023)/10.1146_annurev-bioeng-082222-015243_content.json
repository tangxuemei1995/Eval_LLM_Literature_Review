{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and application of engineered compounds designed to control ice nucleation and recrystallization, with a focus on antifreeze (glyco)proteins (AF(G)Ps). These proteins exhibit unique properties such as thermal hysteresis, which allows them to inhibit ice growth at sub-zero temperatures. By leveraging the molecular mechanisms of AF(G)Ps, we engineered synthetic analogs that mimic their ice-binding activities. Our findings demonstrate that these compounds effectively modulate ice crystal formation and growth, offering potential applications in cryopreservation, food storage, and climate research. The research highlights the importance of understanding the structural and functional aspects of AF(G)Ps in designing novel materials for ice control, paving the way for advancements in various scientific and industrial fields."}
