{"Abstract": "The integration of biosensors into the Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative approach to personalized healthcare, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological data. This paper explores the development of bioelectronic sensor nodes that are pivotal for the IoB, a subset of the Internet of Things (IoT) focused on human body-centric applications. These sensor nodes are designed to perform in-sensor analytics, reducing the need for data transmission and thereby conserving energy. They incorporate advanced sensing technologies, computational capabilities, and secure communication protocols to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive health data. Furthermore, innovative powering strategies are discussed to address the challenge of energy autonomy in wearable and implantable devices. The convergence of these technologies within bioelectronic sensor nodes offers a promising pathway towards enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and security of IoB systems, paving the way for their widespread adoption in healthcare and beyond."}
