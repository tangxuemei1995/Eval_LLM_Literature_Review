{"Abstract": "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has emerged as a powerful tool in medical diagnostics, offering unique capabilities for the characterization of bone tissue. This technique combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the deep penetration of ultrasound, enabling detailed visualization of bone structure and composition. The application of PAI in bone analysis leverages its ability to provide quantitative information on bone density, microarchitecture, and mineral content, which are critical for the assessment of bone health and the diagnosis of related pathologies. Spectral unmixing techniques further enhance the utility of PAI by allowing the differentiation of various bone components based on their optical absorption spectra. This overview explores the principles of PAI, its applications in bone imaging, and the integration with quantitative ultrasound for comprehensive bone characterization. The outlook for PAI in bone medicine is promising, with ongoing advancements aimed at improving resolution, depth penetration, and quantitative accuracy, paving the way for its broader clinical adoption."}
