{"Abstract": "The epitranscriptome, encompassing all RNA modifications, plays a pivotal role in gene regulation and has emerged as a critical area of study in cardiovascular bioengineering. This review delves into the mechanisms of epitranscriptional regulation and its implications for cardiovascular health and disease. By examining the dynamic landscape of RNA modifications, including methylation and acetylation, we explore how these alterations influence RNA stability, translation, and function within the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of targeting the epitranscriptome for therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and hypertension. Advances in bioengineering technologies, including CRISPR-based tools and high-throughput sequencing, are enabling unprecedented insights into the epitranscriptome's role in cardiovascular biology. This synthesis of current knowledge underscores the importance of epitranscriptional regulation in cardiovascular bioengineering and its promise for innovative therapeutic strategies."}
