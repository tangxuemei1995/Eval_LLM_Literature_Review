{"Abstract": "The integration of health technologies into daily life has the potential to significantly improve healthcare outcomes. However, the design of these technologies often overlooks the nuanced needs of diverse populations, leading to disparities in access and effectiveness. This paper provides an overview of human- and equity-centered approaches for health technology design, emphasizing the importance of contextual investigation and community engagement. By prioritizing the perspectives and experiences of end-users, including marginalized communities, designers can create more inclusive and effective health solutions. The discussion highlights the role of stakeholder engagement in identifying and addressing barriers to technology adoption, ensuring that health technologies are not only accessible but also equitable. Through a review of current methodologies and case studies, this paper advocates for a paradigm shift in health technology designâ€”one that moves beyond the device to consider the broader social, cultural, and economic contexts in which technologies are used."}
