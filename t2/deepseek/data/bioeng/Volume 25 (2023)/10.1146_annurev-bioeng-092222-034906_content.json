{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of nanotechnologies with physiology-informed strategies to enhance drug delivery to the lymphatic system. Focusing on lymph nodes, we investigate bioengineered and immunoengineered biomaterials for targeted delivery. Our approach aims to optimize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure, leveraging the unique physiological characteristics of the lymphatic system. This research underscores the potential of nanotechnology in advancing precision medicine for lymphatic-targeted therapies."}
