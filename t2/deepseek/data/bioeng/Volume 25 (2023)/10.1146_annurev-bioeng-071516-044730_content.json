{"Abstract": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging represents a transformative approach for studying cellular and tissue metabolism in situ, leveraging endogenous fluorophores such as NADH and FAD. This technique capitalizes on the autofluorescence properties of these coenzymes, which are pivotal in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, to provide insights into the redox state and metabolic activity of cells without the need for exogenous labels. By employing advanced imaging modalities, including multiphoton microscopy and two-photon excited fluorescence, researchers can achieve high-resolution, three-dimensional visualization of metabolic processes in living tissues. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) offers a powerful tool for distinguishing between free and protein-bound NADH, enabling a deeper understanding of metabolic shifts in response to physiological and pathological stimuli. This review highlights the principles, applications, and recent advancements in label-free optical metabolic imaging, underscoring its potential to revolutionize our understanding of metabolism in health and disease."}
