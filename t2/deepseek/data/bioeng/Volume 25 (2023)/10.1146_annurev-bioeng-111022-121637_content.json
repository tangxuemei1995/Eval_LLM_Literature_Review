{"Abstract": "Chronic pain, a pervasive and debilitating condition, significantly impacts the quality of life for millions worldwide. This paper explores the forefront of neurotechnology applications in pain management, focusing on innovative techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). These methods offer promising avenues for alleviating chronic pain by targeting the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system pathways. DBS and SCS, through precise electrical stimulation, modulate neural activity to disrupt pain signals, while TENS provides a non-invasive approach to pain relief by stimulating nerve fibers through the skin. The review highlights recent advancements, clinical outcomes, and the potential of these technologies to revolutionize pain management strategies. By integrating findings from recent studies, this paper underscores the importance of neurotechnology in developing effective, personalized treatment plans for chronic pain sufferers, paving the way for future research and therapeutic innovations."}
