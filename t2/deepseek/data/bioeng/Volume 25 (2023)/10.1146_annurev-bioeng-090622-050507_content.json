{"Abstract": "The field of electrophysiology has witnessed significant advancements with the development of emerging penetrating neural electrodes, aimed at achieving large-scale neural recordings and long-term stability. These electrodes are designed to penetrate the neural tissue, enabling direct access to individual neurons or neural ensembles, thus providing high-resolution insights into neural activity. The pursuit of large-scale recordings is driven by the need to understand complex neural circuits and their dynamics, which is crucial for advancing neuroscience research and developing effective neural prosthetics. Concurrently, the challenge of ensuring chronic stability of these electrodes is paramount, as it directly impacts the quality and duration of neural recordings. This abstract explores the latest innovations in penetrating electrode technology, focusing on materials, design strategies, and integration techniques that enhance their scalability and longevity. The implications of these advancements for both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications are discussed, highlighting the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain and improve therapeutic outcomes."}
