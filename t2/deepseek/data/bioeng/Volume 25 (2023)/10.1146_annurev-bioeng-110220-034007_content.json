{"Abstract": "The study of lipids at the single-cell level presents unique challenges and opportunities for understanding cellular function and disease mechanisms. This review focuses on the latest analytical techniques employed for single-cell biochemical assays of lipids, including mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, capillary electrophoresis, and thin layer chromatography. Mass spectrometry offers high sensitivity and specificity for lipid identification and quantification, while Raman imaging provides label-free, spatially resolved chemical information. Capillary electrophoresis enables the separation of complex lipid mixtures with minimal sample volumes, and thin layer chromatography serves as a cost-effective method for lipid separation and preliminary analysis. Each technique's advantages, limitations, and applications in single-cell lipidomics are discussed, highlighting their potential to uncover novel insights into lipid metabolism, signaling, and interactions at the cellular level. This comprehensive overview aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methodologies for their specific single-cell lipid analysis needs."}
