{"Abstract": "The quest to understand and mitigate the effects of aging has led to significant advancements in the field of anti-aging research. This study explores current trends in anti-aging strategies, focusing on the manipulation of biological clocks, the role of cellular senescence, and the potential for rejuvenation therapies. By examining the mechanisms underlying aging and age-related diseases, including progeria, researchers are uncovering novel approaches to delay or reverse the aging process. These include genetic interventions, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacological treatments aimed at extending healthspan and lifespan. The integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as CRISPR and senolytics, offers promising avenues for combating aging at the molecular level. This review highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in developing effective anti-aging interventions, emphasizing the need for further research to translate these strategies into clinical applications. The ultimate goal is to enhance the quality of life for the aging population and to address the challenges posed by an increasingly elderly society."}
