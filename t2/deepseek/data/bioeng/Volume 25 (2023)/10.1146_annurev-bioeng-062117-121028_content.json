{"Abstract": "Dehydration poses significant health risks, necessitating accurate and timely detection to prevent adverse outcomes. This review explores the current state of noninvasive monitoring technologies aimed at detecting dehydration, with a focus on wearable devices and medical devices designed for hydration monitoring. Despite advancements in sensor technology and data analytics, challenges remain in achieving reliable, real-time hydration status assessment outside clinical settings. We evaluate the efficacy of existing solutions, including wearable sensors that measure physiological parameters such as skin conductivity, bioimpedance, and optical properties, to infer hydration levels. The discussion extends to the integration of these technologies with mobile health platforms for continuous monitoring and early warning systems. While promising, the field requires further research to enhance accuracy, user compliance, and accessibility, ensuring these innovations can effectively contribute to public health by preventing dehydration-related complications."}
