{"Abstract": "This study explores the role of neural plasticity in the development and optimization of sensorimotor brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs). By integrating sensory and motor functions, BMIs offer a unique platform to investigate how neural circuits adapt and reorganize through learning. We review recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms of plasticity that facilitate the seamless integration of artificial devices with the nervous system. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive neural circuits in enhancing BMI performance and suggest future directions for leveraging plasticity to improve the efficacy and user experience of these interfaces."}
