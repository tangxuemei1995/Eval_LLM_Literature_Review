{"Abstract": "The integration of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is pivotal for advancing precision medicine. Sexual dimorphism influences cellular behavior, tissue regeneration, and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, underscoring the necessity to consider sex differences in research and clinical applications. This review highlights the impact of sex characteristics on stem cell biology, the development of sex-specific tissue models, and the implications for personalized treatment strategies. By elucidating the molecular and physiological distinctions between sexes, we aim to foster the creation of more accurate and effective regenerative therapies. Emphasizing SABV in experimental design and clinical trials will enhance our understanding of sex-specific responses, ultimately improving outcomes in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."}
