{"Abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has revolutionized the field of personalized medicine, offering unprecedented opportunities to predict health deterioration and understand complex disease pathways. This study focuses on the development of predictive models that leverage time series data from digital health pathways to forecast disease trajectories with high accuracy. By integrating advanced ML algorithms with comprehensive datasets, we aim to identify key biomarkers and risk factors that contribute to disease progression. Our approach not only enhances the precision of early diagnosis but also facilitates the customization of treatment plans tailored to individual patient profiles. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven models in transforming healthcare delivery, enabling proactive interventions, and improving patient outcomes. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on personalized medicine, highlighting the critical role of predictive analytics in navigating the complexities of disease pathways."}
