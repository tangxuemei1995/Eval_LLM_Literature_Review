{"Abstract": "Hemolysis, the breakdown of red blood cells, releases hemoglobin, heme, and iron into the bloodstream, posing significant oxidative stress and toxicity risks. This research focuses on engineering therapeutic strategies to detoxify these byproducts, leveraging the natural scavengers haptoglobin and hemopexin. Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin, preventing its oxidative damage, while hemopexin sequesters heme, mitigating its toxic effects. Our approach involves enhancing the efficacy of these proteins through genetic and protein engineering techniques, aiming to develop novel therapeutics that can effectively neutralize the harmful effects of hemolysis. By targeting the detoxification pathways of hemoglobin, heme, and iron, this study aims to provide innovative solutions for treating hemolysis-related conditions, offering potential benefits for patients with hemolytic disorders, sepsis, and other conditions characterized by excessive hemolysis."}
