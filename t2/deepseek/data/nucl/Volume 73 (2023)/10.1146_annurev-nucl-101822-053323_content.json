{"Abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has opened new frontiers in the study of boson–boson interactions, providing unprecedented insights into the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. This research focuses on the production and analysis of diboson events, including WW, WZ, ZZ, and Wγ, which are crucial for testing the predictions of the Standard Model and probing for new physics beyond it. Vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, in particular, offer a unique window into the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and the properties of the Higgs boson. By leveraging the high-energy proton–proton collisions at the LHC, we investigate the cross-sections and kinematic distributions of these diboson events, comparing them with theoretical predictions. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental interactions between bosons, shedding light on the nature of the electroweak force and the potential existence of new particles or interactions at the TeV scale."}
