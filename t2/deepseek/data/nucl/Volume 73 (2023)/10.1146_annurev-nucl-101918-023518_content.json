{"Abstract": "The COHERENT collaboration at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) has pioneered the observation of coherent elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering (CEνNS), a process predicted by the Standard Model but unobserved until recently. This groundbreaking work not only confirms a long-standing theoretical prediction but also opens new avenues for exploring neutrino properties, supernova neutrino detection, and the search for physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark matter interactions. Utilizing the unique capabilities of the SNS, COHERENT employs a suite of low-threshold detectors to measure the tiny nuclear recoils induced by neutrino interactions. This paper reviews the experimental setup, the detection of CEνNS, and the implications of these findings for neutrino physics and dark matter research. The results from COHERENT significantly enhance our understanding of neutrino interactions and provide a novel tool for probing the universe's most elusive particles."}
