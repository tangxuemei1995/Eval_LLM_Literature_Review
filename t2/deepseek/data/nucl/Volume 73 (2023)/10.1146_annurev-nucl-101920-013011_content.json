{"Abstract": "The search for long-lived particles (LLPs) represents a pivotal frontier in particle physics, offering insights into beyond the Standard Model (BSM) phenomena. This guide focuses on strategies for hunting LLPs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), emphasizing detection techniques, experimental challenges, and theoretical motivations. By leveraging the LHC's unparalleled energy and luminosity, researchers aim to uncover LLPs, which could provide answers to fundamental questions about dark matter, neutrino masses, and the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry."}
