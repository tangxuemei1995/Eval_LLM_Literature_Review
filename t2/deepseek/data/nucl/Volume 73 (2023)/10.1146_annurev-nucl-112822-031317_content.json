{"Abstract": "This study investigates the intricate dynamics of medium response and jet–hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a critical area of research in high-energy physics aimed at understanding the properties of the quark–gluon plasma (QGP). By analyzing the interactions between high-energy jets and the QGP, we explore the phenomena of jet quenching and jet-induced medium excitation, which are pivotal for elucidating the energy loss mechanisms of partons traversing the dense medium. Our analysis leverages advanced theoretical models and experimental data to dissect the angular correlations between jets and hadrons, providing insights into the medium's response to jet propagation. The findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the QGP's transport properties and the modification of jet structures due to medium interactions. This research underscores the importance of jet–hadron correlations as a probe for the QGP, offering a pathway to unravel the complexities of matter under extreme conditions."}
