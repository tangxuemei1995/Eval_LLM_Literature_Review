{"Abstract": "The quest for understanding dark matter and neutrino interactions has led to the development of sophisticated detectors capable of identifying low-energy nuclear recoils. This study focuses on the detection and calibration techniques essential for observing coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEÎ½NS) and potential dark matter interactions. By employing neutron scatter as a calibration method, we achieve precise low-energy calibration necessary for distinguishing between dark matter signals and neutrino-induced nuclear recoils. Our research outlines the advancements in detector sensitivity and the methodologies for accurately calibrating the energy response of detectors to nuclear recoils at low energies. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts in particle physics to unravel the mysteries of dark matter and neutrino properties, providing a foundation for future experiments aiming to detect these elusive particles with unprecedented precision."}
