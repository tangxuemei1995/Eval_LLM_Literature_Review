{"Abstract": "The top quark, being the heaviest known fundamental particle, offers a unique window into physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This paper explores the pivotal role of the top quark in addressing some of the most pressing questions in particle physics, including the hierarchy problem, flavor physics anomalies, and the nature of dark matter. Through a comprehensive review of current theoretical models and experimental searches, we highlight the top quark's interactions as a probe for New Physics. The study underscores the importance of precision measurements and direct searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future colliders in uncovering BSM phenomena associated with the top quark, thereby advancing our understanding of the fundamental constituents of the universe."}
