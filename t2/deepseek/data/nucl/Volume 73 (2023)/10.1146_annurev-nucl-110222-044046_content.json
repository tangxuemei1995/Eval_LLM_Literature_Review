{"Abstract": "This review highlights recent advancements in the study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons, a pivotal area in charm physics. Leveraging the precision of lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), significant progress has been made in determining decay constants and form factors, crucial for testing the Standard Model and probing new physics. These decays offer a unique window into the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, enhancing our understanding of quark flavor transitions. Furthermore, investigations into lepton flavor universality violations in these decays provide stringent tests of the Standard Model's predictions. The synthesis of experimental data and theoretical calculations continues to refine our knowledge, paving the way for future discoveries in particle physics."}
