{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of high-energy to ultrahigh-energy neutrino interactions, a pivotal area in neutrino astrophysics. By analyzing the cross-sections and interaction mechanisms of neutrinos across a broad energy spectrum, we aim to enhance our understanding of cosmic phenomena and the fundamental properties of neutrinos. Utilizing advanced computational models and data from leading neutrino observatories, our research contributes to the ongoing quest to decipher the universe's most energetic processes and the role of neutrinos therein."}
