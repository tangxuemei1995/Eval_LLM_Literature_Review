{"Abstract": "Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy represents a frontier in astrophysics, offering insights into the most energetic processes in the universe. This field leverages advanced observatories like the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) to detect gamma rays with energies exceeding the PeV (peta-electronvolt) scale, thereby identifying potential PeVatronsâ€”cosmic accelerators capable of producing such high-energy particles. The study of these gamma rays, alongside cosmic rays, provides a unique window into the acceleration mechanisms and environments of extreme astrophysical objects, including the Crab Nebula, a well-known gamma-ray source. A key aspect of this research involves the analysis of extensive air showers (EAS) generated when these high-energy particles interact with the Earth's atmosphere. The muon content within these showers serves as a critical diagnostic tool, helping to distinguish between gamma-ray and cosmic ray origins. This distinction is vital for understanding the composition and propagation of cosmic rays, as well as for identifying the sources of ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Through the integration of observational data from LHAASO and theoretical models, this research aims to unravel the mysteries of PeVatrons, shedding light on the acceleration of particles to ultra-high energies and their implications for our understanding of the universe."}
