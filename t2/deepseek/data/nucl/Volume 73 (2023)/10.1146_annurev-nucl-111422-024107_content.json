{"Abstract": "The Hubble tension, a discrepancy between the local and early Universe measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), poses a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model, Î›CDM. This tension has prompted a reevaluation of our understanding of the Universe's expansion rate and the underlying physics governing it. Among the proposed solutions, Early Dark Energy (EDE) has emerged as a compelling candidate. EDE posits the existence of a new form of energy that becomes significant prior to recombination, altering the sound horizon and thereby affecting the inferred value of H0 from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. This paper reviews the current state of research on the Hubble tension, with a focus on the role of EDE in reconciling the discrepancy. We examine the theoretical underpinnings of EDE, its implications for the early Universe, and the constraints imposed by current cosmological data. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and prospects for future observations and theoretical developments in resolving the Hubble tension. The exploration of EDE not only offers a potential pathway to understanding the Hubble tension but also enriches our comprehension of the Universe's evolution, highlighting the intricate interplay between cosmology and fundamental physics."}
