{"Abstract": "This study investigates the presence of radioisotopes in deep-sea sediments and lunar samples, attributed to nearby astrophysical explosions such as supernovae. Utilizing accelerator mass spectrometry, we analyze the isotopic signatures of r-process elements, which are synthesized in such cataclysmic events. Our findings reveal a temporal correlation between the deposition of these isotopes and historical supernova events, providing insights into the nucleosynthesis processes and the distribution of cosmic material in the solar system. This research not only enhances our understanding of the chemical evolution of the galaxy but also offers a novel approach to dating astrophysical phenomena through the analysis of extraterrestrial and terrestrial samples."}
