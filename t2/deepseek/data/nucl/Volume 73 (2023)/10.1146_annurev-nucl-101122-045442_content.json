{"Abstract": "This study investigates the phenomena of Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) and Lepton Flavor Universality Violation (LFUV) in the decays of heavy mesons containing b and c quarks, as observed by the LHCb experiment. By analyzing the symmetries of fundamental interactions and comparing experimental results with predictions from the Standard Model (SM), we explore potential physics beyond the SM. The research focuses on anomalies in decay rates and angular distributions that suggest deviations from lepton universality, hinting at new particles or interactions not accounted for in the SM. Through a comprehensive review of recent data and theoretical models, this work aims to shed light on the nature of these violations and their implications for our understanding of particle physics."}
