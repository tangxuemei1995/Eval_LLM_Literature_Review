{"Abstract": "This study delves into the s-process (slow neutron capture process) of nucleosynthesis, a fundamental mechanism responsible for the creation of approximately half of the atomic nuclei heavier than iron in the universe. By examining the intricate nuclear reactions and neutron captures occurring within Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and massive stars, we aim to elucidate the conditions and environments conducive to the s-process. Furthermore, this research explores the implications of stellar spectroscopy and meteoritic anomalies in understanding the distribution and abundance of s-process elements. Our findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis, and the chemical evolution of the galaxy, offering insights into the cosmic origins of heavy elements beyond the s-process."}
