{"Abstract": "The gauge hierarchy problem, a central issue in particle physics, questions the vast disparity between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale, particularly in the context of the Higgs boson mass. This paper explores innovative solutions to this enduring problem, focusing on the principles of naturalness and relaxation mechanisms. We delve into the theoretical frameworks that extend beyond the Standard Model, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and composite Higgs models, which aim to stabilize the Higgs mass without fine-tuning. Additionally, we examine the relaxation approach, where dynamical processes during the early universe could naturally select the observed electroweak scale. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements and critical analysis of existing models, this study highlights the potential pathways towards resolving the hierarchy problem. Our findings suggest that a combination of theoretical innovation and experimental verification is essential for uncovering the underlying principles that govern the mass scales in the universe. This research contributes to the ongoing quest for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics and the quest for naturalness in the laws of nature."}
