{"Abstract": "This study explores the implications of large-Nc Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction, leveraging the framework of effective field theories (EFTs) to systematically analyze two-nucleon and few-nucleon interactions. By examining the behavior of QCD in the limit of a large number of colors (Nc), we derive insights into the underlying symmetries and dynamics governing nuclear forces. Our analysis reveals that large-Nc QCD provides a robust foundation for understanding the hierarchy of nuclear interactions, offering a novel perspective on the effective range expansion and the role of pion exchange. The findings underscore the utility of large-Nc QCD in refining EFTs for nuclear physics, paving the way for more accurate predictions of nuclear properties and reactions."}
