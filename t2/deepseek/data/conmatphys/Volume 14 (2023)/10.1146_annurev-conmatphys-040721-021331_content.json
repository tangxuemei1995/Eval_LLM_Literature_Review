{"Abstract": "The study of Fermiology in topological metals has emerged as a pivotal area in condensed matter physics, offering profound insights into the interplay between geometry, topology, and quantum phenomena. This research delves into the intricate Fermi surface topologies of Diracâ€“Weyl semimetals, where the unique electronic structures give rise to exotic quantum oscillations and Berry phase effects. By employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical models, we explore the conditions under which magnetic breakdown occurs, revealing the complex dynamics of electron trajectories in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The investigation highlights the role of the Berry phase in modulating the quantum oscillation patterns, providing a deeper understanding of the topological invariants that govern the electronic properties of these materials. Furthermore, the research underscores the significance of geometry and topology in shaping the Fermi surface, leading to novel quantum states and transport phenomena. Through a comprehensive analysis of experimental data and theoretical predictions, this study contributes to the broader understanding of topological metals, paving the way for future explorations in quantum materials and their potential applications in next-generation electronic devices."}
