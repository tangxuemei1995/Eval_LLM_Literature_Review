{"Abstract": "This study delves into the physics of human crowds, exploring the intricate dynamics and emergent phenomena akin to active matter systems. By integrating principles from social physics and conducting observational experiments, we analyze pedestrian flows to uncover patterns and behaviors that emerge from individual interactions. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of crowd dynamics, offering insights that could inform the design of safer public spaces and improve crowd management strategies."}
