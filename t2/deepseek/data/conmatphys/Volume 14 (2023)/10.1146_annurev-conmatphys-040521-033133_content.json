{"Abstract": "Non-Hermitian topological phenomena have emerged as a vibrant field of research, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian physics and topological phase transitions. This review delves into the intricate interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and topological properties, highlighting the unique aspects that distinguish them from their Hermitian counterparts. We explore the fundamental principles underlying non-Hermitian topological phases, including the modification of bulk-boundary correspondence and the implications for spectral theory. The discussion encompasses recent advancements in understanding the robustness of topological states in the presence of non-Hermiticity, as well as the novel phenomena arising from exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects. By synthesizing key theoretical insights and experimental observations, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in non-Hermitian topological phenomena, paving the way for future explorations in this rapidly evolving domain."}
