{"Abstract": "Tensor Network Algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool in computational physics, offering a novel approach to the numerical simulation of quantum many-body systems. By leveraging the principles of quantum information and entanglement, these algorithms provide an efficient framework for understanding complex quantum phenomena. This paper presents a comprehensive route map of Tensor Network Algorithms, detailing their development, theoretical underpinnings, and practical applications. We explore their role in advancing our understanding of quantum systems, highlighting their ability to tackle problems that are intractable with traditional methods. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of Tensor Network Algorithms in various domains of physics, underscoring their potential to revolutionize the field of numerical simulations in quantum physics."}
