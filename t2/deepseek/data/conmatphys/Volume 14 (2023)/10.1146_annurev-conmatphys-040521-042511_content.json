{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between superconductivity and local inversion-symmetry breaking, with a focus on the emergence of topological and unconventional superconductivity. By examining the role of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and hidden spin polarization, we uncover novel mechanisms that drive the superconducting state in materials lacking global inversion symmetry. Our analysis reveals that local inversion-symmetry breaking can significantly enhance the superconducting transition temperature and induce exotic pairing symmetries, which are pivotal for the realization of topological superconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and hidden spin polarization leads to unique electronic properties, such as spin-momentum locking and protected surface states, which are essential for the development of spintronic devices. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles governing superconductivity in inversion-asymmetric systems, offering new insights for the design of advanced quantum materials."}
