{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of Floquet states within open quantum systems, a critical area of research in nonequilibrium statistical physics. By leveraging the Floquet theory, which provides a framework for understanding periodically driven quantum systems, we investigate the stability and coherence of these states when subjected to environmental interactions. Our analysis focuses on the interplay between the periodic driving forces and the dissipative effects induced by the environment, aiming to uncover the conditions under which Floquet states can maintain their coherence and thus be harnessed for quantum technologies. Through a combination of theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we identify key parameters that influence the robustness of Floquet states against decoherence, offering insights into the design of more resilient quantum systems for applications in quantum computing and information processing."}
