{"Abstract": "The Spin Seebeck Effect (SSE) has emerged as a powerful tool for probing the intricate dynamics of elementary excitations, spin correlations, transport phenomena, magnetic order, and domain structures in solid-state systems. This effect, which generates a spin current from a temperature gradient, bridges the gap between spin caloritronics and antiferromagnetic spintronics, offering insights into the interplay of heat and spin degrees of freedom. By leveraging the inverse spin Hall effect, SSE facilitates the detection of spin currents, enabling the study of magnon dynamics and their interactions with nuclear spins in various materials, including quantum spin liquids. This review highlights the sensitivity of SSE to the underlying magnetic and thermal properties of solids, underscoring its potential as a versatile probe for advancing our understanding of spin-related phenomena in condensed matter physics."}
