{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intriguing phenomena of odd viscosity and odd elasticity within the framework of continuum and fluid mechanics, particularly in the context of nonequilibrium systems and active matter. By integrating principles from hydrodynamics and rheology, we explore the unique mechanical responses that arise in systems where time-reversal symmetry is broken, leading to non-dissipative, parity-odd transport coefficients. Our analysis sheds light on the implications of these odd properties for the behavior of complex fluids and soft materials, offering new insights into the design and control of active systems. Through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental observations, we aim to establish a comprehensive understanding of how odd viscosity and elasticity influence the dynamics and stability of nonequilibrium materials."}
