{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of active colloids, focusing on the transition from simple Active Brownian Particles (ABPs) to systems influenced by hydrodynamic and chemical fields. By employing advanced numerical modeling techniques, we explore the behavior of microswimmers in complex environments, emphasizing the role of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. Our research sheds light on the collective dynamics within active baths and the operational mechanisms of active engines, providing insights into the self-organization and propulsion strategies of these systems. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing active matter, offering potential applications in the design of synthetic microswimmers and the manipulation of active colloidal systems in various technological and biomedical contexts."}
