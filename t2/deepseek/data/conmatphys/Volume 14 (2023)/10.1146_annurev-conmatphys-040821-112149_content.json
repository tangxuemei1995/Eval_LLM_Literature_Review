{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of swimming in complex fluids, focusing on the interplay between locomotion and the unique properties of soft and active matter. By examining the behavior of microswimmers in biological fluids and active suspensions, we aim to uncover the fundamental principles governing movement in environments characterized by non-Newtonian fluid dynamics. Our research integrates theoretical models with experimental observations to analyze how the viscoelasticity and activity of the surrounding medium influence propulsion efficiency and swimming strategies. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of biological locomotion and have potential applications in the design of synthetic microswimmers for targeted drug delivery and other biomedical applications."}
