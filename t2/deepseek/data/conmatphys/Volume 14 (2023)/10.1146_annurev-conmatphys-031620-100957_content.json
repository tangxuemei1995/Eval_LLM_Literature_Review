{"Abstract": "The quest for sustainable energy solutions has intensified the search for robust materials capable of efficient photocatalytic energy conversion. This study leverages a data-driven approach to identify and evaluate materials with optimal photocatalytic properties, focusing on their aqueous stability and efficiency in energy conversion processes. By integrating computational models with experimental data, we systematically screen a vast array of compounds to uncover those with the highest potential for renewable energy applications. Our methodology emphasizes the importance of material stability in aqueous environments, a critical factor for the longevity and effectiveness of photocatalytic systems. The findings highlight promising candidates that exhibit superior photocatalytic activity, stability, and scalability, paving the way for their application in solar energy conversion and storage. This research contributes to the accelerated discovery of materials for renewable energy technologies, offering a pathway towards more sustainable and efficient energy systems."}
