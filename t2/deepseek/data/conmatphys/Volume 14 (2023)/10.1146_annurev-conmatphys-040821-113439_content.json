{"Abstract": "This paper explores the paradigm of learning without neurons in physical systems, a frontier that extends the principles of machine learning and learning theory into the realm of physical materials and processes. We investigate how physical systems, ranging from metamaterials to molecular computing architectures, can embody learning mechanisms through inverse design and self-assembly. By leveraging the inherent properties of these systems, such as their response to external stimuli and their ability to self-organize, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve complex computational tasks without the need for traditional neural networks. This approach not only broadens our understanding of learning in non-biological systems but also opens up new avenues for the development of energy-efficient and scalable computing technologies. Through a series of case studies, we highlight the potential of physical learning in advancing fields such as material science, computational physics, and beyond, offering a fresh perspective on the future of machine learning and artificial intelligence."}
