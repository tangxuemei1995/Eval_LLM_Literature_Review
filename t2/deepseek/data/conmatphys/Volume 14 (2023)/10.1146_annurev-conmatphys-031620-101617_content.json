{"Abstract": "This study explores the phenomenon of Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) through the lens of quasiparticle theory, offering a novel perspective on their role in disrupting the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) within quantum systems. By analyzing the constrained dynamics and out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, we identify how QMBS can lead to non-ergodic behavior in systems that would otherwise be expected to thermalize. Our findings suggest that the presence of QMBS introduces a form of quantum chaos that is distinct from the conventional thermalization pathway, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that allow certain quantum states to evade thermalization. This research contributes to the broader field of quantum dynamics by highlighting the significance of quasiparticle interactions in the formation and stability of QMBS, thereby offering new insights into the control and manipulation of quantum systems for technological applications."}
