{"Abstract": "This paper explores the pivotal role of microdata in enhancing the understanding and modeling of macro-financial dynamics. By leveraging detailed individual-level data, we address the critical challenges of identification and aggregation that are central to bridging microeconomic behaviors with macroeconomic outcomes. Our analysis underscores the importance of microdata in uncovering the heterogeneous responses of economic agents to financial shocks, thereby enriching the granularity of macro-financial models. We propose a methodological framework that systematically integrates microdata into macro-finance research, emphasizing the identification of causal relationships and the aggregation of micro-level insights into coherent macroeconomic narratives. Through a series of empirical applications, we demonstrate how microdata can illuminate the mechanisms driving financial cycles, inform the design of more effective monetary and fiscal policies, and enhance the predictive accuracy of macroeconomic models. This study contributes to the growing literature on the intersection of microeconomics and macro-finance, offering a roadmap for researchers to harness the power of microdata in addressing complex macroeconomic questions."}
