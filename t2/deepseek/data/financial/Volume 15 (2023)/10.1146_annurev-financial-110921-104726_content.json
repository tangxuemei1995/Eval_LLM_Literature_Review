{"Abstract": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between inflation and asset returns, focusing on the dynamics of risk premia and bond return predictability across varying economic conditions, including periods of stagflation. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple decades, we analyze the impact of inflation on different asset classes, emphasizing the role of monetary policy in shaping investor expectations and market outcomes. Our findings reveal that inflation significantly influences risk premia, with distinct patterns emerging during stagflationary periods. Furthermore, we uncover evidence of bond return predictability linked to inflation expectations, offering insights for portfolio management and policy formulation. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on inflation's multifaceted effects on financial markets."}
