{"Abstract": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a pivotal concept in financial economics, serving as a cornerstone for government valuation, fair value accounting, and budgetary accounting practices. This paper critically examines the capabilities and limitations of financial economics in elucidating the SDR, particularly in the context of government cost of capital. While financial economics offers robust frameworks for understanding risk, return, and the time value of money, its application to the SDR is fraught with complexities. These include the challenge of reconciling market-based approaches with ethical considerations, intergenerational equity, and the non-market valuation of public goods. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this study highlights the nuanced interplay between economic theory and practical policy-making. It argues for a multidisciplinary approach to the SDR, one that integrates insights from financial economics with those from environmental economics, ethics, and public policy. The paper concludes with reflections on the implications of these findings for future research and policy formulation, emphasizing the need for a more holistic understanding of the SDR in government decision-making processes."}
