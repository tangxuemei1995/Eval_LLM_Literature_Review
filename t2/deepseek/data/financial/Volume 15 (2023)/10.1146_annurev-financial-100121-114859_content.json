{"Abstract": "This study delves into the historical panorama of banking crises, examining their causes, consequences, and the pivotal role of financial intermediation in exacerbating or mitigating these events. By analyzing a series of case studies from different epochs, the research highlights the critical function of the lender of last resort in maintaining financial stability during periods of distress. Furthermore, it explores the impact of leverage on the fragility of the banking sector, drawing parallels between past and present financial systems. The paper aims to distill historical lessons that can inform current regulatory frameworks and policy responses, emphasizing the importance of prudent financial oversight and the need for adaptive mechanisms to prevent future crises. Through this historical lens, the study contributes to the ongoing discourse on financial stability and the prevention of banking crises."}
