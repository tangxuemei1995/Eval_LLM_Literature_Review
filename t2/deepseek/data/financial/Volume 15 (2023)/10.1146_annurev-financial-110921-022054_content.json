{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving landscape of state and local pension funds, focusing on the challenges and trends that have emerged in recent years. With public pensions under increasing strain due to demographic shifts, economic fluctuations, and policy changes, this research delves into the implications for state and local governments. It explores the rising pension costs, the impact on government debt levels, and the strategies employed to manage these pressures. Through a comprehensive analysis of retirement policies and funding mechanisms, the paper highlights the critical need for sustainable solutions to ensure the long-term viability of public pension systems. The findings underscore the importance of innovative approaches to pension management, aiming to balance the needs of current and future retirees with the fiscal realities faced by state and local governments."}
