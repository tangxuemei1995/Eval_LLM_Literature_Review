{"Abstract": "In the era of data-driven decision-making, algorithmic fairness has emerged as a critical concern, particularly in applications like credit scoring where decisions can significantly impact individuals' lives. This study delves into the complexities of ensuring fairness in machine learning algorithms, which are increasingly employed to automate and scale decision-making processes. We explore the inherent biases that can be perpetuated or exacerbated by these algorithms, stemming from biased training data or flawed model assumptions. The research focuses on the development and application of fairness metrics designed to quantify and mitigate bias, ensuring that algorithms treat all individuals equitably, regardless of sensitive attributes such as race or gender. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies in credit scoring, we propose a framework for integrating fairness considerations into the algorithmic design process. Our findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving algorithmic fairness, combining insights from computer science, ethics, and social sciences to develop algorithms that are not only accurate but also just and equitable."}
