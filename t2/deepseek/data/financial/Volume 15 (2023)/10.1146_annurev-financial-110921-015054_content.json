{"Abstract": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative short-term rate benchmarks marks a pivotal shift in the financial landscape. This paper explores the post-LIBOR regime, focusing on the adoption and implications of new benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), American Interbank Offered Rate (Ameribor), Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), and the AXI. These benchmarks, categorized into risk-free rates and credit-sensitive rates, aim to address the shortcomings of LIBOR by providing more reliable and transparent reference rates for interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments. The study delves into the operational, regulatory, and market challenges associated with this transition, including the recalibration of financial contracts, the development of liquidity in new benchmark markets, and the impact on pricing and risk management practices. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of each alternative rate, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the future of rate benchmarks, offering insights into the evolving dynamics of global financial markets in the post-LIBOR era."}
