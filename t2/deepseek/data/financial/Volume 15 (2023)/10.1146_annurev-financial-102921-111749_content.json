{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the current methodologies employed in public discounting systems, with a particular focus on their application in risk adjustment, carbon pricing, and cost-benefit analysis. The study identifies significant discrepancies and inefficiencies in the way future costs and benefits are discounted, which can lead to suboptimal policy decisions, especially in the context of environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation. By analyzing a range of case studies and theoretical models, the research proposes a revised framework for discounting that incorporates more accurate risk assessments and a more nuanced understanding of long-term environmental impacts. The findings suggest that adopting a more dynamic and context-sensitive approach to discounting can enhance the effectiveness of public policies aimed at addressing complex societal challenges. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on public finance and environmental economics by offering practical recommendations for policymakers to improve the fairness and efficiency of public discounting systems."}
