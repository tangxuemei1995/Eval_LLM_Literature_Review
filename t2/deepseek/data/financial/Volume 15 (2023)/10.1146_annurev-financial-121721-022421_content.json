{"Abstract": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of long-term projects and policies, particularly those with significant intertemporal and intergenerational implications. This paper delves into the legal and philosophical foundations that underpin the determination and application of the SDR in benefit-cost analysis. By examining the ethical considerations and legal frameworks that influence the choice of discount rates, the study highlights the tension between present and future generations' welfare. The analysis reveals that the selection of an appropriate SDR is not merely a technical decision but a deeply normative one, reflecting societal values regarding equity, sustainability, and the rights of future generations. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this research underscores the importance of integrating philosophical insights and legal principles into the discourse on discounting, aiming to foster a more equitable and sustainable approach to long-term decision-making."}
