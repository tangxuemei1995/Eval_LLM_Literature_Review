{"Abstract": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) plays a pivotal role in the valuation of government projects and public investments, particularly in the context of long-term environmental policies such as the cost of carbon. This theme explores the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of the SDR, emphasizing its significance in making intergenerational trade-offs. By balancing present costs against future benefits, the SDR serves as a critical tool in ensuring that public investments are both economically viable and ethically justifiable across generations. The discussion delves into the challenges of determining an appropriate SDR, considering factors such as uncertainty, risk, and the moral considerations of valuing future welfare. Through a comprehensive analysis, this theme aims to provide insights into the complexities of applying the SDR in policy-making, highlighting its impact on sustainable development and the equitable distribution of resources over time."}
