{"Abstract": "This study explores the implications of missing participants and incomplete markets on the determination of the social discount rate, focusing on the roles of borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. By integrating these factors into a unified framework, we analyze how the absence of certain market participants and the limitations in market completeness affect intertemporal decision-making and resource allocation across generations. Our findings suggest that altruism and the desire for legacy significantly influence the social discount rate, especially in contexts where borrowing constraints and incomplete markets limit the ability of individuals to transfer resources across time. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on the appropriate social discount rate for policy evaluation, highlighting the importance of considering non-market factors and intergenerational equity in economic models."}
