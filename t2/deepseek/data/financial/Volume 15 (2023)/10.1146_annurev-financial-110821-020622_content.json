{"Abstract": "This study examines the unprecedented disruptions in fixed income markets during the COVID-19 crisis, focusing on the mechanisms through which the pandemic affected market liquidity, pricing, and investor behavior. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning pre- and post-crisis periods, we analyze the impact of fiscal and monetary policy interventions on market stability and recovery. Our findings reveal significant volatility and liquidity shortages, particularly in corporate and municipal bonds, highlighting the role of central bank actions in restoring market functioning. The research contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the crisis's effects on fixed income markets and offering insights into the effectiveness of policy responses in mitigating financial market disruptions during global health emergencies."}
