{"Abstract": "This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of sovereign debt, exploring the persistent puzzles that challenge conventional economic theories. By analyzing patterns of sovereign default and the accumulation of public debt, we aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive countries to borrow beyond sustainable levels and the factors that precipitate defaults. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple decades and countries, our study employs advanced econometric techniques to test prevailing hypotheses and propose novel explanations. The findings shed light on the role of political economy factors, international financial markets, and institutional frameworks in shaping sovereign debt outcomes. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on debt sustainability and offers policy recommendations to mitigate the risks of sovereign default."}
