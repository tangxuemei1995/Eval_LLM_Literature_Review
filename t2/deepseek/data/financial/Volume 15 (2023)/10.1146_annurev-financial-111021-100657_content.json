{"Abstract": "The landscape of public offerings has witnessed significant evolution with the emergence of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) alongside traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). This study delves into recent developments within these mechanisms, focusing on their implications for unicorn companies and the broader market. We explore the strategic considerations behind choosing SPACs over IPOs, including the allure of confidential filings and the flexibility of direct listings. Additionally, the paper examines the contentious issue of dual-class shares, a feature increasingly prevalent in both IPOs and SPAC transactions, and its impact on corporate governance and shareholder rights. Through a comprehensive analysis of current trends and case studies, this research aims to provide insights into the shifting paradigms of public offerings and their future trajectory."}
