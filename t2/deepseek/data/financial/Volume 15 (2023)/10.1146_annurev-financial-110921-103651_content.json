{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of fiscal policy and asset pricing, focusing on the concept of fiscal capacity from an asset pricing perspective. By analyzing the term structure of interest rates and the maturity of government debt, we investigate how fiscal capacity influences the convenience yield of government securities. Our findings suggest that fiscal capacity, as a measure of a government's ability to meet its financial obligations, plays a crucial role in determining the pricing of sovereign debt. This research contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms through which fiscal policy affects financial markets, offering insights into the pricing of risk and the valuation of government debt."}
