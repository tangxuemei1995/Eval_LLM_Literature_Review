{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives within the financial markets, focusing on their role in hedging against inflation risk. Utilizing the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework, we analyze the term structure of interest rates and its implications for pricing inflation-indexed securities. The research delves into the mechanisms of inflation swaps and derivatives, assessing their effectiveness in predicting the break-even inflation rate. By integrating theoretical models with empirical data, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these financial instruments can be utilized to manage inflation expectations and risk, offering valuable insights for investors and policymakers in navigating the complexities of inflation-linked investments."}
