{"Abstract": "The advent of blockchain technology has ushered in a new era of financial systems, notably through the development of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi). This paper explores the transformative potential of DeFi, focusing on its core components such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), protocols for loanable funds (PLFs), and the utilization of tokens on platforms like Ethereum. By eliminating intermediaries, DeFi offers a more inclusive, transparent, and efficient financial ecosystem. However, challenges such as scalability, security, and regulatory compliance remain. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of DeFi, its underlying technologies, and the implications for the future of finance."}
