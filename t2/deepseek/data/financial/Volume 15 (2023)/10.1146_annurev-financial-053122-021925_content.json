{"Abstract": "This study revisits the dynamics of pari-mutuel betting markets, focusing on racetracks and lotteries, to explore the efficiency of these markets and the presence of the favorite-longshot bias. Utilizing stochastic programming optimization models, we analyze betting strategies and their outcomes, aiming to identify patterns that could lead to more informed decision-making by bettors. Our investigation sheds light on the operational mechanisms of these markets, offering insights into how they might be optimized for both bettors and operators. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on gambling economics, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors that influence betting behavior and market efficiency in the context of pari-mutuel systems."}
