{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of nonlinear dynamics into macro-finance models, focusing on Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) frameworks. By incorporating systemic risk, endogenous jump risk, financial constraints, and liquidity considerations, we aim to enhance the predictive accuracy and policy relevance of these models. Our analysis reveals that nonlinearities significantly affect the transmission of financial shocks to the real economy, highlighting the importance of accounting for complex interactions between financial markets and macroeconomic variables. The findings suggest that models with nonlinear dynamics can better capture the nuances of financial crises and the role of policy interventions, offering valuable insights for both academics and policymakers."}
