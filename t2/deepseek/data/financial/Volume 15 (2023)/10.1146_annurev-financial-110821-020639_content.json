{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of epidemiological modeling in understanding and forecasting the spread of infectious diseases. This study delves into the application of various epidemiological models to predict the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, assessing their accuracy and utility in informing public health responses. By analyzing data from diverse geographical regions, we evaluate the effectiveness of these models in capturing the complexities of disease spread, including the impact of interventions such as social distancing and vaccination campaigns. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating real-time data and adapting models to reflect evolving epidemiological contexts, offering insights into optimizing model-based strategies for pandemic preparedness and response."}
