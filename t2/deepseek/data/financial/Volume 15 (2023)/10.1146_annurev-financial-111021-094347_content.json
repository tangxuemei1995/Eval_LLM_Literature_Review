{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolving landscape of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) within the context of sustainable finance and corporate decarbonization efforts. Focusing on the role of responsible shareholder mandates, the research investigates how these mandates influence corporate behavior towards reducing negative externalities and promoting environmental sustainability. The concept of 'greeniums'—premiums associated with green investments—is examined as a financial incentive for corporations to adopt more sustainable practices. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and case studies, this paper highlights the mechanisms by which CSR initiatives can drive corporate decarbonization, contributing to a more sustainable economic system. The findings suggest that responsible shareholder mandates and the pursuit of greeniums not only enhance corporate reputation but also offer a competitive advantage in the transition towards a low-carbon economy."}
