{"Abstract": "This paper explores the concept of swing pricing within mutual funds, a mechanism designed to mitigate the adverse effects of liquidity transformation and potential fire sales. By adjusting the net asset value (NAV) of fund shares in response to significant purchase or redemption activities, swing pricing aims to protect existing shareholders from the costs associated with excessive trading. Through a comprehensive review of theoretical models and empirical evidence, we analyze the effectiveness of swing pricing in managing liquidity risks and its impact on investor behavior. Our findings suggest that swing pricing can serve as a valuable tool for liquidity management, reducing the likelihood of fire sales and promoting a more stable investment environment. However, the implementation of swing pricing also raises questions regarding its influence on market efficiency and the equitable treatment of investors."}
