{"Abstract": "Climate change poses significant risks to financial stability, necessitating the development of robust methodologies for climate stress testing. This paper explores the integration of climate risk into financial stability assessments, focusing on the identification and quantification of systemic risks arising from environmental changes. By leveraging a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, we propose a framework for conducting climate stress tests that account for both physical and transition risks. Physical risks, stemming from direct climate impacts such as extreme weather events, and transition risks, associated with the shift towards a low-carbon economy, are analyzed to understand their potential effects on financial systems. The study highlights the importance of scenario analysis and forward-looking assessments in capturing the complex dynamics of climate-related financial risks. Furthermore, it discusses the role of regulatory bodies and financial institutions in enhancing resilience against climate-induced shocks. The findings underscore the need for a collaborative approach among policymakers, regulators, and the financial sector to develop standardized stress testing practices that can effectively mitigate climate risks and safeguard financial stability in the face of an uncertain environmental future."}
