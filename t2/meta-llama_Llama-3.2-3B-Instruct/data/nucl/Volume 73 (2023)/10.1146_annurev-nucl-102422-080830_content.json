{"Abstract": "The gauge hierarchy problem is a long-standing challenge in particle physics, where the large mass of the Higgs boson is difficult to reconcile with the small masses of gauge bosons. Recent advances in theoretical frameworks and experimental discoveries have led to the development of novel solutions to this problem. This review article provides an overview of the latest approaches to addressing the gauge hierarchy problem, with a focus on the relaxation of naturalness constraints. We discuss the role of new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as extra dimensions and modified gravity, in resolving the hierarchy problem. Additionally, we examine the implications of the Higgs boson's properties, including its mass and couplings, on our understanding of the gauge hierarchy. Our analysis highlights the potential of a more nuanced understanding of naturalness and the importance of considering alternative frameworks for resolving the gauge hierarchy problem. By exploring these new solutions, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and shed light on the long-standing challenge of the gauge hierarchy problem."}
