{"Abstract": "This review article discusses recent advances in the search for lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFU) in b and c decays, with a focus on the LHCb experiment. LFV and LFU are key signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model, and their observation would have significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental interactions. The LHCb experiment has reported intriguing results in various channels, including B0s → μ+μ- and Bc → Dsμ+μ-, which have sparked intense interest and debate in the physics community. This article provides an overview of the current status of LFV and LFU searches, highlighting the latest results and the underlying theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain these phenomena."}
