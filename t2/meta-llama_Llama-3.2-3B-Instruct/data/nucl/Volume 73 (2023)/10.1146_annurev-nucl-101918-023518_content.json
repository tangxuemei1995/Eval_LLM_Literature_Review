{"Abstract": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) using a low-background setup. This process is a promising tool for detecting supernova neutrinos and potentially probing dark matter. By analyzing the scattering of neutrinos off a target material, the COHERENT collaboration seeks to constrain models of neutrino interactions and dark matter. The experiment's unique combination of high neutrino flux, low background rates, and precise energy resolution enables the detection of subtle signals that could be indicative of new physics. Preliminary results from the COHERENT experiment have shown promising signs of CEvNS, with implications for our understanding of neutrino physics and the search for dark matter."}
