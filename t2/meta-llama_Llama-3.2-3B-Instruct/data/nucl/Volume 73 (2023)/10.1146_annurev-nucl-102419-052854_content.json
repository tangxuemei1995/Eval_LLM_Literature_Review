{"Abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has revolutionized our understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics by providing unprecedented insights into the properties of the top quark, the heaviest known particle. This review appraises the current state of knowledge on the top quark, focusing on its production and decay modes, cross-section measurements, and implications for the Standard Model. The LHC data have consistently confirmed the predictions of the Standard Model, with precise measurements of the top quark mass and width. However, the search for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions, remains an active area of research. The upcoming LHC upgrades and future colliders, such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), will provide new opportunities to probe the strong and electroweak interactions, as well as the Higgs boson sector, in unprecedented detail. This appraisal and outlook highlights the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the physics of the top quark at the LHC, and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries in the years to come."}
