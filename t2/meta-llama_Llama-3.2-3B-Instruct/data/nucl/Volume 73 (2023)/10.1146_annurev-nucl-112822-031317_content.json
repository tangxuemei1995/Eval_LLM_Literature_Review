{"Abstract": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have been used to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in these collisions. Medium response and jet-hadron correlations are crucial probes of the QGP's interaction with jets, which are high-energy quanta of gluons. This review article focuses on the latest experimental and theoretical developments in the study of medium response and jet-hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We discuss the experimental results from RHIC and LHC, including the measurement of jet-quenching and jet-induced medium excitation. We also review the theoretical frameworks that describe these phenomena, including the use of effective theories and numerical simulations. The review highlights the importance of medium response and jet-hadron correlations in understanding the QGP's properties and the jet-quenching mechanism, and discusses future directions for experimental and theoretical research in this area."}
