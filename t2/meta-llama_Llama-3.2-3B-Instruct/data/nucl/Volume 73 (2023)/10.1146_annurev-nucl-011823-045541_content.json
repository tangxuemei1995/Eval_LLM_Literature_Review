{"Abstract": "This study investigates the presence of deep-sea and lunar radioisotopes resulting from nearby astrophysical explosions, specifically supernovae. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) analysis of deep-sea sediments and lunar samples reveals the presence of r-process elements, indicative of explosive nucleosynthesis. The isotopic signatures of these elements are compared to those produced in supernovae, suggesting a connection between these events and the formation of the Earth's crust. The findings provide new insights into the astrophysical origins of the Earth's heavy elements and the potential for AMS to be used as a tool for tracing the history of our planet's formation."}
