{"Abstract": "The Standard Model of particle physics has been remarkably successful in describing the behavior of fundamental particles and forces, yet it falls short in addressing several long-standing puzzles, including the hierarchy problem and the nature of dark matter. Recent studies have focused on the top quark as a potential gateway to new physics beyond the Standard Model. This review article examines the current state of research on top quark physics, with a particular emphasis on its connection to the hierarchy problem, flavor physics, and dark matter. We discuss the latest experimental and theoretical developments, including the search for supersymmetric partners and the role of extra dimensions in resolving the hierarchy problem."}
