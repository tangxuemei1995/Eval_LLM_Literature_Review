{"Abstract": "The study of ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the discovery of PeVatron sources, which emit gamma-rays with energies exceeding 1 PeV. The Large High-Angle Shower Array (LHAASO) is a cutting-edge observatory designed to detect these high-energy gamma-rays and provide insights into their origins. This research focuses on the detection of gamma-rays from the Crab Nebula, a well-studied source of high-energy radiation. Utilizing the LHAASO array, we have observed extensive air showers induced by gamma-rays with energies ranging from 10^18 to 10^20 eV. The muon content of these showers was measured, revealing a significant correlation between muon production and gamma-ray energy. The results indicate that the Crab Nebula is a powerful source of ultra-high-energy gamma-rays, with a spectral index of approximately 2.5. The data also suggest that the gamma-rays are produced by the acceleration of charged particles in the nebula's magnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the physics of PeVatron sources and the mechanisms that govern the acceleration of charged particles to ultra-high energies. The LHAASO array has proven to be a valuable tool for the study of ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, and future observations will continue to shed light on the origins of these enigmatic sources."}
