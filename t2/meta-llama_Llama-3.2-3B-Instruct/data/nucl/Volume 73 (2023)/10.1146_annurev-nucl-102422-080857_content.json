{"Abstract": "This review article delves into the complex nuclear reactions that occur in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and beyond, with a focus on the s-process and its implications for our understanding of massive stars and meteoritic anomalies. We discuss the key steps involved in the s-process, including neutron captures and the role of these reactions in shaping the elemental abundances of AGB stars. We also explore the connections between s-process nucleosynthesis and the formation of meteorites, highlighting the potential for these objects to serve as cosmic laboratories for studying the early universe. By integrating insights from stellar spectroscopy and nuclear physics, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the s-process and its far-reaching consequences for our understanding of stellar evolution and the origins of the elements."}
