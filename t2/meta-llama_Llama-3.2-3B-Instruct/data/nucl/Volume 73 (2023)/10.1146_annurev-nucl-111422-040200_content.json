{"Abstract": "This review article explores the current understanding of high-energy to ultrahigh-energy neutrino interactions, a realm where the Standard Model of particle physics is expected to be challenged. Neutrino astrophysics has emerged as a vibrant field, with observations of neutrino bursts from supernovae and active galactic nuclei providing insights into the most energetic astrophysical processes. We discuss the latest theoretical models and experimental searches for ultrahigh-energy neutrino production and detection, highlighting the potential for neutrinos to reveal the universe's most extreme phenomena."}
