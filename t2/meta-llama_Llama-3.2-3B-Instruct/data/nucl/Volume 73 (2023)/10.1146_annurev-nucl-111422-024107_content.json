{"Abstract": "The Hubble tension, a discrepancy between the observed Hubble constant and the value predicted by the Planck satellite, has sparked intense debate in the cosmological community. This tension is particularly pronounced when considering the early Universe, where the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation provides a unique window into the epoch of recombination. Recent studies have suggested that the early Universe may have been characterized by a period of rapid expansion, driven by a mysterious form of dark energy. This phenomenon, known as early dark energy, would have had a profound impact on the CMB, potentially explaining the observed Hubble tension. In this review, we examine the current state of knowledge regarding early dark energy and its potential implications for our understanding of the early Universe. We discuss the latest CMB data and theoretical models, highlighting the key challenges and opportunities for resolving the Hubble tension. Our analysis suggests that early dark energy may be a viable explanation for the observed discrepancy, and we outline a framework for future research directions. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of early dark energy and its role in the early Universe holds the key to resolving the Hubble tension and refining our understanding of the cosmos."}
