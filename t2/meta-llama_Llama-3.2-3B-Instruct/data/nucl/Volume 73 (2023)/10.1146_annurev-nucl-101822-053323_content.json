{"Abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been instrumental in probing the fundamental nature of matter and the universe, with a particular focus on boson-boson interactions. This review article delves into the realm of diboson production, a process in which two vector bosons (WW, ZZ, or Ã A) interact with each other. Theoretical frameworks, such as the Standard Model of particle physics, predict the existence of these interactions, which are crucial for understanding the electroweak force. Experimental searches at the LHC have been conducted to detect diboson production, with the aim of confirming or ruling out these predictions. This article discusses the current state of diboson physics at the LHC, highlighting recent results and the implications for our understanding of the electroweak force. The interplay between theoretical models and experimental data is also explored, shedding light on the complex interplay between boson-boson interactions and the fundamental forces of nature."}
