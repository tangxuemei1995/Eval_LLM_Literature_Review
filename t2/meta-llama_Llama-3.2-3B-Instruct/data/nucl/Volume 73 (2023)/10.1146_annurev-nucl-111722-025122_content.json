{"Abstract": "The detection of low-energy nuclear recoils is a crucial aspect of experiments searching for dark matter and neutrino scattering. These events are notoriously difficult to distinguish from background processes, necessitating precise calibration and detection techniques. This review article focuses on the latest advancements in the detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils for dark matter and neutrino scattering experiments. We discuss the underlying physics of these interactions, including the role of neutron scattering and the challenges associated with low-energy calibration. Recent experimental results and theoretical frameworks are examined, highlighting the importance of precise calibration in distinguishing signal from background. Our analysis highlights the need for further research in this area, with potential applications in the development of more sensitive dark matter and neutrino detection experiments."}
