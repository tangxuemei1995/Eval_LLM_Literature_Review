{"Abstract": "This review examines the implications of large-N QCD for the two-nucleon (NN) and few-nucleon interactions. Effective field theories, such as chiral perturbation theory and the nuclear shell model, are used to describe the NN interaction in the context of large-N QCD. The results show that the NN interaction is dominated by short-range correlations, which are mediated by gluons and are responsible for the saturation of the nucleon-nucleon potential. The few-nucleon interactions are also studied, and the effects of large-N QCD on the binding energies and scattering lengths are found to be significant. The implications of these results for our understanding of nuclear physics and the behavior of nucleons at high densities are discussed."}
