{"Abstract": "This review provides an overview of the theoretical frameworks and experimental strategies for detecting long-lived particles at the Large Hadron Collider. Long-lived particles, such as sterile neutrinos and hidden sector particles, can evade detection through conventional decay modes, necessitating innovative approaches. We discuss the implications of long-lived particles on particle physics and the LHC's potential to constrain or discover these exotic particles through novel decay channels and advanced analysis techniques."}
