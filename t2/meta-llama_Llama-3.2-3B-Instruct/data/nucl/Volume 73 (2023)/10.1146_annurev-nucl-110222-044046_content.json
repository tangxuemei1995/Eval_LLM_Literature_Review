{"Abstract": "Recent advances in lattice quantum chromodynamics have significantly improved our understanding of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons. Theoretical frameworks, such as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, have been employed to analyze the decay constants and form factors of these decays. Lepton flavor universality has been confirmed in various studies, highlighting the importance of precision measurements in charm physics. Theoretical models, including QCD sum rules and chiral perturbation theory, have been used to extract the decay constants and form factors from lattice data. These advances have shed new light on the underlying physics of charmed hadron decays, with implications for our understanding of the Standard Model."}
