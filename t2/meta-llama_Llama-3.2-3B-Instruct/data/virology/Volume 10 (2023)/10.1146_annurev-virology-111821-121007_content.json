{"Abstract": "O-Linked glycans play a crucial role in the structure and function of viral envelope proteins, influencing viral attachment, entry, and egress. These carbohydrate moieties, particularly mucin-like domains, are often composed of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, which interact with host cell receptors and modulate the viral attachment process. The precise arrangement and glycosylation pattern of O-linked glycans can significantly impact the efficiency of viral entry and the immune response elicited by viral infections. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of O-linked glycans as targets for vaccine development, with strategies aimed at inducing neutralizing antibodies against these carbohydrate structures. Understanding the structure and role of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins is essential for the design of effective vaccines and the development of novel therapeutic interventions against viral infections. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between O-linked glycans and host cell receptors, and to explore their potential as targets for antiviral therapies."}
