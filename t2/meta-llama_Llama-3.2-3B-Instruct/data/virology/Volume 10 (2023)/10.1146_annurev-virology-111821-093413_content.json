{"Abstract": "Viral membrane fusion is a complex process mediated by a diverse array of viral fusion proteins, which orchestrate the conformational changes necessary for the merging of host and viral membranes. Class I, II, and III viral fusion proteins exhibit distinct structural and functional properties, with class I proteins typically forming trimers-of-hairpins that facilitate membrane fusion, while class II proteins often employ fusion loops and peptides to regulate lipid dynamics. The energetics of fusion are influenced by the interplay between viral fusion proteins and host lipids, with conformational intermediates playing a crucial role in the fusion process. Furthermore, fusion restriction factors can modulate the efficiency of viral membrane fusion, highlighting the intricate mechanisms governing this critical step in viral entry. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying viral membrane fusion is essential for understanding viral pathogenesis and developing effective antiviral strategies."}
