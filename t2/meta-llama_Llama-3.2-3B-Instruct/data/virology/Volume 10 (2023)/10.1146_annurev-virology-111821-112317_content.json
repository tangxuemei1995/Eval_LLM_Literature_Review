{"Abstract": "Enteric viruses, comprising a diverse range of noroviruses, play a significant role in modulating the immune response within the intestine. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between enteric viruses and the host immune system, leading to the development of novel immunomodulatory strategies. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of immunomodulation by enteric viruses, with a focus on norovirus. The norovirus-induced immune response is characterized by the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of mucosal barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, the norovirus virome influences the host's immune response, modulating the expression of immune-related genes and proteins. Understanding the mechanisms of immunomodulation by enteric viruses is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and the prevention of norovirus-induced gastrointestinal disease."}
