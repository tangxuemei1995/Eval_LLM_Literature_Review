{"Abstract": "Cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to facilitate the transmission of viruses between disparate kingdoms. This phenomenon, known as cross-kingdom infection, can occur through various mechanisms, including extracellular transfer and virus-virus interaction. Plant viruses, such as tobacco rattle virus, have been shown to infect fungal hosts, while fungal viruses, like those belonging to the family Reoviridae, can infect plant hosts. The transmission of plant viruses to fungal hosts can be mediated by insect vectors, water droplets, or direct contact. Conversely, fungal viruses can also be transmitted to plants through similar routes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cross-kingdom interactions is crucial for the development of novel biocontrol strategies, which could potentially exploit these interactions to control the spread of plant viruses. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex relationships between plant and fungal viruses and to explore their potential applications in plant virus management."}
