{"Abstract": "Herpesvirus nuclear egress is a complex process involving the coordinated action of multiple proteins and cellular structures. The nuclear egress complex (NEC) plays a crucial role in the formation of primary enveloped virions (PEVs), which are the infectious particles released from infected cells. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying NEC-mediated nuclear membrane fusion, a key step in the egress process. The pseudorabies virus (PrV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been extensively studied, providing valuable insights into the NEC's function. However, the mechanisms of nuclear egress in other herpesviruses, such as HSV-1 and HSV-2, remain poorly understood. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on herpesvirus nuclear egress, highlighting the key players and regulatory mechanisms involved. The review will also discuss the implications of NEC-mediated nuclear membrane fusion for our understanding of herpesvirus replication and pathogenesis. Understanding the intricacies of nuclear egress is essential for the development of novel antiviral therapies targeting herpesvirus infections."}
