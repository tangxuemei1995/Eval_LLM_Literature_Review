{"Abstract": "Viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a crucial mechanism employed by various viruses to manipulate host cell translation and promote their replication. This process involves the formation of pseudoknot structures within the viral mRNA, which in turn induce ribosomal frameshifting, leading to the production of aberrant proteins. Recent studies have shed light on the structural and functional insights underlying this phenomenon, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. In SARS-CoV-2, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) generates pseudoknot structures within the viral mRNA, which in turn induce frameshifting and the production of non-structural proteins. Similarly, in HIV, the viral reverse transcriptase generates pseudoknot structures within the viral mRNA, leading to frameshifting and the production of aberrant proteins. The structural and functional insights gained from these studies have significant implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is essential for the design of effective therapeutic strategies to combat viral infections. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target."}
