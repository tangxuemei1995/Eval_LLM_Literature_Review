{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between the microbiota and viral infections has garnered significant attention in recent years. Recent studies have demonstrated that the microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating the host immune response to viral infections. The production of metabolites by the microbiota has been shown to influence the production of interferon, a key cytokine involved in antiviral defense. Furthermore, the microbiome has been found to regulate the composition and function of the virome, the collection of viruses that inhabit a host. The signaling pathways that govern the interaction between the microbiota and the host immune system are complex and multifaceted. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the impact of the microbiota on viral infections, with a focus on the role of metabolites, interferon signaling, and the microbiome-virome interface. The findings of this review have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of viral infections."}
