{"Abstract": "Nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses, including members of the Mononegavirales order, utilize RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) to transcribe their genomes. These polymerases are essential for viral replication and have evolved unique structures and mechanisms to facilitate efficient transcription. Paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, pneumoviruses, and rhabdoviruses, all classified within the Mononegavirales, employ distinct RdRp architectures. Paramyxoviruses feature a large, multifunctional RdRp, while filoviruses possess a smaller, more compact RdRp. Pneumoviruses and rhabdoviruses exhibit intermediate RdRp structures. The mechanisms underlying RdRp activity, including processivity, error correction, and interaction with viral RNA, have been elucidated through structural and biochemical studies. Understanding the structures and mechanisms of nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus polymerases is crucial for the development of antiviral therapies and the design of novel vaccine strategies. This knowledge has significant implications for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases caused by Mononegavirales viruses."}
