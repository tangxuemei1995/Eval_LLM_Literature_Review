{"Abstract": "Viral evolution has been significantly influenced by host proteostasis networks, which are complex systems that maintain protein homeostasis and respond to stress. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of chaperones and quality control mechanisms in modulating viral replication and survival. Viruses have evolved strategies to evade host proteostasis networks, including the hijacking of chaperones and the manipulation of stress response pathways. This abstract reviews the current understanding of the interplay between viral evolution and host proteostasis networks, with a focus on protein folding biophysics and the role of chaperones in viral adaptation. The impact of viral adaptation on drug and immune system resistance is also discussed, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between viruses and host proteostasis networks. This knowledge has important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and the design of effective vaccines."}
