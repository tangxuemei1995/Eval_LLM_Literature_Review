{"Abstract": "Biomolecular condensates, such as viroplasms, play a crucial role in the assembly and replication of segmented RNA viruses, including rotaviruses. These dynamic structures facilitate the organization of viral proteins and RNA into functional complexes, enabling efficient viral transcription and replication. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of phase transitions in the formation and stabilization of viroplasms, which can be triggered by viral proteins or environmental cues. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of viroplasm formation and function, with a focus on the role of phase transitions in viral assembly. The implications of this research for our understanding of viral replication and the development of antiviral strategies are also discussed."}
