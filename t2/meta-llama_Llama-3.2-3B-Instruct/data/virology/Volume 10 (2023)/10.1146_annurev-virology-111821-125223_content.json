{"Abstract": "Influenza, a highly contagious and deadly viral disease, has been a persistent threat to global health, with numerous pandemics occurring throughout history. This study delves into the origins of influenza pandemics, focusing on the role of aquatic birds and live bird markets in the emergence of new strains. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, including reports from the World Health Organization, we examine the complex dynamics of reassortment and the transmission of influenza viruses between hosts. Our analysis highlights the critical importance of monitoring live bird markets, where the virus can jump from birds to humans, and the need for enhanced surveillance and early warning systems to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. By exploring the intersection of human and animal health, this research aims to inform strategies for mitigating the impact of future influenza pandemics, ultimately reducing the risk of widespread illness and death."}
