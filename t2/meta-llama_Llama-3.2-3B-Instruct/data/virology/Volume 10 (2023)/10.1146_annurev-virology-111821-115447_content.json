{"Abstract": "Influenza viruses pose a significant threat to global health, with airborne transmission being a primary mode of spread. This review examines the various barriers to transmission of influenza viruses, including respiratory droplets, mucus, and viral persistence in the environment. The role of ventilation systems, UV light, and surface disinfection in reducing transmission is also discussed. Vaccination and antiviral therapies are effective in preventing and treating influenza, but their implementation is hindered by factors such as vaccine hesitancy and limited access to antivirals. The use of masks and social distancing measures can also reduce transmission, but their effectiveness is influenced by factors such as mask quality and adherence to public health guidelines. Understanding these barriers is crucial for developing effective strategies to control the spread of influenza viruses and mitigate the impact of future pandemics."}
