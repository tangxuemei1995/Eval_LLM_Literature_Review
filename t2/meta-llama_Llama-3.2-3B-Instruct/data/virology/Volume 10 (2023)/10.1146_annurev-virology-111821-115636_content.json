{"Abstract": "The discovery of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) as nucleotide second messengers has revolutionized our understanding of innate immune signaling. The cytosolic sensor cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) and its downstream effector STING (stimulator of interferon genes) are pivotal in recognizing and responding to viral infections. Recent studies have shed light on the evolutionary origins of this pathway, revealing a common ancestor with the bacterial sensor cGLR (cyclic GMP-AMP receptor). The CBASS (cGAS-STING pathway activation) pathway has been extensively characterized, demonstrating its critical role in antiviral defense and innate immunity. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms of nucleotide second messenger immune signaling, from the recognition of viral nucleic acids to the activation of downstream transcription factors. The intricate relationships between cGAS, STING, and cGLR are discussed, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this pathway across species. The implications of this pathway in understanding viral infections and innate immunity are also explored."}
