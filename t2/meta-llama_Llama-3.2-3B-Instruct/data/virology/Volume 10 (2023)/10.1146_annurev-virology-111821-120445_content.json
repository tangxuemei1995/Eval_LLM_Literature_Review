{"Abstract": "This review focuses on segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses of humans, including influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Rift Valley fever virus. These viruses exhibit complex genetic systems, comprising multiple segments of RNA that encode various proteins essential for viral replication and pathogenesis. Experimental uses of reporter strains have significantly advanced our understanding of viral biology and have enabled the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies. Fluorescent and bioluminescent strains have been engineered to facilitate the visualization of viral replication and transmission, providing valuable insights into viral dynamics and host-virus interactions. This review highlights the genetic systems and experimental applications of these viruses, with a focus on the potential for future research and therapeutic interventions."}
