{"Abstract": "Tobamoviruses, a family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, have evolved complex strategies to evade plant immunity, leading to devastating crop losses worldwide. This perpetual interplay between tobamoviruses and plant immunity is characterized by the activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) pathways, which involve the recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in PTI, promoting the expression of resistance genes and the production of defense-related proteins. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of RNA silencing (RNAi) in regulating tobamovirus infection, with ToBRFV and TMV serving as model viruses to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process. Understanding the intricate relationships between tobamoviruses and plant immunity is essential for the development of effective resistance strategies, and this review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on this topic, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying the PTI-RNAi-salicylic acid axis."}
