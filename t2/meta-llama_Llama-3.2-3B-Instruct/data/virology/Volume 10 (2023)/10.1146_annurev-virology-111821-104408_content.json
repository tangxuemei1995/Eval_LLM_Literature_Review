{"Abstract": "The 1918 influenza pandemic, caused by the H1N1 virus, resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history. Recent advances in reverse genetics have enabled the resurrection of the 1918 virus, allowing researchers to study its virulence and transmission dynamics in unprecedented detail. This study reviews the key findings from the resurrection of the 1918 virus, including its genomic sequence, antigenic characteristics, and pathogenesis. The results show that the 1918 virus retained its high virulence and transmissibility, characteristics that contributed to its rapid spread and devastating impact. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the 1918 pandemic in the context of modern influenza viruses, with implications for the development of effective vaccines and treatments. The resurrection of the 1918 virus has provided valuable insights into the history of influenza and its ongoing impact on global health."}
