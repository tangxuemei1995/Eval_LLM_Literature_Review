{"Abstract": "The viral accessory protein Vpu, encoded by the HIV-1 genome, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This small protein, approximately 15 kDa in size, exhibits a high degree of versatility, influencing various aspects of viral replication and immune evasion. One of the primary functions of Vpu is to counteract the host cell's innate immune response by downregulating CD4 and tetherin, a key restriction factor that limits viral release. By inhibiting tetherin, Vpu facilitates the release of newly formed virions, thereby enhancing viral transmission. Additionally, Vpu has been implicated in modulating the host's NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, a critical regulator of immune responses. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that Vpu may also contribute to the induction of superinfection, a phenomenon where a secondary infection occurs in cells that have already been infected with a different strain of the virus. The mechanisms underlying Vpu-mediated immune evasion and superinfection are complex and multifaceted, involving the regulation of DNA damage repair pathways. Elucidating the functions of Vpu is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at combating HIV-1 infection."}
