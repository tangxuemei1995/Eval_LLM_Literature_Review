{"Abstract": "The process of bacteriophage uptake and processing by mammalian cells is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. This process begins with the endocytosis of the phage, where the viral particle is engulfed by the cell membrane, often through the formation of a phagosome. Following internalization, the phage is trafficked through the endolysosomal system, where it is subjected to various forms of degradation and immune recognition. The host cell's immune response to the phage is characterized by the activation of inflammatory pathways, leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection. The phage's genome is also subject to regulation by the host's virome, with various viral and bacterial components interacting to modulate the immune response. Understanding the intricacies of phage processing and the host's response to infection is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against viral infections."}
