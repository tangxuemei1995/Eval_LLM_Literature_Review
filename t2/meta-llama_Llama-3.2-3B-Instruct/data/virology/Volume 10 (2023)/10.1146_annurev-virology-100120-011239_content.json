{"Abstract": "Recent advances in metagenomics and virome analysis have expanded our understanding of the microbial world, revealing a vast and diverse array of microviruses that defy traditional classification within the phage family Microviridae. Beyond phiX174, a paradigmatic single-stranded DNA phage, these microviruses exhibit unique characteristics, such as compact genomes and specialized replication strategies. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that microviruses have evolved independently in various environments, including aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The discovery of microviruses has significant implications for our understanding of virus taxonomy and evolution, highlighting the need for reevaluation of the phage family Microviridae. Further research is required to elucidate the functional and ecological roles of microviruses in shaping the virome and influencing microbial communities."}
