{"Abstract": "The human microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating immune homeostasis, modulating inflammation, and influencing HIV persistence. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids in shaping the immune response to HIV infection. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a key site of HIV replication, and the microbiome composition and SCFA production are significantly altered in HIV-infected individuals. SCFAs, produced by the microbiome, have anti-inflammatory properties and can modulate the immune response, potentially reducing HIV replication. Bile acids, produced by the liver and stored in the gut, also exhibit immunomodulatory effects and may influence HIV persistence. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the microbiome's role in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence, with a focus on the mechanisms by which SCFAs and bile acids contribute to these processes. Understanding these interactions is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to manage HIV infection and promote immune recovery."}
