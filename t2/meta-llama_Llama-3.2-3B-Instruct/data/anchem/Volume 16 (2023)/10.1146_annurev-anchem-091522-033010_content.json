{"Abstract": "Photoluminescence probes have emerged as powerful tools for multidimensional sensing, enabling the detection of multiple analytes in complex matrices. By harnessing the principles of multidimensional fluorescence and phosphorescence, these probes can provide a wealth of information on the chemical and physical properties of the analytes. Recent advances in image analysis and N-way analysis have further expanded the capabilities of photoluminescence probes, allowing for the simultaneous analysis of multiple variables in a single experiment. This review provides an overview of the current state of photoluminescence probes in data-enabled sensing, highlighting their applications in fields such as chemistry, biology, and materials science. The potential of these probes for advancing our understanding of complex systems is discussed, along with future directions for research and development."}
