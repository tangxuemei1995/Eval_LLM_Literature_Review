{"Abstract": "Direct mass spectrometry technologies have revolutionized the field of tissue analysis, enabling the non-invasive and high-resolution imaging of biomolecules in various tissues. Recent advances in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) have expanded its clinical diagnostics applications, allowing for the detection of biomarkers for diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and infectious diseases. Ambient ionization (AI) techniques have further enhanced the portability and accessibility of MSI, enabling the development of handheld mass spectrometry-based devices for point-of-care diagnostics. These emerging technologies have the potential to transform the field of clinical diagnostics, enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis, and facilitating personalized medicine. This review highlights the current state of the art in direct mass spectrometry technologies for tissue analysis, and discusses their potential applications in clinical diagnostics and beyond."}
