{"Abstract": "The accurate detection and quantification of organic micropollutants in water samples are crucial for environmental monitoring and public health protection. This review highlights the importance of efficient validation strategies in environmental analytical chemistry, with a focus on liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS and GC-MS) methods. A comprehensive evaluation of method validation protocols, including matrix effects, method robustness, and inter-laboratory comparability, is presented. The impact of sample preparation, instrumental parameters, and calibration standards on method performance is also discussed. Furthermore, the application of quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) principles, such as proficiency testing and certified reference materials, is emphasized. The review concludes by highlighting the need for standardized validation protocols and the importance of inter-laboratory collaboration to ensure the accuracy and reliability of environmental analytical results."}
