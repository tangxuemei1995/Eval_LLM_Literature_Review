{"Abstract": "The interrogation of cell signaling pathways is crucial for understanding cellular behavior and developing novel therapeutic strategies. Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising tool for intracellular sensing and manipulation of cell signaling. These nanoscale entities can be engineered to target specific cell types, manipulate signaling pathways, and provide quantitative imaging of cellular responses. This review highlights the recent advances in the development of nanoparticles for interrogation of cell signaling, including magnetic and optical manipulation techniques. We discuss the design and synthesis of nanoparticles for specific applications, such as sensing of biomarkers, modulation of signaling pathways, and imaging of cellular dynamics. The potential of nanoparticles in cell signaling interrogation is also discussed in the context of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The future directions of nanoparticle-based cell signaling interrogation are also explored, including the development of nanoscale biosensors and therapeutic agents."}
