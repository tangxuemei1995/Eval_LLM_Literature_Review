{"Abstract": "CRISPR-based biosensing strategies have emerged as a promising approach for detecting and quantifying various biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules. Recent advancements in CRISPR-Cas13 and CRISPR-Cas12a technologies have enabled the development of sensitive and specific biosensors for detecting pathogens, biomarkers, and environmental pollutants. These biosensors utilize the RNA-targeting activity of CRISPR-Cas13 or the DNA-targeting activity of CRISPR-Cas12a to selectively cleave target molecules, resulting in a detectable signal. The technical development of CRISPR-based biosensors has been facilitated by the optimization of guide RNA design, Cas enzyme engineering, and signal amplification strategies. The application prospects of CRISPR-based biosensing strategies are vast, including point-of-care diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety surveillance, offering a powerful tool for early disease detection, rapid response, and public health protection."}
