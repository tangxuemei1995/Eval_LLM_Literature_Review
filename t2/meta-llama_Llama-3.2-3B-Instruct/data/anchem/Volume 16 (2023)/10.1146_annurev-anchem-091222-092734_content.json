{"Abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach for nondestructive 3D pathology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, enabling high-resolution imaging of intact tissue samples. By leveraging advanced computational algorithms and spatial biology principles, we have developed a platform for translational research and clinical assays. Our method allows for the rapid acquisition of 3D tissue structures, facilitating the analysis of complex biological processes and disease mechanisms. The application of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy in conjunction with machine learning techniques has the potential to revolutionize the field of computational pathology, enabling the development of precision medicine approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. This technology holds great promise for advancing our understanding of human biology and improving patient outcomes."}
