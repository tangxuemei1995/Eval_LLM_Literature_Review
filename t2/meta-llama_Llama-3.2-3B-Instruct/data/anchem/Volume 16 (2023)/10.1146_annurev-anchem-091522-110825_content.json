{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 released an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in widespread contamination of marine ecosystems. Following this event, emerging chemical methods have been developed to analyze petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been employed to quantify petrogenic elements and black carbon in marine sediments and water samples. Fluorescence-based techniques have also been utilized to identify and quantify petrogenic DOM, which is a key component of the oil spill's impact on marine ecosystems. This study reviews the current state of chemical methods for analyzing petroleum and petrogenic DOM in the context of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, highlighting the advantages and limitations of ICP-MS and fluorescence-based approaches. The findings of this review have implications for our understanding of the long-term effects of oil spills on marine ecosystems and the development of effective remediation strategies."}
