{"Abstract": "This review focuses on label-free electrochemical methods for disease detection, highlighting their potential in biosensing and diagnostics. Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as a promising approach for disease diagnosis, offering high sensitivity, rapid response times, and low cost. Label-free electrochemical methods, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), enable real-time monitoring of biomarker interactions without the need for fluorescent labels. These methods have been successfully applied to detect various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and infectious diseases. The review discusses the principles, advantages, and limitations of label-free electrochemical methods, as well as their potential for integration into point-of-care diagnostics and clinical settings."}
