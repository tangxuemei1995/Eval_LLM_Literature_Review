{"Abstract": "Digital histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging represents a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis. By integrating infrared spectroscopic imaging with machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, this method enables the non-invasive analysis of tissue samples. Infrared spectroscopic imaging captures chemical information from tissue samples, which is then processed by deep learning models to identify specific biomarkers associated with cancer. The proposed approach has been validated on a dataset of histopathological images and corresponding infrared spectroscopic data, demonstrating a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional methods. The results show that digital histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging can be a valuable tool for the early detection and monitoring of cancer, offering a promising alternative to conventional histopathological analysis. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this technology in clinical settings."}
