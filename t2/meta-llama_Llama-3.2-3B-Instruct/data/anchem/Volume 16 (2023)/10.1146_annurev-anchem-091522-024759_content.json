{"Abstract": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose a significant public health burden worldwide, with limited access to diagnostic tools and healthcare infrastructure in endemic regions. This study presents a low-cost, paper-based microfluidic system for the detection of NTDs, leveraging lateral flow assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principles. The system, designed for point-of-care testing, utilizes a simple, portable format and minimal reagents, enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Chagas disease. The microfluidic device integrates a sample inlet, reaction chamber, and output channel, allowing for efficient mixing and separation of analytes. The system was evaluated for its sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use, demonstrating promising results in a clinical setting. The low-cost, user-friendly design of this microfluidic system has the potential to revolutionize NTD diagnosis and treatment in resource-limited settings, improving health outcomes and reducing the global burden of these diseases."}
