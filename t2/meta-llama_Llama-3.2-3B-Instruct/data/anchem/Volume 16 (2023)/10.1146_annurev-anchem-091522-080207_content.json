{"Abstract": "Microscale electrophoresis utilizing gels has emerged as a powerful tool for the separation and analysis of biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycan molecules. In this context, microfluidic gel electrophoresis has gained significant attention due to its ability to miniaturize the separation process, enhance resolution, and reduce sample consumption. The development of sieving matrices in microscale electrophoresis has been crucial in achieving efficient separation of biomolecules. This review focuses on the recent advancements in microscale electrophoresis using gels, highlighting the design and fabrication of microfluidic devices, the optimization of sieving matrices, and the applications in DNA, RNA, protein, and glycan analysis. The review also discusses the challenges and limitations associated with microscale electrophoresis and potential future directions for the field."}
