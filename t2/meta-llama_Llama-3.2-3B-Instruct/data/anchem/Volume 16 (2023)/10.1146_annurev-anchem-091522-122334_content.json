{"Abstract": "This beginner's guide provides an overview of micro- and nanoscale electrochemical additive manufacturing techniques, including meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED), fluid dynamics-based methods such as electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), and advanced imaging techniques like scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and fluid force microscopy (FluidFM). The guide covers the fundamental principles and applications of these techniques, including the deposition of metals, alloys, and other materials at the micro- and nanoscale. The use of nanopipettes and other specialized equipment is also discussed, highlighting the potential for precise control over the manufacturing process. By exploring these cutting-edge technologies, researchers and engineers can unlock new possibilities for additive manufacturing and nanotechnology applications."}
