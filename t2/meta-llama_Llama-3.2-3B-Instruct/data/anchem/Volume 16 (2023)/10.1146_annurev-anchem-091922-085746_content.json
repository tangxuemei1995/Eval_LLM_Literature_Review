{"Abstract": "The deployment of in situ sensors for coastal and ocean monitoring has become increasingly crucial for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change, ocean acidification, and human activities on marine ecosystems. This review synthesizes the current state of sensor technologies and their applications in coastal and ocean monitoring, highlighting the benefits and challenges associated with sensor networks. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that biofouling, a major concern for sensor longevity and performance, can be mitigated through the use of anti-fouling coatings and sensor design innovations. The review also discusses the importance of sensor networks in providing real-time data on ocean currents, temperature, salinity, and other parameters, which are essential for predicting and managing coastal erosion, marine pollution, and fisheries management. By integrating cutting-edge sensor technologies and innovative data analytics, this review aims to provide a framework for the development of effective sensor systems for coastal and ocean monitoring, ultimately informing policy and management decisions that support sustainable ocean management and conservation."}
