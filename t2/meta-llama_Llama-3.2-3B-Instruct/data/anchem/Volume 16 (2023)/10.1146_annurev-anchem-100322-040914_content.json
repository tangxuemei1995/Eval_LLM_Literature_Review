{"Abstract": "The integration of biosensors into a connected world has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing real-time, system-level support for decision-making. This concept is rooted in the idea of a knowledge network, where biosensors serve as the backbone, facilitating the exchange of health-related data between various stakeholders. By leveraging biosensors, healthcare systems can optimize quality of service, ensuring seamless communication and data sharing. The meaningful use of biosensors can be achieved through the development of sophisticated decision support systems, which analyze health data to provide actionable insights. This abstract explores the intersection of biosensors, decision support, and quality of service, highlighting the importance of a connected world in enhancing healthcare outcomes. By fostering a collaborative knowledge network, biosensors can play a pivotal role in shaping the future of healthcare."}
