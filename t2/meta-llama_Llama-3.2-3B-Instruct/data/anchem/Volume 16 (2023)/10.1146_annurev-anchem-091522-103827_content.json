{"Abstract": "Microfluidics plays a crucial role in biofilm studies by enabling in situ visualization, manipulation, and analysis of complex microbial communities. This technology allows for the creation of microfluidic devices that mimic the flow dynamics and shear stress experienced by biofilms in their natural environments. Antifouling surfaces and antimicrobial agents can be integrated into these devices to investigate the effects of surface modifications on biofilm formation and resistance to antimicrobials. Organ-on-chip devices and biosensors can also be integrated to study the interactions between biofilms and host tissues. By leveraging microfluidics, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of biofilm biology and develop innovative solutions for biofilm-related diseases and infections."}
