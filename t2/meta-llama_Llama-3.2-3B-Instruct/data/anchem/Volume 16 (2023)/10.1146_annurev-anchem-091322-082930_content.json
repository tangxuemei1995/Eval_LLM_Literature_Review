{"Abstract": "This study presents a wearable microfluidics device designed for continuous biomarker sensing and analysis. The device integrates a microfluidic channel, a biochemical assay, and a sensing mechanism into a compact, wearable form factor. The microfluidic channel is fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and photolithography, allowing for the creation of complex geometries and precise control over fluid flow. The biochemical assay is based on a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol, which enables the detection of biomarkers in real-time. The sensing mechanism utilizes a nanoscale optical sensor, which provides high sensitivity and selectivity for biomarker detection. The wearable device is designed to be user-friendly, with a user-friendly interface and a rechargeable battery that provides up to 5 days of continuous operation. The device has been validated through a series of experiments, demonstrating its ability to detect biomarkers with high accuracy and reliability."}
