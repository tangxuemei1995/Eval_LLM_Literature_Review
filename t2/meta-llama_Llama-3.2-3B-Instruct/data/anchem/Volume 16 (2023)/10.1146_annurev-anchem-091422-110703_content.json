{"Abstract": "The development of efficient energy storage systems, such as batteries, requires a deep understanding of the interfaces between electrodes and electrolytes. Scanning probe methods, including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM), and Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Microscopy (SICM), have emerged as powerful tools for electrochemical imaging of interfaces. These techniques enable the spatially resolved analysis of electrode-electrolyte interactions, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of energy storage. Recent advancements in automation and machine learning, including deep learning algorithms, have further enhanced the capabilities of these methods. This review provides an overview of the current state of the art in electrochemical imaging of interfaces via scanning probe methods, highlighting their techniques, applications, and prospects for future research. The integration of these methods with artificial intelligence and machine learning is expected to revolutionize the field of energy storage research."}
