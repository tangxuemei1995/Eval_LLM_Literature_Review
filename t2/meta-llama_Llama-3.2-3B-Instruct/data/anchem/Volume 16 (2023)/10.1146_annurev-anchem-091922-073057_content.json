{"Abstract": "Recent advances in single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques have significantly improved our understanding of molecular dynamics and interactions at the nanoscale. Feedback-control tracking methods have been developed to enhance the precision and accuracy of single-molecule localization, while point-spread-function engineering has enabled the creation of high-resolution imaging systems. Multiple plane microscopy has expanded the spatial resolution of imaging techniques, allowing for the observation of complex molecular interactions in three-dimensional space. Trajectory analysis and clustering analysis have been employed to elucidate the dynamics of single molecules and identify patterns of behavior. These advances have far-reaching implications for fields such as biomedicine, materials science, and nanotechnology, enabling researchers to study molecular processes in unprecedented detail. The integration of these techniques has opened new avenues for the investigation of molecular mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutic strategies."}
