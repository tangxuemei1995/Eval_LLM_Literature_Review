{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive framework for three-decision methods, which provide a sensible formulation of significance tests and address the challenges of multiple testing. By integrating decision theory and sensitivity analysis, these methods enable researchers to evaluate the power of their tests and account for the impact of multiple testing on Type I error rates. The proposed framework offers a flexible and generalizable approach to significance testing, allowing for the incorporation of various decision criteria and sensitivity analyses. The results demonstrate that three-decision methods can significantly improve the accuracy of significance tests, particularly in scenarios with multiple testing. This work provides a valuable contribution to the field of statistical inference, offering a more nuanced understanding of significance testing and its limitations."}
