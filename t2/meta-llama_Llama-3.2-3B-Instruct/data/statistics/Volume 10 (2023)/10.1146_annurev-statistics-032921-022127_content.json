{"Abstract": "High-dimensional survival analysis is a crucial aspect of precision medicine, where the complexity of biological systems necessitates the integration of multiple variables to predict patient outcomes. This review article discusses novel methods and applications of high-dimensional survival analysis, focusing on feature screening techniques and machine learning algorithms. We explore the use of artificial neural networks to improve predictive accuracy and discuss the importance of statistical inference in high-dimensional datasets. Our analysis highlights the challenges and opportunities in high-dimensional survival analysis, including the need for robust feature selection and the potential of machine learning to improve predictive models. By integrating insights from data science and statistical inference, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for high-dimensional survival analysis and its applications in precision medicine."}
