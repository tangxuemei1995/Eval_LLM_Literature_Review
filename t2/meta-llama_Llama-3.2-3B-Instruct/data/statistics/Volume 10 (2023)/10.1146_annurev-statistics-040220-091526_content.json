{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex dynamics of innovation diffusion processes, focusing on the interplay between critical diffusion, competition, and structured interventions. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that traditional innovation diffusion models often oversimplify the nonlinear relationships between these factors. To address this limitation, we employ a critical diffusion framework that incorporates word-of-mouth and competition into a nonlinear regression model. The results suggest that structured interventions can significantly impact the diffusion process, particularly when combined with critical diffusion and competition. Our findings have implications for policymakers and practitioners seeking to promote innovation adoption. The study's contributions include the development of a more nuanced understanding of innovation diffusion processes and the identification of effective strategies for accelerating innovation adoption. Future research directions are discussed, highlighting the need for further investigation into the role of word-of-mouth and competition in innovation diffusion."}
