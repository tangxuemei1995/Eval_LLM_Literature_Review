{"Abstract": "This study explores approximate Bayesian computation methods, focusing on Bayesian synthetic likelihood, coreset-based approaches, and divide-and-conquer strategies. By leveraging subsampling techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, researchers can efficiently approximate complex Bayesian models. The proposed methods, including Bayesian synthetic likelihood and coreset-based methods, demonstrate improved computational efficiency and accuracy in Bayesian inference, making them suitable for large-scale applications and high-dimensional data."}
