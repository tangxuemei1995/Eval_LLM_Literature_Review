{"Abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive review of models for integer data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models. We explore the application of thinning operators to improve the efficiency of these models, particularly in the context of the Skellam distribution. The Skellam distribution, a bivariate extension of the Laplace distribution, is shown to be effective in modeling integer-valued time series data. Our analysis reveals that thinning operators can significantly reduce the computational complexity of these models, making them more suitable for large-scale applications. The results demonstrate the potential of the Skellam distribution and thinning operators in modeling integer data, with implications for fields such as finance and signal processing."}
