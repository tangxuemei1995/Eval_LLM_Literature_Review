{"Abstract": "Graph-based change-point analysis is a novel approach to detecting abrupt changes in high-dimensional network data, particularly in non-Euclidean spaces. By leveraging graph-theoretic concepts, such as network topology and community structure, this method extends traditional change-point detection techniques to accommodate nonparametric and high-dimensional data. The proposed graph-based scan statistic is designed to efficiently identify changes in the tail probability of network properties, allowing for the detection of subtle changes in network behavior. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various network data sets, including social networks, biological networks, and transportation networks. The results show that the graph-based change-point analysis outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. This work provides a significant contribution to the field of network science and change-point analysis, offering a powerful tool for detecting changes in complex network data."}
