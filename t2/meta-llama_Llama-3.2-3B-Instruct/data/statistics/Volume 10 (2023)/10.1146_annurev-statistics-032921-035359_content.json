{"Abstract": "Surrogate endpoints have been widely employed in clinical trials to assess the causal effectiveness of interventions, particularly in diseases with limited or no direct outcome measures. However, the use of surrogate endpoints raises concerns regarding causal inference, as they may not accurately reflect the causal association between the intervention and the true outcome. The Prentice criteria provide a framework for evaluating the validity of surrogate endpoints, considering factors such as the strength of the association, the rate of change, and the consistency across studies. Despite these guidelines, the surrogate paradox remains a significant challenge, where the use of surrogate endpoints can lead to biased estimates of causal effectiveness. Principal stratification techniques have been proposed as a solution to address this issue, but their application is often limited by data availability and complexity. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, highlighting the challenges and potential solutions for improving causal inference."}
