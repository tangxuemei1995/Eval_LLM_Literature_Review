{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advances in shared frailty methods for complex survival data, focusing on applications in clustered, competing event, and recurrent event settings. The accelerated failure time (AFT) model and Cox regression are discussed, highlighting their limitations in handling unbalanced data and competing events. Regression trees and random survival forests are also examined, showcasing their potential in modeling shared frailty in clustered data. The review highlights the importance of accounting for shared frailty in survival analysis, particularly in the presence of competing events and recurrent events. Recent methodological developments and their applications are discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of shared frailty methods in survival analysis."}
