{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of model-based clustering techniques, specifically utilizing mixture models and the expectation-maximization algorithm, to identify complex patterns and structures within large datasets. By leveraging Bayesian inference, the proposed approach enables the estimation of model parameters and the assignment of data points to underlying clusters. The software implementation of the algorithm allows for efficient computation and visualization of the results. The effectiveness of the model-based clustering method is demonstrated through a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to accurately identify clusters and distinguish between different patterns. The findings of this research contribute to the development of robust clustering methods, which can be applied in various fields, including data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The results also highlight the potential of Bayesian inference in improving the accuracy and interpretability of clustering outcomes."}
