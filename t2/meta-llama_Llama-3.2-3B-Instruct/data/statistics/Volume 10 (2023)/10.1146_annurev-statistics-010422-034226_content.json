{"Abstract": "This study examines the application of statistical disclosure limitation techniques to protect confidentiality in the 2020 US Census of Population and Housing. We employ differential privacy methods to minimize the risk of individual-level data exposure while preserving the accuracy of redistricting data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in reducing disclosure risk while maintaining statistical reliability. The findings have implications for the protection of sensitive demographic data and the integrity of redistricting processes, highlighting the need for robust confidentiality protection measures in census data collection and analysis."}
