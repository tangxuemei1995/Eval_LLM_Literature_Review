{"Abstract": "This review provides a statistical perspective on deep learning, highlighting the underlying principles of neural networks and their applications in pattern recognition. We discuss the optimization techniques used to train deep neural networks, including stochastic gradient descent and its variants. The statistical properties of deep neural networks are also examined, including their capacity for generalization and the role of regularization. The implications of these findings for deep learning are discussed."}
