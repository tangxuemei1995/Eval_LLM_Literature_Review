{"Abstract": "The conundrum of statistical data privacy has long plagued researchers and policymakers, as the pursuit of utility and knowledge often collides with the need to protect sensitive information. This study delves into the realm of statistical disclosure control, exploring the intersection of formal privacy and differential privacy in the context of statistical inference. By employing a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we examine the efficacy of various statistical disclosure control methods in mitigating the risks of statistical inference. Our results indicate that formal privacy techniques, such as those based on differential privacy, offer a promising framework for safeguarding statistical data while maintaining utility. However, the application of these methods is often hampered by computational complexity and interpretability concerns. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on statistical data privacy, highlighting the need for further research into the development of more practical and effective formal privacy techniques. Ultimately, our findings underscore the importance of striking a balance between privacy and utility in statistical data analysis."}
