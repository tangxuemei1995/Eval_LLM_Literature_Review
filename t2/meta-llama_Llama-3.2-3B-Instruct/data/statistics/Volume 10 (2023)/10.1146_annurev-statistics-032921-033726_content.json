{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to second-generation functional data, which encompasses spatial, longitudinal, and multivariate functional data. By leveraging the capabilities of FPCA, we aim to uncover underlying patterns and structures in these complex data types. Our approach involves the application of FPCA to a suite of synthetic and real-world datasets, including spatial functional data from remote sensing and climate modeling, longitudinal functional data from medical imaging and finance, and multivariate functional data from neuroscience and materials science. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FPCA in identifying meaningful patterns and relationships in these data types, and highlight its potential for applications in data analysis, modeling, and visualization. Furthermore, our findings suggest that FPCA can be used to develop novel methods for data integration, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction, which can have significant implications for various fields of research and practice."}
