{"Abstract": "The increasing complexity of scientific research has led to a proliferation of data, creating a pressing need for data reusability and research transparency. Statistics plays a pivotal role in promoting these values by ensuring the quality and reliability of data. This review synthesizes existing literature on the intersection of statistics and data reusability, highlighting the importance of data quality control, standardization, and documentation. We discuss the impact of open science initiatives on data sharing and the role of statistical methods in facilitating reproducibility and replicability. Our analysis reveals that the integration of statistical techniques, such as data validation and visualization, can significantly enhance data reusability and research transparency. By adopting these strategies, researchers can increase the value and impact of their work, ultimately contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge and the integrity of the research process."}
