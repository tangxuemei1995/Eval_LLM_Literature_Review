{"Abstract": "This study employs simulation-based Bayesian analysis to investigate the performance of various statistical software packages in estimating model parameters and assessing model fit. A range of graphical models are simulated, including latent variable models and probabilistic graphical models, to evaluate the capabilities of INLA, BUGS, Stan, JAGS, and PDMPs. The results demonstrate that these software packages exhibit varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency in estimating model parameters and assessing model fit. Gibbs sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are shown to be effective in generating posterior distributions, while the use of graphical models facilitates the estimation of complex relationships between variables. The findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each software package, informing the choice of statistical analysis tools for specific research applications."}
