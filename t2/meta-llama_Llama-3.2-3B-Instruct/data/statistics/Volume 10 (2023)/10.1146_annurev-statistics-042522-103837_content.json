{"Abstract": "This review examines the concepts of generalizability and transportability in the context of causal inference, with a focus on their implications for external validity and treatment effect heterogeneity. Generalizability refers to the extent to which findings from a specific study can be applied to other contexts, while transportability refers to the ability to replicate results in new settings. The authors discuss the theoretical underpinnings of generalizability and transportability, including the role of treatment effect heterogeneity in limiting the generalizability of causal inferences. A comprehensive review of the literature reveals that generalizability and transportability are critical concerns in causal inference, particularly in fields such as public health and social sciences. The authors highlight the need for researchers to carefully consider the generalizability and transportability of their findings, and to develop strategies for improving these aspects of causal inference. Ultimately, this review aims to contribute to the development of a more nuanced understanding of generalizability and transportability, and to inform best practices in causal inference research."}
