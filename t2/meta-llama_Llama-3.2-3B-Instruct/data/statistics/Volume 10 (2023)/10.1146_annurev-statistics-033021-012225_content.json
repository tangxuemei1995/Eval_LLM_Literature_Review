{"Abstract": "The detection of exoplanets using radial velocity measurements has been a cornerstone of exoplanetary science for decades. However, the analysis of these data is often plagued by correlated noise and uneven sampling, which can lead to model misspecification and biased results. This study presents a comprehensive framework for statistical methods to address these challenges. We develop a multivariate time series model that accounts for correlated noise and uneven sampling, and compare its performance to existing models. Our results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for model misspecification in exoplanet detection, and provide guidelines for model selection and validation. The proposed methods have significant implications for the detection and characterization of exoplanets, and can be applied to a wide range of radial velocity datasets."}
