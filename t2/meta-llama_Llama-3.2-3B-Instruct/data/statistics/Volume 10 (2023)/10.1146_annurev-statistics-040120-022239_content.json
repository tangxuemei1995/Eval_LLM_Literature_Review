{"Abstract": "This study investigates the application of the multiplier bootstrap method to high-dimensional data, leveraging the high-dimensional central limit theorem to improve empirical bootstrap accuracy. By accounting for multiple testing, the method mitigates the risk of false positives and enhances simultaneous inference capabilities. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the multiplier bootstrap approach in reducing bias and improving precision in high-dimensional data, with implications for statistical inference and hypothesis testing in various fields."}
