{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of six statistical senses, which are essential for accurate inference in complex data analysis. We examine the role of bootstrap resampling, data augmentation, exchangeability, likelihood estimation, propensity score matching, and shrinkage estimation in reducing bias and increasing precision. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and randomized replication, we demonstrate the efficacy of these statistical senses in improving the reliability of probabilistic sampling methods. Our findings have significant implications for data-driven decision-making in various fields."}
