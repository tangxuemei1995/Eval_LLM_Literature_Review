{"Abstract": "Generative models have revolutionized various fields by enabling the simulation of complex systems and the estimation of uncertain parameters. This interdisciplinary perspective explores the applications of generative models in decision-making, agent-based modeling, and experimental design. By leveraging techniques from particle filter and model evaluation, researchers can assess the goodness-of-fit of generative models to real-world data. The integration of generative models with simulation techniques allows for the estimation of uncertain parameters and the prediction of system behavior. This review highlights the key challenges and opportunities in the development of generative models, including model evaluation, parameter estimation, and the incorporation of uncertainty. By examining the intersection of generative models and decision-making, agent-based modeling, and experimental design, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential applications and limitations of these models in various fields."}
