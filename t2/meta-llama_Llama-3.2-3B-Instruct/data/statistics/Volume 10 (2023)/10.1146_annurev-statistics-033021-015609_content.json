{"Abstract": "This study examines the importance of sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa, with a focus on biostatistics. The authors highlight the need for enhanced human capital in the region, particularly in the field of biostatistics, to address the growing demand for data-driven decision-making in healthcare and research. A mixed-methods approach was employed to investigate the current state of biostatistical capacity in Africa, with a focus on the role of South-North collaboration in addressing knowledge gaps. The findings indicate that existing biostatistical capacity in Africa is limited, with a significant shortage of skilled professionals and inadequate infrastructure. The authors propose a sustainable capacity-building framework that incorporates consulting, education, and research initiatives, with a focus on building partnerships between African institutions and international organizations. This framework aims to enhance human capital, improve statistical infrastructure, and promote data-driven decision-making in Africa."}
