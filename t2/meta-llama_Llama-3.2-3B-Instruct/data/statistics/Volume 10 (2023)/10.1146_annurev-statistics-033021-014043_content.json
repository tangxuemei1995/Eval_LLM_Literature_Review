{"Abstract": "The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced by David Cox in 1972, has been a cornerstone of survival analysis for over five decades. This seminal model has been widely adopted to investigate the relationship between time-to-event outcomes and a set of covariates, accounting for competing risks and independent censoring. The Cox model has been extended to incorporate intensity and marginal rate models, which provide a more nuanced understanding of the underlying hazard function. Partial likelihood estimation has been employed to estimate model parameters, offering a computationally efficient approach to model fitting. The incorporation of time-dependent covariates has also been a significant development, enabling researchers to capture the dynamic nature of the relationship between covariates and the hazard rate. Over the past fifty years, the Cox model has been extensively validated and has been applied to a diverse range of fields, including oncology, cardiology, and epidemiology. Despite its widespread adoption, the Cox model remains a subject of ongoing research and development, with recent advances in model extension and application to recurrent events data. This review aims to provide an overview of the key developments and applications of the Cox model, highlighting its enduring relevance in modern survival analysis."}
