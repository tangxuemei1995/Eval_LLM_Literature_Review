{"Abstract": "The intricate relationships between genes and their interactions in human disease have garnered significant attention in recent years. Epistasis, the phenomenon of gene-gene interactions, plays a crucial role in shaping the genetic architecture of complex human diseases. Recent advances in multiomics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have enabled researchers to uncover the complex interactions between genes and their regulatory networks. These studies have provided evidence for the importance of epistasis in modulating disease susceptibility and progression. For instance, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic variants that interact with each other to influence disease risk. Furthermore, computational models have been developed to predict the functional impact of these interactions on disease pathways. The integration of multiomics data with machine learning algorithms has also enabled the identification of novel epistatic interactions that may contribute to human disease. As precision medicine continues to evolve, a deeper understanding of gene interactions is essential for the development of targeted therapies and the prediction of individual disease risk. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on epistasis in human disease studies and its implications for precision medicine."}
