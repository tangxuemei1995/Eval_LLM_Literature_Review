{"Abstract": "The increasing recognition of the importance of diversity in precision medicine has led to a growing need to assess the generalizability of genetic associations across ancestry groups. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous variants associated with disease susceptibility, but the majority of these studies have been conducted in predominantly European cohorts. This limitation raises concerns about the applicability of these findings to diverse populations. Recent advances in polygenic risk scores (PRS) have enabled the prediction of disease susceptibility based on an individual's genetic makeup. However, the generalizability of PRS across ancestry groups remains uncertain. This review aims to discuss the current state of knowledge on the importance of diversity in precision medicine, with a focus on the generalizability of genetic associations across ancestry groups. We will examine the current evidence on the impact of ancestry on GWAS findings and the development of PRS, highlighting the need for increased diversity in research cohorts and consortia to improve the accuracy of disease susceptibility predictions. Ultimately, this review seeks to inform strategies for improving the generalizability of genetic associations across ancestry groups and enhancing the effectiveness of precision medicine in diverse populations."}
