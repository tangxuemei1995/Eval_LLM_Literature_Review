{"Abstract": "The rapid evolution of viruses poses significant challenges to the development of effective vaccines. Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV are prime examples of viruses that have adapted to evade host immune responses, necessitating the design of broad-spectrum vaccines that can provide universal protection. Recent advances in broadly neutralizing antibody (bNA) technology have shown promise in eliciting broad-spectrum immunity against these viruses. However, the complexity of viral genomes and the high mutation rates of rapidly evolving viruses pose significant hurdles to vaccine design. This review aims to discuss the current challenges and progress in designing broad-spectrum vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses. We examine the latest strategies for eliciting broad-spectrum immunity, including the use of bNA, mRNA-based vaccines, and viral vector-based vaccines. We also discuss the challenges associated with manufacturing and scaling up these vaccines, as well as the need for continued research and development to overcome the limitations of current vaccine technologies. Ultimately, the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses holds the key to preventing future pandemics and protecting global public health."}
