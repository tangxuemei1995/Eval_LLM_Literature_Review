{"Abstract": "The integration of data science in women's health presents a significant opportunity to improve reproductive and gynecologic health outcomes. However, challenges persist, including the lack of standardized electronic health records and limited availability of diverse datasets. This study examines the current state of data science in women's health, highlighting the need for standardized data collection and sharing protocols. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, researchers can identify patterns and trends in reproductive health data, informing evidence-based interventions and improving patient care. Ultimately, this research aims to bridge the gap between data science and women's health, driving innovation and improving health outcomes for women worldwide."}
