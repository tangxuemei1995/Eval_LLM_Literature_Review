{"Abstract": "The biomedical data landscape is plagued by inequality, with subpopulations often underrepresented or misrepresented, leading to biased models and poor health outcomes. This disparity can be addressed through the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly multiethnic machine learning and transfer learning. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on diverse datasets, AI can learn to recognize patterns and relationships that are specific to underrepresented subpopulations. Our research explores the potential of AI to mitigate data inequality by developing models that can adapt to shifting subpopulation demographics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in reducing bias and improving model performance on multiethnic datasets. Our findings have significant implications for healthcare, highlighting the need for diverse and representative datasets to ensure equitable AI-driven decision-making. By addressing data inequality, AI can help bridge the health disparities gap and promote health equity."}
