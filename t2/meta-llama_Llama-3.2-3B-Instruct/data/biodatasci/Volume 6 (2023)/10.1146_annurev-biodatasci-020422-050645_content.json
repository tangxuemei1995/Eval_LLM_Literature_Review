{"Abstract": "Single-cell multiomics is an emerging field that integrates multiple 'omics' technologies to analyze the complex interactions within individual cells. By combining next-generation sequencing, imaging, and other modalities, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and its impact on disease. This abstract reviews the current state of single-cell multiomics, highlighting the computational challenges and innovative approaches that enable the integration of diverse data types. We discuss the applications of single-cell multiomics in understanding cellular development, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. The integration of multimodal data also enables the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our review highlights the potential of single-cell multiomics to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and its translation to clinical applications."}
