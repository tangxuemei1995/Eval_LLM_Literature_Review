{"Abstract": "Deep generative models have revolutionized the field of functional and evolutionary genomics by enabling the generation of high-quality, synthetic genomic data. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are two prominent architectures that have been successfully applied to various genomics-related tasks, including gene expression prediction, chromatin state inference, and species classification. These models have been shown to outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, deep generative models have been used to analyze large-scale genomic datasets, providing insights into functional and evolutionary relationships between genes and their regulatory elements. This review provides an overview of the current state of deep generative models in functional and evolutionary genomics, highlighting their potential and limitations, and discussing future directions for research in this field."}
