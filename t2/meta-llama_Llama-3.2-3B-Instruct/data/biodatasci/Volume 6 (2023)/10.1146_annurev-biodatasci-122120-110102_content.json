{"Abstract": "Noncoding DNA sequences play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, yet their functional variants remain poorly understood. This study employs a multi-faceted approach combining sequence analysis, machine learning, and deep learning to identify functional sequences and variants in noncoding DNA. By integrating whole genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies, we discovered novel enhancer elements and rare variants associated with disease susceptibility. Our deep learning model accurately predicted variant effects, revealing novel regulatory mechanisms. These findings provide insights into the complex interplay between noncoding DNA and gene regulation, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine approaches."}
