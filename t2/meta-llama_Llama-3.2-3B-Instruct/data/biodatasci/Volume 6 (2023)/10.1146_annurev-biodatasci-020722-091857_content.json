{"Abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the field of cancer research by enabling the comprehensive analysis of tumor heterogeneity and the characterization of rare cell populations. By analyzing the transcriptome of individual cancer cells, scRNA-seq provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression, including the identification of novel cancer stem cells and the elucidation of the tumor microenvironment. Bioinformatics tools have been developed to facilitate the analysis of scRNA-seq data, allowing researchers to reconstruct cell trajectories, identify differentially expressed genes, and predict the functional roles of individual cells. The application of scRNA-seq in cancer research has also facilitated the development of personalized immunotherapies, enabling the identification of cancer-specific antigens and the design of targeted therapies. This review highlights the current state of scRNA-seq in cancer research and its potential for advancing our understanding of human cancers."}
