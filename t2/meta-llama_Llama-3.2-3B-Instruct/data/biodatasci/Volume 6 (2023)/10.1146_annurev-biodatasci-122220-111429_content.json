{"Abstract": "Virus-derived small RNAs and microRNAs play a crucial role in modulating host gene expression, influencing the progression of various diseases. This study focuses on the analysis of v-miRNAs, a class of microRNAs encoded by viruses, including the Epstein-Barr virus. Utilizing bioinformatics tools and resources, we investigated the prevalence and functional significance of v-miRNAs in different viral infections. Our results reveal that v-miRNAs can regulate host immune responses, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we discuss the development of viral RNA bioinformatics resources, enabling researchers to explore the vast repertoire of v-miRNAs and their implications in human health and disease."}
