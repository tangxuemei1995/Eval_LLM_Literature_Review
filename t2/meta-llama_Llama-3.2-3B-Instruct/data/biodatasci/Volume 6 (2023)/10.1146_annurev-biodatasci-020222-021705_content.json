{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of human genomics in understanding the complex interactions between viral pathogens and host immune systems. This study investigates the contributions of rare and common variants to COVID-19 pneumonia, a severe manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified associations between genetic variants and the risk of developing severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Notably, variants in genes involved in type I interferon signaling, a key component of innate immunity, were significantly associated with increased susceptibility to severe disease. Furthermore, rare variants in genes encoding proteins involved in inborn errors of immunity were also found to contribute to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings highlight the critical role of genetic factors in modulating the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore the importance of personalized medicine approaches in the management of COVID-19. The identification of genetic variants associated with severe disease may also inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies."}
