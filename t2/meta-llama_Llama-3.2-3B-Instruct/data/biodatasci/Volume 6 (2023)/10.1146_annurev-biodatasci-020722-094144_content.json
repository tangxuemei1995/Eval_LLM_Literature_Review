{"Abstract": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has revolutionized the field of prenatal care by enabling the detection of genetic abnormalities in fetal cells circulating in maternal blood. Recent advances in liquid biopsy technologies have improved the accuracy and efficiency of NIPT, leveraging circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) as biomarkers. The use of machine learning algorithms and next-generation sequencing has enhanced the detection of rare genetic variants and improved the resolution of NIPT results. However, challenges persist, including the need for standardized protocols, the impact of maternal health on cfDNA and cfRNA quality, and the potential for false positives. Despite these challenges, NIPT holds great promise for improving prenatal care, enabling early intervention, and reducing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing NIPT protocols and expanding its applications to diverse populations."}
