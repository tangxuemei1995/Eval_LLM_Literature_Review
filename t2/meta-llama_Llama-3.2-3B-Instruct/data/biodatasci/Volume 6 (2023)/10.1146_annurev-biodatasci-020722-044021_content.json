{"Abstract": "Alternative splicing is a critical process in gene expression that generates diverse transcript variants and isoforms, leading to increased functional diversity of proteins. Recent advances in sequencing technologies, including short-read RNA-seq and long-read RNA-seq, have enabled the comprehensive identification of splice variants and isoforms. Top-down mass spectrometry approaches have also been developed to analyze protein isoforms and proteoforms, providing insights into post-translational modifications and protein post-translational regulation. This review highlights the current state of research on the identification of splice variants and isoforms in transcriptomics and proteomics, with a focus on the integration of sequencing and mass spectrometry technologies. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach and their potential applications in understanding the complex regulation of gene expression and protein function."}
