{"Abstract": "Recent advances in computational chemistry and machine learning have significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches in drug discovery. By leveraging deep learning algorithms and GPU acceleration, researchers can now rapidly process vast libraries of molecules, enabling the identification of potential lead compounds. Structure-based virtual screenings, which utilize molecular docking and free energy simulations, have also been refined to better predict binding affinities and ligand-receptor interactions. The integration of machine learning models with these computational methods has further enhanced the accuracy and speed of virtual screening, allowing for the identification of promising candidates with reduced experimental costs. This review highlights the recent developments in ultralarge and structure-based virtual screening approaches, with a focus on their applications in drug discovery and the future directions for this rapidly evolving field."}
