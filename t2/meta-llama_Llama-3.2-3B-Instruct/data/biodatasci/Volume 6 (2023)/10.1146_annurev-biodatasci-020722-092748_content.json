{"Abstract": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by varying molecular and radiological features. Recent advances in radiomics and genomics have enabled the development of novel risk assessment models for breast cancer. This study combines molecular and radiomic features to predict breast cancer risk. We analyzed a cohort of 1000 breast cancer patients and 1000 healthy controls, extracting radiomic features from mammography and ultrasound images. Additionally, we extracted single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genomic data. We calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on the SNPs and radiomic features. Our results showed that the combined model outperformed traditional risk assessment models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95. The model identified high-risk patients with a 30% increased likelihood of developing breast cancer within 5 years. Our findings suggest that integrating molecular and radiomic features can improve breast cancer risk assessment, enabling early detection and personalized treatment strategies. These results have significant implications for breast cancer prevention and early intervention."}
