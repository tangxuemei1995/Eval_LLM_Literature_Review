{"Abstract": "Autism is a complex and heterogeneous neuropsychiatric phenotype characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. The increasing availability of digital health data and advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new avenues for the development of digital phenotyping tools and personalized interventions for autism. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in data science and ML for autism, highlighting the potential of digital phenotyping, crowdsourcing, and digital psychiatry in improving diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for individuals with autism. We discuss the various types of digital data that can be leveraged, including electronic health records, wearable devices, and social media platforms, and review the existing literature on ML algorithms and techniques used for autism diagnosis, prediction, and monitoring. A roadmap for future research is also presented, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, standardization of data and methods, and the development of evidence-based digital interventions. By integrating data science and ML into autism research, we can accelerate the development of more effective and personalized treatments, ultimately improving the lives of individuals with autism and their families."}
