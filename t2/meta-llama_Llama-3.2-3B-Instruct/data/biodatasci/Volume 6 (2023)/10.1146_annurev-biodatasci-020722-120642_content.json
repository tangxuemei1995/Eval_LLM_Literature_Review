{"Abstract": "Aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by the accumulation of distinct cellular and molecular alterations, collectively referred to as aging hallmarks. Recent advances in single-cell analysis have enabled the deciphering of these hallmarks at the cellular level, revealing intricate mechanisms underlying aging progression. This study leverages cutting-edge analytical tools and a comprehensive data resource to investigate the expression and dynamics of aging hallmarks in human cells. By identifying key intervention targets and elucidating the underlying mechanisms, our findings provide novel insights into the aging process, paving the way for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related diseases."}
