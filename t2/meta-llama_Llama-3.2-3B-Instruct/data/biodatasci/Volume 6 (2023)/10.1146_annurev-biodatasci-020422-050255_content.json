{"Abstract": "Single-cell proteomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by enabling the comprehensive analysis of protein expression at the single-cell level. Computational methods play a crucial role in this field, facilitating the integration of mass cytometry and spatial proteomics data. This abstract reviews recent advances in data analysis, clustering, and trajectory inference for single-cell proteomics. We discuss the application of machine learning algorithms, dimensionality reduction techniques, and spatial modeling to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in single-cell proteomic data. By leveraging these computational methods, researchers can gain insights into cellular behavior, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex biological systems."}
