{"Abstract": "The All of Us Research Program, launched by the National Institutes of Health, has established a unique data and research center to accelerate biomedical research through the integration of diverse data sources. This center creates a secure, scalable, and sustainable ecosystem for researchers to access and analyze large-scale genomic, clinical, and electronic health records data. By leveraging the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from over 400,000 participants, researchers can explore the complex relationships between genetic variations, environmental factors, and disease outcomes. The data ecosystem also incorporates diverse datasets, including genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data, to foster precision medicine approaches. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, with robust safeguards in place to protect participant confidentiality. The All of Us Data and Research Center has the potential to revolutionize biomedical research by providing a comprehensive and integrated platform for researchers to explore the intricate connections between human biology and disease."}
