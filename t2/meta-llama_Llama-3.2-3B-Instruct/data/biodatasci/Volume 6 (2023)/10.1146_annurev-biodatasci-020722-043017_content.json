{"Abstract": "The human microbiome is a complex ecosystem comprising trillions of microorganisms that inhabit the human body, playing a crucial role in maintaining health and contributing to the development of various diseases. Biomedical data scientists can leverage advanced sequencing technologies, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), to analyze the microbiome's composition and function. This abstract reviews the current state of microbiome research, highlighting the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding the relationships between the microbiome and human health. By integrating microbiome data with other biomedical datasets, data scientists can develop novel predictive models and therapeutic strategies to combat microbiome-related diseases, ultimately improving human health outcomes."}
