{"Abstract": "The increasing availability of genomic data from admixed populations presents a unique challenge for the analysis of complex traits. Admixed individuals possess a mixture of genetic variants from different ancestral populations, which can lead to increased genetic heterogeneity and reduced power to detect associations with complex traits. This review aims to provide an overview of strategies for the genomic analysis of admixed populations, including the use of statistical methods to account for population structure and ancestry. We discuss the application of techniques such as principal component analysis, mixed-model association analysis, and machine learning-based approaches to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits in admixed populations. Additionally, we highlight the importance of considering the effects of admixture on genetic association studies and provide recommendations for the optimal analysis of genomic data from admixed populations."}
