{"Abstract": "This study examines the emotional foundation of social rank attainment, focusing on the role of pride in shaping individual and group behavior. Drawing on theories of self-conscious emotion and social identity, we argue that pride serves as a crucial motivator for individuals to strive for social status and prestige. Through a mixed-methods approach combining survey data and experimental designs, we investigate the relationship between pride, social rank, and dominance. Our findings suggest that individuals who experience higher levels of pride are more likely to engage in behaviors that enhance their social status, such as assertiveness and competition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pride can also foster a sense of self-conscious emotion, leading individuals to evaluate themselves in relation to others and strive for dominance. The implications of our study highlight the importance of pride in understanding social rank attainment and its role in shaping human behavior."}
