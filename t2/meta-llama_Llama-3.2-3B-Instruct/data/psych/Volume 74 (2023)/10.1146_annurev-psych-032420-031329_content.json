{"Abstract": "Conspiracy theories are complex and multifaceted phenomena that have garnered significant attention in recent years. This definitional approach examines the correlates, consequences, and communication patterns of conspiracy theories. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that conspiracy theories are characterized by a unique blend of cognitive biases, social influences, and emotional appeals. The predictors of conspiracy theory adoption include factors such as cognitive dissonance, social identity theory, and exposure to misinformation. The consequences of conspiracy theories are far-reaching, influencing not only individual attitudes and behaviors but also societal norms and institutions. Effective communication strategies are crucial in mitigating the spread of conspiracy theories, requiring a nuanced understanding of their underlying psychological and social mechanisms. By elucidating the definitional characteristics of conspiracy theories, this research aims to inform the development of targeted interventions and counter-narratives to promote critical thinking and media literacy."}
