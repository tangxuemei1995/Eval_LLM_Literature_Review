{"Abstract": "Careless responding in survey data poses a significant threat to the validity and reliability of survey research findings. This phenomenon encompasses various forms of invalid responding, including insufficient effort, random, and lazy responses. To address this issue, this review synthesizes existing literature on prevention, identification, and best practices for dealing with careless responding in survey data. The findings highlight the importance of survey design, question wording, and respondent engagement strategies in minimizing careless responding. Additionally, techniques for identifying and handling invalid responses, such as data cleaning and weighting methods, are discussed. By adopting these best practices, researchers can enhance the quality and accuracy of their survey data, ultimately informing more informed decision-making and policy development."}
