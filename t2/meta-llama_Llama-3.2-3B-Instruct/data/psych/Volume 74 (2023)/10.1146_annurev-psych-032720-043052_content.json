{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between gender inclusion and fit in STEM fields, with a focus on the impact of person-environment fit on career satisfaction and job performance. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of STEM professionals. The results indicate that individuals who reported higher levels of gender inclusion in their workplaces experienced greater person-environment fit, leading to improved job satisfaction and performance. Conversely, those who felt excluded or marginalized due to their gender reported lower levels of fit, resulting in decreased job satisfaction and performance. The findings suggest that promoting gender inclusion and addressing stereotypes in STEM fields is crucial for fostering a positive work environment that supports the well-being and success of all employees. The study's implications highlight the need for organizations to prioritize diversity and inclusion initiatives to create a more inclusive and supportive STEM workforce."}
