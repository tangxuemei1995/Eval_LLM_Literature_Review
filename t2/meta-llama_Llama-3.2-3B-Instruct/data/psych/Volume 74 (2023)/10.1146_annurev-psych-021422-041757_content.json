{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between working memory and behavior, focusing on the role of selective attention in shaping anticipatory processes. By examining the neural mechanisms underlying vision-action coupling, our research reveals that working memory plays a critical role in modulating selective attention, thereby influencing behavior. We demonstrate that individuals with enhanced working memory capacity exhibit improved anticipation and expectation of visual stimuli, leading to more accurate and efficient action execution. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the neural networks involved in working memory and selective attention interact to facilitate the integration of sensory information and motor responses. These results have implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between cognitive and motor processes, and highlight the importance of working memory in guiding behavior."}
