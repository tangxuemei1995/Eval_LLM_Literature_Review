{"Abstract": "The development of color perception and cognition is a complex and multifaceted process that spans from infancy to adulthood. Research has shown that infants as young as a few months old can distinguish between different colors, with color vision maturing significantly by 6-12 months of age. As children progress through childhood, their color perception and cognitive abilities continue to evolve, with studies demonstrating improved color recognition and identification skills. This abstract reviews the current literature on the development of color perception and cognition in infancy and childhood, highlighting key findings and theoretical perspectives. The findings suggest that color perception is closely tied to cognitive development, with color recognition playing a critical role in learning and memory. Understanding the developmental trajectory of color perception and cognition has important implications for education and visual development interventions."}
