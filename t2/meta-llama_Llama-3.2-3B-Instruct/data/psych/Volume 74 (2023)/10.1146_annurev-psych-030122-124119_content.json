{"Abstract": "Cancer-related stressors pose a significant threat to the psychological and physiological well-being of cancer patients and survivors, compromising optimal health outcomes. This review synthesizes existing literature on stress management interventions aimed at facilitating psychological and physiological adaptation in cancer populations. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and stress management interventions have emerged as effective strategies to mitigate cancer-related stressors and promote resilience. These interventions focus on enhancing coping skills, emotional regulation, and social support, ultimately leading to improved psychological adaptation and physiological resilience. The review highlights the importance of integrating stress management interventions into comprehensive cancer care, with a focus on optimizing health outcomes and enhancing quality of life. By exploring the efficacy of CBT and stress management interventions, this review provides a framework for healthcare providers to develop evidence-based strategies for supporting cancer patients and survivors in navigating the complex landscape of cancer-related stressors."}
