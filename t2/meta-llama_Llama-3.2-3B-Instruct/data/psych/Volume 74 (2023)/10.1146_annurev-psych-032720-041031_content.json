{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex process of human object vision, focusing on the formation and representation of object representations in the visual cortex. By leveraging deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), we analyze the neural responses to various objects and identify the key features that contribute to accurate object recognition. Our results demonstrate that the visual cortex processes objects in a hierarchical manner, with early stages emphasizing low-level features and later stages incorporating higher-level representations. The findings have significant implications for understanding human behavior, as they suggest that object representations play a crucial role in guiding decision-making and action. The study's results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human object vision, shedding light on the intricate relationships between perception, cognition, and behavior."}
