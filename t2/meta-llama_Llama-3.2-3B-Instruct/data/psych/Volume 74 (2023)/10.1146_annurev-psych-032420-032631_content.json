{"Abstract": "This study integrates socioecological and genetic perspectives to examine the complex interplay between culture and personality. By analyzing trends in cultural values and personality traits across historical periods, we identify the roots of these dynamics in socioecological factors such as environmental pressures, social norms, and technological advancements. Genetic influences on personality are also considered, with a focus on the interaction between genes and environment. Our framework highlights the dynamic interplay between nature and nurture, demonstrating how cultural and genetic factors shape and influence each other. The findings have implications for understanding cultural and personality change, and the natureâ€“nurture debate, shedding light on the complex relationships between culture, personality, and the human experience."}
