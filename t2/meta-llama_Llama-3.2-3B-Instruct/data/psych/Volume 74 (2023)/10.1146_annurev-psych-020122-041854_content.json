{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of affect-regulation in psychological resilience, particularly in the context of adversity and stress. Affect-regulation refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one's emotions, which is a critical component of psychological resilience. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research investigates the relationship between affect-regulation and resilience in individuals facing adversity. The results show that individuals with high affect-regulation skills exhibit better resilience outcomes, including reduced stress and improved psychological health. The findings suggest that affect-regulation is a key mediator between adversity and resilience, highlighting the importance of emotional awareness and management in promoting psychological well-being. The study contributes to the understanding of the affect-regulation framework as a crucial component of psychological resilience, with implications for the development of interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in individuals facing adversity."}
