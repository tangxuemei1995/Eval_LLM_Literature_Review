{"Abstract": "This study examines the psychological factors underlying climate change acceptance and climate action, with a focus on the role of values and climate change beliefs. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey of 1000 participants revealed significant correlations between climate change beliefs and values, with individuals holding more environmentally friendly values being more accepting of climate change. Additionally, a thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with 30 participants revealed that climate change action is often hindered by conflicting values and a sense of powerlessness. The findings suggest that addressing climate change requires a shift in values and a re-evaluation of individual and collective responsibilities. The study's results have implications for climate change policy and practice, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the psychological factors driving climate change acceptance and action. Ultimately, this research contributes to the development of effective climate change interventions that prioritize values-based behavior change."}
