{"Abstract": "This study examines the concept of self-continuity, a fundamental aspect of psychological health, and its relationship with attitudes, behavior, and cultural influences. Drawing on theories of collective self and social identity, the research investigates how individuals perceive and maintain a sense of continuity with their past selves, present identities, and future selves. A mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and content analysis was employed to collect data from a diverse sample of participants. The findings suggest that self-continuity is positively correlated with positive attitudes towards oneself and one's life, as well as adaptive behavior. Cultural factors, such as collectivist versus individualist orientations, were found to shape self-continuity experiences. The study's results have implications for our understanding of psychological health, self-concept, and the role of culture in shaping individual experiences of self-continuity. The findings also highlight the importance of promoting self-continuity as a means of fostering psychological well-being and resilience."}
