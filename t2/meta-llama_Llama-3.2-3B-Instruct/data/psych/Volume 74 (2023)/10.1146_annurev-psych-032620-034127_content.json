{"Abstract": "Sleep plays a crucial role in cognitive function, with research indicating that adequate sleep is essential for optimal memory consolidation, attention, and executive function. This study examines the relationship between sleep and cognition, with a focus on the impact of sleep structure and age on cognitive performance. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that sleep deprivation can lead to impaired memory recall, decreased attention span, and reduced cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, age-related changes in sleep patterns, such as reduced sleep duration and altered sleep architecture, can exacerbate these effects. The findings of this review highlight the importance of optimizing sleep structure, including maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and creating a sleep-conducive environment. By understanding the need for sleep to improve cognition, individuals can take proactive steps to enhance their cognitive function and overall quality of life."}
