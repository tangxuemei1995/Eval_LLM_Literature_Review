{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes the current state of psychosocial and integrative oncology interventions across the disease trajectory, from diagnosis to end-of-life care. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, and mindfulness-based mind-body therapies have been shown to alleviate anxiety, depression, and distress in cancer patients. Emerging mind-body therapies, including psychedelic-assisted interventions, demonstrate promise in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Integrative oncology approaches, combining conventional treatments with complementary therapies, have been found to enhance patient well-being and survival outcomes. The review highlights the need for further research on the efficacy and optimal integration of these interventions, as well as their potential to address the complex psychosocial needs of cancer patients and their families."}
