{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of systemic racism and psychological resilience among African Americans, drawing on a qualitative analysis of autobiographical narratives. Through in-depth interviews with 30 African American individuals, this research explores the ways in which systemic racism shapes the experiences of Black individuals and influences their psychological well-being. The findings suggest that African Americans employ various coping strategies to navigate the challenges of racism, including cultural resilience, social support networks, and adaptive coping mechanisms. The study highlights the importance of considering the cultural context in which individuals experience racism and the need for targeted interventions to promote psychological resilience among marginalized communities. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between racism, culture, and psychological well-being, with implications for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion."}
