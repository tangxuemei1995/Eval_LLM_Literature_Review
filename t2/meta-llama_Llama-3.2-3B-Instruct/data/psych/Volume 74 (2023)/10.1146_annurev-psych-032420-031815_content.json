{"Abstract": "Evaluative conditioning is a fundamental concept in social psychology that refers to the process by which individuals form attitudes and make associations between stimuli and propositions. This phenomenon has been extensively studied in the past, with early research by Miller and Ross (1975) demonstrating the role of evaluative conditioning in attitude formation. More recent studies have expanded our understanding of evaluative conditioning, highlighting its relationship with external validity and the importance of considering contextual factors. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the past, present, and future of evaluative conditioning research, examining key findings, methodological limitations, and future directions. By synthesizing existing literature, this review seeks to advance our understanding of evaluative conditioning and its implications for attitude formation and behavior. The findings of this review have significant implications for fields such as marketing, education, and public health, highlighting the need for further research on the external validity of evaluative conditioning."}
