{"Abstract": "Self-compassion is a multifaceted construct that encompasses the ability to acknowledge and accept oneself with kindness, understanding, and acceptance in the face of adversity. This concept has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance psychological well-being and resilience. Theoretical frameworks, such as the self-compassion model, provide a foundation for understanding the complex relationships between self-compassion, mindfulness, and emotional regulation. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated the positive correlations between self-compassion and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression. Interventional studies have also shown that self-compassion-based programs can be effective in promoting resilience and enhancing overall well-being. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of self-compassion research, highlighting key findings, theoretical perspectives, and practical applications. By synthesizing existing literature, this review seeks to contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions aimed at promoting self-compassion and improving mental health outcomes."}
