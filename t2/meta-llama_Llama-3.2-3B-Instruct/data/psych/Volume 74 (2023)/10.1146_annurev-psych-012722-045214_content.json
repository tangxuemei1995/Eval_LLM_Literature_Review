{"Abstract": "This study examines the psychological factors underlying athletic endeavor, with a focus on the interplay between early specialization, athlete motivation, and social cognition. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The results indicate that early specialization is associated with increased stress and decreased motivation in athletes, while social cognition plays a critical role in regulating athlete stress and promoting motivation. Coaching practices that emphasize group processes and social support are found to be effective in mitigating the negative effects of early specialization and promoting athlete well-being. The findings have implications for the development of evidence-based coaching strategies and the promotion of athlete mental health."}
