{"Abstract": "This study revisits the scope and significance of historical criminology, a field that has been marginalized in recent years. By examining the evolution of criminal justice systems across different historical periods, this research highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between social, economic, and political factors that shape crime and punishment. Through an interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from sociology, history, and criminology, this study demonstrates the value of historical criminology in providing a nuanced understanding of the historical context of crime and justice. The findings of this research underscore the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the historical development of criminal justice systems, and highlight the potential for historical criminology to inform contemporary debates in the field. Future directions for the field are also discussed, including the potential for increased interdisciplinarity and a more critical examination of the historical roots of contemporary crime and justice policies."}
