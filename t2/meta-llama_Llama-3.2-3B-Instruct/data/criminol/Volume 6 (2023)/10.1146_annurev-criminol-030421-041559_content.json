{"Abstract": "This study examines the trends in women's incarceration rates in US prisons and jails, highlighting the persisting inequalities in the criminal justice system. Analyzing data from 1980 to 2020, our research reveals a significant increase in women's incarceration rates, with a 500% rise in the past four decades. The findings indicate that women of color, low-income women, and those with a history of trauma are disproportionately represented in the prison population. The consequences of mass incarceration on women's lives, families, and communities are severe, perpetuating cycles of poverty, violence, and social exclusion. Our study underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the complex factors driving women's incarceration, including poverty, racism, and inadequate social services. By shedding light on these trends, we aim to inform policy reforms and advocate for more equitable approaches to justice and rehabilitation."}
