{"Abstract": "Overcriminalization refers to the proliferation of laws that exceed the intended purpose of criminalizing a behavior, often resulting in the criminalization of previously acceptable actions. This phenomenon has sparked intense debate among scholars, policymakers, and practitioners, with concerns that it undermines the rule of law, erodes civil liberties, and perpetuates mass incarceration. This abstract provides an overview of six key questions surrounding overcriminalization, a complex and multifaceted issue that warrants further exploration. Firstly, what are the primary drivers of overcriminalization, and how do they intersect with other factors such as discretion, enforcement, and punishment? Secondly, how do the harms caused by overcriminalization manifest, and what are the most effective defenses against its negative consequences? Thirdly, what role do offense categories play in the perpetuation of overcriminalization, and how can they be reformed to promote more targeted and effective regulation. Fourthly, how do the relationships between criminalization, discretion, and enforcement contribute to overcriminalization, and what strategies can be employed to mitigate these effects. Fifthly, what are the implications of overcriminalization for punishment, and how can it be reformed to prioritize rehabilitation and restorative justice. Finally, what policy and legislative reforms can be implemented to address overcriminalization, and how can they be evaluated for their effectiveness in promoting more just and equitable outcomes. By examining these six questions, this abstract aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of overcriminalization and its far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and society as a whole."}
