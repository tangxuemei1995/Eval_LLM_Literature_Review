{"Abstract": "The proliferation of surveillance technologies has raised significant concerns regarding their impact on constitutional law, particularly with regards to the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. This study examines the intersection of surveillance technologies and constitutional law, with a focus on the implications of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biometrics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) on individual rights. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case law, this research identifies key areas of tension between the need for law enforcement to utilize surveillance technologies to prevent and investigate crime, and the need to protect individual privacy and constitutional rights. The findings of this study highlight the need for a nuanced and context-specific approach to regulating surveillance technologies, one that balances competing interests and ensures that constitutional rights are protected in an evolving technological landscape."}
