{"Abstract": "Carjacking, a form of robbery where a perpetrator forces or deceives a victim into relinquishing control of their vehicle, has become a significant concern for law enforcement agencies nationwide. This study examines the scope, structure, process, and prevention strategies of carjacking, drawing from data collected through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). A comprehensive analysis of crime trends reveals that carjacking rates have increased over the past decade, with a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. The study identifies key factors influencing carjacking decision-making, including economic necessity, peer pressure, and opportunistic circumstances. To inform effective prevention strategies, the research highlights the importance of situational awareness, vehicle security measures, and community-based initiatives. By understanding the complexities of carjacking, policymakers and law enforcement can develop targeted interventions to reduce victimization and prevent this type of crime."}
