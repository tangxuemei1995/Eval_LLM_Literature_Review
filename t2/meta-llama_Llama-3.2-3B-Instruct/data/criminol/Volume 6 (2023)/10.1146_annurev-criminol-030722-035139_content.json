{"Abstract": "The current crisis of American criminal justice is a multifaceted phenomenon that warrants a structural analysis. Mass incarceration, a hallmark of the US penal system, has led to a staggering increase in the prison population, with over 2.3 million individuals behind bars. This trend is deeply intertwined with the broader social and economic context, including the erosion of the welfare state and the concentration of wealth among the elite. The police killings of unarmed black individuals, such as George Floyd and Trayvon Martin, have further highlighted the systemic racism and brutality that pervades the US criminal justice system. This analysis examines the interplay between political economy, social control, and criminal violence, arguing that the crisis of American criminal justice is a symptom of a larger societal malaise. By exploring the historical and contemporary factors that have contributed to this crisis, this study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between the state, economy, and society, and to inform potential solutions to address the root causes of this crisis."}
