{"Abstract": "This study investigates the feasibility and efficacy of minimal supervision in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders released from prison. Building on the concept of mass supervision, our research examines the impact of reduced supervision on recidivism rates, community reintegration, and offender behavior. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative data from a large-scale survey of parolees with qualitative insights from in-depth interviews with community supervisors. The results suggest that, while minimal supervision may lead to cost savings and increased efficiency, it can also compromise the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs and increase the likelihood of recidivism. Conversely, a balanced approach that combines minimal supervision with targeted support and monitoring appears to be more effective in promoting community reintegration and reducing reoffending. The findings of this study have implications for the development of community supervision policies and practices, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach that balances supervision intensity with offender needs and circumstances."}
