{"Abstract": "This study examines the viability of conservative criminal justice reform in the face of a rising crime rate, a pressing concern for Republican policymakers. Drawing on theoretical frameworks from public choice theory and institutional economics, our analysis assesses the potential impact of conservative reforms on recidivism rates and the common good. We find that, while conservative reforms may initially reduce recidivism, their long-term effects are uncertain and may ultimately exacerbate social problems. Our results suggest that a nuanced approach, balancing individual liberty with collective security, is necessary to ensure the success of conservative criminal justice reform. By incorporating evidence-based policies and stakeholder engagement, policymakers can mitigate the risks associated with reform and promote a more effective and equitable justice system."}
