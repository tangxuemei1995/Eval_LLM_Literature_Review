{"Abstract": "This study seeks to contribute to the burgeoning field of criminology by integrating critical race theory (LatCrit) with existing criminological frameworks to provide a nuanced understanding of Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement. Drawing on the principles of LatCrit, this research examines the intersections of racism, ethnicity, and power in shaping the experiences of Latino/a/x individuals within the criminal justice system. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and empirical data, this study identifies the ways in which systemic racism and bias perpetuate disparities in arrest rates, sentencing, and incarceration rates among Latino/a/x populations. The findings of this research highlight the need for a more inclusive and equitable approach to criminological theory, one that acknowledges the complex and multifaceted nature of Latino/a/x identity and experiences. By centering the voices and perspectives of Latino/a/x individuals and communities, this study aims to challenge dominant narratives and power structures that have historically marginalized and excluded them from mainstream criminological discourse. Ultimately, this research seeks to contribute to a more just and equitable criminal justice system by promoting a deeper understanding of the ways in which race, ethnicity, and power intersect to shape the experiences of Latino/a/x individuals within the criminal justice system. The implications of this research have significant theoretical and practical applications for criminologists, policymakers, and community-based practitioners working to address the complex issues surrounding Latino/a/x crime and criminal justice system involvement."}
