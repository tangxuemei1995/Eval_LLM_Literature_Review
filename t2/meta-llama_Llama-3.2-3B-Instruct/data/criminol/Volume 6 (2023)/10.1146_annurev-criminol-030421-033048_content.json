{"Abstract": "This study revitalizes ethnographic research on the intersection of immigration and crime, drawing on qualitative methods and the Chicago School's foundational framework. Through in-depth interviews and observations, we examine the experiences of new immigrants in Chicago, exploring how their social and economic contexts shape their involvement in crime. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between structural factors, such as poverty and lack of access to resources, and individual agency, as new immigrants navigate the challenges of settlement and integration. By centering the voices and perspectives of new immigrants, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which immigration shapes crime patterns and vice versa. The study's ethnographic approach offers a critical counterpoint to more quantitative and policy-focused research on immigration and crime, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of these issues."}
