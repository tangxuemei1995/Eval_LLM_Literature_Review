{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of far-right and jihadi terrorism within the United States, spanning from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks to the January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol. A comprehensive review of existing literature and primary sources reveals a complex and multifaceted landscape of extremist ideologies. Far-right and jihadi groups have increasingly intersected, with some individuals and organizations adopting hybrid ideologies that combine elements of white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and Islamist extremism. The study highlights the growing threat of far-right and jihadi terrorism, including hate crimes and violent attacks on minority communities, law enforcement, and critical infrastructure. The January 6th insurrection serves as a pivotal moment, illustrating the potential for extremist ideologies to mobilize and manifest in violent action. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics between far-right and jihadi extremism, emphasizing the need for coordinated counter-terrorism strategies and inclusive counter-narratives to address the root causes of radicalization. By examining the intersections and synergies between these two forms of extremism, this study aims to inform policy and practice, ultimately mitigating the threat of terrorism and promoting public safety in the United States."}
