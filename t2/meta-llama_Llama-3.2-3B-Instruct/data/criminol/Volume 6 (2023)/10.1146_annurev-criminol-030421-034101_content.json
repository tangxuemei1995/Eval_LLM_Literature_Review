{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolution of police observational research in the twenty-first century, focusing on the integration of qualitative and systematic social observation methods. Building on the principles of procedural justice, the research highlights the importance of reactivity and reflexivity in observational studies. By employing a systematic approach to data collection, researchers can minimize reactivity and ensure the accuracy of findings. Reflexivity is also crucial in acknowledging the researcher's role in shaping the observational process. The study demonstrates the value of combining qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of police observational research. The findings have implications for the development of more effective and just policing practices, and highlight the need for continued methodological innovation in this field."}
