{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between police unionism, accountability, and misconduct, with a focus on the implications of collective bargaining agreements on law enforcement practices. A critical review of existing literature reveals that police unions often prioritize protecting officers from accountability measures, leading to a culture of impunity and excessive use of force. The authors argue that the current system of collective bargaining agreements perpetuates a 'blue wall of silence,' hindering efforts to address police misconduct. A mixed-methods approach combining survey research and case studies is employed to investigate the impact of unionization on police accountability in the United States. The findings suggest that unionized departments tend to have higher rates of police misconduct and less effective accountability mechanisms. The study's conclusions highlight the need for reforming collective bargaining agreements to promote greater transparency and accountability in law enforcement practices."}
