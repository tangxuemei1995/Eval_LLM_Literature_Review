{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on carceral systems worldwide, resulting in unprecedented challenges for correctional facilities and law enforcement agencies. This review aims to provide an overview of the incidence of COVID-19 in prisons and jails, highlighting the key factors that contribute to the spread of the virus. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, incorporating studies published between January 2020 and December 2022. The results indicate that the incidence of COVID-19 in carceral systems has been alarmingly high, with reported cases and deaths exceeding those in the general population. Effective mitigation strategies, including vaccination, social distancing, and enhanced hygiene practices, have been implemented in various jurisdictions. However, the challenges of maintaining these measures in confined environments remain significant. This review highlights the need for continued research and collaboration between policymakers, healthcare professionals, and correctional administrators to develop evidence-based guidelines for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in carceral systems. By doing so, we can reduce the risk of infection and minimize the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable populations."}
