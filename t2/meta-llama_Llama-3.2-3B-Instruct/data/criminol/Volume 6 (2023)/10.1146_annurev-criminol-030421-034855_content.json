{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intersection of peace and crime, exploring the concept of 'predatory peace' and its environmental consequences. Through a critical analysis of autobiographical accounts of former combatants, this research reveals the ways in which post-conflict societies can perpetuate cycles of violence and exploitation. The findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of peace, one that acknowledges the complex relationships between conflict, crime, and environmental degradation. By examining the personal narratives of those who have experienced war, this study sheds light on the darker aspects of peace."}
