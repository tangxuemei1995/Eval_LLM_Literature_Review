{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of victim advocacy in criminal justice reform in England and Wales, with a focus on the women's movement. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative data from surveys, interviews, and policy documents. The findings suggest that victim advocacy has played a crucial role in shaping the criminal justice system, particularly in promoting the rights and needs of victims, including women. The women's movement has been instrumental in advocating for victim support services and reforming policies to prioritize victim-centered approaches. The study highlights the need for continued advocacy and reform to address ongoing injustices."}
