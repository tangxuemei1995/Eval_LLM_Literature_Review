{"Abstract": "This study undertakes a comparative analysis of police killings in the United States, examining the phenomenon of deadly force within the context of decentralized policing and the notion of American exceptionalism. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research assesses the relationship between policing practices, community relationships, and the use of lethal force. A comparative framework is employed to evaluate the policing strategies and policies of the United States in relation to other developed nations, with a focus on Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The findings suggest that the United States exhibits a unique pattern of policing, characterized by a reliance on decentralized authority and a cultural narrative of American exceptionalism. This narrative is linked to a higher incidence of police killings and a lack of accountability. The study's results highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of policing practices and the importance of adopting evidence-based strategies to reduce the use of deadly force and promote police accountability. Ultimately, this research contributes to a critical examination of the American model of policing and its implications for public safety and social justice."}
