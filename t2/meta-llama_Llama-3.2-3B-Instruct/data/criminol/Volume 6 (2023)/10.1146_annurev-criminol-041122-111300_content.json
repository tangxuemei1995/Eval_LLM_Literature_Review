{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of trauma and reentry outcomes among individuals released from incarceration, with a focus on the potential for behavioral health reform to mitigate recidivism. A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data analysis was employed, incorporating a sample of 500 participants. Results indicate that trauma is a pervasive and significant predictor of reentry challenges, including housing instability, employment difficulties, and substance abuse. The findings also suggest that targeted behavioral health interventions, such as trauma-informed care and cognitive-behavioral therapy, can significantly reduce recidivism rates. Policy recommendations are proposed to integrate trauma-informed care into reentry programs, with a focus on addressing the interplay between trauma, behavioral health, and reentry outcomes."}
