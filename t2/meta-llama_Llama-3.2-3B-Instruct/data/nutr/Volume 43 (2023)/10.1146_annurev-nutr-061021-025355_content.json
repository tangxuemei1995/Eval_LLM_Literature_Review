{"Abstract": "The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is a complex interplay between the gut microbiome, the gut epithelium, and the central nervous system, influencing various physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of maternal and infant nutrition in shaping the MGBA. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to impact the development of the infant's gut microbiota, with adequate intake of essential fatty acids, prebiotics, and probiotics promoting a healthy gut microbiome. The presence of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) components in breast milk also plays a crucial role in modulating the infant's gut microbiota. The incorporation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) into the infant's diet has been linked to improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Conversely, a diet high in processed foods and low in fiber and polyunsaturated fats may disrupt the MGBA, leading to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the impact of maternal and infant nutrition on the MGBA, highlighting the importance of evidence-based dietary recommendations for optimal infant development and long-term health outcomes."}
