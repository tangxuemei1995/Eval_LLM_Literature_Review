{"Abstract": "Riboflavin deficiency is a nutritional disorder that can lead to various clinical sequelae, including anemia and hypertension. The activation coefficient of erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGRac) is a sensitive indicator of riboflavin status, as it is essential for the enzyme's activity. Studies have shown that riboflavin deficiency can impair EGRac, leading to increased oxidative stress and cellular damage. Furthermore, riboflavin plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy erythrocytes, and deficiency can result in anemia characterized by reduced hemoglobin levels and increased red blood cell breakdown. Additionally, riboflavin has been linked to blood pressure regulation, and deficiency has been associated with hypertension. The dietary reference intakes for riboflavin are often not met, particularly in populations with limited access to nutrient-dense foods. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the causes and clinical sequelae of riboflavin deficiency, highlighting the importance of adequate riboflavin intake for maintaining optimal health."}
