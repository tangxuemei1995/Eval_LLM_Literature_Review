{"Abstract": "The multifunctional family of mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and transport. These proteins, comprising 15 members, are involved in the binding, transport, and storage of fatty acids, as well as their regulation in various cellular processes. FABPs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Additionally, alterations in FABP expression have been linked to cancer development and progression. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of FABPs in lipid transport and metabolism, suggesting that they may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic disorders and cancer. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of FABPs, their functions, and their implications in human disease, highlighting the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying their role in lipid metabolism and disease."}
