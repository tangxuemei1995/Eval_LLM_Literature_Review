{"Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health concern worldwide, characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver of individuals who consume minimal or no alcohol. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been identified as potential therapeutic agents in the management of NAFLD. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on NAFLD involve anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic pathways. DHA has been shown to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduce oxidative stress, and inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells, thereby mitigating liver inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical studies have demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can improve liver function, reduce liver enzymes, and slow disease progression in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and steatosis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of action and to establish the optimal dosage and duration of omega-3 fatty acid therapy for the treatment of NAFLD."}
