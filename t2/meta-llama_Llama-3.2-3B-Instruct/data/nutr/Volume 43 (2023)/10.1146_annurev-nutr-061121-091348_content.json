{"Abstract": "Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, has emerged as a multifaceted regulator of energy metabolism and bone homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted its role in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism, with implications for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Additionally, osteocalcin has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, making it a potential danger repellent against various diseases. The undercarboxylation of osteocalcin, a post-translational modification, has been implicated in its biological activity, suggesting a complex interplay between its structure and function. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying osteocalcin's multifaceted roles in human health and disease."}
