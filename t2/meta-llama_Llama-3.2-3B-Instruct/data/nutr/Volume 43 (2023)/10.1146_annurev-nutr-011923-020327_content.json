{"Abstract": "The use of dietary supplements is a ubiquitous aspect of modern health and disease management, yet significant gaps persist in our understanding of their role in human health. A critical review of existing literature reveals substantial limitations in the validity and reproducibility of dietary supplement use assessments, primarily due to measurement errors and methodological flaws. Current dietary assessment methods often rely on self-reported data, which are prone to biases and inaccuracies. Furthermore, the lack of standardization in supplement labeling and dosing regimens exacerbates the challenges in accurately measuring supplement use. The consequences of these gaps are far-reaching, as they can lead to misinformed health decisions, inadequate treatment of underlying conditions, and a failure to identify potential interactions between supplements and medications. To address these limitations, this review emphasizes the need for rigorous methodology and standardized approaches to dietary supplement use assessments. By promoting the development of reliable and valid measurement tools, we can enhance our understanding of the complex relationships between dietary supplements and health outcomes, ultimately informing evidence-based health practices and policy decisions."}
