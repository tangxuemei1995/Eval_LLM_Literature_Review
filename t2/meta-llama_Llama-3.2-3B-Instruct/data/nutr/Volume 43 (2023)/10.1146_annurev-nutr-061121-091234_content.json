{"Abstract": "Malnourished Microbes: Host–Microbiome Interactions in Child UndernutritionChild undernutrition is a pervasive global health issue, characterized by stunting and wasting, resulting from inadequate nutrient intake and impaired host–microbiome interactions. The human microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis, regulating nutrient absorption, and influencing metabolic pathways. In malnourished children, alterations in the microbiome composition and function have been observed, leading to impaired nutrient utilization and increased susceptibility to infections. This review synthesizes existing evidence on the host–microbiome interactions in child undernutrition, highlighting the complex relationships between the microbiome, nutrient availability, and growth outcomes. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the malnourished microbiome, including changes in microbial diversity, gene expression, and metabolic activity. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing targeted interventions to prevent and treat child undernutrition, and to promote healthy growth and development in vulnerable populations."}
