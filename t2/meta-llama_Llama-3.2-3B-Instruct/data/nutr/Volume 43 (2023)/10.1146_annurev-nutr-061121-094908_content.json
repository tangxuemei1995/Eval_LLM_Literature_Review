{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between diet and the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and obesity. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between dietary components and the gut microbiota, with alterations in the microbiome composition and metabolic activity contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the diet-microbiome interaction and its implications for gastrointestinal health. We discuss the mechanisms by which dietary factors influence the gut microbiome, including fermentation, metabolomics, and the gut-brain axis. Furthermore, we explore the potential of microbiome-targeted therapies, including prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, as strategies to modulate the gut microbiome and alleviate gastrointestinal disorders. By elucidating the complex relationships between diet, microbiome, and disease, this review provides a framework for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat gastrointestinal disorders."}
