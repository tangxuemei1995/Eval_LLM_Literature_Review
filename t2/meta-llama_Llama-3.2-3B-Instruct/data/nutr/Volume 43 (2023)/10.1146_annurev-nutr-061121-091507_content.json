{"Abstract": "Gluconeogenesis is a vital metabolic pathway that generates glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, playing a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. However, dysregulation of gluconeogenesis has been implicated in various metabolic diseases, including insulin resistance and cancer. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of gluconeogenesis flux in metabolic disease, with a focus on the impact of insulin resistance, hormone dysregulation, and enzyme deficiency on gluconeogenic pathways. We also discuss the potential therapeutic strategies targeting gluconeogenesis in metabolic disorders, including the development of novel inhibitors and modulators of key enzymes involved in this pathway. Understanding the complex interplay between gluconeogenesis and metabolic disease is essential for the development of effective treatments and interventions."}
