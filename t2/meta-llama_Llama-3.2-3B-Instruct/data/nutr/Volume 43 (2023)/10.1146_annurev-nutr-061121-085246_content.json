{"Abstract": "The placenta is a complex, dynamic organ that serves as the primary interface between the maternal and fetal circulations, facilitating the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products. The syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated layer of trophoblast cells, plays a crucial role in histiotrophic nutrition, where it directly absorbs nutrients from the maternal bloodstream. In contrast, hemotrophic nutrition, mediated by the cytotrophoblast, involves the uptake of nutrients from the maternal blood through the formation of microvilli. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of placental mosaicism, where genetic variations within the placental tissue can impact fetal development and health. The expression of nutrient transporters, such as glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and folate receptor 1 (FR1), is essential for the efficient transfer of essential nutrients across the placental barrier. This review aims to provide an overview of the placenta's role in maternofetal nutrition, highlighting the complex interplay between histiotrophic and hemotrophic nutrition and the critical functions of nutrient transporters in maintaining fetal health."}
