{"Abstract": "Precision nutrition, a concept emphasizing tailored dietary approaches based on individual genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, has gained significant attention in recent years. However, the scientific evidence supporting its application in public health recommendations for the prevention of chronic disease is limited and often exaggerated. A critical review of existing literature reveals that the complexity of human biology and the variability in nutrient requirements among individuals pose significant challenges to the development of personalized nutrition plans. Furthermore, the lack of standardization in genetic testing and the limited understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors hinder the translation of genetic data into actionable dietary recommendations. As a result, public health recommendations for the prevention of chronic disease should be grounded in evidence-based guidelines that prioritize a balanced and varied diet, rather than relying on unproven precision nutrition approaches."}
