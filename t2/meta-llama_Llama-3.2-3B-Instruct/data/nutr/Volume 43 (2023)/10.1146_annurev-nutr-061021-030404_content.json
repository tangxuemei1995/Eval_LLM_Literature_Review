{"Abstract": "Iron homeostasis is a critical process during pregnancy, as maternal iron stores are depleted and the fetus requires increasing amounts of iron for growth and development. Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, is upregulated during pregnancy, leading to decreased iron absorption and increased iron sequestration in the placenta. The placenta plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis, producing hepcidin and regulating iron transfer to the fetus. Maternal inflammation, which is common during pregnancy, also affects iron homeostasis, exacerbating hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration. Fetal iron requirements are met through a complex interplay of placental and maternal mechanisms, including the transfer of iron from the mother to the fetus via the placenta. Dysregulation of iron homeostasis during pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency, which has significant consequences for maternal and fetal health. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of iron homeostasis during pregnancy is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent and treat iron deficiency in pregnant women."}
