{"Abstract": "Intestinal amino acid transport plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic health by regulating the absorption of essential amino acids from the diet. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of epithelial cell membrane transporters in modulating amino acid uptake and utilization. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of intestinal amino acid transport and its relationship to metabolic health. We discuss the key players involved in amino acid transport, including the SLC and SLC41 families of membrane transporters, and their role in regulating amino acid homeostasis. Protein restriction has been shown to alter intestinal amino acid transport, leading to changes in metabolic health outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying intestinal amino acid transport is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in this field, highlighting the potential for targeted interventions to improve metabolic health."}
