{"Abstract": "Serine is a non-essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including nutrition, health, and disease. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of serine sources, sinks, and metabolic flux in the context of human health and disease. Serine is synthesized from glycine and pyruvate through the serine hydroxymethyltransferase reaction, and its metabolic pathways are tightly regulated by various enzymes and transcription factors. Abnormal serine metabolism has been implicated in the development of neuropathy and diabetes, highlighting the importance of serine in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recent advances in metabolomics have enabled the identification of serine-related biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new avenues for the prevention and treatment of serine-related disorders. This review will discuss the current state of knowledge on serine metabolism, its implications for human health, and potential therapeutic strategies for serine-related diseases."}
