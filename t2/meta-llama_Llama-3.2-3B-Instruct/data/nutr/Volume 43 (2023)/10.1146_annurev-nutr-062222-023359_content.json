{"Abstract": "This study aims to assess and monitor nutrition security in the United States, with a focus on promoting healthy dietary intake and outcomes. A comprehensive review of existing literature on food security and nutrition security indicators was conducted to identify key factors influencing nutrition security. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with qualitative insights from focus groups and interviews with stakeholders. The results indicate that nutrition security is closely linked to food security, with limited access to nutrient-dense foods and inadequate dietary knowledge contributing to poor nutrition outcomes. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions and policies to improve nutrition security, including increased access to healthy food options, nutrition education, and community-based initiatives. The findings have implications for public health policy and practice, emphasizing the importance of addressing nutrition security to promote healthy dietary intake and outcomes in the US population."}
