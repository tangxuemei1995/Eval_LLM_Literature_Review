{"Abstract": "This study examines the complexities of sovereign debt puzzles, a phenomenon where countries with high public debt levels experience reduced borrowing costs and increased investor confidence. Despite the intuitive expectation that high debt levels should lead to higher borrowing costs, empirical evidence suggests that sovereign debt puzzles occur due to factors such as credit rating upgrades, improved fiscal discipline, and increased investor demand. The findings of this research highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of sovereign debt puzzles and their implications for public debt management and fiscal policy."}
