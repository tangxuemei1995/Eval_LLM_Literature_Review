{"Abstract": "This study examines the default and bankruptcy resolution mechanisms in China, focusing on the interplay between state-owned banks, shadow banks, and bond markets. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) have been a persistent issue in China's financial system, with significant implications for economic stability. The paper analyzes the impact of China's bankruptcy law on default resolution, highlighting the role of state-led restructuring and the implications for shadow banks and bond markets. The findings suggest a complex and evolving landscape for default resolution in China."}
