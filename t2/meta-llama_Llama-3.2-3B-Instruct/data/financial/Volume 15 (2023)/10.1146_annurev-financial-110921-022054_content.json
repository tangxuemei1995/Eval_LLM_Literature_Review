{"Abstract": "This study examines the trends in state and local pension funds in the United States, with a focus on retirement policies, pension costs, and government debt. Analyzing data from 2010 to 2020, the research reveals a significant increase in pension costs for state and local governments, driven by rising actuarial assumptions and demographic changes. The findings indicate that state and local governments have been relying heavily on borrowing to finance pension liabilities, contributing to growing government debt. The study also explores the impact of pension reform policies on state and local pension funds, highlighting the challenges of balancing retirement security with fiscal sustainability. The research provides insights into the complex relationships between pension costs, government debt, and retirement policies, with implications for policymakers seeking to address the long-term fiscal challenges facing state and local governments."}
