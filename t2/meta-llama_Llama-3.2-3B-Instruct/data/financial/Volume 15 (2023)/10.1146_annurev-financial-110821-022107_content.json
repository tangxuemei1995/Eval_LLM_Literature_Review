{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to macro-financial stability worldwide, with far-reaching implications for emerging markets. This paper provides a retrospective analysis of the crisis, focusing on the responses of monetary policymakers and their impact on financial stability. The literature review reveals that the pandemic-induced shock led to a significant increase in debt levels, reduced economic activity, and heightened market volatility. The paper examines the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies, such as quantitative easing and forward guidance, in mitigating the crisis. The findings suggest that these policies helped to stabilize financial markets and support economic recovery in emerging markets. However, the paper also highlights the need for policymakers to consider the long-term implications of their actions and to develop more effective strategies for promoting macro-financial stability in the face of future crises."}
