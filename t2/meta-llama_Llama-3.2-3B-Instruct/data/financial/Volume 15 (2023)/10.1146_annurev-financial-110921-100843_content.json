{"Abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of swing pricing in the mutual fund industry, where liquidity transformation and fire sales are employed to manage fund liquidity. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that swing pricing can be a double-edged sword, providing liquidity benefits to fund managers while also increasing market volatility and potentially leading to fire sales. Empirical evidence from a sample of mutual funds is presented to illustrate the mechanics of swing pricing and its impact on market dynamics. The findings suggest that swing pricing can be an effective tool for liquidity management, but its use must be carefully calibrated to avoid destabilizing market conditions. The study contributes to the existing literature on liquidity management and highlights the need for further research on the optimal use of swing pricing in the mutual fund industry."}
