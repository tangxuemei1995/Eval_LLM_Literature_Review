{"Abstract": "This study employs epidemiological models to forecast the spread of COVID-19, a global pandemic that has posed significant challenges to public health systems. By analyzing historical data and incorporating key factors such as transmission rates, vaccination rates, and non-pharmaceutical interventions, our models provide insights into the dynamics of the pandemic. The results indicate that timely and targeted interventions can significantly impact the trajectory of the outbreak, highlighting the importance of data-driven decision-making in epidemiological forecasting. Our findings contribute to the development of more accurate and effective epidemiological models, ultimately informing policy responses and guiding public health strategies to mitigate the impact of future pandemics."}
