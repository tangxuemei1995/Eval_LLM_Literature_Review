{"Abstract": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative short-term rate benchmarks has significant implications for the financial markets. This study examines the performance of various post-LIBOR rate benchmarks, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the Securitized Overnight Index Average (SONIA), and the Bank of England's Sterling Overnight Repurchase Rate (BSYR), in replacing LIBOR. Our analysis reveals that SOFR and SONIA have emerged as the most suitable alternatives, with lower credit risk and improved risk-free characteristics. In contrast, Euribor and Ameribor have struggled to replicate LIBOR's performance, highlighting the need for more robust risk-free rate benchmarks. We also investigate the impact of these new benchmarks on interest rate derivatives, finding that BSYR and AXI have shown promising results in replicating LIBOR's characteristics. Our findings have important implications for financial market participants, policymakers, and regulators seeking to mitigate the risks associated with LIBOR's decline. By providing a comprehensive assessment of post-LIBOR rate benchmarks, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts to establish a more stable and resilient financial system."}
