{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential of Robo-Advice in transforming households into rational economic agents by leveraging FinTech innovations. By analyzing the intersection of behavioral finance and household finance, we examine how Robo-Advice platforms can mitigate cognitive biases and optimize consumption, debt, and investment decisions. Our findings suggest that personalized financial recommendations and automated portfolio management can lead to improved financial outcomes, reduced debt, and increased investment returns. By bridging the gap between financial literacy and behavioral finance, Robo-Advice has the potential to democratize access to financial services and promote more rational economic decision-making among households."}
