{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household behavior, focusing on consumption, credit, and investments. Analyzing data from a large-scale survey, we find that households adjusted their spending patterns in response to the pandemic-induced economic uncertainty. Notably, households increased their consumption of essential goods and services, while reducing discretionary spending. Additionally, households turned to credit to mitigate financial shocks, with a significant increase in credit utilization. Investments in assets such as stocks and real estate also experienced a surge. Our findings suggest that households employed various coping mechanisms to navigate the pandemic-induced economic environment, highlighting the importance of understanding household finance behavior during times of crisis."}
