{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on fixed income markets, utilizing a panel data analysis framework. The results indicate that the pandemic led to significant market volatility, with bond yields experiencing substantial fluctuations. The fixed income market's response to the crisis was characterized by a pronounced credit risk premium, as investors sought safer assets. The study also reveals that the crisis exacerbated existing inequalities in the market, with smaller investors facing disproportionate losses. The findings contribute to our understanding of the COVID-19 crisis's effects on fixed income markets, highlighting the need for policymakers to develop targeted interventions to mitigate market instability."}
