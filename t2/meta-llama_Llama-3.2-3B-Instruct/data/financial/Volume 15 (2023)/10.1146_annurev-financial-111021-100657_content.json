{"Abstract": "This study examines the recent trends and developments in the IPO and SPAC markets, with a focus on the impact of emerging trends on unicorn companies. The analysis reveals that SPACs have become a popular alternative to traditional IPOs, offering a more efficient and cost-effective route to market. Meanwhile, direct listings have gained traction, allowing companies to bypass the traditional IPO process. The use of dual-class shares has also become more prevalent, enabling companies to maintain control and flexibility. The study also explores the role of confidential filings and the implications for unicorn companies seeking to go public. The findings highlight the need for regulatory clarity and updated guidelines to accommodate the evolving IPO and SPAC landscape."}
