{"Abstract": "Climate stress testing is a critical tool for assessing the resilience of financial systems to the impacts of climate change. This research provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the potential climate-related risks to financial stability, with a focus on systemic risk. By integrating climate risk into traditional stress testing methodologies, financial institutions can better manage their exposure to climate-related shocks and maintain financial stability. The study employs a multi-faceted approach, combining econometric analysis, scenario planning, and scenario analysis to assess the potential impacts of climate change on financial systems. The results highlight the need for financial institutions to adopt a proactive approach to climate risk management, including the development of climate-resilient business models and the implementation of climate-risk aware risk management practices. The findings of this research have significant implications for policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions seeking to mitigate the systemic risk posed by climate change and ensure the long-term financial stability of the global economy."}
