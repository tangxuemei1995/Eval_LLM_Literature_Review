{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between financial economics and the social discount rate, a concept central to government valuation and fair value accounting. The social discount rate is a critical component in budgetary accounting, as it determines the present value of future government expenditures and revenues. Financial economics provides a framework for understanding the social discount rate, but its limitations are also evident. This paper reviews the current literature on the social discount rate, highlighting the differences between government and private discount rates. It also discusses the implications of the social discount rate for fair value accounting and budgetary accounting. The study concludes that financial economics can provide valuable insights into the social discount rate, but its application is subject to limitations and requires careful consideration of government-specific factors. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers and financial practitioners seeking to accurately value government assets and liabilities."}
