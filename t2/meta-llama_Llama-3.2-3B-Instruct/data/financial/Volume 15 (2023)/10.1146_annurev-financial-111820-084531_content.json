{"Abstract": "This introduction to the ARFE theme on the social discount rate highlights the importance of accurately valuing public investments over time, considering the intergenerational trade-offs associated with government decisions. The social discount rate is a critical component in government valuation, as it determines the present value of future costs and benefits. However, the choice of discount rate can significantly impact the outcome of valuation studies, particularly when assessing the cost of carbon and other environmental externalities. This theme explores the various approaches to estimating the social discount rate, including the use of cost of carbon, and discusses the implications of different discount rate assumptions on public investment decisions. By examining the current state of knowledge on the social discount rate, this theme aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities in government valuation, ultimately informing more effective public investment strategies that balance present and future generations' needs."}
