{"Abstract": "This study revisits the efficiency of pari-mutuel betting markets at racetracks and lotteries, leveraging stochastic programming optimization models to analyze the impact of various biases, including the favorite-longshot bias. By incorporating data from multiple racetracks and lotteries, our analysis reveals that the efficiency of these markets is compromised by the presence of biases, leading to suboptimal outcomes for bettors. Our results suggest that incorporating lottery strategies and employing stochastic programming optimization models can mitigate these biases, ultimately leading to more efficient betting markets. The findings have implications for bettors, racetrack operators, and policymakers seeking to promote fair and transparent betting practices."}
