{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi), a rapidly growing field that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate financial transactions. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and protocols for loanable funds (PLFs) are key components of DeFi, enabled by smart contracts that automate trustless and permissionless interactions. The Ethereum platform serves as a primary infrastructure for DeFi applications, with its smart contract functionality facilitating the creation and execution of complex financial protocols. This research examines the potential benefits and challenges of DeFi, with a focus on the role of smart contracts in enabling decentralized lending and borrowing mechanisms."}
