{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between fiscal capacity and asset prices from an asset pricing perspective. We investigate how changes in government debt maturity and term structure impact the convenience yield, a key component of fiscal policy. Our analysis reveals a significant positive relationship between fiscal capacity and asset prices, suggesting that investors perceive fiscal policy as a reliable source of returns. The findings have important implications for understanding the role of fiscal policy in shaping asset prices and the behavior of investors in the market for government securities."}
