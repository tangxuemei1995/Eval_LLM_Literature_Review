{"Abstract": "This study examines the interplay between borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy in the context of missing participants and missing markets. We argue that the social discount rate, a key parameter in economic models, is influenced by these factors, leading to incomplete markets and inefficient allocation of resources. Our analysis reveals that borrowing constraints and altruistic behaviors can exacerbate the social discount rate, resulting in a preference for short-term gains over long-term benefits. Furthermore, the desire for legacy can lead to intergenerational transfers, which in turn affect the social discount rate. Our findings have implications for understanding the behavior of individuals and households in the presence of missing markets and incomplete financial systems."}
