{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between inflation and asset returns, with a focus on the impact of monetary policy on bond return predictability. Using a sample of developed economies, we find that inflation has a significant and persistent effect on asset returns, with higher inflation leading to higher risk premia and lower bond returns. Our results also suggest that the relationship between inflation and asset returns is exacerbated during periods of stagflation, where both high inflation and economic stagnation coexist. The findings have implications for monetary policy and asset pricing models, highlighting the need for policymakers to consider the impact of inflation on financial markets."}
