{"Abstract": "This study examines the current state of public discounting systems and proposes a framework for risk-adjusted discounting to mitigate the impact of carbon pricing on vulnerable populations. Our analysis reveals that traditional cost-benefit analysis methods often fail to account for the disproportionate effects of carbon pricing on low-income households. We develop a novel risk-adjusted discounting approach that incorporates socioeconomic data to estimate the true cost of carbon pricing on different demographic groups. Our results show that risk-adjusted discounting can significantly reduce the burden of carbon pricing on low-income households, while maintaining the overall effectiveness of carbon pricing in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed framework has implications for policymakers seeking to design more equitable and effective carbon pricing systems."}
