{"Abstract": "The increasing reliance on algorithmic decision-making in various domains has raised concerns about bias and unfairness in machine learning models. This study examines the application of fairness metrics in credit scoring algorithms to mitigate bias and promote fairness. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that traditional metrics, such as equal opportunity and demographic parity, are often insufficient in detecting and addressing bias in credit scoring models. This paper proposes a novel approach to evaluating fairness in credit scoring algorithms using a multi-faceted framework that incorporates both statistical and fairness metrics. The proposed framework is applied to a large dataset of credit scores, revealing significant bias in the existing models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying and mitigating bias, ultimately leading to more fair and equitable credit scoring decisions. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of fair and transparent machine learning models in various applications."}
