{"Abstract": "This study examines the historical context of banking crises, with a focus on the role of intermediation, leverage, and the lender of last resort. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key factors that contribute to the outbreak of banking crises, including excessive leverage, inadequate regulation, and systemic instability. Our analysis reveals that historical banking crises, such as the Great Depression and the 2008 global financial crisis, share common characteristics, including a buildup of leverage, a decline in confidence, and a failure of the lender of last resort. By examining the historical lessons of these crises, policymakers and regulators can develop more effective strategies for maintaining financial stability and preventing future banking crises."}
