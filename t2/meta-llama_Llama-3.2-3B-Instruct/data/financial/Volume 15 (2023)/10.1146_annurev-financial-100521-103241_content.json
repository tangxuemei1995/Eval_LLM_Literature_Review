{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving landscape of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting recent trends and research findings. An analysis of distressed debt defaults and recovery rates reveals a shift towards increased private equity involvement and creditor rights. The rise of leveraged loans and 363 sales has also transformed the bankruptcy process. Notably, the study finds that private equity firms have become key players in restructuring and recovery efforts, often prioritizing asset sales over debt forgiveness. These insights offer valuable perspectives on the current state of Chapter 11 bankruptcy and its implications for creditors and debtors alike."}
