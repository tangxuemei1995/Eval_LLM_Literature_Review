{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of microdata in macro-finance, a field that traditionally relies on aggregate data. By leveraging microdata, researchers can identify patterns and trends that may be obscured by aggregated data. The authors employ a novel approach, combining microdata on individual financial transactions with macroeconomic indicators to estimate the impact of macroeconomic shocks on individual financial behavior. The results show that microdata can provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between macroeconomic variables and individual financial decisions. The authors demonstrate how microdata can be used to identify the most vulnerable populations to macroeconomic shocks and to inform policy interventions. The study highlights the potential of microdata to bridge the gap between micro and macro perspectives in finance, enabling more accurate and targeted policy decisions. The findings have implications for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to better understand the complex relationships between macroeconomic variables and individual financial behavior."}
