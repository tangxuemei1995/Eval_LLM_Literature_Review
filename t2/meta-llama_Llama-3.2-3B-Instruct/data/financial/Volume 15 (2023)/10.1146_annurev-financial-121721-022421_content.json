{"Abstract": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a widely used concept in benefit-cost analysis, intergenerational decision-making, and environmental economics. This concept refers to the rate at which future benefits are discounted to their present value. The SDR has been subject to intense debate and criticism, with various scholars arguing that it is a flawed and culturally relative concept. This paper provides an in-depth examination of the legal and philosophical underpinnings of the SDR, drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature. We analyze the historical development of the SDR, its theoretical foundations, and its application in different fields. Our analysis reveals that the SDR is deeply rooted in Western cultural and economic values, which may not be universally applicable. We also discuss the implications of the SDR for intergenerational justice, fairness, and the distribution of costs and benefits. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced and context-dependent approach to the SDR, one that takes into account the diverse values and preferences of different societies and cultures. Ultimately, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the SDR and its role in shaping our understanding of the future and our responsibilities towards it."}
