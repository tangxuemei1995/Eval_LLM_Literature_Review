{"Abstract": "This study examines the application of nonlinear dynamics in macro-finance models, specifically dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, to capture systemic risk and endogenous jump risk. By incorporating financial constraints and liquidity considerations, we demonstrate that traditional DSGE models can be improved upon to better account for the complexities of financial systems. Our results show that nonlinear dynamics can effectively model the interactions between macroeconomic variables and financial shocks, leading to more accurate predictions of systemic risk and liquidity crises. The findings have significant implications for macro-finance modeling and policy-making."}
