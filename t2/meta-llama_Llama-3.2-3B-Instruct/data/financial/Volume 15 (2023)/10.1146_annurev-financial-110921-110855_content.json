{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of inflation on the term structure of interest rates, focusing on inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives. We employ the HJM model to analyze the dynamics of inflation-indexed instruments and derive a break-even inflation rate that captures the equilibrium relationship between nominal and inflation-adjusted yields. Our results indicate that inflation swaps and derivatives can effectively hedge against inflation risk, while inflation-adjusted bonds exhibit a unique term structure that reflects the expected inflation path. The findings have implications for investors seeking to manage inflation risk and policymakers aiming to stabilize the economy."}
