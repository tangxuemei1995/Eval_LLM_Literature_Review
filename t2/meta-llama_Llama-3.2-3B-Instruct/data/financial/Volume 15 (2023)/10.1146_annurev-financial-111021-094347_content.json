{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainable finance, with a focus on the role of externalities and responsible shareholder mandates in driving corporate decarbonization. The concept of greeniums, or the value created by companies that prioritize environmental sustainability, is also explored. Our analysis reveals that CSR initiatives can have a significant impact on a company's financial performance, particularly in the context of sustainable finance. We find that companies that adopt responsible shareholder mandates and prioritize decarbonization are more likely to experience increased greeniums and improved financial outcomes. Our findings have implications for policymakers and business leaders seeking to promote sustainable finance and reduce corporate externalities. By integrating CSR and sustainable finance, companies can create long-term value and contribute to a more environmentally sustainable future."}
