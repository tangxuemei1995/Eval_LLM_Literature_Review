{"Abstract": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a groundbreaking therapeutic class for the management of kidney diseases, including diabetic and nondiabetic kidney disease. By inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose excretion, thereby decreasing the metabolic burden on the kidneys. This leads to a significant reduction in albuminuria, a key biomarker of kidney damage, and a slowing of the progression of kidney disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in improving kidney outcomes, including reduced risk of acute kidney injury and cardiovascular events. The mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors also suggests potential benefits in patients with nondiabetic kidney disease, making them a promising therapeutic option for a broader range of patients with kidney disease."}
