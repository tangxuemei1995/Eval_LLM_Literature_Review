{"Abstract": "Club cell secretory protein (CCSP), also known as uteroglobin or secretoglobin 1A1 (SCGB1A1), plays a crucial role in maintaining lung homeostasis and protecting against various lung diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the emerging concepts of CCSP's involvement in lung injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. CCSP's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have been implicated in modulating the immune response and mitigating tissue damage in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, CCSP has been identified as a potential biomarker for lung disease diagnosis and prognosis. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of CCSP's role in lung biology and its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of lung diseases. The findings of this review have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for lung disease management."}
