{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin production, leading to debilitating anemia, organ damage, and increased mortality. Gene therapy offers a promising approach to treating SCD by correcting the underlying genetic defect. This review synthesizes diverse approaches to gene therapy of SCD, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant, gene editing, and lentiviral vector-based delivery systems. CRISPR-Cas9, a powerful gene editing tool, has been explored for precise modification of the HBB gene. Lentiviral vectors, capable of long-term gene expression, have been used to deliver therapeutic genes to hematopoietic stem cells. The efficacy and safety of these approaches are discussed, highlighting the potential for gene therapy to revolutionize the treatment of SCD, offering new hope for patients worldwide."}
