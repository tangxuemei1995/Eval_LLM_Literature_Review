{"Abstract": "Valvular heart disease encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart valves, leading to impaired cardiac function and increased morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shed new light on the pathophysiology of valvular heart disease, highlighting the complex interplay between valve structure, function, and surrounding tissue. Novel therapeutic approaches, including minimally invasive interventions and targeted pharmacotherapies, are being explored to improve outcomes for patients with valvular heart disease."}
