{"Abstract": "This study examines the trends and opportunities for prevention of maternal mortality in the United States. Analyzing data from 2015 to 2020, we found a significant increase in maternal mortality rates, with disparities persisting across racial and socioeconomic groups. Preconception health and counseling emerged as critical factors in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our findings suggest that targeted interventions, including preconception counseling and access to reproductive healthcare, can mitigate maternal mortality. Furthermore, addressing social determinants of health, such as poverty and lack of access to healthcare, is essential for reducing maternal mortality disparities. By understanding the trends and opportunities for prevention, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop effective strategies to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health outcomes in the US."}
