{"Abstract": "Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis in the body. Dysregulation of hepcidin has been implicated in various health and disease states, including anemia and iron overload. This review highlights the complex interplay between hepcidin and iron, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced hepcidin expression. We discuss the clinical implications of hepcidin dysregulation, including its role in anemia of chronic disease and iron overload disorders, and explore potential therapeutic strategies for modulating hepcidin activity."}
