{"Abstract": "Multispecific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for lymphoma treatment. By incorporating multiple binding sites, these cells can simultaneously target and eliminate multiple tumor antigens, thereby preventing escape via antigen loss. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of trispecific CAR T cells in depleting lymphoma cells of their antigenic repertoire. Our results demonstrate that trispecific CAR T cells effectively recognize and eliminate lymphoma cells expressing multiple tumor antigens, including CD19, CD20, and BCMA. Notably, the use of multispecific CAR T cells resulted in a significant reduction in antigen loss, as measured by flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing. These findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cells may offer a novel strategy for overcoming antigen loss and achieving long-term remission in lymphoma patients. The results of this study have important implications for the development of next-generation CAR T cell therapies."}
