{"Abstract": "This study examines the origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies, specifically pulse oximetry and pulmonary function testing. Structural racism and algorithmic bias in medical devices have been identified as key contributors to disparities in healthcare outcomes. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that the development and validation of pulmonary technologies have been influenced by societal and cultural norms, perpetuating existing health inequities. The use of biased algorithms and data-driven decision-making processes exacerbates these disparities, highlighting the need for diverse and inclusive approaches to the development and implementation of pulmonary technologies. Understanding the roots of bias is crucial for mitigating health disparities in pulmonary care."}
