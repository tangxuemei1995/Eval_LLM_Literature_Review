{"Abstract": "Gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth has evolved to address the complex physical, emotional, and social needs of this population. Pubertal blockers, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, have been shown to effectively delay puberty, allowing for more informed decision-making regarding hormone treatment and surgical interventions. Gender-affirming hormone treatment, including estrogen and testosterone, has been demonstrated to improve mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. A comprehensive approach to care is essential, incorporating multidisciplinary teams and individualized treatment plans to optimize health and well-being for this vulnerable population."}
