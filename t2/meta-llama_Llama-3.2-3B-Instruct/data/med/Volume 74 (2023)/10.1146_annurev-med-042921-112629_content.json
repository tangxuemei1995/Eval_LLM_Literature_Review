{"Abstract": "Polygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as a promising tool for predicting individual risk of complex diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD). By integrating information from multiple genetic variants, PGS can provide a comprehensive risk assessment, accounting for the cumulative effect of multiple genetic factors. This review aims to summarize the current advances and applications of PGS in CAD, highlighting their potential as a risk prediction tool. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies examining the relationship between PGS and CAD risk, as well as the identification of novel genetic variants associated with CAD. The results indicate that PGS can accurately predict CAD risk, particularly in combination with traditional risk factors. Furthermore, PGS may also identify individuals at high risk of CAD who would benefit from early intervention and preventive measures. The findings of this review have significant implications for the development of personalized medicine approaches to CAD prevention and management, highlighting the need for further research into the application of PGS in clinical practice."}
