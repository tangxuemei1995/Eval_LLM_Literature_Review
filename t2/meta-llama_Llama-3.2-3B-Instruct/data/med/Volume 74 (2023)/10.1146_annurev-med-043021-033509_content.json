{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in endocrine disorders, with SARS-CoV-2 infection affecting various endocrine glands, including the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary. Obesity, a significant risk factor for endocrine diseases, has been exacerbated by the pandemic-induced lifestyle changes and socioeconomic factors. Studies have reported an increase in thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, in COVID-19 patients. The adrenal gland's response to stress, as triggered by the pandemic, has also been implicated in the development of Cushing's syndrome. Furthermore, reproductive endocrine disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), have been observed in women affected by COVID-19. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine disorders, highlighting the need for further research into the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human health."}
