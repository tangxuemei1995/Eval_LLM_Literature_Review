{"Abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the emergence of viral variants of concern (VOCs), which have significantly impacted vaccine efficacy and disease severity. This review examines the challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants, highlighting their distinct characteristics and transmissibility patterns. The study discusses the implications of VOCs on public health policy, vaccine development, and global response strategies, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance, research, and collaboration to mitigate the pandemic's impact."}
