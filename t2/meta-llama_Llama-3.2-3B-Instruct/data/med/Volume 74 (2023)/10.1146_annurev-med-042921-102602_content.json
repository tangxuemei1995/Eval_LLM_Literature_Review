{"Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a leading cause of anemia, characterized by impaired erythropoiesis due to reduced erythropoietin (EPO) production. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays a crucial role in regulating EPO expression. In this context, HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHIs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance EPO production and alleviate anemia in CKD patients. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the HIF pathway's regulation of erythropoiesis and its modulation by genetic and pharmacological perturbations. We discuss the effects of PHIs on HIF-Î± subunit stabilization, EPO gene transcription, and erythropoiesis in CKD models. Additionally, we examine the potential risks of thromboembolism associated with EPO therapy and the need for personalized treatment approaches. By integrating insights from basic and clinical research, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between the HIF pathway, EPO production, and erythropoiesis in CKD."}
