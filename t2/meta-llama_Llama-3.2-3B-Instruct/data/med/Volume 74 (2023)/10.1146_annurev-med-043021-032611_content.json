{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by diverse clinical manifestations and a complex pathophysiology. Recent advances in immunology and molecular biology have led to the development of novel diagnostic approaches, including the use of interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma to differentiate SLE from other autoimmune diseases. Additionally, biologic therapies targeting specific immune pathways, such as B-cell depletion and T-cell activation, have shown promise in reducing disease activity and improving patient outcomes. This review aims to summarize the current state of SLE diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of these new approaches and their potential impact on future clinical practice."}
