{"Abstract": "Undiagnosed syndromes pose a significant challenge in clinical practice, with many cases remaining unexplained despite extensive diagnostic evaluations. Exome and genome sequencing have emerged as powerful tools for identifying the underlying genetic causes of these enigmatic conditions. Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the rapid and cost-effective analysis of exomes and genomes, facilitating the detection of rare and ultrarare genetic variants. In this context, exome sequencing has been shown to be particularly effective in identifying Mendelian disease-causing mutations, which account for a significant proportion of undiagnosed cases. By leveraging these advanced sequencing technologies, clinicians can now rapidly and accurately diagnose a wide range of undiagnosed syndromes, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of exome and genome sequencing in the diagnosis of undiagnosed syndromes, highlighting its potential and limitations."}
