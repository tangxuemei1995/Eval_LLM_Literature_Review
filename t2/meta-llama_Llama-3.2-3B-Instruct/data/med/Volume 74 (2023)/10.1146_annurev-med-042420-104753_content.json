{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global health landscape, with significant consequences for individuals with pre-existing kidney disease. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the relationship between COVID-19 and kidney disease, with a focus on chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and the need for dialysis and kidney transplantation. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to exacerbate kidney injury and accelerate the progression of CKD in vulnerable populations. The incidence of KFRT (kidney failure requiring replacement therapy) has increased significantly during the pandemic, with dialysis and kidney transplantation rates rising substantially. The underlying mechanisms of COVID-19-related kidney disease are multifactorial, involving direct viral effects, systemic inflammation, and immune-mediated damage. Understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related kidney disease is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate its impact on patients with kidney disease. This review highlights the need for further research into the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-related kidney disease."}
