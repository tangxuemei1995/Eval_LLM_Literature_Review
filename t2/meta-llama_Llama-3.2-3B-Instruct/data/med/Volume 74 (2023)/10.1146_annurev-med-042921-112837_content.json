{"Abstract": "Cytokine Storm Syndrome is a life-threatening condition characterized by an excessive and uncontrolled release of cytokines, leading to hyperinflammation and tissue damage. This syndrome is often associated with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), conditions in which the immune system overreacts and attacks the body's own cells. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is another term used to describe this condition, which can occur in response to various triggers, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. The excessive cytokine release causes widespread inflammation, leading to cytolysis of cells and organs, and can result in multi-organ failure and death. Understanding the pathophysiology of Cytokine Storm Syndrome is crucial for the development of effective treatments, including immunomodulatory therapies and supportive care measures. Research into this syndrome has the potential to improve patient outcomes and provide new insights into the regulation of the immune system."}
