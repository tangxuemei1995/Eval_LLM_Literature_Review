{"Abstract": "Chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure is a debilitating condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness, leading to inadequate respiratory function. Home-assisted ventilation (HAV) has emerged as a viable treatment option, providing patients with the autonomy to manage their condition in a familiar environment. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) devices, such as bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), have been shown to improve respiratory outcomes and reduce hospitalization rates. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the effectiveness of HAV and NIV in managing chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure, highlighting the benefits and limitations of these interventions and their potential impact on quality of life."}
