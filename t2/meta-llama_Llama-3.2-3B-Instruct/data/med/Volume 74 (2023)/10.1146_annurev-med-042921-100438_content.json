{"Abstract": "Primary aldosteronism is a common endocrine disorder characterized by excessive production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid hormone that regulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure. This condition often leads to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have emerged as a therapeutic option for managing primary aldosteronism, as they effectively block the effects of aldosterone on the kidneys and heart. Studies have demonstrated that MRAs can reduce blood pressure, decrease left ventricular mass, and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with primary aldosteronism. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the role of MRAs in the management of primary aldosteronism, highlighting their potential benefits and limitations for patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease."}
