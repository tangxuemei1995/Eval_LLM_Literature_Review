{"Abstract": "Recent advances in massively parallel sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of novel genetic variants associated with kidney disease. A collapsing analysis of genomic data from patients with chronic kidney disease revealed a previously unrecognized role for rare disorders in modulating disease progression. This study highlights the importance of integrating genomic information into precision medicine approaches for kidney disease. By examining the genetic underpinnings of collapsing disorders, researchers can identify novel therapeutic targets and develop more effective treatment strategies. The findings of this study have significant implications for the diagnosis and management of genetic kidney disease, and underscore the need for further investigation into the complex interplay between genetics and kidney function."}
