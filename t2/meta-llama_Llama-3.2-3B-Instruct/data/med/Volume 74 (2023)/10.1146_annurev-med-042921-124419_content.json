{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of race in kidney function estimation, highlighting lessons learned and pathways toward health justice. Clinical algorithms often rely on race-based data, which can perpetuate health disparities. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms can inaccurately estimate kidney function in diverse populations. To address this issue, we propose a revised approach incorporating patient-specific factors and culturally sensitive data. By acknowledging the limitations of current methods, we aim to develop more equitable kidney function estimation tools, ultimately promoting health justice and improving outcomes for marginalized communities."}
