{"Abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains a significant threat to the health of transplant recipients, particularly those undergoing solid organ transplants and hematopoietic cell transplants. Letermovir, a potent antiviral agent, has emerged as a valuable tool in CMV prophylaxis and treatment. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the role of letermovir in preventing CMV disease in transplant recipients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, incorporating studies on the efficacy and safety of letermovir in solid organ transplant and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. The results indicate that letermovir is effective in reducing CMV disease incidence and severity, with a favorable safety profile. The use of letermovir as a prophylactic measure in high-risk transplant patients has been shown to be particularly beneficial. Overall, letermovir represents a valuable addition to the antiviral arsenal in the management of CMV infection in transplant recipients, offering a promising approach to preventing and treating this devastating disease."}
