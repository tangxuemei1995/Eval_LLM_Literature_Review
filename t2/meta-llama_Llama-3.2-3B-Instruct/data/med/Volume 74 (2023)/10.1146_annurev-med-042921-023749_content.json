{"Abstract": "The accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of tau protein is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, yet the development of effective therapeutics remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of tau as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and progression monitoring. However, the complex interactions between tau and other disease-related proteins hinder the identification of a single, reliable biomarker. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of tau's role in Alzheimer's disease, its potential as a biomarker, and the ongoing efforts to develop tau-targeting therapeutics, with a focus on the latest advances in tau biology and disease modeling."}
