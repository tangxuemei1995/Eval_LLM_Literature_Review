{"Abstract": "Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) gene therapy has emerged as a promising approach for treating hemophilia A and B, two inherited bleeding disorders caused by deficient factor VIII and IX proteins. By utilizing AAV vectors to deliver the genes encoding these clotting factors, researchers aim to restore normal hemostasis in affected individuals. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of AAV-mediated gene therapy in animal models of hemophilia, with significant improvements in bleeding symptoms and clotting factor production. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the translational potential of AAV gene therapy for hemophilia A and B, offering new hope for patients with this debilitating disease."}
