{"Abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by defective CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) function, leading to respiratory and digestive complications. CF modulator therapies aim to correct CFTR function by targeting specific molecular mechanisms. Recent studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of CF modulator therapies, including ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and trikaftor, in combination with ivacaftor. These therapies have shown significant benefits in improving lung function and reducing CFTR-dependent chloride transport in patients with CF, offering new treatment options for this debilitating disease."}
