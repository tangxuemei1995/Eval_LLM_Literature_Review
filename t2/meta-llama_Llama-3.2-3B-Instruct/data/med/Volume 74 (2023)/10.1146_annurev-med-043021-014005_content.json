{"Abstract": "Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are complex, heterogeneous conditions characterized by profound alterations in physiological and molecular phenotypes. Recent advances in critical care medicine have underscored the need for precision medicine approaches to tailor treatment strategies to individual patient subphenotypes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biological phenotyping of sepsis and ARDS, highlighting the importance of identifying distinct subphenotypes and their underlying molecular mechanisms. We discuss the role of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, in elucidating the phenotypic heterogeneity of these conditions. By integrating phenotypic data with clinical and outcome information, researchers and clinicians can develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for sepsis and ARDS, ultimately improving patient outcomes in critical care settings."}
