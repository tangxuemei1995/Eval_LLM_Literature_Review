{"Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but serious immunologic complication associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Characterized by the presence of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, VITT has been reported in various studies, primarily in individuals who received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The pathogenesis of VITT is multifactorial, involving immune-mediated mechanisms and the presence of prothrombotic factors. This complication has been linked to the formation of antibodies against platelet surface antigens, leading to platelet activation and aggregation. Prompt recognition and management of VITT are crucial to prevent severe outcomes, including mortality. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of VITT and to develop effective strategies for prevention and treatment of this condition."}
