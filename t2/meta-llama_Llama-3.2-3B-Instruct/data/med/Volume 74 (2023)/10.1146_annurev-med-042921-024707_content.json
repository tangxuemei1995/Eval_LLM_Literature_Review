{"Abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignant tumor of the bile duct, is characterized by its aggressive nature and limited treatment options. Recent studies have identified FGFR2 as a potential therapeutic target in this disease. FGFR2 mutations, fusions, and amplifications have been found in a subset of cholangiocarcinoma patients, suggesting a role for this receptor in tumor development and progression. In-frame deletions of the FGFR2 gene have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma. The RAS/MEK/EGFR signaling pathway is often dysregulated in cholangiocarcinoma, contributing to resistance to FGFR2 inhibition. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of FGFR2 in cholangiocarcinoma, including its molecular mechanisms, clinical significance, and potential therapeutic strategies. The development of targeted therapies, such as FGFR2 inhibitors, holds promise for improving treatment outcomes in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. However, the presence of resistance mechanisms, including RAS/MEK/EGFR signaling, must be addressed to maximize the efficacy of these therapies. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between FGFR2 and other signaling pathways in cholangiocarcinoma."}
