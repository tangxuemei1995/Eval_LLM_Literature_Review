{"Abstract": "Recent advances in the field of obesity treatment have led to the development of novel GLP-1 receptor agonists, dual receptor agonists, and triple receptor agonists, offering improved efficacy and reduced side effects compared to traditional antiobesity medications. Nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies (NuSH-based therapies) have also emerged as a promising approach, leveraging the body's natural response to nutrient intake to regulate appetite and metabolism. This review aims to summarize the current state of GLP-1 and NuSH-based therapies, highlighting their mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and future directions for obesity treatment."}
