{"Abstract": "The ISCHEMIA trial provided valuable insights into the management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease. A total of 5,997 patients with stable angina were randomized to either invasive or conservative approaches. The results showed that both strategies resulted in significant reductions in cardiovascular events, with no significant difference in mortality rates. Optimal medical therapy was found to be a crucial component in both groups, emphasizing the importance of personalized treatment plans. These findings have significant implications for the management of stable ischemic heart disease, highlighting the need for individualized treatment strategies."}
