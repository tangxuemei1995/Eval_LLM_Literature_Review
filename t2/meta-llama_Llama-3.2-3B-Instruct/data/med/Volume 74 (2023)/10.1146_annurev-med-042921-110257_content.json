{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant risk of thrombotic complications, including venous and arterial thrombosis, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. These complications have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the need for effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and manage thrombotic events. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of COVID-19 thrombotic complications, including the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these events and the role of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in prevention and treatment. We discuss the evidence supporting the use of anticoagulants, such as low molecular weight heparin and direct oral anticoagulants, and platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, in patients with COVID-19. Our analysis highlights the importance of personalized treatment approaches, taking into account individual patient risk factors and clinical characteristics. By examining the current evidence and therapeutic strategies, this review aims to inform clinical practice and guide the development of novel treatments for COVID-19-related thrombotic complications."}
