{"Abstract": "Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) is a clinical entity characterized by acute myocardial injury without evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Despite the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis, patients with MINOCA often present with symptoms of myocardial infarction, including chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The etiology of MINOCA remains unclear, but several mechanisms have been proposed, including coronary spasm, takotsubo syndrome, and microvascular dysfunction. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of MINOCA, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation. We also discuss the diagnostic challenges and the role of imaging modalities in identifying the underlying causes of MINOCA. Understanding the complexities of MINOCA is essential for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to identify novel therapeutic targets for this enigmatic condition."}
