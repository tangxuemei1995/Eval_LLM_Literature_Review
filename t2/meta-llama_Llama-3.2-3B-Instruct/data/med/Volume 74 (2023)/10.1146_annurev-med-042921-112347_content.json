{"Abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a condition characterized by the expansion of a small subset of hematopoietic stem cells, which can lead to various health consequences. Recent studies have highlighted the association between CHIP and an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as the potential for CHIP to contribute to the development of malignancy. The underlying mechanisms of CHIP involve epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, which can influence the clonal trajectories of hematopoietic stem cells. As individuals age, the frequency and impact of CHIP are expected to increase, further exacerbating the risk of age-related diseases. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of CHIP, its relationship with CAD and malignancy, and the role of DNA methylation in shaping clonal hematopoiesis. By elucidating the complex interactions between CHIP, epigenetics, and disease, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for future research into the impact of CHIP on human health."}
