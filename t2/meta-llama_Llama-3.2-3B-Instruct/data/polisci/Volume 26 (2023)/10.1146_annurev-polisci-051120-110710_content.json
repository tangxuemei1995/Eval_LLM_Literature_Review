{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex and multifaceted role of the South in shaping American political development, particularly in the context of the 20th century. Through a critical analysis of historical and contemporary data, this research explores the enduring legacy of Jim Crow laws and the perpetuation of white supremacy in southern politics. The author argues that the South's unique cultural and institutional dynamics have contributed to the rise of authoritarianism and the erosion of democratic norms. Conversely, the New Deal policies of the 1930s represent a pivotal moment in southern politics, as they marked a significant shift towards greater federal intervention and social welfare programs. This research demonstrates how the South's influence on national politics has been shaped by a complex interplay of historical, cultural, and economic factors, with profound implications for American democracy and governance."}
