{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between trust and state capacity, with a particular focus on the impact of corruption and sanctions on trust in institutions. A mixed-methods approach is employed, combining quantitative and qualitative data from 20 countries to investigate the effects of corruption and sanctions on trust in government, economy, and civil society. The results indicate that corruption and sanctions can erode trust in institutions, leading to decreased state capacity and social cohesion. Conversely, effective governance and anti-corruption measures can enhance trust and promote state capacity. The study highlights the need for policymakers to address corruption and sanctions as key factors in building trust in institutions and promoting sustainable development. The findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners seeking to promote trust and state capacity in post-conflict and fragile states."}
