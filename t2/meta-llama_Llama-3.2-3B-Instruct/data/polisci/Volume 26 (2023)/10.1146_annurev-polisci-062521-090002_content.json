{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex politics of reparations for Black Americans, tracing the historical roots of the movement from the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow laws to contemporary social movements. Through a critical analysis of key texts and speeches, this research reveals the evolution of reparations as a concept, from the initial calls for compensation in the late 19th century to the present-day debates over policy and implementation. The study also explores the intersections of reparations with other social justice movements, including the Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter. By examining the intersections of historical trauma, social justice, and political thought, this research sheds new light on the ongoing struggle for reparations and its significance for American society."}
