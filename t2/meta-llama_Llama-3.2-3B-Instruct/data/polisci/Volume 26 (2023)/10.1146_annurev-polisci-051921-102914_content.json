{"Abstract": "This study examines the concept of bureaucratic autonomy, a crucial aspect of comparative administrative law, and its relationship with political control. By analyzing the delegation of authority and the exercise of discretion within bureaucratic organizations, this research aims to clarify the boundaries of bureaucratic autonomy and its implications for the distribution of power between governments and administrative agencies. Through a comparative analysis of institutional frameworks and case studies from various countries, this study reveals that bureaucratic autonomy is shaped by the degree of delegation, the nature of discretion, and the level of political control exerted by governments. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between bureaucratic autonomy and political control in shaping the effectiveness and accountability of administrative agencies, with significant implications for comparative politics and public administration."}
