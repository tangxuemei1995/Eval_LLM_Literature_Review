{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolution of global health governance from the era of imperialism to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the complex interplay between politics, power dynamics, and health outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) emerged as a key international health organization, initially shaped by colonial interests and later influenced by the Cold War. The post-Cold War period saw a shift towards a more multilateral approach, with the WHO playing a central role in responding to global health crises. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the limitations and vulnerabilities of global health governance, revealing deep-seated power imbalances and inequities in health systems. This research analyzes the historical context of global health governance, tracing the trajectory from the 'Golden Age' of international cooperation to the Great Lockdown, and exploring the implications for future health security. By examining the politics of global health, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between health, power, and politics, and to inform strategies for strengthening global health governance in the face of emerging health threats."}
