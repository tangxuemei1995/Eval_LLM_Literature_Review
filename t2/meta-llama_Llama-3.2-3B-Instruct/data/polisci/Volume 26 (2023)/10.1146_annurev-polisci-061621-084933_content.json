{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex dynamics of bureaucratic politics, highlighting blind spots and opportunities for improvement in the field of political science. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we identify key areas of influence, including personnel appointments, performance evaluations, and oversight mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that bureaucratic politics is often characterized by a lack of transparency and accountability, allowing for undue influence from special interest groups and lobby firms. Furthermore, procurement processes are frequently opaque, creating opportunities for corruption and favoritism. By shedding light on these blind spots, this research provides a nuanced understanding of the intricate relationships between bureaucracy, politics, and power. The findings have significant implications for policymakers seeking to promote more effective and accountable governance."}
