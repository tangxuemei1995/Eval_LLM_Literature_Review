{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationships between policy causes and consequences of citizenship in Western Europe, with a focus on naturalization and immigration. Analyzing existing literature and empirical data, the research reveals how policy changes in citizenship regimes have influenced integration outcomes and shaped the experiences of immigrant populations. The findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between policy and social outcomes, and underscore the importance of considering the long-term consequences of citizenship policy decisions in Western Europe."}
