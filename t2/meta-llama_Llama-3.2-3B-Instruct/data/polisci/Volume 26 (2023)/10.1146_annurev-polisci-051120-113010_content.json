{"Abstract": "This study undertakes a historical and conceptual examination of the complex relationship between democracy and the corporation, tracing its evolution from the early modern period to the present day. Drawing on the traditions of republican thought and constitutionalism, the research explores how the rise of the corporation has shaped and been shaped by democratic ideals. Through a critical analysis of key texts, case studies, and empirical evidence, the study reveals how the increasing concentration of corporate power has contributed to growing inequality and the erosion of democratic institutions. Conversely, it also highlights instances where corporate enterprise has been harnessed to promote democratic values and social justice. By examining the long view of this relationship, the research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the tensions between economic and democratic goals in modern societies."}
