{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationships between women's participation in politics and state formation in the developing world. Through a comparative analysis of countries with varying levels of gender equality, we investigate the impact of women's representation in politics on state institutions and policies. Our research highlights the significance of electoral quotas as a key mechanism for increasing women's representation in politics. We also explore the role of intrafamily bargaining in shaping women's political engagement and empowerment. By analyzing case studies from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, we demonstrate that women's participation in politics is closely tied to the development of gender-sensitive state institutions and policies. Our findings suggest that promoting women's representation in politics is crucial for achieving gender equality and sustainable development in the developing world. The study contributes to the existing literature on comparative political development and state formation, highlighting the importance of gender perspectives in understanding the complex dynamics of state-building in the developing world."}
