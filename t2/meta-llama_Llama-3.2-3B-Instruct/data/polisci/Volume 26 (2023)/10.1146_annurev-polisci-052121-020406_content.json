{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex dynamics of authoritarian power sharing, a phenomenon prevalent in civil wars and post-conflict societies. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key concepts, mechanisms, and strategies employed by authoritarian regimes to maintain power and stability. Our analysis reveals that commitment problems, institutional weaknesses, and the presence of external actors can significantly impact the effectiveness of power-sharing agreements. We discuss the role of coups, patronage networks, and clientelism in undermining power-sharing institutions and highlight the importance of building trust and credibility among key stakeholders. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with authoritarian power sharing, offering insights for policymakers and scholars seeking to promote more stable and sustainable peace in conflict-affected regions."}
