{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of gender and international relations, exploring the ways in which gendered power dynamics shape foreign policy and global governance. Drawing on feminist theories of political economy, the research analyzes the impact of patriarchal norms on international relations, including the representation of women in global institutions and the perpetuation of gender-based violence in conflict zones. The study also investigates the role of sexuality in international relations, including the ways in which heteronormativity and homophobia influence foreign policy decisions. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between gender, sexuality, and international relations, and to inform more inclusive and equitable approaches to global governance. The findings have implications for policymakers and scholars seeking to promote gender equality and human rights in international relations."}
