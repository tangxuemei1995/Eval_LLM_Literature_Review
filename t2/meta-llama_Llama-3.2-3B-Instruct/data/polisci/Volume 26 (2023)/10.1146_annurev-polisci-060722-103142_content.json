{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between democracy and policing in the United States, highlighting the tensions between multiracial democratic ideals and the reality of racial authoritarianism in law enforcement. Through a critical discourse analysis of policy documents, academic literature, and media reports, this research reveals how policing practices perpetuate racial disparities and undermine democratic values. The findings suggest that the criminal justice system in the US is characterized by a 'democratic deficit,' where marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by police violence and mass incarceration. The study argues that a multiracial democracy requires a critical examination of the intersections between identity, power, and policing. By exploring the ways in which policing shapes and is shaped by democratic ideals, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the challenges facing democratic governance in the US and offers insights into potential strategies for promoting more equitable and just policing practices. Ultimately, the study seeks to spark a national conversation about the need for democratic reform and the importance of addressing racial authoritarianism in policing."}
