{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic backgrounds of politicians, exploring the relationship between their socio-economic status and representation. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that politicians from affluent backgrounds often hold positions of power, influencing policy decisions that favor their own interests. The findings suggest that education and wealth are significant determinants of political representation, with those from lower socio-economic backgrounds facing barriers to entry and limited opportunities for advancement. The study also highlights the importance of class in shaping political ideologies and policy agendas. By understanding the economic backgrounds of politicians, policymakers can work to increase representation and promote more equitable decision-making. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of the intersection of economics and politics, with implications for democratic governance and social justice."}
