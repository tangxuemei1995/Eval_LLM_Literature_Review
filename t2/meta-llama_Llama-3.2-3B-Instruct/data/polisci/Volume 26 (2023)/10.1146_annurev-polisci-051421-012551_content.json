{"Abstract": "This study seeks to unify the disparate fields of environmental effects on politics by integrating context and contact theory. By examining the interplay between the built environment and neighborhood effects, we shed light on how physical settings influence political behavior, particularly in the realm of ethnic politics. Drawing on insights from contact theory, we investigate how the spatial proximity of diverse groups affects their interactions and, in turn, shapes their political attitudes and behaviors. Our analysis reveals that the built environment plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of context on political outcomes, with findings suggesting that neighborhoods with more mixed populations exhibit greater levels of civic engagement and reduced ethnic polarization. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between environmental factors, social interactions, and political behavior."}
