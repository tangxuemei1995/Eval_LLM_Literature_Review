{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationship between violence and nonviolent resistance, exploring the phenomenon of unarmed collective violence as a strategic component of nonviolent movements. Through a critical discourse analysis of historical and contemporary case studies, including the Indian independence movement, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and the Arab Spring protests, this research reveals how violent flanks can both empower and undermine nonviolent resistance. The findings suggest that the presence of unarmed collective violence can create a sense of urgency and momentum, while also increasing the risk of state repression and violence. The study argues that a nuanced understanding of the interplay between violence and nonviolence is essential for developing effective strategies of nonviolent resistance in the face of authoritarian regimes and oppressive power structures."}
