{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex and multifaceted relationship between Asian Americans and the politics of the twenty-first century. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and empirical data, this research explores the ways in which Asian American civic engagement and political participation are shaped by intersecting factors such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The findings highlight the need for more inclusive and representative policies that address the unique needs and concerns of Asian American communities. By examining the historical and contemporary contexts of Asian American politics, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the ongoing struggles and triumphs of this marginalized group in the pursuit of equal civic rights and opportunities."}
