{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between political inequality and democratic representation in rich democracies. Analyzing data from 25 countries, our research reveals a significant correlation between income inequality and the degree of representation in government. We find that countries with higher levels of income inequality exhibit lower levels of congruence between the interests of the wealthy and the poor, and lower responsiveness of policymakers to the needs of marginalized groups. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that trade unions play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of income inequality on democratic representation. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the relationship between economic inequality and democratic accountability, and highlight the need for policies that address the root causes of income inequality to promote more inclusive and responsive democratic systems."}
