{"Abstract": "This study integrates political science perspectives into the field of public health, examining the complex relationships between health systems, social determinants, and population health outcomes. By applying economic theories and methods, we analyze the political economy of health, highlighting the disproportionate impact of social determinants on health equity. Our research reveals that health systems are shaped by political decisions, influencing access to healthcare, resource allocation, and policy interventions. We demonstrate how addressing social determinants, such as poverty, education, and environmental factors, can improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities. Our findings have implications for policymakers and healthcare professionals seeking to create more equitable and effective health systems."}
