{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolution of growth and welfare regimes across time and space, exploring how similar trends in economic development have led to divergent paths in institutional arrangements. Through a comparative analysis of the transition from Fordist to knowledge-based economies, we investigate how financialization and the rise of the service sector have reshaped the welfare state. Our research reveals that countries with similar economic profiles have adopted distinct institutional frameworks, reflecting divergent priorities and values. We argue that the growth and welfare regimes of today are characterized by a complex interplay between institutional, social, and economic factors, and that understanding these dynamics is crucial for policymakers seeking to promote sustainable and equitable development. By shedding light on the nuances of growth and welfare regimes, this study contributes to the ongoing debate in comparative political economy and highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between economic development, institutional change, and social welfare."}
