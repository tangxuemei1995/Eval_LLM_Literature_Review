{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex and multifaceted phenomenon of racist dehumanization in the United States, with a particular focus on its impact on Black and Indigenous populations. Through a critical discourse analysis of media representations and public discourse, this research reveals how racist dehumanization is perpetuated and normalized, contributing to the perpetuation of systemic racism and prejudice. The findings suggest that dehumanization is not only a tool of oppression but also a means of maintaining racial hierarchies and justifying discriminatory policies. The study also highlights the ways in which white racial attitudes and privilege are embedded in the very fabric of American society, perpetuating a culture of dehumanization and exclusion. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of the politics of racist dehumanization and its far-reaching consequences for marginalized communities."}
