{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of agendas in shaping democratic decision-making processes, with a focus on the intersection of social movements and advocacy. Agenda setting theory posits that the framing and prioritization of issues by dominant groups can influence the policy agendas of governments. In the context of democracy, this can have significant implications for marginalized groups and social movements. Through a critical discourse analysis of petitions, social media campaigns, and policy documents, this research reveals how agendas can be both constructed and contested by social movements and advocacy groups. The findings suggest that the ability of social movements to influence agenda setting can be a key factor in achieving policy change and promoting democratic accountability. The study contributes to our understanding of the complex dynamics between social movements, advocacy, and democratic decision-making, highlighting the importance of agenda democracy in promoting inclusive and responsive governance."}
