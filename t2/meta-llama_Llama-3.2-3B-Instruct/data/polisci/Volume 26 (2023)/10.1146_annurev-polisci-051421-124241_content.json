{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex dynamics of international energy politics in the context of climate change, with a focus on the transition to clean energy. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this research reveals the intricate relationships between energy politics, distributive power, and climate governance. The findings highlight the tensions between state interests, market forces, and environmental concerns in shaping the global energy landscape. The study also explores the role of oil in international energy politics, particularly in the context of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. The research demonstrates that a clean energy transition requires a fundamental shift in the distributive politics of energy, with a greater emphasis on equity, justice, and environmental sustainability. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with significant consequences for global energy security, climate change mitigation, and sustainable development."}
