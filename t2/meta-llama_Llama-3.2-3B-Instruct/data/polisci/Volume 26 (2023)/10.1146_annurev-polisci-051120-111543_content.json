{"Abstract": "This study adopts a multi-level approach to investigate the structure and context of supply chain governance, focusing on the interplay between network dynamics, environmental factors, labor standards, and polycentric governance. By analyzing case studies from diverse industries, we demonstrate how supply chains are shaped by complex interactions among multiple stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, and buyers. Our research reveals that supply chain governance is influenced by environmental context, labor standards, and network structure, leading to varying degrees of polycentricity. We argue that a multi-level approach is essential to understand the nuances of supply chain governance, as it acknowledges the existence of multiple governance regimes and the need for context-specific solutions. The findings of this study contribute to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of supply chain governance, highlighting the importance of considering the complex interplay between structure and context in achieving sustainable and responsible supply chain management."}
