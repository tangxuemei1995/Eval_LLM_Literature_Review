{"Abstract": "This study examines the persistence of historical legacies in the realm of political economy, exploring their causal influence on contemporary economic outcomes. Drawing on formal theory and causal inference methods, we analyze the enduring impact of past economic policies, institutions, and social structures on present-day economic conditions. By tracing the evolution of historical political economy, we identify key factors that have contributed to the persistence of these legacies, including the role of power dynamics, social norms, and institutional inertia. Our findings suggest that historical legacies continue to shape economic outcomes, often in subtle yet profound ways, and that formal theory can provide valuable insights into the causal mechanisms underlying these relationships. The study's results have implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between history, politics, and economics, and highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to economic analysis that takes into account the enduring legacies of the past."}
