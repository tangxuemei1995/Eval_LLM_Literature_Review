{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in genetic engineering and bionic technologies have revolutionized our understanding of proprioception, the complex sensory system governing movement and posture. By modulating the expression of proprioceptive sensory neurons, researchers have successfully enhanced the accuracy of muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ signals, thereby improving kinesthetic perception. Neural machine interfaces have also been integrated with prosthetic limbs, allowing for more precise control and reducing kinesthetic illusions. Furthermore, studies on the dorsal column nuclei and somatosensory cortex have shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying proprioceptive processing, paving the way for innovative treatments of proprioceptive disorders and the development of advanced prosthetic systems."}
