{"Abstract": "Iron plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of diabetes, with its dysregulation contributing to the development and progression of the disease. Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, has been implicated in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Research has shown that hepcidin deficiency can lead to increased iron absorption and storage, resulting in iron overload and oxidative stress, which in turn can impair insulin signaling and glucose uptake in adipocytes. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that iron overload can exacerbate insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction, leading to hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, iron deficiency has been linked to impaired insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Understanding the complex interplay between iron, hepcidin, and insulin in the context of diabetes is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at improving glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients."}
