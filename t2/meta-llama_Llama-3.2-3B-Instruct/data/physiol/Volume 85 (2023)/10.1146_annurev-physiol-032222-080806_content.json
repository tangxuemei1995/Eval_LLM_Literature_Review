{"Abstract": "Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) is a process by which endothelial cells undergo a phenotypic transformation into mesenchymal cells, playing a critical role in both physiological and pathological conditions. In the context of cardiovascular health, EndMT has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, where it contributes to the formation of fibrous plaques and vascular remodeling. Conversely, in disease states such as heart failure and hypertension, EndMT has been linked to increased vascular stiffness and reduced vascular function. Recent studies have also highlighted the potential of EndMT as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of EndMT in health and disease, with a focus on its role in cardiovascular biology and the potential for therapeutic intervention. The implications of EndMT for cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment are discussed in detail."}
