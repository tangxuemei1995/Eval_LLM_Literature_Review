{"Abstract": "Myostatin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, functions as a skeletal muscle chalone, regulating muscle growth and size. The latency-associated peptide (LAP) of myostatin, covalently linked to the mature protein, prevents its activation and inhibits muscle hypertrophy. Conversely, the removal of LAP or its inhibition leads to the activation of myostatin, resulting in decreased muscle mass and size. Recent studies have implicated GDF-8 and activin in modulating myostatin activity, suggesting a complex interplay between these growth factors in regulating tissue size. Understanding the mechanisms underlying myostatin's role in muscle growth and size control is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies to treat muscle-wasting diseases and disorders."}
