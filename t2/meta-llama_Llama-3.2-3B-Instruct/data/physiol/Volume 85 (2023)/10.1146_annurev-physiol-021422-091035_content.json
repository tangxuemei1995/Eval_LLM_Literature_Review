{"Abstract": "Metabolic recruitment in brain tissue refers to the dynamic interplay between neurons and astrocytes in regulating energy metabolism. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the brain, play a crucial role in maintaining the metabolic homeostasis of neurons through the exchange of glucose, lactate, and oxygen. Glycolysis, the primary energy-producing pathway in neurons, is supported by the presence of mitochondria, which are also essential for the removal of lactate produced by neurons. Recent studies have shown that astrocytes can regulate the activity of neurons by modulating the availability of glucose and oxygen, thereby influencing neuronal activity and function. This metabolic recruitment mechanism is critical for maintaining proper brain function, particularly under conditions of stress or injury. Understanding the complex interactions between neurons and astrocytes in metabolic recruitment is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders."}
