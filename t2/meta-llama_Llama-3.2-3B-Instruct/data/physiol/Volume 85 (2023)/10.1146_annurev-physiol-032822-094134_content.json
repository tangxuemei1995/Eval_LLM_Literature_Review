{"Abstract": "The mammalian liver is a complex organ characterized by its unique zonation and heterogeneity, which enable it to maintain homeostasis and regenerate in response to acute and chronic injury. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cellular plasticity in liver regeneration, where hepatocytes and other liver cells undergo significant changes in gene expression and function to restore liver function. This process is mediated by a network of signaling pathways that coordinate the activation of stem cells, the proliferation of hepatocytes, and the reorganization of liver tissue. Understanding the multiple facets of cellular homeostasis and regeneration in the liver is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for liver injury and disease, including liver transplantation and regenerative medicine. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying liver regeneration has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of liver-related disorders and improve patient outcomes."}
