{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between diet and human health is increasingly recognized to be influenced by the gut microbiota, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of the gut microbiota in modulating metabolic processes, influencing nutrient absorption, and regulating the production of metabolites that impact human health. A diverse gut microbiota, shaped by dietary patterns, has been linked to various health outcomes, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the gut microbiota's impact on the diet-human health axis, highlighting the key mechanisms by which dietary components influence microbiota composition and function. The findings of this review have significant implications for the development of personalized nutrition strategies and the design of novel therapeutic interventions targeting the gut microbiota."}
