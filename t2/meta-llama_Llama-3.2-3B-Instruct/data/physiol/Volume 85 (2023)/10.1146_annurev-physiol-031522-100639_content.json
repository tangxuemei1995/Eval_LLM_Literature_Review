{"Abstract": "Protein trafficking and quality control are crucial processes in maintaining renal function and overall health. The kidney's secretory pathway, involving the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes, is responsible for the proper maturation and secretion of proteins. However, dysregulation of these processes can lead to kidney disease. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of transporters, such as the transmembrane protein family (TMED), in regulating cargo transport between compartments. The vesicular system, including endosomes and lysosomes, also plays a vital role in protein quality control and degradation. Aberrant trafficking and quality control mechanisms have been implicated in various kidney diseases, including nephrotic syndrome and chronic kidney disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying protein trafficking and quality control in the kidney and beyond is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat kidney disease. Elucidating the complex interactions between the secretory pathway, vesicles, and lysosomes will provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of kidney disease and potential therapeutic targets."}
