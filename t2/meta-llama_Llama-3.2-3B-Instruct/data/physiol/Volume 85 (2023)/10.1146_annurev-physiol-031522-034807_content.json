{"Abstract": "Pericytes, a subtype of mural cells surrounding blood vessels, play a crucial role in regulating blood flow and metabolism in both the brain and heart. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in modulating neurovascular coupling, a process by which changes in neural activity influence blood flow and metabolic demand. In the brain, pericytes interact with astrocytes and endothelial cells to regulate the release of neurotransmitters and ions, including calcium and potassium, which are essential for neuronal function. In the heart, pericytes have been shown to influence cardiac function by modulating the activity of ion channels and affecting calcium handling. Electro-metabolic signaling pathways, involving the exchange of ions and metabolites between neurons and blood vessels, are also critical for pericyte function. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of pericyte-mediated control of blood flow and metabolism in the brain and heart, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes."}
