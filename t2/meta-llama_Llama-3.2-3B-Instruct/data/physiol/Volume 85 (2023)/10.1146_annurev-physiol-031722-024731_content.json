{"Abstract": "Flexible perceptual decision making is a complex cognitive process that enables individuals to adapt to changing environments and tasks. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of sensory-guided behavior and stimulus-action mapping in shaping decision policies. This review aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision making, with a focus on the role of distributed neural networks. We discuss the key findings from neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies on task switch performance, stimulus-action mapping, and decision policy adaptation. Our analysis reveals that flexible decision making involves the coordinated activity of multiple brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and sensory cortices. We also examine the neural mechanisms underlying stimulus-action mapping and decision policy adaptation, highlighting the importance of sensory-guided behavior in shaping flexible decision making. The findings of this review have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of flexible decision making and its role in real-world decision making scenarios."}
