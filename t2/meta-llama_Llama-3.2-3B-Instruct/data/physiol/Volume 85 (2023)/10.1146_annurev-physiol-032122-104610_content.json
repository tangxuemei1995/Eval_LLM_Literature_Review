{"Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulumâ€“plasma membrane junctions (ERPMJs) play a crucial role in regulating Ca2+ signaling in excitable cells. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ERPMJs as sites of depolarization-induced Ca2+ release, which can modulate various cellular processes. In skeletal muscle, ERPMJs facilitate the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, regulating muscle contraction. In cardiac muscle, ERPMJs contribute to the regulation of Ca2+ handling and contractility. Smooth muscle ERPMJs modulate Ca2+ entry and contraction, while in neurons, ERPMJs regulate neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. The ERPMJ-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway involves the activation of ion channels and the release of second messengers, such as inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and calcium-dependent protein kinase (CaMK). Understanding the mechanisms underlying ERPMJ-mediated Ca2+ signaling is essential for elucidating the molecular basis of excitable cell function and dysfunction, with implications for the treatment of various cardiovascular and muscular disorders."}
