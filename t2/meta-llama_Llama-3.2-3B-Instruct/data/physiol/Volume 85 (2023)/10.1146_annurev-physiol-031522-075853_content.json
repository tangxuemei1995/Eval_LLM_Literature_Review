{"Abstract": "The perception of salt taste is a complex process involving molecular and cellular mechanisms. Salt taste is mediated by the activation of taste receptors on the tongue, specifically the ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) and T1R1/T1R3 (taste receptor 1/3) heterodimers. The binding of sodium ions to ENaC triggers a conformational change, allowing the channel to open and allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell. This influx of positively charged ions triggers a signaling cascade that ultimately activates the T1R1/T1R3 receptor, leading to the perception of salty taste. The valence of sodium ions, or their positive charge, plays a crucial role in modulating the intensity of salt taste. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying salt taste, highlighting the key players and signaling pathways involved in this complex process."}
