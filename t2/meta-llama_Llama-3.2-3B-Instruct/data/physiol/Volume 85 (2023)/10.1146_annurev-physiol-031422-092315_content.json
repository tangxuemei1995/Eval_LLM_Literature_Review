{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex infectious and inflammatory pathways underlying cough, a ubiquitous symptom of respiratory tract infections. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the role of sensory neurons in disease transmission, highlighting the intricate mechanisms by which viral and bacterial pathogens trigger cough responses. Our analysis reveals the interplay between inflammatory mediators, neural signaling, and airway hyperresponsiveness, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms driving cough. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting cough pathways."}
