{"Abstract": "WNK signaling plays a crucial role in regulating ion balance and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of intracellular ion control in modulating WNK activity, particularly through the coordinated action of potassium channels (NKCC and KCC) and the SPAK kinase. In the Malpighian tubule, a key ion transport organ in insects, ion fluxes are tightly regulated by WNK signaling, influencing both fluid and electrolyte balance. Disruption of this delicate balance can lead to inflammatory responses, mediated by the activation of the inflammasome. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the intricate relationships between ion transport, WNK signaling, and the Malpighian tubule, highlighting the potential implications for understanding ion homeostasis and inflammatory responses in various organisms."}
