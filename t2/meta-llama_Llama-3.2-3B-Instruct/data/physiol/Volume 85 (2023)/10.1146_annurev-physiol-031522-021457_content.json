{"Abstract": "The microcirculation plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, and the redox switch is a key regulator of this process. In the microcirculatory bed, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells interact to control blood flow, while red blood cells navigate through the narrow vessels. The redox switch, mediated by the balance between oxidants and antioxidants, modulates the activity of key proteins involved in microcirculatory function. This balance is maintained by the calcium-handling machinery, which regulates the release of vasoactive substances. Disruption of the redox switch has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and anemia. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the redox switch in the microcirculation is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to restore microcirculatory function and improve tissue perfusion. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the redox switch in the microcirculation and its implications for human health and disease."}
