{"Abstract": "Polycystin channel complexes, comprising polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, are crucial components of primary cilia and play a pivotal role in maintaining ciliary function and overall kidney health. Mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, encoding polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively, lead to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common inherited disorder characterized by the development of cysts in the kidneys. Recent studies have elucidated the gating mechanism of polycystin channel complexes, revealing a complex interplay between the channel's pore-forming properties and its role in mechanosensation. The primary cilium, a microtubule-based structure protruding from the cell surface, is a key site of polycystin channel complex assembly and function. Disruption of polycystin channel complexes has been implicated in various ciliopathies, highlighting the importance of these complexes in maintaining cellular homeostasis and overall health. Understanding the gating mechanism and function of polycystin channel complexes is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ADPKD and other ciliopathies."}
