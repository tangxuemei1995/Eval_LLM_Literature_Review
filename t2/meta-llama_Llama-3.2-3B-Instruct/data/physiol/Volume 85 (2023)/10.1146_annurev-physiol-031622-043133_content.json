{"Abstract": "Insulin clearance, a critical determinant of glucose homeostasis, is influenced by various factors including age, ethnicity, and underlying health conditions. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, leads to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, exacerbating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This review synthesizes the current literature on insulin clearance in health and disease, highlighting the complex interplay between insulin action, insulin resistance, and NAFLD. We examine the impact of age and ethnicity on insulin clearance, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and NAFLD. Understanding the determinants of insulin clearance is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and manage insulin-related disorders, ultimately mitigating the risk of NAFLD and related metabolic complications."}
