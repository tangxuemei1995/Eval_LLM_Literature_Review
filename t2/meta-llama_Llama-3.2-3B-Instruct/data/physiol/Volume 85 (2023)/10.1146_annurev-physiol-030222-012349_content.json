{"Abstract": "TRPV channels, a family of transient receptor potential channels, play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including pain perception and ion homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the complexities of TRPV channel structure and function, revealing a nuanced interplay between ion channel properties and downstream signaling pathways. Despite significant progress, controversies surrounding the molecular physiology of TRPV channels persist, including the mechanisms underlying their activation and desensitization. Future research directions will focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying TRPV channel function, with implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for pain management and other TRPV-related disorders. Elucidating the intricate relationships between TRPV channel structure, function, and physiology will be essential for advancing our understanding of these channels and their role in human health and disease."}
