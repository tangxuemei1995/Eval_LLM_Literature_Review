{"Abstract": "Fatty acid transport and signaling play crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating physiological processes. The process of fatty acid uptake and transport is mediated by various membrane proteins, including CD36, fatty acid-binding proteins, and caveolin. The G protein-coupled receptors FFAR1 and FFAR4, also known as GPR40 and GPR120, respectively, are key players in fatty acid signaling, modulating metabolic pathways and influencing cellular responses to fatty acids. The activation of these receptors triggers a cascade of downstream signaling events, including the regulation of Î²-oxidation, lipid metabolism, and tissue repair. Dysregulation of fatty acid transport and signaling has been implicated in various diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of fatty acid transport and signaling is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways."}
