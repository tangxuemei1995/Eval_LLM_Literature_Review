{"Abstract": "Lung cell atlases have revolutionized our understanding of pulmonary diseases by providing a comprehensive snapshot of the lung's cellular composition. Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the identification of distinct cell types and their differential expression in various lung conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. By comparing cell type abundance and gene expression profiles across these diseases, researchers have gained insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This knowledge has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including targeted cell-based therapies and precision medicine approaches. Further studies are needed to translate these findings into clinical applications and improve patient outcomes."}
