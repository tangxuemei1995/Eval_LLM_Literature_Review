{"Abstract": "This study examines the nexus linkages between zero-carbon urban transitions, health, climate resilience, and equity co-benefits. By analyzing the intersections of urban metabolism, sustainable development goals, and the health-climate-resilience nexus, this research assesses the potential for decarbonization to enhance urban well-being while promoting equity and resilience. A mixed-methods approach combining literature reviews, stakeholder interviews, and case studies is employed to investigate the relationships between urban planning, energy systems, transportation, and waste management. The findings highlight the importance of integrating health, climate, and equity considerations into urban planning strategies to achieve sustainable development goals. The study demonstrates that zero-carbon urban transitions can co-benefit health, climate resilience, and equity, and provides recommendations for policymakers and urban practitioners to design more resilient, equitable, and sustainable cities. The research contributes to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the nexus linkages between urban transitions, health, climate resilience, and equity co-benefits."}
