{"Abstract": "This study contributes to the expanding knowledge of fungal biodiversity by investigating the global diversity, distribution, and conservation of fungi across the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Utilizing metabarcoding techniques, we analyzed fungal communities from diverse ecosystems, revealing a vast array of endemic species and highlighting the underrepresentation of early diverging fungi. Our findings indicate a significant disparity in the fungus:plant ratio, with implications for ecosystem functioning and plant-fungal interactions. The results also underscore the need for conservation efforts, as many fungal species are threatened or endangered, necessitating the implementation of in situ and ex situ conservation strategies. In line with the IUCN Red List, our study emphasizes the importance of protecting fungal diversity, which is intricately linked to the health of ecosystems and the planet as a whole. By advancing our understanding of fungal biodiversity, this research provides a foundation for evidence-based conservation initiatives and underscores the urgent need for fungal conservation."}
