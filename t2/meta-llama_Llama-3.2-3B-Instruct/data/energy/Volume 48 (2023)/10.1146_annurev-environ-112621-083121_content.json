{"Abstract": "Soils play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, serving as both carbon stores and sinks. This review synthesizes existing knowledge on the expectations, patterns, processes, and prospects of transitions in soil carbon dynamics, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation. We examine the implications of decomposition, litter, and root turnover on soil carbon sequestration, highlighting the importance of soil health and mapping in informing climate policy. The Century and Millennial models are discussed in relation to their limitations and potential applications in predicting soil carbon changes. Our analysis reveals that effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies require a comprehensive understanding of soil carbon dynamics, including the role of decomposition, litter, and root turnover. By integrating soil mapping and monitoring, we can better anticipate and respond to transitions in soil carbon stores and sinks, ultimately supporting more effective climate policy and sustainable land management practices."}
