{"Abstract": "This literature review examines the evolution of climate mitigation policy over the past three decades, with a focus on its effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A comprehensive analysis of existing research reveals that climate policy has made significant progress in promoting abatement measures, but its overall impact on mitigation remains limited. The review highlights the development and implementation of various policy instruments, including cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes, and subsidies for renewable energy. While these instruments have contributed to a decline in emissions intensity, their effectiveness in reducing absolute emissions has been inconsistent. The literature also underscores the importance of policy coherence, stakeholder engagement, and international cooperation in achieving effective climate mitigation. A critical assessment of existing policy frameworks and their outcomes reveals both successes and failures, including the challenges posed by market failures, behavioral barriers, and the need for more ambitious targets. The review concludes that climate mitigation policy has delivered some notable achievements, but its long-term effectiveness remains uncertain. To improve policy outcomes, the review recommends a more nuanced understanding of the policy instruments and their interactions, as well as a greater emphasis on evidence-based decision-making and stakeholder engagement. Ultimately, this literature review contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities of climate mitigation policy and highlights the need for sustained efforts to address the climate crisis."}
