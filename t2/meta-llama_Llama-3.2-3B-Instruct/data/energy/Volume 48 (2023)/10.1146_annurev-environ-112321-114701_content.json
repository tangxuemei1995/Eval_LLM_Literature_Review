{"Abstract": "Groundwater is a vital source of drinking water for millions of people worldwide, yet its quality is increasingly threatened by geogenic contaminants and emerging pollutants. This study examines the impact of geogenic contaminants and key substances on groundwater quality and human health. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that geogenic contaminants, such as heavy metals and radionuclides, can have severe health consequences, including cancer and neurological damage. Emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, are also being detected in groundwater, posing significant risks to human health. Sustainable groundwater management practices, including monitoring, remediation, and protection, are essential to mitigate these risks. This study highlights the need for integrated approaches to manage groundwater quality, incorporating both technical and non-technical strategies to ensure safe and sustainable water supplies. By understanding the complex relationships between groundwater quality, geogenic contaminants, and human health, policymakers and practitioners can develop effective strategies to protect this vital resource."}
