{"Abstract": "The built environment is a significant contributor to global energy demand, with residential and commercial buildings accounting for approximately 40% of total energy consumption. As climate change mitigation efforts intensify, there is a pressing need to model low energy demand futures for buildings to inform policy and investment decisions. This review synthesizes current state-of-the-art approaches to modeling building energy demand, with a focus on scenarios development and energy demand transformation. We identify key megatrends, including electrification of transportation, smart grids, and building information modeling, that are driving the transformation of the built environment. Our analysis highlights the importance of integrating climate change mitigation goals with building energy demand modeling to achieve decent living standards while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Future research directions are outlined, including the development of more sophisticated scenarios development methodologies and the integration of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to enhance the accuracy and applicability of building energy demand models."}
