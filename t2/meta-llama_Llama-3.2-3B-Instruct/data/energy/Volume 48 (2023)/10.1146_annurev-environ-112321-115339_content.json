{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of opinion polarization on environmental decision-making in the context of climate change. A survey of 1,000 participants revealed significant correlations between perceived polarization and reduced willingness to engage in environmental discussions and cooperation. Furthermore, polarization was found to influence individuals' perceptions of environmental issues, with polarized individuals exhibiting a more negative view of climate change and its consequences. The results suggest that intergroup relations play a crucial role in shaping environmental decision-making, as polarized individuals are less likely to consider alternative perspectives and compromise. The findings have implications for environmental policy and education, highlighting the need for strategies that address and mitigate the effects of opinion polarization on collective action and cooperation. Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of fostering inclusive and respectful intergroup dialogue in promoting effective environmental decision-making."}
