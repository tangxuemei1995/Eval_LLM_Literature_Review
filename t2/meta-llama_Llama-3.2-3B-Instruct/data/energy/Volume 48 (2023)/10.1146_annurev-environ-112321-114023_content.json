{"Abstract": "The 30×30 initiative, launched in 2021, aims to protect 30% of the world's land and sea by 2030 to address the pressing issue of climate change. This ambitious goal is rooted in the understanding that climate change is a pressing global threat, with far-reaching consequences for biodiversity, ecosystems, and human societies. The history of climate change is marked by decades of scientific research, policy development, and conservation efforts, which have collectively highlighted the need for integrated conservation strategies. These strategies must account for the impacts of climate change on species on the move, including migration patterns, habitat shifts, and population dynamics. The 30×30 initiative recognizes the importance of regional coordination and systematic conservation planning in addressing the complex and interconnected challenges of climate change. By protecting and restoring natural habitats, conserving biodiversity, and promoting ecosystem resilience, the 30×30 initiative seeks to build a more sustainable future for all. Climate change biology plays a critical role in informing conservation efforts, as it provides insights into the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and species. This paper provides an overview of the history and future of climate change-integrated conservation strategies, highlighting the key challenges, opportunities, and successes of the 30×30 initiative. It also explores the role of climate change biology in informing conservation efforts and the potential for regional coordination and systematic conservation planning to address the complex challenges of climate change. By examining the intersection of conservation and climate change, this paper aims to contribute to the development of effective and sustainable conservation strategies for the 30×30 goal."}
