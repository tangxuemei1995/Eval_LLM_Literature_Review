{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes recent advances in qualitative methods in environmental research, with a focus on participatory approaches and socioecological systems. Climate change has underscored the need for nuanced, context-specific research methods that capture the complexities of human-environment interactions. Participatory research methods, such as co-design and co-production, have emerged as key strategies for engaging stakeholders and fostering collaborative knowledge production. By integrating insights from environmental sociology, ecology, and anthropology, this review highlights the potential of qualitative methods to elucidate the socioecological dynamics underlying environmental issues. The findings suggest that qualitative methods can provide rich, contextualized understandings of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies, informing evidence-based policy and practice. The review also underscores the importance of considering the epistemological and methodological implications of climate change research, and the need for continued innovation and collaboration in the development of qualitative methods for environmental research."}
