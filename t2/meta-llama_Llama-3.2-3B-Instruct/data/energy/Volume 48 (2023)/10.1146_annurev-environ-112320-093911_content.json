{"Abstract": "Sustainable intensification of smallholder agricultural systems is crucial for enhancing food production and improving livelihoods in the Global South. This review synthesizes evidence on various strategies, including the adoption of improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and System of Rice Intensification (SRI), to promote sustainable intensification. Staple crops, such as maize, wheat, and rice, are often targeted for intensification. The review highlights the potential of these strategies to increase crop yields, reduce post-harvest losses, and improve water and nutrient use efficiency. Push-pull systems, which combine the use of insecticides and crop rotation, have shown promise in reducing pest pressure and improving crop productivity. SRI, which emphasizes conservation agriculture practices, has been successful in improving soil health and reducing water usage. The review also notes the importance of integrating these strategies with other approaches, such as agroforestry and climate-smart agriculture, to achieve sustainable intensification. Overall, the evidence suggests that a combination of these strategies can contribute to more sustainable and resilient smallholder agricultural systems."}
