{"Abstract": "The increasing demand for electricity worldwide has led to a growing interest in renewable energy sources as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. This study examines the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity, focusing on various technologies such as solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. A comprehensive review of existing literature and data was conducted to assess the technical potential of each technology, considering factors such as resource availability, capacity factors, and energy conversion efficiencies. The economic potential was evaluated based on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the potential for job creation and economic growth. The feasible potential was assessed considering the current policy and regulatory frameworks, as well as the availability of financing mechanisms. The results show that the technical potential of renewable electricity is substantial, with solar PV and wind energy being the most promising technologies. The economic potential is also significant, with the LCOE of solar PV and wind energy decreasing dramatically over the past decade. However, the feasible potential is limited by the current policy and regulatory frameworks, which often favor fossil fuels. The study highlights the need for policy reforms and investments in renewable energy infrastructure to unlock the full potential of renewable electricity and achieve a low-carbon energy system. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and industry stakeholders seeking to transition to a renewable energy-based economy."}
