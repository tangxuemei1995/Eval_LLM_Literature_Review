{"Abstract": "The pervasive presence of plastics in the environment has become a pressing concern, with microplastics and polymer-based pollutants contaminating ecosystems worldwide. This review synthesizes existing literature on the chemical composition and environmental impact of plastics, with a focus on microplastics and their role as a pollutant. The production and disposal of plastics have led to the release of microplastics into the environment, where they are ingested by aquatic organisms and accumulate in the food chain. The chemical properties of plastics, including their plasticizers and additives, contribute to their persistence and toxicity in the environment. The review highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the plastic-pollutant continuum, including the sources, fate, and effects of plastic pollution on ecosystems and human health. Strategies for mitigating plastic pollution, such as reducing plastic production and increasing recycling rates, are discussed, as well as the potential for biodegradable alternatives and waste management practices that can minimize plastic contamination. Ultimately, this review underscores the importance of addressing the plastic-pollutant problem through a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates scientific research, policy, and public awareness."}
