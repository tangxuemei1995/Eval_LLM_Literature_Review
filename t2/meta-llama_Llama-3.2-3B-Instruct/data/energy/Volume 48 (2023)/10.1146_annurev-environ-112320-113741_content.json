{"Abstract": "The world's arable land is facing unprecedented threats, with widespread land degradation and habitat loss compromising global food security and biodiversity. This study examines the current state of the world's arable land, focusing on the impact of land use on greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Our analysis reveals that intensive agricultural practices are leading to significant soil erosion and nutrient depletion, resulting in reduced soil carbon stocks and increased greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, sustainable land use practices, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture, can enhance soil carbon sequestration and mitigate climate change. We also explore the economic implications of land degradation on rural economies, highlighting the need for policy interventions to promote sustainable land use and support rural livelihoods. Our findings underscore the urgent need for a paradigm shift in land use practices to ensure the long-term health of the world's arable land and mitigate the impacts of climate change."}
