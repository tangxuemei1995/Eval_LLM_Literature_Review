{"Abstract": "Concurrent flood and drought risks pose significant threats to agricultural productivity, water resources, and human livelihoods. Land modifications, such as terracing, contour farming, and afforestation, have been proposed as potential strategies to mitigate these risks. This study examines the potential and perspectives of land users in adopting land modifications to address concurrent flood and drought risks. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from 300 land users in flood-prone and drought-affected areas with in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The results indicate that land users are motivated to adopt land modifications to enhance their livelihoods and reduce risks. However, the adoption of these strategies is hindered by limited awareness, lack of technical expertise, and inadequate institutional support. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to address these challenges and promote the adoption of land modifications among land users, ultimately contributing to climate change adaptation and sustainable land management."}
