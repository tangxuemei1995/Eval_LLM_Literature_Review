{"Abstract": "This study examines the feasibility of deforestation-free commodity supply chains, a concept increasingly promoted as a key strategy for achieving sustainable land use and mitigating deforestation. A comprehensive review of existing literature on forest governance, policy mix, and land use practices reveals that while some companies have made significant progress in sourcing commodities without contributing to deforestation, the reality remains complex and context-dependent. The findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between policy, market, and social factors in driving deforestation-free practices. The study's results have implications for policymakers, companies, and civil society organizations seeking to promote sustainable land use and reduce deforestation, and underscore the importance of continued research and collaboration in this critical area."}
