{"Abstract": "Great Green Walls (GGWs) are large-scale ecological restoration initiatives aimed at combating desertification and improving livelihoods in arid and semi-arid regions. Despite their widespread adoption, the scientific community has raised concerns regarding the efficacy and sustainability of GGWs. This review synthesizes existing literature on the environmental, social, and economic implications of GGWs in the Sahel region of Algeria and the Chinese drylands. Our analysis reveals that while GGWs can provide short-term benefits in terms of soil erosion control and increased vegetation cover, their long-term effectiveness is often hindered by factors such as inadequate funding, insufficient community engagement, and limited scientific understanding of the complex interactions between vegetation, soil, and climate. Furthermore, the environmental rehabilitation of degraded lands through GGWs may not necessarily address the root causes of desertification, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and integrated approach to addressing these complex environmental challenges."}
