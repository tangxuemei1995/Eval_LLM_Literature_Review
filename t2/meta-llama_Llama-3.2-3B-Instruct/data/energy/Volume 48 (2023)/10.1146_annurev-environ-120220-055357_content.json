{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationships between fire regimes, biodiversity, and climate change within the context of the Anthropocene. By analyzing the dynamics of social-ecological systems, we investigate how human activities influence wildfire patterns and their impact on ecosystem resilience. Our research reveals that the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires are linked to climate change, leading to a decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services. We propose a framework for understanding fire regimes as a critical component of the Earth System, highlighting the need for sustainable land-use practices and fire management strategies. By integrating insights from ecology, sociology, and environmental science, our study contributes to the development of effective policies and management practices for mitigating the effects of wildfires and promoting biodiversity conservation in the Anthropocene era. Ultimately, our research aims to inform a more sustainable future for human societies and the natural world."}
