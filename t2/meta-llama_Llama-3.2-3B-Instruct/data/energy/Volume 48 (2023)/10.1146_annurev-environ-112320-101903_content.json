{"Abstract": "Climate change poses significant threats to coastal critical infrastructure, compromising the resilience of essential services and facilities that underpin regional economies and communities. Rising sea levels, increased storm frequency, and more intense coastal erosion events create a complex landscape of cascading hazards that can have devastating consequences for critical infrastructure. This study examines the intersection of climate change and coastal critical infrastructure, with a focus on the risks associated with cascading hazards. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to climate-related disruptions is exacerbated by factors such as aging infrastructure, inadequate maintenance, and insufficient emergency preparedness. The findings of this research highlight the need for proactive measures to enhance the resilience of coastal critical infrastructure, including the implementation of climate-informed design and construction practices, enhanced emergency preparedness and response protocols, and the development of adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of cascading hazards. By addressing these risks, policymakers and infrastructure managers can work towards creating more resilient and sustainable coastal critical infrastructure that can withstand the challenges of a changing climate."}
