{"Abstract": "Effective governance is crucial for the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity in protected areas and indigenous and locally managed areas. This study examines the relationship between governance and conservation effectiveness in these areas. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from 20 protected areas and 15 indigenous and locally managed areas in a tropical region. The results show that strong governance structures, including clear policies, effective institutions, and community engagement, are positively correlated with conservation effectiveness. However, the study also highlights the challenges of implementing effective governance in these areas, including limited resources, corruption, and conflicting interests. The findings suggest that a more nuanced approach to governance, one that takes into account the unique cultural and social contexts of these areas, is needed to achieve sustainable conservation outcomes. The study's results have implications for conservation practitioners, policymakers, and researchers seeking to improve governance and conservation effectiveness in protected areas and indigenous and locally managed areas. Ultimately, the study demonstrates the importance of effective governance in achieving conservation goals and promoting sustainable development in these critical ecosystems."}
