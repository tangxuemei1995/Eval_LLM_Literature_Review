{"Abstract": "The integration of green technologies is crucial for achieving environmental justice, particularly in marginalized communities. A just transition towards a low-carbon economy requires a modal shift towards electrification of transportation, heating, and industry, as well as the adoption of sustainable building practices. However, the distributional implications of these changes must be carefully considered to ensure that the benefits are equitably distributed. This study examines the implications of green technologies for environmental justice, with a focus on the distributional justice framework. The results suggest that a well-designed just transition can reduce health disparities and promote environmental justice, but that unequal access to green technologies and benefits can perpetuate existing inequalities. The study highlights the need for policy interventions that prioritize community engagement, education, and economic support to ensure a fair and equitable transition to a low-carbon economy."}
