{"Abstract": "The US legal and regulatory framework governing nuclear waste management from present and future reactors and their fuel cycles is complex and evolving. This framework encompasses various federal and state regulations, including the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal policies. Advanced reactor designs, such as small modular reactors and integral pressurized water reactors, pose new challenges for waste management. The concept of retrievability, where spent fuel is designed to be easily removed and reprocessed, is gaining attention. Standard contracts and nuclear fuel cycles also play crucial roles in shaping the regulatory landscape. This study examines the current state of the US legal and regulatory framework, highlighting areas of improvement and future directions for nuclear waste management."}
