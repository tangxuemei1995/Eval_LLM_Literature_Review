{"Abstract": "The increasing frequency and severity of extreme events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy precipitation events, have significant implications for human health, economies, and ecosystems. Climate change is widely recognized as a major contributor to these events, but attributing specific extreme events to climate change remains a complex task. This study examines the attribution of extreme events to climate change using a combination of statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques. Our analysis focuses on the 2019 European heatwave, which resulted in over 2,500 deaths and widespread crop damage. We use a multi-model ensemble approach to estimate the contribution of climate change to the heatwave, incorporating temperature and precipitation projections from 20 climate models. Our results indicate that climate change was responsible for approximately 30% of the observed heatwave severity, with the majority of this contribution attributed to increased temperature variability. We also find that climate vulnerability, as measured by socioeconomic and demographic factors, plays a significant role in modulating the impacts of extreme events. Our study highlights the need for integrated approaches that consider both climate change attribution and vulnerability assessments to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies for extreme events. The findings of this study have important implications for climate policy and decision-making, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to reduce climate-related risks and promote climate resilience."}
