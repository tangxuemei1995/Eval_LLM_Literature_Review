{"Abstract": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) pose a significant threat to freshwater ecosystems worldwide, exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication. These blooms are characterized by the rapid growth of cyanobacteria, resulting in the production of cyanotoxins that can be toxic to humans, animals, and plants. The biological traits of HCBs, including their ability to fix nitrogen and produce secondary metabolites, contribute to their persistence and spread. Climate change and eutrophication create ideal conditions for HCBs, leading to increased blooms and associated risks. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying HCBs, including nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and toxin production. It also discusses the risks associated with HCBs, including human health impacts and ecosystem damage. Finally, this review examines control strategies, including nutrient management, algaecides, and biological control agents, to mitigate the impacts of HCBs on freshwater ecosystems."}
