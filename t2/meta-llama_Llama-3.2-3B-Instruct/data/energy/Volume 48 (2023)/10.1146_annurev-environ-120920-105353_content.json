{"Abstract": "The increasing demand for sustainable practices has led to a surge in sustainability careers, encompassing a wide range of professions that prioritize environmental stewardship and social responsibility. This growing field requires a distinct set of competencies, including critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. As the job market continues to evolve, it is essential to develop effective training programs and curricula that equip individuals with the necessary skills to excel in sustainability careers. Research has shown that transitions towards sustainable practices can be facilitated through the development of green jobs, which not only contribute to environmental conservation but also drive economic growth and social development. This study examines the key competencies, training needs, and curricula required to support the growth of sustainability careers, with a focus on green jobs and their role in driving sustainable transitions."}
