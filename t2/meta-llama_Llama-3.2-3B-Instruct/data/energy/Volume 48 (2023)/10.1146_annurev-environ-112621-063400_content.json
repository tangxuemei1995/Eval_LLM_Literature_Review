{"Abstract": "This study examines the development of metrics for decision-making in energy justice, a critical aspect of achieving distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining literature reviews, stakeholder interviews, and expert consultations. The findings highlight the need for metrics that account for the intersectional impacts of energy policies on vulnerable populations. A proposed framework, 'Energy Justice Metrics' (EJM), is introduced, incorporating indicators of energy equity, environmental justice, and social justice. The EJM framework provides a structured approach to evaluating the distributive, procedural, and recognition justice implications of energy decisions, enabling more informed decision-making and promoting energy justice. The study's contributions have significant implications for energy policy development and implementation."}
