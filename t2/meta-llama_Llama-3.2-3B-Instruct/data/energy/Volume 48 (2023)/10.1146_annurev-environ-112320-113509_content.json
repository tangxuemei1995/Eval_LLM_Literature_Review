{"Abstract": "This study examines the complexities of collective action and resource governance in the context of common-pool resources, a ubiquitous feature of the natural environment. Drawing on theoretical frameworks from political ecology, economics, and sociology, we analyze the dynamics of commoning, a process of shared management and use of resources that challenges traditional notions of property and ownership. Through a critical review of existing literature and case studies from diverse geographical contexts, we identify key factors that facilitate or hinder collective action and effective resource governance. Our findings highlight the importance of social capital, institutional arrangements, and power dynamics in shaping the commons, and underscore the need for nuanced policy approaches that balance individual interests with collective well-being. By exploring the intersections of commoning, collective action, and resource governance, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the commons as a site of contested meanings, practices, and power relations."}
