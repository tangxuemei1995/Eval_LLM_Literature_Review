{"Abstract": "Urban overheating, a pressing issue in contemporary cities, refers to the excessive increase in temperature within urban areas compared to surrounding rural regions. This phenomenon is primarily caused by the urban heat island (UHI) effect, where built-up environments and human activities lead to the concentration of heat. The magnitude of urban overheating varies globally, with cities in tropical and subtropical regions experiencing the most severe temperatures. The impact of overheating is multifaceted, affecting human health, energy consumption, and urban infrastructure. Mitigation strategies, such as green infrastructure, cool pavements, and urban planning, can reduce the urban heat island effect. Adaptation measures, including heat-resilient design and climate-resilient urban planning, are also essential. However, future challenges, including climate change, population growth, and urbanization, will necessitate innovative and integrated approaches to address the complex issue of urban overheating, ensuring sustainable and livable cities for generations to come."}
