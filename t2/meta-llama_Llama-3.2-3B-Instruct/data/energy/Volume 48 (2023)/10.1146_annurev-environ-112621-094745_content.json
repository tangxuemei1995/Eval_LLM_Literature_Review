{"Abstract": "Brine, a high-salinity water solution, is a ubiquitous resource found in salt lakes and salt domes worldwide. The formation of brine is a complex process involving geological, geochemical, and hydrological factors. This review aims to provide an overview of the genesis of brine and its sustainable recovery as a valuable resource. Brine is a significant source of potash and lithium, essential minerals for various industrial applications. The processing techniques employed to recover these minerals from brine are crucial for their comprehensive utilization. Recent advances in membrane technology, solvent extraction, and electrochemical methods have improved the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of brine processing. However, the environmental and social impacts of brine recovery must be carefully considered to ensure sustainable development. This review highlights the current state of brine formation, processing, and utilization, and discusses the challenges and opportunities for sustainable brine recovery worldwide. By exploring the complexities of brine genesis and processing, this review aims to contribute to the development of innovative and environmentally responsible brine management strategies."}
