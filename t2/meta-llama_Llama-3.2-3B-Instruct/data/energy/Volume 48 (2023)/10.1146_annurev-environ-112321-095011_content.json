{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of imagination and cognition in shaping alternative futures within the Anthropocene era. By analyzing a range of scenarios and future visions, we identify key drivers of transformation and anticipation in the face of environmental and societal challenges. Our research reveals that imagination plays a crucial role in envisioning and creating alternative futures, while cognitive biases and heuristics can influence the development of these scenarios. We also explore the intersection of imagination and cognition in the context of future visions, highlighting the importance of considering the psychological and social factors that underpin human anticipation of future events. By examining the interplay between imagination, cognition, and transformation, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics governing human futures and the Anthropocene era."}
