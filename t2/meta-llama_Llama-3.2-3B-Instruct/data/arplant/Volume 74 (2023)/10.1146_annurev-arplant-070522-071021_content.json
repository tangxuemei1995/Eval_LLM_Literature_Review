{"Abstract": "Invasive plants have become a significant threat to global ecosystems, outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem processes. This review examines the factors contributing to the success of invasive plants, with a focus on biotic interactions, functional traits, and ecosystem invasibility. We discuss how non-native plants exploit vacant niches, overcome native defenses, and interact with other organisms to achieve dominance. Key functional traits, such as rapid growth rates, high reproductive capacities, and ability to tolerate stress, are identified as critical determinants of invasiveness. Biotic interactions, including herbivory, predation, and competition, also play a crucial role in shaping the success of invasive plants. Our analysis highlights the complex interplay between ecological, evolutionary, and environmental factors that enable invasive plants to thrive in new environments, and underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of these processes to inform effective management and control strategies."}
