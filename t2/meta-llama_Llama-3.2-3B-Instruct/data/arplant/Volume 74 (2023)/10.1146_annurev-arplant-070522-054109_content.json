{"Abstract": "The variability in mutation rates among plant genomes is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors. Recent studies have highlighted the role of chromatin structure in regulating DNA repair mechanisms, which in turn impact mutation rates. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the interplay between chromatin, DNA repair, and mutation rates in plant genomes. We discuss the evidence for chromatin-mediated regulation of DNA repair pathways, including the impact of histone modifications and chromatin remodeling complexes. Furthermore, we examine the evolutionary pressures that drive mutation rate variability in plants, including the role of mutation in plant evolution and adaptation to environmental stresses. Our analysis reveals that a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying mutation rate variability is essential for elucidating the evolutionary dynamics of plant genomes."}
