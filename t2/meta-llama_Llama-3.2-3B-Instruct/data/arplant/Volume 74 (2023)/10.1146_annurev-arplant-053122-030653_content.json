{"Abstract": "The advent of genome editing technologies has revolutionized the field of plant domestication, enabling the rapid creation of novel crop varieties with desirable traits. De novo domestication using genome editing holds immense promise for addressing the challenges posed by climate change, such as increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. By introducing specific genetic modifications, researchers can enhance crop resilience, yield, and nutritional content. However, the uncharted territory of de novo domestication also raises concerns regarding the unintended consequences of these modifications on plant developmental genetics and ecosystem balance. Ethnobotanical studies have highlighted the complex relationships between humans and plants, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of the cultural and environmental contexts in which crops are domesticated. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on de novo domestication using genome editing, highlighting both the power and perils of this emerging approach and its potential to reshape the future of plant breeding and food security."}
