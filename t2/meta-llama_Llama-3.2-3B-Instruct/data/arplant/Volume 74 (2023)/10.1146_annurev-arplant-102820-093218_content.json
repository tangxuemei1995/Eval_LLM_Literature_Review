{"Abstract": "SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers are a family of ATP-dependent enzymes that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular development by dynamically altering chromatin structure. These remodelers consist of a catalytic subunit and a scaffold subunit, which interact with transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to modulate nucleosome positioning and accessibility. The SWI/SNF complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including stimulus response, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation. In development, SWI/SNF remodelers have been shown to regulate the expression of key developmental genes, influencing cell fate decisions and tissue patterning. The activity of SWI/SNF remodelers is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, and epigenetic marks, allowing for precise control over chromatin dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of SWI/SNF remodelers in disease, including cancer, where dysregulation of these enzymes can contribute to tumorigenesis and epigenetic instability. Understanding the mechanisms of SWI/SNF remodeling and its role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression is essential for elucidating the molecular basis of cellular development and disease, and for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting these enzymes."}
