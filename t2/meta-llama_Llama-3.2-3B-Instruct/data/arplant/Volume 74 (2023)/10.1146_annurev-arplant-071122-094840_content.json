{"Abstract": "Optogenetic methods have revolutionized the field of plant biology by enabling precise control over plant physiological processes. By harnessing the power of light, researchers can manipulate photoreceptors, such as phytochromes and cryptochromes, to modulate plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. The introduction of optogenetic tools, including rhodopsin-based biosensors and optoswitches, has expanded the scope of optogenetic applications in plants. These tools allow for the selective activation or inhibition of specific photoreceptors, enabling researchers to study the complex interactions between light, plant hormones, and developmental pathways. Recent advances in optogenetic methods have also enabled the creation of novel plant models, such as optogenetically modified Arabidopsis thaliana, which have greatly enhanced our understanding of plant biology. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of optogenetic methods in plant biology and their potential applications in agriculture and basic research."}
