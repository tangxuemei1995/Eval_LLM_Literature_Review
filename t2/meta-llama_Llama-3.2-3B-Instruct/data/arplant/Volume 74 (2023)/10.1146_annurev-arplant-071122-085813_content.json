{"Abstract": "Plant RNA modifications, including mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA modifications, play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stresses. Recent studies have elucidated the diversity of RNA modifications in plants, with m6A, m5C, and other modifications being identified as key regulators of gene expression. The functional diversity of RNA modification is evident in their involvement in various cellular processes, including stress response, development, and defense against pathogens. For instance, m6A modifications have been shown to regulate stress-induced gene expression, while m5C modifications are involved in the regulation of rRNA processing. The functional diversity of RNA modification is further underscored by their ability to interact with RNA-binding proteins and other regulatory factors. Despite significant progress in understanding the diversity and functions of plant RNA modifications, there is still much to be discovered. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying RNA modification and their interactions with other regulatory networks, as well as exploring the potential applications of RNA modification in plant breeding and stress response. By continuing to investigate the complex relationships between RNA modifications and cellular processes, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanisms governing plant biology and develop new strategies for improving crop yields and stress tolerance."}
