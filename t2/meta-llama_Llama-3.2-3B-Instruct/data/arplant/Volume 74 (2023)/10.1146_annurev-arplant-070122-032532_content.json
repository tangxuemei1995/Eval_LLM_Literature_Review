{"Abstract": "Chloroplast proteostasis is a critical process that maintains protein homeostasis within the chloroplast, a vital organelle responsible for photosynthesis. The chloroplast proteostasis network involves the coordinated import, sorting, ubiquitination, and proteolysis of proteins to ensure proper protein function and prevent protein aggregation. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms of protein translocation into the chloroplast, where proteins are targeted to specific compartments and undergo post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a central role in regulating protein turnover in the chloroplast, with the proteasome degrading ubiquitinated proteins to maintain protein homeostasis. Disruptions in chloroplast proteostasis have been implicated in various plant diseases and disorders, highlighting the importance of this process in maintaining chloroplast function and plant health. Further research is needed to fully understand the complexities of chloroplast proteostasis and its role in plant biology."}
