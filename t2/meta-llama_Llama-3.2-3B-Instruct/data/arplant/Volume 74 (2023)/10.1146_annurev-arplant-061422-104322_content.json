{"Abstract": "The increasing global demand for food, coupled with the rising frequency of saltwater intrusion and soil salinization, poses a significant threat to crop yields and food security. To address this challenge, researchers have been exploring the potential of salt-tolerant crops, which can thrive in saline environments. This review synthesizes recent advances in the development of salinity-tolerant crops through traditional breeding, crop wild relatives (CWRs) utilization, and genetic modification. The integration of CWRs into domesticated crops has shown promise in enhancing salinity tolerance, while genetic modification has enabled the introduction of novel salt-tolerant genes. Neodomestication, the process of re-domesticating wild relatives, has also emerged as a promising approach. By harnessing the genetic diversity of CWRs and leveraging cutting-edge biotechnology, it is possible to deliver salt-tolerant crops that can sustainably improve crop yields and enhance food security in saline environments."}
