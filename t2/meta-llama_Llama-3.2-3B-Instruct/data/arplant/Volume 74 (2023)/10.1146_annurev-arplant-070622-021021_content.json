{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of an RNA world, where RNA plays a central role in the evolution of life on Earth. By examining the genetic material of plant viruses, we uncover the mechanisms by which RNA-based systems confer disease resistance in plants. Through a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from molecular biology, virology, and evolutionary biology, we demonstrate how RNA can be harnessed to improve crop yields and disease resistance in agriculture. Our research also delves into the historical context of the RNA world hypothesis, tracing its development from the early 20th century to the present day. By integrating cutting-edge technology in agriculture with our understanding of RNA-based systems, we aim to create innovative solutions for sustainable food production and disease management."}
