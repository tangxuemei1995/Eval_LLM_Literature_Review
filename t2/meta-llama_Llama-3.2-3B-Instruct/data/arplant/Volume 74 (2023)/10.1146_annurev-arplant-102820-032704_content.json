{"Abstract": "The phyllosphere microbiome, comprising microorganisms residing on plant surfaces, plays a crucial role in plant health and immunity. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between phytobiomes and their host plants, including the exchange of nutrients and signaling molecules. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the phyllosphere microbiome, has been linked to various plant diseases and reduced plant immunity. Endophytes, microorganisms living within plant tissues, contribute to plant defense against pathogens and abiotic stresses. Epiphytes, microorganisms growing on plant surfaces, can also modulate plant immunity and nutrient uptake. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the phyllosphere microbiome, its dynamics, and its impact on plant health and immunity. We discuss the mechanisms of phytobiome-endophyte interactions and the consequences of dysbiosis on plant immunity, highlighting the potential for phytobiome manipulation as a novel approach to improve plant health and resistance to diseases."}
