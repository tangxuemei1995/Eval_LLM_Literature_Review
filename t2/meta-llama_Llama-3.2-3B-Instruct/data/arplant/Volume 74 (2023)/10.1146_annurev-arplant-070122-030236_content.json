{"Abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in plant development, adaptation, and evolution by regulating gene expression in response to environmental cues. These non-coding DNA sequences interact with chromatin to modulate transcription, influencing various physiological processes such as growth, stress response, and reproductive development. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of CREs in plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions, including drought, temperature, and salinity stress. The evolution of CREs has been linked to the development of novel gene regulatory networks, enabling plants to adapt to diverse ecological niches. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the function and evolution of CREs in plant development, adaptation, and evolution, highlighting their potential as targets for crop improvement and stress tolerance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CRE-mediated transcription regulation is crucial for elucidating the complex interactions between plants and their environment."}
