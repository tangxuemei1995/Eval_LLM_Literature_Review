{"Abstract": "Proximity labeling is a powerful tool for elucidating protein–protein and protein–nucleotide interactions within the subcellular proteome of plants. By enabling the quantitative analysis of protein interactions, proximity labeling has the potential to reveal novel protein partners and elucidate their functional roles in plant biology. Recent advances in proximity labeling technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas13 and BioID, have facilitated the detection of protein–protein and protein–nucleotide interactions in plant cells. These methods have been successfully applied to investigate protein interactions in various plant cell types, including Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. The resulting data have provided valuable insights into the subcellular organization of the plant proteome and have shed light on the functional significance of protein interactions in plant development, stress response, and metabolism. This review provides an overview of the current state of proximity labeling in plants, highlighting its applications, advantages, and limitations. We discuss the use of proximity labeling to investigate protein–protein and protein–nucleotide interactions in the subcellular proteome of plants and highlight the potential of this approach for elucidating the complex interactions that govern plant biology."}
