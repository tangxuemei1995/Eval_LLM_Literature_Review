{"Abstract": "Plant volatiles play a crucial role in mediating ecological signaling, influencing interactions between plants and their environment. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of these interactions remain poorly understood. Research has shown that plant volatiles can convey information about environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and soil chemistry, to other plants and animals. This information can be used to facilitate mutualistic relationships, deter herbivores, and attract beneficial insects. Despite the importance of plant volatiles in ecological signaling, significant research gaps remain, particularly in terms of understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of volatile emission and reception. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying plant volatile-mediated ecological signaling and to explore its potential applications in agriculture and conservation. By investigating the complex relationships between plants, volatiles, and their environment, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the intricate web of ecological interactions that shape ecosystems."}
