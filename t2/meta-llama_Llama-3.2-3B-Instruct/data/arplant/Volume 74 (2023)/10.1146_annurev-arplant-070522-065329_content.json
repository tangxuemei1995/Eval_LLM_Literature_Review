{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between circadian rhythms and environmental changes has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of climate change. This intersection of biological and environmental factors has profound implications for organismal adaptation and survival. Research has shown that circadian rhythms, which govern the body's internal clock, are sensitive to external cues such as temperature, light, and humidity. As environmental conditions shift in response to climate change, these cues can disrupt the normal functioning of circadian signaling networks, leading to altered physiological responses and behavioral adaptations. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of the interplay between circadian rhythms and environmental change, with a focus on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this complex relationship. By elucidating the key players and pathways involved, this review seeks to provide a framework for understanding the adaptive responses of organisms to a changing environment."}
