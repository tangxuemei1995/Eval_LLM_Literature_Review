{"Abstract": "Epigenetic regulation plays a pivotal role in plant development, influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation. Histone modifications, DNA methylation, and transposable element activity contribute to the dynamic epigenetic landscape, modulating plant growth and responses to environmental stimuli. This study investigates the interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and plant development, with a focus on the capacity for epigenetic memory. We examine the impact of heat stress on epigenetic marks in Arabidopsis thaliana, revealing altered histone modifications and DNA methylation patterns. Furthermore, we explore the role of transposable elements in mediating epigenetic responses to heat stress. Our findings suggest that epigenetic regulation is essential for plant adaptation to environmental stressors, and that epigenetic memory can be retained across generations. These results have significant implications for our understanding of plant development and stress responses, and highlight the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping plant phenotypes."}
