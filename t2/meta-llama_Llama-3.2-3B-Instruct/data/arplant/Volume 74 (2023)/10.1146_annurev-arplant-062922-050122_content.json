{"Abstract": "The BAHD (B3-Domain-Containing) acyltransferase gene family has emerged as a crucial component in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway of land plants. This family of enzymes catalyzes the transfer of acyl groups to various substrates, resulting in the formation of diverse acylsugars, esters, and amides. Recent studies have expanded our understanding of the BAHD gene family's roles in plant development, stress responses, and interactions with the environment. The HCT (hydroxycinnamoyltransferase) subfamily, in particular, has been implicated in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds and the regulation of plant defense mechanisms. Through the analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, as well as biochemical assays, this review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the BAHD gene family and its significance in plant evolution, highlighting the intricate relationships between these enzymes and the phenylpropanoid pathway. The findings of this review will contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth, development, and adaptation to environmental challenges."}
