{"Abstract": "Plant small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and phasiRNAs, play crucial roles in regulating various aspects of plant development and stress responses. The biogenesis of these small RNAs involves complex interactions between RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA-binding proteins, and other factors. miRNAs primarily function in post-transcriptional gene silencing, targeting mRNAs for degradation or translational repression, thereby modulating gene expression. In contrast, siRNAs and phasiRNAs are involved in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and the regulation of endogenous retroelements. Mobile siRNAs, which are derived from transposable elements, also contribute to the regulation of plant development and stress responses. This review provides an overview of the biogenesis, regulatory roles, and functions of plant small RNAs, highlighting their importance in understanding plant development and stress responses, and their potential applications in crop improvement and plant breeding."}
