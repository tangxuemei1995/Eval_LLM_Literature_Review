{"Abstract": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a complex, plant-fungal relationship that plays a crucial role in plant growth and stress adaptation. This symbiosis involves the exchange of nutrients between plants and fungi, facilitating enhanced nutrient uptake and utilization. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of common mycorrhizal networks, where multiple plants share resources through fungal connections. Helper bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, also contribute to mycorrhizal symbiosis by producing plant growth-promoting substances. The autoregulation of mycorrhizae, where fungi regulate their own growth in response to plant needs, is another key mechanism. This review synthesizes current knowledge on mycorrhizal symbiosis, from the molecular level of gene expression to the ecosystem level of nutrient cycling and stress resistance. Understanding the intricate relationships between plants, fungi, and bacteria is essential for optimizing agricultural productivity and promoting ecosystem resilience in the face of environmental stressors."}
