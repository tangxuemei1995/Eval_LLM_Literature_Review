{"Abstract": "Plant hormone transport and localization are crucial for maintaining hormone homeostasis and regulating plant growth and development. Phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), and ethylene (ET), play vital roles in various physiological processes. The transport of these signaling molecules is mediated by a family of transporters, which facilitate their movement across cell membranes and between tissues. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying hormone transport, including the role of auxin transporters in regulating cell elongation and division. The localization of hormone transporters is also critical, with specific transporters localized to distinct tissues and cell types. Understanding the complex interactions between hormone transport and localization is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth and development, and for developing strategies to improve crop yields and plant productivity."}
