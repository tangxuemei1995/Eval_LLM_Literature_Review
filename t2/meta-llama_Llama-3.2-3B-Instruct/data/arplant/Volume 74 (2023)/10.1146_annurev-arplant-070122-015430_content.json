{"Abstract": "Interplant signaling through common mycelial networks and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been increasingly recognized as a crucial mechanism facilitating communication between plants. This phenomenon, known as between-plant signaling, enables plants to share information about environmental cues, pathogens, and nutrient availability, thereby modulating their growth, defense, and resource allocation strategies. Research has shown that AMF can act as hubs in complex networks of mycelia, connecting multiple plants and facilitating the exchange of signaling molecules. In contrast, parasitic plants, such as dodder and mistletoe, have evolved to exploit these networks for their own benefit, using them to tap into the nutrient resources of their host plants. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of between-plant signaling is essential for elucidating the intricate relationships between plants and their environment, and for developing novel strategies for improving plant health and productivity in agricultural systems."}
