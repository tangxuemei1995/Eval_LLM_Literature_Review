{"Abstract": "Temperature sensing in plants is a crucial mechanism for regulating growth, development, and stress responses. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely used model organism, thermosensors play a pivotal role in thermomorphogenesis, the process by which plants adapt to changing temperatures. This study investigates the role of thermosensors in heat and cold stress responses in Arabidopsis. We found that thermosensors are activated in response to both heat and cold stress, triggering a signaling cascade that regulates gene expression and stress responses. Our results demonstrate that thermomorphogenesis is a complex process involving multiple thermosensors and signaling pathways. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature sensing in plants and have implications for understanding plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions."}
