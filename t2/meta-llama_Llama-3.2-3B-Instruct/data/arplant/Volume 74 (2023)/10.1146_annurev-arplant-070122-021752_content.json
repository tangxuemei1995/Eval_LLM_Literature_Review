{"Abstract": "Lipid droplets are dynamic, membrane-bound organelles that play a crucial role in the storage and metabolism of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in various eukaryotic cells, including plant seeds. The biogenesis of lipid droplets involves the coordinated action of multiple proteins, including lipid droplet-associated proteins (LDAPs) and lipid droplet-binding proteins (LDBPs), which regulate the assembly and maturation of these organelles. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of compartmentation in lipid droplet metabolism, with TAGs serving as a key energy storage molecule in seeds. The storage of TAGs in lipid droplets allows for efficient energy storage and mobilization during periods of stress or nutrient limitation. In addition, lipid droplets have been implicated in the regulation of seed germination and plant growth. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of lipid droplet biogenesis, compartmentation, and metabolism, with a focus on the role of TAGs in seed energy storage and plant growth. The findings of this review have implications for our understanding of lipid droplet function in various eukaryotic cells and the development of novel strategies for improving crop yields and stress tolerance."}
