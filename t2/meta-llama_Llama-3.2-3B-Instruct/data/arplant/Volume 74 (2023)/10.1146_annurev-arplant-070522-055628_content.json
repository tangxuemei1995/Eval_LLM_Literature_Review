{"Abstract": "Plant photoperiodism is a complex process by which plants respond to the duration of daylight to regulate growth and development. Recent advances in our understanding of external coincidence and metabolic daylength measurement systems have expanded the scope of photoperiodism research. Noncanonical photoperiod measurement approaches, such as those utilizing novel sensors and machine learning algorithms, have emerged as promising tools for deciphering the intricacies of plant circadian rhythms. Furthermore, studies on photosynthetic photoperiod have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying photosynthetic adaptation to changing light conditions. This review synthesizes the latest findings on photoperiodism, highlighting the interplay between external cues, internal clocks, and metabolic pathways. By exploring the frontiers of photoperiodism research, we aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing plant growth and development in response to environmental light conditions, ultimately informing strategies for crop improvement and agricultural optimization."}
