{"Abstract": "The high-tech industry has long been touted as a bastion of meritocracy, where innovation and entrepreneurship reign supreme. However, a growing body of research suggests that this narrative is far from accurate. This study examines the intersection of social inequality, including gender, race, and ethnicity, with the high-tech industry. Through a critical analysis of organizational structures and venture capital investments, we reveal how these factors perpetuate workplace inequality and limit opportunities for underrepresented groups. Our findings indicate that women, people of color, and ethnic minorities face significant barriers to entry and advancement in the industry, including biased hiring practices, limited access to funding, and a lack of representation in leadership positions. These findings have important implications for the industry's ability to drive innovation and growth, and highlight the need for more inclusive and equitable practices to address the persistent inequalities that plague the high-tech sector."}
