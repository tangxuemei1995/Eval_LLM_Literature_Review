{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationships between food systems, inequality, and social justice. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, we explore how agricultural practices, food access, and distribution perpetuate or challenge existing power dynamics and inequalities. Drawing on intersectional frameworks, we investigate how food sovereignty, a concept rooted in the experiences of marginalized communities, can serve as a tool for promoting food justice and reducing inequality. Our research highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the intersections between agriculture, food access, and social justice, and underscores the importance of centering the voices and perspectives of historically disadvantaged groups in the development of food systems that prioritize equity and sustainability. By examining the ways in which food systems can be transformed to promote greater food justice and reduce inequality, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between food, power, and social justice."}
