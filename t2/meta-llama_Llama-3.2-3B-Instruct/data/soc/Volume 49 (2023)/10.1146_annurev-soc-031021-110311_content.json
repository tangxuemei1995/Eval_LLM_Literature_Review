{"Abstract": "This study introduces a novel framework for investigating the interplay between neighborhood and school structures, shedding light on the complex relationships between social contexts and educational outcomes. By examining the intersection of neighborhood effects and school effects, our research aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how social segregation influences student achievement and school performance. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data, we analyze the relationships between neighborhood characteristics, school demographics, and student academic results. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the social contexts in which schools operate, and underscore the importance of considering the broader neighborhood environment in educational policy and practice. By exploring the dynamics between neighborhood-school structures, this research contributes to a more informed discussion of the social determinants of educational success."}
