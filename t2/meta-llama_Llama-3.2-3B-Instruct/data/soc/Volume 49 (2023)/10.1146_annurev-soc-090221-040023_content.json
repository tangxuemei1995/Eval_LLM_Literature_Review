{"Abstract": "Forced and refugee migration has become a pervasive global phenomenon, resulting in significant social consequences for both migrants and host communities. This literature review examines the complex interplay between forced and refugee migration, migrant integration, and demographic changes. The findings suggest that forced migration can lead to profound disruptions in social networks, cultural identity, and economic stability, particularly among refugees. Furthermore, the influx of migrants can strain local resources, exacerbate social tensions, and challenge the host country's social cohesion. The review also highlights the critical role of international migration policies, demographic factors, and community-based initiatives in mitigating the negative social consequences of forced migration. Ultimately, this study underscores the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach to addressing the social consequences of forced and refugee migration, one that prioritizes the dignity, resilience, and well-being of all individuals affected by these complex global issues."}
