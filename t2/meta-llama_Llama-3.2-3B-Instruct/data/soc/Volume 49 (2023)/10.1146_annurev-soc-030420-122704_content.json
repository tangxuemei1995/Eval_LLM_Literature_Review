{"Abstract": "This study examines the pervasive issue of land inequalities in the United States, a pressing concern that affects the economy, environment, and quality of life in both urban and rural areas. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research highlights the disproportionate distribution of land ownership and control, with significant implications for property values, tax revenues, and community development. The findings reveal that urban areas tend to have higher concentrations of land ownership among a small elite, while rural areas are often characterized by fragmented and unequal land ownership patterns. The study also explores the role of environmental factors, such as zoning regulations and land-use policies, in perpetuating land inequalities. Ultimately, this research underscores the need for policy reforms and community-led initiatives to address the root causes of land inequalities and promote more equitable and sustainable land use practices in the United States."}
