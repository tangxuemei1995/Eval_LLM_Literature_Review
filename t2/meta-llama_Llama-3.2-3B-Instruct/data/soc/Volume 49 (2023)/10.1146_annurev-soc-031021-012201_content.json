{"Abstract": "This study examines the social implications of supply-side decarbonization, a critical strategy for mitigating climate change. By transitioning to low-carbon energy sources and improving energy efficiency, supply-side decarbonization can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, this transition also poses significant social challenges, including the potential displacement of workers in fossil fuel-intensive industries and the need for significant investments in new infrastructure. A mixed-methods approach was employed to investigate the social impacts of supply-side decarbonization in three case study countries. The findings suggest that a just transition to a low-carbon economy requires careful planning and coordination to minimize negative social impacts. Effective policies and programs can help mitigate the effects of decarbonization on workers and communities, ensuring a more equitable and sustainable transition to a low-carbon future."}
