{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex dynamics of cross-border politics, focusing on the mobilization of diasporic communities and the state's response to their activism. Through a critical analysis of transnationalism and geopolitics, this research explores how diasporic groups navigate their homeland and host country relationships, influencing the trajectory of emigrant politics. The intersection of nationalism and transnationalism is also investigated, highlighting the tensions between state sovereignty and diasporic identity. Drawing on case studies of various diasporic communities, this research reveals the multifaceted nature of diasporic mobilization, from advocacy for homeland rights to transnational solidarity. The state response to diasporic activism is also scrutinized, highlighting the ways in which governments navigate the complexities of cross-border politics and the implications for homeland and host country relations. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of diasporas in shaping geopolitics and the evolving nature of nationalism in the 21st century."}
