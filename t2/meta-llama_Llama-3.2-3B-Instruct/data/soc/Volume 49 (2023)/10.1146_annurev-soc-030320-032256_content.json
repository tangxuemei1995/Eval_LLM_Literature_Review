{"Abstract": "This study explores the complexities of LGBTQ+ identities by examining the intersections of sexual minority experiences with gender identity and life course trajectories. Drawing on intersectional theories, the research delves into the ways in which societal expectations, cultural norms, and individual experiences shape the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals. Through a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative data, the study investigates how gender identity and sexual minority status intersect to influence life course outcomes, including mental health, relationships, and social participation. The findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of LGBTQ+ identities, acknowledging the diversity of experiences within the community and the importance of intersectional approaches in promoting inclusivity and social justice."}
