{"Abstract": "This study undertakes a spatial-contextual analysis of the criminal legal system, examining the interplay between policing, punishment, and place. Through a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative data, we investigate how spatial contexts influence the exercise of policing and punishment. Our research reveals that the spatial distribution of crime, policing strategies, and punishment outcomes are shaped by factors such as urban planning, socioeconomic status, and institutional policies. We demonstrate how the built environment and social contexts interact to produce disparate outcomes for different populations, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the spatial dimensions of the criminal legal system. Our findings have implications for the development of more effective and equitable policing and punishment strategies, and underscore the importance of considering the spatial context in which these practices occur."}
