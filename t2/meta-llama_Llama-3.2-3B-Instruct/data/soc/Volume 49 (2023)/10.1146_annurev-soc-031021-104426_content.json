{"Abstract": "This 60-year journey in comparative political economy has traversed the complexities of embedded autonomy and its evolution into counter-hegemonic globalization. Through a critical examination of dependent development and the state-society synergy of developmental states, this research has identified the transformative power of transnational advocacy networks in shaping global economic policies. Drawing on autobiographical accounts of key figures, this study reveals the intricate dynamics of power and resistance that have characterized the trajectory of globalization. By juxtaposing the embedded autonomy of the 1950s and 1960s with the counter-hegemonic forces of the present day, this research offers a nuanced understanding of the ongoing struggle for economic justice and democracy. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intersections between globalization, development, and social change, highlighting the need for more inclusive and equitable global economic systems."}
