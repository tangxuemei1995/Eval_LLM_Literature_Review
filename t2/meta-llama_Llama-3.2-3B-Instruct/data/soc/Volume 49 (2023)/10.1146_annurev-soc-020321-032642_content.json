{"Abstract": "This study examines the diverging destinies of children in East Asia, with a particular focus on the intersection of family, gender, and inequality. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature and original data from China, Japan, and South Korea, this research reveals significant disparities in the life chances of children across these countries. The findings suggest that children from lower-income families and those with female parents are disproportionately disadvantaged, facing increased risks of poverty, poor education, and limited social mobility. In contrast, children from higher-income families and those with male parents tend to enjoy greater access to resources, networks, and opportunities. The study argues that these diverging destinies are rooted in deeply ingrained social and cultural norms that perpetuate inequality and limit social mobility in East Asia. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, highlighting the need for policy interventions and social programs that address the root causes of inequality and promote more equitable outcomes for all children in the region."}
