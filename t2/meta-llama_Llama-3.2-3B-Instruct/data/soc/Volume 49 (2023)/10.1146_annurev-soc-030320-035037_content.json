{"Abstract": "The legitimacy of science is a multifaceted concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of public policy and cultural discourse. This study examines the relationship between science, knowledge, and legitimacy, with a focus on the polarization of scientific opinions in the public sphere. Through a critical discourse analysis of media reports and public statements, this research reveals how the legitimacy of science is shaped by cultural and social factors, including the representation of science in the media and the role of science in public policy. The findings suggest that the polarization of scientific opinions is often driven by a perceived mismatch between scientific knowledge and public values, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between science, knowledge, and legitimacy. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the social and cultural contexts that shape the legitimacy of science and informs strategies for promoting public trust in science."}
