{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex and multifaceted concept of age, exploring its social construction and implications for understanding aging and life course dynamics. Drawing on intersectional and demographic perspectives, the research highlights how age is shaped by stratification, power relations, and social context. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and empirical data, this study reveals how age is constructed and measured, and how these constructions impact individual and collective experiences of aging. The findings emphasize the need for a nuanced understanding of age that takes into account the intersections of age with other social factors, such as gender, class, and ethnicity. By examining the social construction of age, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the life course and its relationship to demographic and social change, ultimately informing more effective policies and interventions aimed at promoting healthy aging and social inclusion."}
