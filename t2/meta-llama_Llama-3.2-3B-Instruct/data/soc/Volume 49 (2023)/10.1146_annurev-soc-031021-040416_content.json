{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of sociology of culture, institutions, and women's movement through the lens of autobiographical narratives from African women. Analyzing historical and contemporary accounts, this research reveals the complex relationships between cultural practices, social structures, and individual agency in shaping the lives of women in Africa. Biographical insights inform sociological theories on culture and religion."}
