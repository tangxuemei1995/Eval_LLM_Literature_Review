{"Abstract": "Social isolation is a pervasive and growing health concern, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. This review synthesizes existing literature on social isolation, highlighting its disparate impact across the life course, influenced by intersecting factors of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. Research indicates that marginalized groups experience heightened levels of social isolation, exacerbating existing health disparities. The life course perspective reveals how early-life experiences, such as poverty and discrimination, contribute to long-term social isolation. Furthermore, the intersection of social isolation with other health risk factors, such as mental health and chronic disease, underscores its significance as a uniquely distributed health hazard. Addressing social isolation requires a nuanced understanding of its complex relationships with social determinants of health, ultimately necessitating targeted interventions to mitigate its inequitable effects."}
