{"Abstract": "This study investigates the concept of weak ties and their potential to become strong, exploring the dynamics of social network diffusion. Through a computational social science approach, we analyze the structural and agency-based factors influencing the transformation of bridging ties into strong ties. Our results indicate that the strength of weak ties is contingent upon the presence of shared interests, trust, and reciprocity. We also find that the structure of the social network, including the density and centrality of bridging nodes, plays a crucial role in facilitating the diffusion of information and resources. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between structure and agency in shaping the strength of weak ties, with implications for the study of social networks and diffusion processes."}
