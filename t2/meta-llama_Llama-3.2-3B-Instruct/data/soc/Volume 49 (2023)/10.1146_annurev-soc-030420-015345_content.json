{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in causal inference and machine learning, highlighting their interplay in estimating treatment effects and addressing treatment effect heterogeneity. By leveraging counterfactuals and mediation analysis, researchers can better understand the complex relationships between treatment variables and outcome variables. Machine learning techniques, such as propensity score matching and gradient boosting, have been employed to improve the accuracy of causal inference. However, extrapolation of results to new populations and contexts remains a significant challenge. External validity is increasingly recognized as a critical concern in causal inference, particularly when using machine learning methods. This review discusses the current state of the field, highlighting key challenges and opportunities for future research, and provides a roadmap for integrating causal inference and machine learning to improve the validity and generalizability of treatment effect estimates."}
