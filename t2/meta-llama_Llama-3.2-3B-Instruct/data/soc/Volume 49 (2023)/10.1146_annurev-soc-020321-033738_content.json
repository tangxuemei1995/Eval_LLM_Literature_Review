{"Abstract": "This abstract provides an overview of the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology, a sociological approach that examines the methods and practices of everyday social interaction. Ethnomethodology, pioneered by Harold Garfinkel, has had a profound impact on the field of conversation analysis, which has in turn influenced various studies of science, organizations, and the workplace. By examining the instructed actions and rules that govern social behavior, ethnomethodologists have shed light on the ways in which individuals and groups construct and negotiate meaning in everyday interactions. The legacy of ethnomethodology can be seen in the work of scholars such as Anselm Strauss and Erving Goffman, who have applied the approach to the study of organizations and institutions. However, ethnomethodology's focus on the micro-level details of social interaction has also led to criticisms of its relevance to broader social and political issues. As the field continues to evolve, ethnomethodologists are exploring new avenues for research, including the application of conversation analysis to the study of technology and the internet. Ultimately, the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology offer a nuanced understanding of the complex ways in which social interaction shapes our understanding of the world around us. By examining the rules and instructed actions that govern everyday life, ethnomethodologists can provide insights into the ways in which social structures and institutions are constructed and negotiated."}
