{"Abstract": "This study employs Critical Race Theory (CRT) to examine the complex and multifaceted nature of white privilege, a concept long debated in academic and social circles. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and empirical data, this research aims to challenge dominant narratives surrounding whiteness and white privilege, highlighting the ways in which these constructs perpetuate systemic inequalities. By rethinking traditional notions of privilege and power, this study seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the ways in which whiteness operates as a site of privilege, and to inform strategies for confronting and dismantling these systems of oppression. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the intersections between race, power, and privilege, and its implications for social justice and equality."}
