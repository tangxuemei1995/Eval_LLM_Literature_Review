{"Abstract": "This study investigates the representation of third-party helping interactions in infancy, a critical period of social cognition development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined infants' (6-24 months) responses to observational learning of helping behaviors in a controlled laboratory setting. Participants were exposed to a series of videos depicting adults helping others, with varying levels of success and failure. Infants' facial expressions, eye gaze, and behavioral responses were recorded and analyzed for signs of empathy, understanding, and goal attribution. Our results show that infants as young as 6 months begin to exhibit signs of social understanding, including recognizing the importance of helping and attributing goals to the helper. Notably, infants' responses to successful and unsuccessful helping behaviors differed significantly, suggesting that they are capable of distinguishing between different types of helping interactions. These findings have implications for our understanding of social cognition development in infancy and highlight the importance of third-party helping interactions in shaping infants' understanding of social norms and values. The results also have practical applications for early childhood education and intervention programs aimed at promoting social-emotional learning and prosocial behavior."}
