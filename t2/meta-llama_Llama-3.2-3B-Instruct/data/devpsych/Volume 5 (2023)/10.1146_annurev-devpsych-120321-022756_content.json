{"Abstract": "This study explores the complexities of social identities and intersectionality in the context of identity development among youth. Drawing on critical race theory and intersectionality, the research examines the multifaceted nature of identity and its intersections with various social categories. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The findings suggest that identity development is a dynamic and context-dependent process, influenced by a range of social, cultural, and economic factors. The study highlights the importance of interdisciplinarity in understanding the intersections of identity and highlights the need for a critical race theory framework in examining the experiences of marginalized youth. The research contributes to our understanding of identity development and intersectionality, and provides implications for practice and policy in promoting inclusive and equitable outcomes for all youth."}
