{"Abstract": "Life-course epidemiology and causal inference are two distinct yet interconnected approaches to understanding the relationships between early life experiences and later life outcomes. Life-course epidemiology examines the dynamics of health and disease across the lifespan, often using longitudinal data to identify patterns and trends. In contrast, causal inference seeks to establish the direction and magnitude of causal relationships between early life exposures and later life outcomes. However, these approaches often diverge in their methodologies and assumptions, leading to tensions and challenges in integrating them. This study aims to bridge this divide by developing a novel framework that integrates life-course epidemiological methods with causal inference techniques. By leveraging natural experiments and quantitative methods, we demonstrate the feasibility of using life-course data to estimate causal effects and provide new insights into the relationships between early life experiences and later life outcomes. Our findings have implications for the development of evidence-based policies and interventions aimed at promoting health and well-being across the lifespan."}
