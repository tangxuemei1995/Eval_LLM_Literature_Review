{"Abstract": "This longitudinal study, SECCYD, examines the intricate relationships between early child care and youth development from infancy to adulthood. Spanning multiple decades, the research investigates how various developmental contexts, including social-emotional, cognitive-academic, and physical-biological development, intersect and influence one another. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the study combines quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics at play. Findings from SECCYD shed light on the critical role of early child care in shaping the trajectory of youth development, highlighting the interplay between environmental factors, individual characteristics, and developmental milestones. The study's contributions to the field of developmental psychology offer valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking to inform evidence-based interventions and promote optimal youth development outcomes."}
