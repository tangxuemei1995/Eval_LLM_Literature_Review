{"Abstract": "This study examines the dynamics of emotion regulation in couples across adulthood, with a particular focus on the impact of aging on emotional expression and conflict resolution. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 100 couples aged 40-75. Results indicate that couples' emotion regulation strategies evolve across adulthood, with younger couples relying more on expressive emotional expression and older couples employing more suppressive strategies. Notably, couples' emotion regulation was found to be influenced by age-related changes in emotional experience, social support, and relationship satisfaction. Qualitative findings suggest that couples' ability to regulate emotions together is crucial for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between emotion regulation, aging, and relationship dynamics, highlighting the importance of emotional intelligence and communication in couples' relationships across adulthood."}
