{"Abstract": "This qualitative study employs a phenomenological approach to explore the lived experiences of individuals navigating an unforeseen pathway in life, one that is marked by significant vulnerability and disruption to their previously established socialization and identity. Through in-depth autobiographical interviews, this research seeks to uncover the ways in which participants have coped with and adapted to these challenges, revealing the complex interplay between resilience and vulnerability. The findings suggest that navigating an unforeseen pathway requires a profound re-examination of one's sense of self and social identity, necessitating a process of self-reflection, reorientation, and re-formation. The study highlights the importance of acknowledging and embracing vulnerability as a necessary component of resilience, and underscores the need for social support and community-based interventions to facilitate this process. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the human experience of navigating uncertainty and adversity, and offers insights into the development of effective support strategies for individuals facing unforeseen life challenges."}
