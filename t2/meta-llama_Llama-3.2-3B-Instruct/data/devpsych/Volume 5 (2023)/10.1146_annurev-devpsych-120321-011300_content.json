{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neurodevelopmental trajectory of attention, learning, and memory systems in infancy, a critical period of cognitive growth. Using a longitudinal design, we examined the relationships between infant attention, learning, and memory from 6 to 24 months. Our results show that infants exhibit significant improvements in attentional control, learning, and memory consolidation between 6 and 12 months, with continued refinement and maturation of these systems until 24 months. Notably, we found that early attentional abilities predict later learning and memory outcomes, highlighting the importance of attentional development in the formation of cognitive skills. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying infant cognitive development and have implications for the design of early interventions aimed at promoting healthy cognitive growth in at-risk populations."}
