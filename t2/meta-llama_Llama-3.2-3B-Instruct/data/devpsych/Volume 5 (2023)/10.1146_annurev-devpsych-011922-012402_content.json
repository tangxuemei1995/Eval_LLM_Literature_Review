{"Abstract": "Poverty, a pervasive and complex social issue, has been increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of brain development and mental health outcomes. Research has consistently shown that individuals from impoverished backgrounds exhibit altered brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in emotional regulation, stress response, and cognitive control. Neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between poverty and mental health, highlighting the role of adversity in shaping brain development. However, concerns regarding the replicability and reproducibility of these findings have hindered the translation of research into effective interventions. This review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge on the intersection of poverty, brain development, and mental health, with a focus on identifying progress, challenges, and potential paths forward for addressing these complex issues. By examining the empirical evidence and methodological limitations, this review seeks to inform the development of evidence-based interventions that can mitigate the negative effects of poverty on brain development and mental health outcomes."}
