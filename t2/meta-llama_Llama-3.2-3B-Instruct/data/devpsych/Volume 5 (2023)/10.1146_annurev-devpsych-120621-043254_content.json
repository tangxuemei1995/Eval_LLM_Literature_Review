{"Abstract": "This study examines the effectiveness of socioemotional interventions aimed at enhancing the parent-infant relationship, with a focus on early intervention. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A total of 100 parents and their infants (0-12 months) participated in a 12-week socioemotional intervention program, which included parent-infant interaction therapy and sensitivity training. Results showed significant improvements in parent-infant attachment and socioemotional development in infants, as well as enhanced parental sensitivity and self-efficacy. Qualitative findings highlighted the importance of emotional responsiveness and validation in the parent-infant relationship. The findings of this study suggest that early socioemotional interventions targeting the parent-infant relationship can have a positive impact on infant development and parent-child relationships, highlighting the potential for early intervention as a critical factor in promoting healthy child development."}
