{"Abstract": "This study proposes a two-hit model of behavioral inhibition and anxiety, examining the developmental origins of these constructs from infancy to adolescence. The two-hit model posits that an initial genetic predisposition (hit 1) interacts with a subsequent environmental factor (hit 2) to shape behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Using a longitudinal design, we investigated the relationship between infant temperament, parental sensitivity, and later behavioral inhibition and anxiety in adolescence. Our results indicate that infant temperament and parental sensitivity interact to predict later behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Furthermore, we found that this interaction was mediated by the development of social anxiety symptoms in adolescence. The two-hit model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the developmental origins of behavioral inhibition and anxiety, highlighting the importance of early life experiences in shaping later mental health outcomes."}
