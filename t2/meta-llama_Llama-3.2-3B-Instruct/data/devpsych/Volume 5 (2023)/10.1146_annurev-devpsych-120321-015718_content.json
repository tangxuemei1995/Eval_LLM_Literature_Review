{"Abstract": "This study integrates research on cognitive mechanisms and socialization to examine how children learn and internalize racial attitudes and stereotypes. Drawing on theories of socialization and cognitive development, we investigate the role of ethnic-racial socialization in shaping children's racial learning. Our analysis of existing literature reveals that children's racial learning is influenced by both cognitive processes, such as schema formation and categorization, and socialization experiences, including interactions with family members and peers. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of racial socialization and its impact on children's racial attitudes and behaviors. The study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between cognitive mechanisms and socialization in the context of ethnic-racial socialization."}
