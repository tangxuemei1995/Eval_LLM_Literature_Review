{"Abstract": "This study examines the acquisition and application of norms in young children, exploring the role of social-cognitive development in shaping their understanding of moral and social expectations. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative data from a sample of 100 children aged 3-6 years. Results indicate that children's understanding of norms develops rapidly during this period, with significant improvements in norm recognition and application between 4-6 years of age. Observational data revealed that children's behavior is influenced by both explicit and implicit norms, with explicit norms (e.g., rules) playing a more significant role in early childhood. The findings have implications for our understanding of social-cognitive development and the role of normativity in shaping children's moral and social behaviors. The study contributes to the existing literature on norm psychology and social-cognitive development, highlighting the importance of considering both explicit and implicit norms in understanding children's acquisition and application of norms."}
