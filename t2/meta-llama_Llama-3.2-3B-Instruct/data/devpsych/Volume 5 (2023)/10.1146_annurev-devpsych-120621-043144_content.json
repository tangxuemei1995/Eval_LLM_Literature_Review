{"Abstract": "Depressed parents have been found to have a profound impact on the psychological and neurobiological development of their offspring. Research has consistently shown that children of depressed parents exhibit increased rates of anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems. The current status of offspring of depressed parents is characterized by unresolved issues, including difficulties in emotional regulation, social relationships, and academic performance. Recent studies have also highlighted the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of offspring of depressed parents, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. Despite the growing body of research, several unresolved issues remain, including the lack of longitudinal studies and the need for more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. Future directions for research should prioritize the development of evidence-based interventions and the exploration of novel neurobiological markers to inform prevention and treatment strategies for offspring of depressed parents."}
