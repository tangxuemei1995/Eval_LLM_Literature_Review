{"Abstract": "Cognitive flexibility, a critical component of executive function, refers to the ability to adapt to changing situations and switch between tasks. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have enabled researchers to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility in development. This review updates the current state of knowledge on the developmental trajectory of cognitive flexibility, from infancy to adolescence, and highlights the key brain regions and networks involved. Functional task-based fMRI studies have shown that cognitive flexibility is associated with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex. The findings suggest that cognitive flexibility develops in a step-wise manner, with significant improvements during childhood and adolescence. Future directions for research include the examination of individual differences in cognitive flexibility, the investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility in neurodevelopmental disorders, and the development of novel fMRI-based interventions to enhance cognitive flexibility in clinical populations."}
