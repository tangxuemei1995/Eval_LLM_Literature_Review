{"Abstract": "This study presents a rational account of cognitive control development in childhood, positing that competence in executive functions emerges through a process of maturation driven by the optimization of expected value. According to this framework, children's cognitive control abilities develop as they learn to weigh the potential costs and benefits of different actions, leading to the refinement of their decision-making processes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key milestones in cognitive control development, including the emergence of inhibitory control, working memory, and planning. Our rational account is grounded in the principles of expected value theory, which suggests that children's choices are influenced by the anticipated outcomes of their actions. By integrating insights from cognitive psychology, developmental neuroscience, and decision theory, this study provides a unified explanation for the development of cognitive control in childhood, highlighting the critical role of expected value in shaping children's competence in executive functions."}
