{"Abstract": "Prenatal substance exposure refers to the exposure of a fetus to substances such as tobacco smoke, illicit drugs, and alcohol during pregnancy. This exposure has been linked to various adverse developmental outcomes in children, including lower birth weight, impaired cognitive function, and increased risk of mental health disorders. Research has also shown that prenatal adversity, including substance exposure, can have long-lasting effects on brain development and function. Early adversity, such as prenatal substance exposure, can also have a profound impact on the development of stress response systems, leading to increased susceptibility to anxiety and depression in later life. Understanding the effects of prenatal substance exposure on developmental outcomes is crucial for developing effective interventions to support vulnerable populations, including pregnant women and their children."}
