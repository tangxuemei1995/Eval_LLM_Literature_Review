{"Abstract": "This study employs a developmental social neuroscience perspective to investigate the efficacy of early infant interventions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we examined the neural correlates of social interaction in infants with ASD and their typically developing peers. Our results indicate that infants with ASD exhibit altered neural activity in response to social stimuli, particularly in the fusiform gyrus and superior temporal sulcus. In contrast, typically developing infants demonstrate enhanced neural connectivity and synchronization in these regions. Following a 12-week intervention program, which focused on enhancing social interaction and communication skills, we observed significant improvements in neural activity and connectivity in infants with ASD. These findings suggest that early intervention can positively impact the developmental trajectory of infants with ASD, potentially mitigating the severity of symptoms and improving long-term outcomes. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the neural basis of autism and the potential benefits of early intervention."}
