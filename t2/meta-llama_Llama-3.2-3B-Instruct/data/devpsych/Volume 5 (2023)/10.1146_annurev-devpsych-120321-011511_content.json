{"Abstract": "This study adopts a neuroecosocial perspective to explore the intersections of adolescent development, mental health, and social inequalities in the context of urbanicity and the climate crisis. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, combining youth-led research methods and quantitative data analysis, the study investigates how adolescents navigate the complexities of growing up amidst environmental degradation and social injustices. The findings highlight the disproportionate impact of climate-related stressors on the mental health of urban adolescents from marginalized communities, exacerbating existing social inequalities. The study's results underscore the need for context-specific, youth-led interventions that address the interplay between neuroecological factors, social determinants, and climate change, ultimately promoting more equitable and sustainable adolescent development pathways."}
