{"Abstract": "The resolution of inflammation is a critical process that follows the resolution of acute inflammation, characterized by the clearance of inflammatory cells and the restoration of tissue homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (sPLMs) and annexin A1 peptides in this process. Annexin A1, a protein that regulates the inflammatory response, has been shown to induce the production of sPLMs, which in turn promote the resolution of inflammation. This review focuses on the role of annexin A1 and sPLMs, including lipoxins, protectins, and resolvins, in the resolution of inflammation. We discuss the therapeutic potential of these molecules, including their use in treating inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Our review highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms of action of annexin A1 and sPLMs, and their potential as novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory disorders."}
