{"Abstract": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases: No Longer Undruggable?Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases (MKPs) are a family of enzymes that regulate the activity of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), crucial components of cell signaling pathways. Traditionally considered undruggable due to their complex structures and high specificity, recent advances in structural biology and medicinal chemistry have opened new avenues for the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting MKPs. Dual specificity protein phosphatases (DUSPs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are also MKP family members that have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorders. The discovery of allosteric sites on MKPs has enabled the design of novel, non-competitive inhibitors that can modulate their activity. This review highlights the recent progress in MKP inhibition, with a focus on the design and optimization of small molecule inhibitors, and discusses the potential therapeutic applications of MKP-targeting therapies in various diseases. The development of MKP inhibitors has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cell signaling and disease mechanisms, and may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of complex diseases."}
