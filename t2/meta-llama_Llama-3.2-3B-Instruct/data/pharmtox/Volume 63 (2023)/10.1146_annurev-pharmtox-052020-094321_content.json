{"Abstract": "The 90-90-90 initiative, a key strategy for achieving universal access to HIV treatment, aims to diagnose 90% of all people living with HIV, treat 90% of those diagnosed, and retain 90% of those on treatment. However, significant barriers to reconstitution of antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This roadmap outlines a comprehensive approach to overcome these challenges and ensure universal access to effective ART. By leveraging existing infrastructure, improving diagnostic capacity, and enhancing treatment adherence, we can accelerate the reconstitution of ART and achieve the 90-90-90 targets. Our strategy emphasizes the importance of community engagement, provider training, and policy support, highlighting the need for sustained investment and collaboration to ensure equitable access to life-saving antiretroviral treatment for all."}
