{"Abstract": "Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac function and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure and arrhythmias. Overactivation of CaMKII has been linked to the development of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and electrical remodeling, ultimately contributing to the progression of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have identified CaMKII as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, with several kinase inhibitors and calcium channel blockers showing promise in preclinical models. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of CaMKII's role in cardiovascular disease and discuss the potential of targeting this kinase as a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of heart failure and arrhythmias."}
