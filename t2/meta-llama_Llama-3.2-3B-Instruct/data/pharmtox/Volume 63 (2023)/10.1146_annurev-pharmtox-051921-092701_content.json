{"Abstract": "The pharmacogenetics of antiplatelet therapy has emerged as a crucial aspect of precision medicine, enabling tailored treatment strategies for individuals with varying genetic profiles. This field focuses on the genetic determinants of platelet function and response to antiplatelet medications, particularly the CYP2C19 enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in metabolizing clopidogrel and prasugrel. Variants in the CYP2C19 gene have been identified as significant predictors of treatment response and adverse outcomes in patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy. Guided antiplatelet therapy, informed by pharmacogenomic testing, has been shown to improve clinical outcomes by reducing the risk of adverse events and enhancing efficacy. By integrating pharmacogenetics into clinical practice, healthcare providers can optimize antiplatelet therapy, minimize unnecessary treatment burden, and improve patient outcomes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the pharmacogenetic determinants of antiplatelet therapy and to translate these findings into clinical practice."}
