{"Abstract": "Age-related perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCDs) pose a significant risk to postoperative outcomes, particularly in elderly patients. Experimental models have demonstrated that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the development of PNCDs, characterized by cognitive impairment and delirium. This review highlights the current understanding of PNCDs, focusing on neuroinflammation and cognitive assessment. We discuss the potential druggable targets, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapies, that may mitigate the risk of PNCDs. Furthermore, we examine the importance of care pathways in preventing and managing PNCDs, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and multidisciplinary collaboration. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions, this review aims to inform the development of effective strategies for promoting perioperative brain health and reducing the burden of PNCDs."}
