{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has revolutionized the lead-to-candidate decision-making process in drug discovery, enabling the prediction of decision quality and the identification of optimal candidates. By leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms, AI-ML models can accurately forecast the efficacy and safety of potential drug candidates, reducing the reliance on traditional high-throughput screening methods. Furthermore, computational toxicology has been significantly enhanced through the application of AI-ML, allowing for the prediction of adverse effects and the identification of potential toxicities. This synergy between AI-ML and computational toxicology has the potential to accelerate the drug discovery process, improve decision quality, and ultimately lead to the development of safer and more effective medications. By harnessing the power of AI-ML, researchers can optimize the lead-to-candidate decision-making process and drive innovation in the field of drug discovery."}
