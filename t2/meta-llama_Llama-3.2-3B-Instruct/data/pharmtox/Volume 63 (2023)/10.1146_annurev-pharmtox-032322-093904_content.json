{"Abstract": "Obesity-related metabolic complications, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, pose a significant burden on global health. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic function. Recent studies have explored the therapeutic potential of FGF-based pharmacotherapies for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic complications. Agonistic antibodies targeting FGF receptors have shown promise in preclinical models, demonstrating improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Protein therapeutics based on FGFs have also been developed, offering a novel approach to modulate metabolic function. This review aims to summarize the current state of FGF-based pharmacotherapies for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic complications, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges of these novel therapies. The development of FGF-based treatments holds promise for the management of metabolic disorders, and further research is needed to translate these findings into clinical practice."}
