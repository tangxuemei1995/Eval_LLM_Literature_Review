{"Abstract": "This review delves into the intricate world of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid chemistry and pharmacology, tracing the evolutionary journey of these compounds from their discovery to their current understanding. The endocannabinoid system, comprising anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), plays a pivotal role in maintaining physiological homeostasis. The introduction of synthetic cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), has expanded our knowledge of the system's complexity. Recent studies have also shed light on the existence of endocannabinoid-like compounds, which exhibit similar pharmacological properties to their endogenous counterparts. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid research, highlighting the significance of these compounds in various physiological processes and their potential therapeutic applications. By exploring the intersection of chemistry, pharmacology, and biology, this review seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the endocannabinoid system and its role in maintaining human health."}
