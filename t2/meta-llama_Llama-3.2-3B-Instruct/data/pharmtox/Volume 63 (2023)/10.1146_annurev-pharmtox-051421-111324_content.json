{"Abstract": "The integration of electronic health records (EHRs) and genomics has revolutionized the field of drug discovery, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets and personalized treatment approaches. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenotype-wide association studies (PheWAS) have revealed associations between genetic variants and complex diseases, providing a wealth of information on potential drug targets. Mendelian randomization, a technique utilizing genetic variants as instrumental variables, has been employed to establish causal relationships between genetic factors and disease phenotypes. By leveraging EHRs, researchers can collect and analyze large-scale genomic data, facilitating the discovery of genetic biomarkers and drug targets. This synergy between EHRs and genomics has the potential to accelerate the development of precision medicine and improve treatment outcomes for patients with complex diseases."}
