{"Abstract": "This study investigates the pharmacological induction of granulocyte cell death as a novel therapeutic strategy for various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Granulocytes, comprising neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, play a crucial role in immune responses, but their dysregulation can lead to tissue damage and disease progression. We review the current literature on the mechanisms of granulocyte apoptosis and the potential therapeutic applications of pharmacological inducers of granulocyte cell death. Our analysis reveals that targeting granulocytes with specific pharmacological agents may offer a promising approach for treating conditions characterized by excessive granulocyte activation, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and autoimmune disorders. The induction of granulocyte apoptosis may also provide a novel strategy for preventing graft rejection and reducing inflammation in surgical settings. Further research is needed to fully explore the therapeutic potential of granulocyte apoptosis induction and to identify safe and effective pharmacological agents for this purpose."}
