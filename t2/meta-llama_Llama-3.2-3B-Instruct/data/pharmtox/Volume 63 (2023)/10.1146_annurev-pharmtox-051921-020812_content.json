{"Abstract": "Exposure to air pollution, particularly ultrafine particles and PM2.5, has been linked to various neurotoxic effects across the life span. Research has shown that early life exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ADHD and autism. Long-term exposure has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Air pollution-induced brain metal dyshomeostasis, characterized by disruptions in metal ion homeostasis, is thought to contribute to these neurotoxic effects. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the relationship between air pollution and neurotoxicity, highlighting the need for further research on the mechanisms underlying these effects."}
