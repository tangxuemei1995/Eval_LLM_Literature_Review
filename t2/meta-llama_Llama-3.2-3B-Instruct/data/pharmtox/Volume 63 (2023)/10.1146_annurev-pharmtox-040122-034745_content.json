{"Abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, particularly cGMP-specific PDE5 inhibitors, have been widely recognized for their efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction (ED). However, emerging evidence suggests that these compounds may also possess therapeutic potential for other clinical disorders. The endothelial dysfunction associated with ED is closely linked to impaired nitric oxide (NO) signaling, which is also relevant to cardioprotection and metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that cGMP-Specific PDE5 inhibitors can exert cardioprotective effects by enhancing NO-mediated vasodilation and reducing inflammation. Furthermore, these compounds have been investigated for their anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer properties, with potential applications in the treatment of various cancers. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the therapeutic potential of cGMP-Specific PDE5 inhibitors beyond ED, with a focus on endothelial dysfunction, cardioprotection, metabolic disorders, aging, and cancer."}
