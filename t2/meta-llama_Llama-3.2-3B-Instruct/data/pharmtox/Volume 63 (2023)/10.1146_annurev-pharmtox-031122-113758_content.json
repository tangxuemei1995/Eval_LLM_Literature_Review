{"Abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids, also known as designer drugs or Spice, have gained significant attention in recent years due to their increasing prevalence and associated health risks. These novel psychoactive substances (NPS) mimic the effects of the endocannabinoid system, but with unpredictable and often severe pharmacological and toxicological profiles. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological mechanisms and toxicological effects of synthetic cannabinoids, highlighting their potential for abuse and dependence. The literature reveals that these substances can cause a range of adverse effects, including psychosis, seizures, and cardiovascular instability. Furthermore, the lack of regulation and quality control in the production of synthetic cannabinoids has led to a proliferation of contaminated products, exacerbating substance use disorders. This review aims to provide a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge on synthetic cannabinoids, informing evidence-based strategies for prevention, treatment, and policy development."}
