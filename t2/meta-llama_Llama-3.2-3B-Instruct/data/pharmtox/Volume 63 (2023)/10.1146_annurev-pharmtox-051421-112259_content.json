{"Abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a complex and debilitating condition characterized by damage to the nervous system, resulting in chronic pain that is often resistant to conventional treatments. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of immune cells in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain, with evidence suggesting that immune-mediated mechanisms contribute to the sex differences observed in this condition. In contrast, sex similarities in neuropathic pain have been observed in terms of the underlying neuronal mechanisms, including the activation of nociceptors and the release of pain-promoting neurotransmitters. The identification of specific immune cell subsets and their interactions with neurons has opened up new avenues for the development of targeted therapies for neuropathic pain. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of neuropathic pain mechanisms, sex differences, and potential therapies, with a focus on the role of immune cells and neurons in this complex condition."}
