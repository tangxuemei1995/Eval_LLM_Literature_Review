{"Abstract": "The chemical exposome refers to the aggregate of chemicals to which an individual is exposed throughout their lifetime, influencing health outcomes. During fetal development and early childhood, exposure to chemicals can have profound effects on growth, development, and long-term health. This review synthesizes existing literature on the chemical exposome during critical periods of development, focusing on prenatal exposure and early childhood. Xenobiotics and natural contaminants, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and endocrine disruptors, are identified as key contributors to the chemical exposome. The placenta plays a crucial role in mediating prenatal exposure, with evidence suggesting that maternal exposure to certain chemicals can alter fetal development and programming. Early childhood exposure to chemicals has also been linked to adverse health outcomes, including neurodevelopmental and respiratory problems. Understanding the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood is essential for informing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of chemical exposure and promote healthy development."}
