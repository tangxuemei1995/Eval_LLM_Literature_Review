{"Abstract": "G Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor GPER plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune functions. This receptor is activated by estrogen and mediates rapid signaling events, influencing cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular pharmacology of GPER, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for various diseases. In the context of cancer, GPER has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, while in cardiovascular diseases, it may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Conversely, GPER activation has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Moreover, its role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent for metabolic disorders. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of GPER's molecular pharmacology and its therapeutic applications, with a focus on its implications for cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases."}
