{"Abstract": "Biased agonism at opioid receptors has emerged as a critical mechanism underlying the development of therapeutic and adverse effects associated with opioid medications. Studies have elucidated the complex interplay between opioid receptor G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and β-arrestin-mediated desensitization. Ligand bias, where specific agonists preferentially activate one G protein over another, has been implicated in the modulation of opioid receptor function. This review synthesizes recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying biased agonism at opioid receptors, with a focus on the role of β-arrestin in regulating receptor desensitization and internalization. The implications of biased agonism for the design of novel therapeutic agents and the prevention of opioid-related addiction are also discussed. Overall, this review highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of opioid receptor function and the development of targeted therapies to mitigate the risks associated with opioid use."}
