{"Abstract": "Kir6.2 and Kir6.1 subunits, encoded by the ABCC8 and KCNJ2 genes, respectively, form the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel, a critical regulator of insulin secretion. Mutations in these genes have been implicated in various KATP-dependent pathologies, including congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant√∫ syndrome. Recent advances in genetic analysis and gene editing technologies have enabled the development of personalized therapeutics for these disorders. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of KATP channel function and dysfunction, and discuss the potential of targeted therapies, including gene therapy and small molecule modulators, for the treatment of KATP-dependent pathologies. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders, we can develop effective and tailored interventions to improve patient outcomes."}
