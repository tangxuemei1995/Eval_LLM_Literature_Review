{"Abstract": "Zebrafish have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional mammalian models in in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology. Their transparent nature, rapid breeding, and genetic tractability enable high-throughput screening and efficient testing of compounds. This study investigates the scalability of zebrafish as a mainstream model for in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology. We demonstrate the feasibility of using zebrafish to model human diseases and predict compound efficacy and toxicity. Our results show that zebrafish can accurately recapitulate human disease mechanisms and respond to therapeutic interventions. The use of zebrafish in in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional models, enabling the rapid identification of lead compounds and the optimization of drug development pipelines. These findings support the integration of zebrafish into mainstream in vivo systems pharmacology and toxicology."}
