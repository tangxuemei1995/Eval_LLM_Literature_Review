{"Abstract": "Lipoxins, naturally occurring anti-inflammatory mediators, have been recognized for their potent role in resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair. Recent studies have focused on the development of lipoxin mimetics, synthetic compounds designed to replicate the biological activities of lipoxins. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of lipoxin mimetics, particularly AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT, in resolving inflammation and mitigating fibrosis. By modulating the inflammatory response and promoting the resolution of inflammation, lipoxin mimetics have shown promise in treating various inflammatory diseases, including asthma, arthritis, and cardiovascular disorders. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of action and optimize the therapeutic potential of these compounds, but the existing evidence suggests that lipoxin mimetics may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases."}
