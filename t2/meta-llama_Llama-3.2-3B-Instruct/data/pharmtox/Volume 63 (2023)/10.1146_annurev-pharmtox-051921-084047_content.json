{"Abstract": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, have emerged as key players in the resolution phase of inflammation, exhibiting potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activities. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of SPMs as resolution pharmacology for the control of pain and itch, two complex and multifaceted disorders. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly EPA and DHA, are precursors to SPMs and have been shown to modulate nociceptive sensory neurons, reducing pain and itch perception. TRP channels, involved in pain and itch sensation, are also targeted by SPMs, further supporting their therapeutic potential. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of SPMs in pain and itch resolution, with a focus on their mechanisms of action, neuroimmune modulation, and potential therapeutic applications. The integration of SPMs into pain and itch management strategies may offer novel and effective approaches to treating these debilitating conditions."}
