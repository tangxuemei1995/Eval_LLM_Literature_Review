{"Abstract": "Leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes play a crucial role in the production of leukotrienes, which are potent pro-inflammatory mediators involved in various endemic diseases. The structures of these enzymes have been elucidated, revealing key binding sites for arachidonic acid and other substrates. Structure-based drug design approaches have been employed to develop novel therapeutics targeting these enzymes. Our research focuses on the design and optimization of small molecule inhibitors, with a particular emphasis on the leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzymes. By modulating the activity of these enzymes, we aim to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms associated with diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. The development of effective therapeutics against leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes holds significant promise for the treatment of inflammatory disorders."}
