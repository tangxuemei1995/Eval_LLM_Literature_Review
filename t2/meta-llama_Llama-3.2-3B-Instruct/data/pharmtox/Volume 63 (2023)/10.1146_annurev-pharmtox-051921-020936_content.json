{"Abstract": "Arsenic metabolism is a complex process involving the transformation of inorganic arsenic into its more toxic and less soluble forms, which can lead to severe health consequences. The duality of arsenic metabolism is characterized by the interplay between methylation and demethylation reactions, with methylation being the primary detoxification pathway. However, aberrant methylation patterns can result in the formation of highly toxic methylated arsenic species, such as monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid. This review highlights the impact of arsenic metabolism on human health, with a focus on the role of speciation and the consequences of disrupted detoxification mechanisms. Understanding the intricacies of arsenic metabolism is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate arsenic-induced toxicity and promote human health."}
