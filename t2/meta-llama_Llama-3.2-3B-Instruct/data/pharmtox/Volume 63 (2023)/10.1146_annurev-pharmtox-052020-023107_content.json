{"Abstract": "Aspirin, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has been extensively studied for its potential role in cancer chemoprevention. The underlying mechanism involves the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are responsible for the production of thromboxane A2, a prothrombotic agent, and prostacyclin, a vasodilatory agent. Prostaglandin synthesis is also affected, with reduced levels of certain prostaglandins that promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that aspirin's chemopreventive effects may be attributed to its ability to modulate the COX-2/COX-1 ratio, leading to decreased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, a known promoter of cancer cell proliferation. Recent studies have also highlighted the potential of aspirin to target specific cancer stem cells and inhibit metastasis. While the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, the available data support the notion that aspirin may be a valuable adjunct in cancer prevention and treatment, warranting further investigation into its therapeutic potential."}
