{"Abstract": "Lysosomal ion channels, including transient receptor potential melastatin-like channels (TRPMs) and transient receptor potential channel modulator-like channels (TPCs), play a crucial role in regulating lysosomal function and membrane potential. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of these channels in various physiological processes, including calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. However, dysregulation of lysosomal ion channels has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. The identification of specific lysosomal ion channels, such as TMEM175, as potential therapeutic targets has sparked interest in their druggability. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of lysosomal ion channels, their functions, and their involvement in neurodegeneration. We discuss the potential of these channels as druggable targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the need for further research to fully elucidate their role in human health and disease."}
