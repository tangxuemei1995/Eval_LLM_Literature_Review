{"Abstract": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their potential benefits on cardiovascular health. The consumption of LC-PUFAs, commonly found in fish oil supplements, has been associated with reduced risk of heart disease, improved lipid profiles, and decreased inflammation. However, the evidence also suggests potential drawbacks, including increased risk of bleeding, interactions with anticoagulant medications, and adverse effects on fetal development during pregnancy. Furthermore, the variability in EPA and DHA content among different fish oil products and the lack of standardization in dosing regimens have raised concerns about the efficacy and safety of LC-PUFA supplements. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the pros and cons of LC-PUFAs in cardiovascular health, highlighting the need for further research to establish optimal dosing and supplementation guidelines."}
