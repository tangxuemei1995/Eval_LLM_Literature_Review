{"Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, which significantly affects an individual's quality of life and functional outcomes. Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is associated with alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission, particularly in the NMDA receptor system, which plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and learning. Mismatch negativity, a neurophysiological marker of cognitive processing, is often impaired in individuals with schizophrenia. The dopamine system, which is often targeted in antipsychotic treatment, also contributes to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Recent studies have investigated the relationship between glutamate, NMDA receptor, and dopamine systems in the context of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, with a focus on the role of glutamate, NMDA receptor, and dopamine systems. The findings of this review have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve cognitive function in individuals with schizophrenia."}
