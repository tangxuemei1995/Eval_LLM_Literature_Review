{"Abstract": "Tensor network algorithms have revolutionized the field of computational physics by providing a powerful framework for simulating complex quantum many-body systems. By leveraging the principles of entanglement and non-local correlations, these methods enable the efficient computation of ground states and excited states of quantum systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of tensor network algorithms, highlighting their applications in numerical simulations of quantum many-body systems. We discuss the various types of tensor networks, including matrix product states, projected entangled pair states, and tensor train approximations. The advantages and limitations of each approach are examined, and future directions for research are outlined."}
