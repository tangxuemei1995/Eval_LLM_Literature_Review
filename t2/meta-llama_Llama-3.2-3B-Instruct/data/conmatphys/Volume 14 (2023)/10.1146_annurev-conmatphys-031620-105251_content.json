{"Abstract": "The measurement of energetic costs in cell biology is crucial for understanding the intricate dynamics of metabolic pathways. This review focuses on dissecting flux balances to quantify the energetic costs associated with various cellular processes. We discuss the theoretical frameworks and experimental techniques employed to measure metabolic fluxes, including isotopic labeling, flux analysis, and computational modeling. However, we also highlight the challenges and limitations of these approaches, such as the accuracy of flux measurements, the influence of experimental conditions, and the complexity of metabolic networks. By addressing these challenges, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the energetic costs of cellular processes and their implications for cellular function and disease."}
