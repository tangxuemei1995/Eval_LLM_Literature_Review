{"Abstract": "We investigate the interplay between superconductivity and local inversion-symmetry breaking in unconventional superconductors, with a focus on topological superconductivity. By incorporating Rashba spin-orbit coupling and hidden spin polarization, we demonstrate that local inversion-symmetry breaking can give rise to topological superconducting phases. Our calculations reveal that the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling can induce a non-trivial topological invariant, leading to the formation of a topological superconducting gap. Furthermore, we show that hidden spin polarization can further enhance the topological protection of the superconducting state. Our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between local inversion-symmetry breaking and topological superconductivity in unconventional superconductors, and have implications for the design of topological superconducting materials and devices. Theoretical models and numerical simulations are presented to support our findings, and we discuss the potential experimental signatures of our predictions."}
