{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of odd viscosity and odd elasticity in the context of nonequilibrium fluid dynamics. By leveraging the principles of continuum mechanics and active matter theory, we investigate the emergence of non-trivial rheological behavior in systems exhibiting odd symmetry. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between odd viscosity and odd elasticity gives rise to novel hydrodynamic phenomena, including the formation of topological defects and the generation of non-zero net fluxes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of complex fluid behavior and the development of novel materials with tailored rheological properties. The results of this study contribute to the growing field of nonequilibrium hydrodynamics and its applications in active matter systems."}
