{"Abstract": "Random quantum circuits have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to exhibit nonequilibrium dynamics and quantum chaos. By introducing randomness into quantum circuits, researchers can study the emergence of entanglement and its behavior under nonequilibrium conditions. This abstract reviews the current state of research on random quantum circuits, focusing on their ability to simulate complex quantum systems and the role of quantum measurements in inducing nonequilibrium dynamics. Theoretical models and numerical simulations have shown that random quantum circuits can exhibit chaotic behavior, including the presence of entanglement and quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, the study of random quantum circuits has implications for the development of quantum simulators, which can be used to study the behavior of complex quantum systems in a controlled and efficient manner. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research on random quantum circuits and their potential applications in quantum information science."}
