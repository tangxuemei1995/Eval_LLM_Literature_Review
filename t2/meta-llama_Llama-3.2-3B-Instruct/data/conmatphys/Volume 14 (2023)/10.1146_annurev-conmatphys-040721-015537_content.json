{"Abstract": "Floquet states in open quantum systems exhibit non-equilibrium behavior, where the periodic driving of a quantum system leads to the emergence of novel states of matter. In the context of nonequilibrium statistical physics, Floquet systems have been shown to display rich phase transitions and critical phenomena. This review article provides an overview of the current understanding of Floquet states in open quantum systems, with a focus on nonequilibrium statistical physics. We discuss the theoretical frameworks that describe Floquet systems, including the Floquet-Bloch theorem and the Floquet-Bogoliubov approximation. We also review recent experimental and numerical studies that have investigated the properties of Floquet states in various systems, including superconductors, superfluids, and ultracold atomic gases. Our analysis highlights the potential of Floquet states to exhibit novel nonequilibrium behavior, with implications for our understanding of quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena."}
