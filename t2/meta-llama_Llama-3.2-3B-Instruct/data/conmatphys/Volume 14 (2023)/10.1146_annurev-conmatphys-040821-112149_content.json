{"Abstract": "The study of swimming in complex fluids has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its relevance to various biological and engineering applications. This review focuses on the locomotion of active particles and cells in soft matter systems, including active suspensions and biological fluids. The interplay between particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions is crucial in determining the collective behavior of these systems. We discuss the theoretical frameworks and numerical simulations that have been employed to model the swimming dynamics of active particles and cells in complex fluids. The findings of these studies have important implications for our understanding of biological systems and the development of novel soft matter technologies."}
