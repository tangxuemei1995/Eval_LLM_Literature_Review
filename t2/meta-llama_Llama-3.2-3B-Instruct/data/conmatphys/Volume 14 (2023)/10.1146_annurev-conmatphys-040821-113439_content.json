{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of learning without neurons in physical systems, leveraging advances in metamaterials and molecular computing to create novel, self-assembly-based learning architectures. By designing inverse-structured physical systems, we demonstrate the ability of physical components to adapt and learn from environmental stimuli, mimicking the principles of machine learning. Our approach utilizes self-assembly mechanisms to reconfigure physical structures in response to input signals, effectively encoding and processing information. Theoretical models and simulations reveal the potential for physical systems to learn and improve their performance over time, without the need for traditional neural networks. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields such as robotics, materials science, and artificial intelligence. By bridging the gap between physical and computational learning, we open a new frontier in the study of learning theory and its application in physical systems."}
