{"Abstract": "The spin Seebeck effect is a thermoelectric phenomenon that enables the conversion of spin currents into electric signals, offering a sensitive probe for investigating elementary excitations, spin correlations, and transport properties in solids. By exploiting the inverse spin Hall effect, this effect can be harnessed to detect antiferromagnetic spintronics and magnon-mediated phenomena. The spin Seebeck effect also provides a unique platform for probing nuclear spin dynamics and quantum spin liquids. Recent advances in spintronics have led to the development of spin-caloritronic devices, which can be used to investigate magnetic order and domain structures in solids. This review provides an overview of the spin Seebeck effect, its underlying mechanisms, and its applications in spintronics, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for studying the intricate relationships between spin, magnetism, and transport in solids."}
