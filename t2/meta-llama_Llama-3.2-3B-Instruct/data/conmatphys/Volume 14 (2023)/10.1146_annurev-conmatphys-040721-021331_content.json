{"Abstract": "Topological metals have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique combination of topological and metallic properties. These materials exhibit a Fermi surface that is topologically non-trivial, resulting in the presence of a Berry phase that is not quantized in the conventional sense. Instead, the Berry phase is a continuous function of the geometry and topology of the material. This leads to the emergence of quantum oscillations that are distinct from those observed in conventional metals. The magnetic breakdown phenomenon, where the Fermi surface is disrupted by the presence of a magnetic field, is also a characteristic feature of topological metals. In Dirac-Weyl semimetals, the interplay between the Dirac and Weyl points gives rise to a complex interplay between the Fermi surface and the topological properties. The geometry and topology of these materials play a crucial role in determining their electronic properties, and a deeper understanding of these relationships is essential for the development of new materials with unique properties. This review provides an overview of the current state of research in the field of fermiology of topological metals, with a focus on the interplay between the Fermi surface, Berry phase, and geometry and topology. The review highlights the key features and characteristics of these materials, and discusses the potential applications and implications of this research."}
