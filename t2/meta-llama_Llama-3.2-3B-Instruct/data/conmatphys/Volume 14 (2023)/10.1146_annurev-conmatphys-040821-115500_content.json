{"Abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive review of numerical modeling approaches for active colloids, encompassing active Brownian particles, hydrodynamic, and chemical fields. We examine the interplay between microswimmers and their complex environments, including hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering active baths and active engines in modeling the behavior of active colloids. We discuss various numerical methods, including particle-based simulations and continuum models, and their applications in simulating active colloids in different scenarios. The results demonstrate the potential of numerical modeling to predict the behavior of active colloids in complex environments, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms and providing insights for future experimental and theoretical investigations. The findings have implications for the design and optimization of microswimmer-based systems and the understanding of complex phenomena in soft matter and biological systems."}
