{"Abstract": "The spatial and temporal organization of chromatin is crucial for regulating gene expression and maintaining genome stability. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying chromatin organization at small scales, including the role of nucleosomes and histone modifications. However, the organization of chromatin at larger scales, including the formation of chromatin loops and domains, remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is addressed through the application of advanced imaging and computational techniques, revealing the dynamic interplay between epigenetic marks, chromatin structure, and loop extrusion. Our findings provide new insights into the spatial and temporal organization of chromatin, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying genome organization and function."}
