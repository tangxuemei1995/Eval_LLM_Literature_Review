{"Abstract": "Non-Hermitian topological phenomena have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize our understanding of topological phases and their interplay with non-Hermitian physics. This review provides an in-depth examination of the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting the emergence of topological phases and their characteristic properties. We discuss the role of spectral theory in understanding the non-Hermitian nature of these systems, including the concept of non-Hermitian symmetry and its implications for topological invariants. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between non-Hermitian topological phenomena and other areas of physics, such as quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. By synthesizing existing knowledge, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of non-Hermitian topological phenomena and their far-reaching implications for our understanding of the underlying physics."}
