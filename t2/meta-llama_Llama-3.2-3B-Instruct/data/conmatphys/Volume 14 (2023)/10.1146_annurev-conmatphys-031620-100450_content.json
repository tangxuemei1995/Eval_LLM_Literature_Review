{"Abstract": "This study investigates the physics of human crowds through the lens of active matter and social physics. Observational experiments reveal emergent phenomena in pedestrian flows, including self-organization and phase transitions. Analyzing crowd behavior, we identify key factors influencing collective motion, such as density, velocity, and social interactions. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of human crowd dynamics, shedding light on the intricate relationships between individual behavior and collective emergent properties."}
