{"Abstract": "The quest for efficient and sustainable photocatalytic energy conversion has led to a surge in research on novel materials with enhanced photocatalytic activity. This study employs a data-driven approach to identify robust materials for photocatalytic energy conversion, focusing on aqueous stability and renewable energy applications. A comprehensive literature review and machine learning analysis of existing data on photocatalytic materials were conducted to identify key factors influencing their performance. The results reveal a set of material properties, including bandgap energy, surface area, and hydrophilicity, that are critical for achieving high photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the data-driven discovery framework was used to predict the photocatalytic performance of novel materials, highlighting the potential of certain metal-organic frameworks and transition metal oxides. The findings of this study provide a foundation for the design and synthesis of novel photocatalytic materials with improved aqueous stability and renewable energy conversion efficiency, paving the way for the development of sustainable energy solutions."}
