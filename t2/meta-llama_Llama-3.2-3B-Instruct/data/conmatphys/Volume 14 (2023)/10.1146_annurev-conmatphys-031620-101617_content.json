{"Abstract": "Quantum many-body scars refer to a class of systems that exhibit long-lived, non-thermal eigenstates despite being in a chaotic, out-of-equilibrium environment. From a quasiparticle perspective, these scars arise from the formation of robust, non-degenerate quasiparticle modes that persist even in the presence of strong interactions and disorder. This phenomenon is characterized by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, where the system's eigenstates thermalize to a common temperature, but the quasiparticle modes remain coherent. Our research explores the constrained dynamics of these systems, revealing the interplay between quantum chaos and the emergence of scars. By analyzing the quasiparticle dynamics and eigenstate properties, we provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the formation of quantum many-body scars."}
