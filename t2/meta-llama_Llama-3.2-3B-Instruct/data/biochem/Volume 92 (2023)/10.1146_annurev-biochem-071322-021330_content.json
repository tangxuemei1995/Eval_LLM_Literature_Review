{"Abstract": "Polyamines play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein in neurons. While polyamines can exhibit neurotoxic effects by disrupting mitochondrial function and inducing oxidative stress, they also possess neuroprotective properties by modulating astrocyte activity and regulating lysosomal endo/lysosomal dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between polyamines and α-synuclein, suggesting that polyamines may influence the formation and aggregation of α-synuclein. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of polyamines in PD, focusing on their role in balancing neurotoxicity and neuroprotection, and exploring potential therapeutic strategies that target polyamine metabolism to mitigate PD progression. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying polyamine-mediated neuroprotection, this review seeks to provide a framework for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for PD treatment."}
