{"Abstract": "The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes play a crucial role in genome organization by facilitating the looping of chromatin domains. Recent advances in single-molecule studies have provided insights into the mechanisms of DNA loop extrusion, a process mediated by SMC complexes. These studies have revealed that SMC complexes can form dynamic loops that connect distant chromatin regions, influencing gene expression and genome stability. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA loop extrusion is essential for elucidating the functional roles of SMC complexes in genome organization and its implications for human disease. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on SMC complexes and DNA loop extrusion, highlighting recent findings and future directions."}
