{"Abstract": "The development of base editors has revolutionized the field of genome editing, enabling precise and efficient modifications to DNA sequences. By harnessing the catalytic capabilities of deaminases, methyltransferases, and demethylases, base editors can introduce specific base substitutions, modifications, or removals at targeted locations within the genome. Recent advances in protein engineering have facilitated the design and optimization of base editors, allowing for improved specificity, efficiency, and scalability. This review provides an overview of the design principles and applications of base editors, highlighting their potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and advancing synthetic biology. The integration of base editors with other genome editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, has also been explored, enabling the creation of hybrid systems with enhanced capabilities. The future of base editors holds great promise for transforming the field of genome editing and beyond."}
