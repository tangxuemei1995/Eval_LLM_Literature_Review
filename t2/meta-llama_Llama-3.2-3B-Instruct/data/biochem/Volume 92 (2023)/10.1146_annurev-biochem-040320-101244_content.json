{"Abstract": "Rubisco, a crucial enzyme in the Calvin cycle, plays a pivotal role in carbon fixation and oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere. This enzyme, responsible for the fixation of CO2 into organic compounds, has been the subject of extensive research on its function, evolution, and engineering. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate mechanisms underlying rubisco's catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of its unique active site and allosteric regulation. The evolution of rubisco has been shaped by its ability to adapt to diverse environments, with various species exhibiting distinct substrate specificities and kinetic properties. In response to the increasing demand for sustainable bioenergy and agriculture, rubisco engineering has emerged as a promising strategy for improving crop yields and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By harnessing the power of enzyme engineering, researchers are developing novel rubisco variants with enhanced activity, stability, and specificity, paving the way for the development of more efficient carbon fixation pathways and a more sustainable future."}
