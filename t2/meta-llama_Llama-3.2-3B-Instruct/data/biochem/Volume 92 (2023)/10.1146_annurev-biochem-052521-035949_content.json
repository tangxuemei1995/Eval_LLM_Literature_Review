{"Abstract": "The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) by RNA modifications is a crucial aspect of posttranscriptional control, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of RNA modifications, such as 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), and N6-methyladenosine (N6-meA), in modulating mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and localization. The epitranscriptome, the complete set of RNA modifications, has been shown to play a key role in regulating mRNA metabolism, interacting with various RNA-binding proteins and influencing the expression of key genes. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of mRNA regulation by RNA modifications, highlighting the complex interplay between these modifications and the epitranscriptome in regulating gene expression."}
