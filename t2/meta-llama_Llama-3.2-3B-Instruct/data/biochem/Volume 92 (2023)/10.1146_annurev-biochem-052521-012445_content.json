{"Abstract": "Eukaryotic mRNA 3′-end processing is a complex and highly regulated process that plays a crucial role in gene expression. The process involves the removal of introns, ligation of exons, and addition of a poly(A) tail, which is mediated by a multi-protein complex known as the polyadenylation machinery. This machinery consists of several endonucleases, including the cleavage factor I (CFI) and the cleavage factor II (CFII), which work in conjunction with the polyadenylation factor (PAP) to generate the poly(A) tail. The regulation of pre-mRNA processing is tightly controlled by a network of transcription factors, splicing factors, and post-transcriptional regulators, which modulate the activity of the polyadenylation machinery. The impact of 3′-end processing on gene expression is significant, as it influences mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and subcellular localization. Dysregulation of pre-mRNA processing has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process."}
