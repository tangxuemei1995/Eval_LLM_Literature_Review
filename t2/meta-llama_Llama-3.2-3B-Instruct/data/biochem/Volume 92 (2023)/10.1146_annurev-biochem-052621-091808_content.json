{"Abstract": "Translation and mRNA stability control are intricately linked processes that govern protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of codon optimality in ensuring efficient translation elongation, while also influencing mRNA stability. The interaction between codon usage and tRNA availability plays a crucial role in regulating translation rates. Furthermore, the degradation of mRNA through various mechanisms, including nonsense-mediated decay and microRNA-mediated regulation, can impact protein synthesis. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of the interplay between codon optimality, tRNA, translation elongation, mRNA decay, codon usage, and mRNA stability. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes and their implications for protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, and disease. By elucidating the complex relationships between these factors, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the regulation of translation and mRNA stability."}
