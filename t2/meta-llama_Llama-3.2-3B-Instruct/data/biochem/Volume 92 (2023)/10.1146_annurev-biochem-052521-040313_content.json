{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between cholesterol and hedgehog signaling has been elucidated through a comprehensive analysis of primary cilium biology and cell surface receptor interactions. Cholesterol plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including those involved in hedgehog signaling. The presence of cholesterol in biological membranes influences the conformation and function of these receptors, thereby affecting the downstream signaling cascades. This study highlights the critical involvement of cholesterol in regulating hedgehog signaling, with implications for our understanding of primary cilium function and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with hedgehog signaling dysregulation."}
