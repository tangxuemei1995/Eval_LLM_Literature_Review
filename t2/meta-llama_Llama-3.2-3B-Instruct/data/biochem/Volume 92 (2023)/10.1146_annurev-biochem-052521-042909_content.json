{"Abstract": "Muscle contraction is a complex process involving the coordinated interaction of multiple proteins, including actin and myosin filaments, and regulatory molecules such as troponin and ryanodine receptor. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have enabled the high-resolution structural characterization of muscle contraction. Cryo-EM studies have revealed the detailed architecture of the actin-myosin complex, including the binding sites for myosin heads and the regulation of muscle contraction by troponin and tropomyosin. Cryo-ET has provided insights into the ultrastructure of muscle fibers, including the organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the distribution of ryanodine receptors. These structural studies have significant implications for our understanding of muscle physiology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for muscle-related diseases. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle contraction and to translate these findings into clinical applications."}
