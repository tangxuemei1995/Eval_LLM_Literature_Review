{"Abstract": "The radical SAM enzyme superfamily is a diverse group of enzymes that utilize S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a cofactor to catalyze a wide range of reactions, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and the synthesis of complex biomolecules. A key mechanism underlying the enzymatic activity of these enzymes is the formation of a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is generated through the cleavage of SAM. This radical is then transferred to a substrate, facilitating the reaction. Recent studies have elucidated the organometallic mechanism of radical SAM enzyme catalysis, revealing a complex interplay between the metal cofactor, the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, and the substrate. Understanding the mechanism of radical initiation in these enzymes is crucial for elucidating their biological functions and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the mechanism of radical initiation in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily, highlighting the key steps and players involved in this process."}
