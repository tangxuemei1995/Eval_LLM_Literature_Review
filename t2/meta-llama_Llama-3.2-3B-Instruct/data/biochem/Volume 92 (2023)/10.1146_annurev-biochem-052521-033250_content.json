{"Abstract": "The insulin receptor plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis, and its activation mechanism is a complex process involving multiple steps. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structural characterization of the insulin receptor in its active state. This study provides a detailed structural perspective on the activation mechanism of the insulin receptor, focusing on the insulin-binding sites. The insulin-binding site 1 (IBS1) and insulin-binding site 2 (IBS2) are critical regions for insulin binding and signaling. Cryo-EM structures reveal the conformational changes that occur upon insulin binding, including the rearrangement of IBS1 and IBS2. The study highlights the importance of IBS1 and IBS2 in mediating insulin-induced receptor activation, and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin signaling. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diabetes and insulin resistance."}
