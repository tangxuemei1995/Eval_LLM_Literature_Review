{"Abstract": "Thiolase, a biocatalyst utilizing coenzyme A-thioester chemistry, plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation and cleavage of C-C bonds. This enzyme's unique mechanism involves the creation of an oxyanion hole, a proton wire, and a hydrogen-bond network, which synergistically enhance its catalytic activity. By leveraging these structural features, thiolase enables the efficient execution of Claisen condensation reactions, a type of C-C bond-forming process. Furthermore, the enzyme's ability to facilitate the breaking of C-C bonds is attributed to its capacity to form a thioester intermediate, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to release the desired product. The intricate interplay between coenzyme A, the oxyanion hole, and the hydrogen-bond network underscores the remarkable versatility of thiolase as a biocatalyst, with far-reaching implications for the development of novel biochemical pathways and synthetic organic chemistry applications."}
