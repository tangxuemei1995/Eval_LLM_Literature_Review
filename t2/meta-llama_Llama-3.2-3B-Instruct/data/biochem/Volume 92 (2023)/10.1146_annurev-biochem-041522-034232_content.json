{"Abstract": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a crucial DNA repair pathway that coordinates transcription and repair processes to maintain genome stability. The molecular mechanisms underlying TCR involve the interaction between the transcription-repair coupling factor (Mfd) and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the chromatin remodeling factor CSB in regulating TCR activity. Mutagenesis studies have also revealed that TCR plays a key role in maintaining genome integrity in response to UV-induced damage. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that TCR may also be linked to the circadian clock, with implications for our understanding of the interplay between transcription, repair, and time-dependent gene regulation. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of TCR mechanisms, highlighting the complex interplay between transcription, repair, and chromatin remodeling, and exploring the potential implications for our understanding of genome stability and time-dependent gene regulation."}
