{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release plays a crucial role in innate immune signaling, serving as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that triggers the activation of immune cells. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of mtDNA in the regulation of inflammation and the initiation of immune responses. The mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) pore, also known as the permeability transition pore (PTP), is a key mechanism by which mtDNA is released into the cytosol. This process is mediated by the opening of the MOMP pore, which allows the passage of mtDNA and other pro-inflammatory molecules. The release of mtDNA has been implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms underlying mtDNA release and its role in innate immune signaling is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating inflammation and immune responses. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between mtDNA, immune cells, and the mitochondrial PTP."}
