{"Abstract": "UV-induced DNA damage triggers a complex transcriptional response that involves the activation of DNA repair pathways, including transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER). TC-NER is a specialized DNA repair mechanism that prioritizes the repair of transcribed DNA regions, while GG-NER is a more general mechanism that repairs DNA damage throughout the genome. Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between TC-NER and RNA polymerase II, the primary transcriptional machinery in eukaryotes. In Cockayne syndrome, a disorder characterized by impaired GG-NER, mutations in RNA polymerase II subunits have been linked to the disease. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage, with a focus on the interplay between TC-NER, RNA polymerase II, and GG-NER, and the implications for our understanding of human diseases such as Cockayne syndrome."}
