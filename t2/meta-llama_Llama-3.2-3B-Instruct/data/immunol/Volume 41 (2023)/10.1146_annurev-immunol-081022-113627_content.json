{"Abstract": "The origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, including granulocytes and monocytes, have been a subject of intense investigation in recent years. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) in the development and maintenance of tissue myeloid cells. GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics, suggesting a complex hierarchy of cell fate decisions. Fate-mapping studies have revealed that GMPs can give rise to both macrophages and neutrophils, highlighting the importance of niche-dependent reprogramming in tissue myeloid cell development. Furthermore, tissue reprogramming of GMPs has been shown to be a key mechanism underlying the generation of tissue-resident myeloid cells. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, with a focus on their origin, heterogeneity, and role in tissue myeloid cell development and maintenance."}
