{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies, inflammation, and tissue damage. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of interferons in the pathogenesis of SLE, with elevated levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) observed in patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the production and function of these cytokines in SLE remain poorly understood. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of SLE pathogenesis, with a focus on the role of interferons and other immune mediators. The involvement of mitochondria in the regulation of cell death and survival pathways has also been implicated in SLE, with mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to the development of autoantibodies and tissue damage. Furthermore, the extrafollicular compartment, which includes dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells, plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of the autoimmune response in SLE. This review will discuss the current evidence for the involvement of these mechanisms in SLE pathogenesis, and highlight the need for further research into the underlying biology of this complex disease. By elucidating the complex interactions between interferons, mitochondria, and the immune system, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of SLE pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this debilitating disease."}
