{"Abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response to various pathogens and danger signals. The assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome involve a series of complex structural rearrangements. This review focuses on the structural mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. The NLRP3 protein forms a hexameric structure, which is essential for its function. The assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome requires the recruitment of ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a CARD) and caspase-1. The interaction between NLRP3 and ASC leads to the formation of a filaments network, which is stabilized by the oligomerization of NLRP3. The activation of caspase-1 is crucial for the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1Î² and IL-18. The structural rearrangements of NLRP3 inflammasome are essential for its activation, and understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies against inflammatory diseases."}
