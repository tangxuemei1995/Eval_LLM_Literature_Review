{"Abstract": "IL-4 and IL-13 play pivotal roles in regulating and modulating the wound repair process, a complex and multifaceted response to tissue injury. These cytokines, key effector molecules of type 2 immunity, orchestrate the coordinated action of various immune cells and extracellular matrix components to facilitate healing. Upon wound induction, IL-4 and IL-13 are rapidly produced, promoting the activation of macrophages and the secretion of growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These growth factors, in turn, stimulate angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling, ultimately contributing to the restoration of tissue integrity. Furthermore, IL-4 and IL-13 have been shown to modulate the immune response to helminthic infections, which can also impact wound healing. Understanding the mechanisms by which IL-4 and IL-13 regulate wound repair may provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for promoting tissue recovery and regeneration."}
