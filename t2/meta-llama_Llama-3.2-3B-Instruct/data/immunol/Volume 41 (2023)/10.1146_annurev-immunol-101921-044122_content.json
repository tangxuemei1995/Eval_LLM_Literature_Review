{"Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies have shown significant promise in treating various types of cancer by harnessing the power of the immune system. Recent studies have focused on designing therapies that can effectively engage both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, two crucial components of the innate and adaptive immune responses. This review aims to summarize the current state of research in cancer immunotherapy, with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms and strategies employed to enhance T cell and NK cell activation. The literature highlights the importance of co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines, and checkpoint inhibitors in modulating the immune response. Additionally, the role of tumor-associated antigens and cancer-testis antigens in targeting NK cells is discussed. By understanding the complex interactions between T cells, NK cells, and cancer cells, researchers can design more effective immunotherapies that combine the strengths of both cell types, leading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced cancer treatment."}
