{"Abstract": "The complement system, a key component of the innate immune response, plays a complex role in the brain, contributing to both neuroprotection and neuroinflammation. C1q, a crucial component of the classical pathway, has been implicated in the clearance of amyloid-Î² plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. However, excessive activation of the complement system can lead to neuroinflammation, exacerbating disease progression. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, are activated in response to complement activation, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote synaptic pruning and neuronal loss. Conversely, the complement system can also promote neuroprotection by clearing apoptotic neurons and regulating the activity of microglia. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the complement system's contributions to neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation in the context of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the complex interplay between these processes and the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the complement system."}
