{"Abstract": "Systems immunology approaches have emerged as a crucial framework for understanding the intricate relationships between the immune system and metabolism. By integrating transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metabolic imaging, researchers can elucidate the complex interactions between immune cells and metabolic pathways. This interdisciplinary field has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Computational modeling and machine learning algorithms can be employed to analyze large-scale datasets and identify key regulatory nodes that govern immunometabolic networks. The integration of systems immunology with metabolic imaging techniques can provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between the immune system and metabolism, ultimately leading to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases."}
