{"Abstract": "Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is a crucial component of innate immunity that plays a pivotal role in the recognition and elimination of pathogens. ETI is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface of immune cells. Upon activation, ETI induces the production of guard immunity, a state of heightened immune activation that prepares the host for a more effective adaptive immune response. The effector molecules produced during ETI, such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, possess potent antimicrobial properties that directly inhibit the growth and replication of pathogens. Furthermore, ETI also regulates the expression of virulence factors in pathogens, thereby modulating their ability to cause disease. This review aims to provide an in-depth examination of ETI, its mechanisms, and its significance in the context of innate immunity and pathogen defense."}
