{"Abstract": "The development of novel immunotherapies has been a significant focus in recent years, with biomaterials emerging as a promising tool for the engineering of the immune system. This field has led to the creation of vaccine adjuvants that enhance the efficacy of immunizations, with nanoparticles playing a crucial role in their design and functionality. Biomaterials-mediated immunotherapy has shown great potential in modulating immune responses, with applications in cancer immunotherapy, infectious disease treatment, and autoimmune disorders. The use of nanoparticles as carriers for immunomodulatory molecules has enabled the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to specific immune cells, thereby enhancing their efficacy and reducing side effects. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of biomaterials-mediated immunotherapy, with a focus on the design and functionality of nanoparticle-based vaccine adjuvants and their applications in immunomodulation."}
