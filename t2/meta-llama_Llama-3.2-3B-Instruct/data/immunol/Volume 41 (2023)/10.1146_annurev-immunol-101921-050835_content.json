{"Abstract": "Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in the innate immune response against viral infections, including COVID-19. Type I IFNs, specifically, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced pneumonia. Recent studies have identified a subset of patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia exhibiting elevated levels of anticytokine autoantibodies, which target type I IFNs. This phenomenon suggests a critical mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host's immune response, leading to severe disease outcomes. Understanding the relationship between type I IFNs, anticytokine autoantibodies, and COVID-19 pneumonia is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this critical immune evasion mechanism. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and to explore the potential of anticytokine autoantibody-targeting therapies in treating critical COVID-19 pneumonia."}
