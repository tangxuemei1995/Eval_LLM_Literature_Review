{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between the immune system and epithelial tissues plays a crucial role in regeneration and repair processes. Recent studies have highlighted the complex cross-talk between immune cells and epithelial cells, which modulates the inflammatory response and promotes tissue repair. In the context of inflammatory diseases, dysregulation of this cross-talk can lead to impaired wound healing and tissue damage. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of immune-epithelial cross-talk in regeneration and repair, with a focus on the role of immune cells, cytokines, and stem cells in modulating epithelial function. We discuss the mechanisms by which epithelial cells interact with immune cells, including the production of chemokines and cytokines, and the impact of this cross-talk on tissue repair and regeneration. Furthermore, we explore the potential therapeutic strategies that target this cross-talk to promote wound healing and tissue repair in inflammatory diseases. Understanding the complex interplay between the immune system and epithelial tissues is essential for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to promote regeneration and repair in various diseases."}
