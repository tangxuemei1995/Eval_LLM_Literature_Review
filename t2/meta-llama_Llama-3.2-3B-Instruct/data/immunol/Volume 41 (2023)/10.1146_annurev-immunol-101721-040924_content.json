{"Abstract": "This study employs mathematical modeling to elucidate the complex processes governing T cell fate determination. By integrating insights from immunology and computational biology, we develop a novel computational framework that simulates the dynamic interactions between T cells and their microenvironment. Our model accounts for key regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, transcription factor dynamics, and cell-cell interactions. The results reveal a dynamic interplay between these factors, which ultimately influences T cell fate decisions. The proposed framework provides a valuable tool for understanding T cell biology and has implications for the development of novel immunotherapies and cancer therapies."}
