{"Abstract": "RNA modification plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, particularly in antiviral and antitumor immunity. The epitranscriptome, comprising RNA modifications such as N6-methyladenosine, modulates gene expression and influences the tumor microenvironment. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of RNA modification in modulating antiviral and antitumor immunity, with implications for cancer therapy and vaccine development. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of RNA modification in the immune system, with a focus on its role in antiviral and antitumor immunity and its potential applications in immunotherapy."}
