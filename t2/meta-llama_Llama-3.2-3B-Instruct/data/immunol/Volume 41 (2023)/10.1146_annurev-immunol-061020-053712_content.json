{"Abstract": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in mediating allergic reactions, and its receptors, particularly FcεRI, are crucial for this process. The protein structure of IgE and its receptors has been extensively studied, revealing intricate mechanisms of action. The FcεRI receptor, composed of α, β, and γ subunits, undergoes conformational changes upon IgE binding, triggering the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The CD23 molecule, a disulfide-linked dimer of the low-affinity IgE receptor, modulates IgE binding and receptor activation. Anti-IgE biologics, such as omalizumab, have been developed to target and neutralize IgE, thereby reducing allergic responses. Structural insights into the binding of anti-IgE biologics to IgE and FcεRI have provided valuable information on their mechanisms of action. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of IgE, IgE receptors, and anti-IgE biologics, highlighting the importance of protein structure and allosteric regulation in modulating allergic responses."}
