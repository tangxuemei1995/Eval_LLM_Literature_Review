{"Abstract": "Endogenous retroelements (EREs), including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), have been integrated into the human genome for millions of years, posing a significant challenge to our understanding of the immunological landscape. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between EREs and the adaptive immune system, with ERVs capable of modulating interferon (IFN) responses and influencing the development of autoimmune diseases. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the immunological conundrum of EREs, focusing on the mechanisms by which ERVs interact with the adaptive immune system and the resulting consequences for human health. We will discuss the role of ERVs in shaping the IFN response, the impact on immune cell function, and the potential links to autoimmune diseases. Our analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this field, highlighting the need for further investigation into the immunological implications of EREs."}
