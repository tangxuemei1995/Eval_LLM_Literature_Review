{"Abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) plays a pivotal role in regulating the function and fate of T cells, a crucial component of the adaptive immune system. This review focuses on the complex interactions between TGF-β and various subsets of T cells, including CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T cells. TGF-β has been shown to modulate T cell quiescence and activation, influencing the balance between effector and regulatory T cell responses. Furthermore, TGF-β has been implicated in the development and function of innate lymphoid cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and γδ T cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-β's effects on T cells involve the regulation of key transcription factors and signaling pathways, including the Smad pathway and the NF-κB pathway. Understanding the intricate relationships between TGF-β and T cells is essential for elucidating the mechanisms of immune tolerance and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related disorders."}
