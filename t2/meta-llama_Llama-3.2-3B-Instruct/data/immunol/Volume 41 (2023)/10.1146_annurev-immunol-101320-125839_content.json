{"Abstract": "Inflammatory anemia encompasses a range of conditions characterized by the interplay between anemia and inflammation, leading to impaired erythropoiesis and increased susceptibility to infections. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and malaria-induced hemophagocytic syndrome are two notable examples of inflammatory anemia, where the immune system's overactive response to pathogens results in the destruction of red blood cells. In sickle cell anemia, chronic inflammation exacerbates the disease's pathophysiology, contributing to increased oxidative stress and tissue damage. Hemophagocytes, a subset of immune cells, play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory anemia by mediating the clearance of red blood cells. This review aims to elucidate the complex immune mechanisms underlying inflammatory anemia, with a focus on the roles of hemophagocytes and the implications for disease management and treatment strategies."}
