{"Abstract": "Aging is characterized by the progressive deterioration of tissues, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of the immune system, known as immunosenescence. This process involves the decline of lymphocyte function and the expansion of senescent T cell subsets. In this context, extremely differentiated T cell subsets, such as terminally differentiated effector T cells and senescent memory T cells, contribute to tissue deterioration. Thymus involution, a hallmark of aging, further exacerbates this process by reducing the production of new T cells. Chronic inflammation, resulting from the imbalance between effector and regulatory T cells, also plays a critical role in promoting tissue damage. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the contribution of extremely differentiated T cell subsets to immunosenescence and tissue deterioration is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate the effects of aging."}
