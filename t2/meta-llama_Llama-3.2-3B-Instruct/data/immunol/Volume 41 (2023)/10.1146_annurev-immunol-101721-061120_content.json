{"Abstract": "This study investigates the T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, a critical component of the immune system's defense against COVID-19. Our analysis reveals that T cell responses to the virus are highly variable, with distinct patterns of recognition and activation in response to different variants. Notably, T cell epitopes that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies are also recognized by T cells, suggesting a coordinated immune response. Furthermore, our findings suggest that T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are influenced by disease severity, with individuals experiencing more severe disease exhibiting altered T cell profiles. The results also highlight the importance of vaccination in modulating T cell responses, with vaccinated individuals displaying enhanced T cell activation and proliferation. Overall, this study provides new insights into the complex T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and has implications for the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines and therapies."}
