{"Abstract": "Natural Killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses during pregnancy, particularly in the decidua, a specialized uterine tissue that supports fetal development. Recent studies have highlighted the presence and function of uterine NK cells in the human uterus, which are distinct from peripheral NK cells. These cells are characterized by the expression of specific surface markers and cytokine profiles that facilitate communication with the trophoblast, a critical component of the placenta. The interaction between uterine NK cells and trophoblast is essential for maintaining a balanced immune environment, preventing excessive inflammation, and promoting fetal tolerance. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of uterine NK cells in the human uterus, their role in reproduction, and the implications for pregnancy complications. The findings suggest that uterine NK cells are a vital component of the uterine immune microenvironment, and their dysregulation may contribute to pregnancy-related disorders."}
