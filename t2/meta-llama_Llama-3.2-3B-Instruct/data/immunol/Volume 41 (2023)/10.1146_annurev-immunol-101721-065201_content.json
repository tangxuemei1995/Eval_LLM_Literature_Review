{"Abstract": "The intricate dance between the immune system and infectious agents has long been a cornerstone of immunology research. Recent advances in genetic engineering and genomics have enabled the development of mouse models that closely mimic human immunodeficiency disorders, providing a unique platform for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying inborn errors of immunity. This study leverages the power of mouse genetics to elucidate the genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases, with a focus on the human counterparts. By comparing the genetic landscapes of mouse models with human immunodeficiency disorders, we have identified novel genetic variants associated with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of human immunodeficiency disorders and highlight the potential for mouse models to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The results of this study contribute to the reconciliation of mouse and human immunology, paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between the immune system and infectious agents."}
