{"Abstract": "The naked mole-rat (NMR) has garnered significant attention as a model organism for studying healthy aging due to its remarkable longevity and resistance to age-related diseases. These subterranean rodents exhibit a unique physiology characterized by a high concentration of myeloperoxidase, which confers protection against cancer and oxidative stress. Notably, NMRs live in large, eusocial colonies, where social hierarchy and cooperation play a crucial role in maintaining health and longevity. Furthermore, their ability to thrive in low-oxygen environments, a condition often associated with aging, has sparked interest in the role of hypoxia in promoting healthy aging. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the NMR's remarkable longevity and its potential applications in understanding the biology of healthy aging, with a focus on the interplay between sociality, hypoxia, and cancer resistance."}
