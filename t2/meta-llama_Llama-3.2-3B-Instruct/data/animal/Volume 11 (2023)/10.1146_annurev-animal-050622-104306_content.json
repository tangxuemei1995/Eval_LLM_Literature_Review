{"Abstract": "The role of zoos and aquariums in a changing world is multifaceted and increasingly important for biodiversity conservation. These institutions provide a platform for captive breeding programs, species reintroduction initiatives, and scientific research, contributing to the preservation of threatened and endangered species. Beyond these conservation efforts, zoos and aquariums serve as vital centers for environmental education, promoting awareness and understanding of the natural world among diverse audiences. However, the success of these institutions is contingent upon the implementation of animal welfare standards, ensuring the well-being of animals in their care. As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, habitat destruction, and species extinction, zoos and aquariums must adapt and evolve to remain effective stewards of biodiversity, while also prioritizing animal welfare and promoting environmental stewardship."}
