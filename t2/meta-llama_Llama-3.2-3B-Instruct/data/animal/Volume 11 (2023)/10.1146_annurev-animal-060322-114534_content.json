{"Abstract": "Cephalopods, including octopuses and squids, possess a unique neural proteome that has evolved to support their remarkable cognitive abilities and adaptability. Recent studies have revealed that RNA editing plays a crucial role in the extensive recoding of the neural proteome in these animals. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, specifically ADAR1 and ADAR2, are responsible for introducing adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) modifications in RNA sequences, leading to the generation of novel protein isoforms. This adaptive mechanism enables cephalopods to fine-tune their neural circuits and respond to changing environments. The extensive recoding of the neural proteome by RNA editing in cephalopods has significant implications for our understanding of neural plasticity, adaptation, and the evolution of complex behaviors. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its potential applications in neuroscience and biotechnology."}
