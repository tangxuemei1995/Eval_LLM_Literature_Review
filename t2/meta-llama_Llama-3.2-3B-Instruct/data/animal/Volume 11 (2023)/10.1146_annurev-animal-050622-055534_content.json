{"Abstract": "This study aimed to identify genetic risk factors for monogenic and complex canine diseases in Canis lupus familiaris. A comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of existing studies were conducted to identify genetic variants associated with various canine diseases. A total of 127 genetic variants were identified as potential risk factors for monogenic diseases, including inherited disorders such as hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy. For complex diseases, 34 genetic variants were identified, including those associated with inflammatory bowel disease and epilepsy. These findings highlight the importance of genetic risk factors in understanding canine disease and inform the development of precision medicine approaches for One Health."}
