{"Abstract": "The Biology and Evolution of Fierce Females (Moles and Hyenas) explores the unique characteristics of female mammals that exhibit aggressive and dominant behaviors, exemplified by moles and spotted hyenas. This study delves into the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the reproductive biology of these species, including the presence of ovotestes and pseudopenises in females. The authors examine the role of these anatomical features in facilitating aggressive behavior, including territorial defense and mate competition. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, the researchers highlight the convergent evolution of female masculinization in these species, allowing them to access and utilize male-dominated resources. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between sex, aggression, and evolution in mammals, with implications for our understanding of female reproductive biology and behavior."}
