{"Abstract": "The rapid emergence of human-infecting coronaviruses poses significant threats to global health. This review focuses on the role of animal models and zoonotic reservoirs in the cross-species transmission of emerging coronaviruses. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that animal models, particularly those derived from bats and other wild animals, have played a crucial role in the identification and characterization of novel coronaviruses. The zoonotic reservoirs of these viruses, often found in wildlife populations, serve as a primary source of transmission to humans. Cross-species transmission events, facilitated by recombination and genetic exchange, have contributed to the emergence of new coronaviruses. Effective surveillance and monitoring of animal populations, as well as the development of animal models, are essential for early detection and prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. Understanding the complex interactions between animal reservoirs and human populations is critical for developing targeted interventions and mitigating the risk of future pandemics."}
