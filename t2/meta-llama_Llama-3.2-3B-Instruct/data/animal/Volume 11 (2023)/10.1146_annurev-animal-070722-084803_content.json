{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of wildlife crime and the courtroom, focusing on the role of forensic analysis in prosecuting poaching cases. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, we explore the challenges and opportunities of using DNA evidence in wildlife crime investigations. Our analysis reveals that DNA analysis has become a crucial tool in identifying and prosecuting poaching offenders, with significant implications for conservation efforts. However, the use of DNA evidence in wildlife crime cases is often hindered by limited resources, inadequate laboratory capacity, and the need for specialized expertise. This study highlights the need for increased investment in wildlife forensic analysis and the development of standardized protocols for the collection and analysis of DNA evidence in poaching cases."}
