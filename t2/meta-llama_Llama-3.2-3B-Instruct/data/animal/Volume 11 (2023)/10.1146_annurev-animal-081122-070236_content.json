{"Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the scientific validation of cannabidiol (CBD) as a therapeutic agent for the management of various diseases in dogs and cats. A comprehensive review of existing literature on the pharmacokinetics, anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antiepileptic properties of CBD was conducted. The results showed that CBD exhibits a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with rapid absorption and elimination, making it a suitable candidate for treatment. Furthermore, CBD demonstrated significant anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory effects in both canine and feline models, suggesting its potential as an adjunct therapy for anxiety-related disorders and inflammatory-mediated diseases. The regulatory status of CBD in veterinary medicine was also examined, highlighting the need for further research and standardization of CBD products for canine and feline use. Overall, this review provides a foundation for the scientific validation of CBD as a therapeutic agent for the management of various diseases in dogs and cats."}
