{"Abstract": "The evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors has been a subject of intense research, with a growing body of evidence suggesting significant differences between osteichthyan (bony fish) and non-osteichthyan (cartilaginous fish) genomes. This study provides insights into the evolution of key hormones, including leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin, in non-osteichthyan genomes, specifically in cyclostomes (hagfish and lampreys). Phylogenetic analysis reveals distinct patterns of gene duplication and divergence, highlighting the importance of non-osteichthyan genomes in understanding the origins of vertebrate hormone evolution. Furthermore, comparative expression analysis of hormone receptors in non-osteichthyan species reveals novel insights into the functional conservation and divergence of these systems, shedding light on the complex evolution of vertebrate endocrine systems."}
