{"Abstract": "Domestic animals play a crucial role in the transmission of zoonotic viral diseases to humans, highlighting the importance of the One Health approach. Emerging and endemic viral zoonoses, such as avian influenza, swine flu, and SARS-CoV-2, have been linked to domestic animal reservoirs. These animals can serve as amplifying hosts, facilitating the spread of pathogens to humans. The close interaction between humans and domestic animals increases the risk of zoonotic transmission. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on domestic animal reservoirs of zoonotic viral diseases, including the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control measures. Understanding the role of domestic animals in zoonotic disease transmission is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent pandemics and mitigate the impact of emerging viral zoonoses."}
