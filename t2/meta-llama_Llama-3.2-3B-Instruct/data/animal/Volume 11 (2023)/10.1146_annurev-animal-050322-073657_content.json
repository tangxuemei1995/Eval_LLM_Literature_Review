{"Abstract": "Biologging and biotelemetry technologies have revolutionized the study of marine animal behavior, ecology, and physiology. By attaching sensors and tracking devices to marine animals, researchers can gain insights into their movement patterns, habitat use, and social interactions. This abstract reviews the current state of biologging and biotelemetry in marine research, highlighting its applications in movement ecology, predator-prey interaction, and social behavior. The impact of anthropogenic stressors, such as climate change and pollution, on marine animal populations is also discussed. Field physiology studies have shown that biologging and biotelemetry can provide valuable information on the physiological responses of marine animals to environmental changes. The integration of biologging and biotelemetry data with other research methods, such as genetic analysis and remote sensing, offers a powerful tool for understanding the complex interactions between marine animals and their environments. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of biologging and biotelemetry in marine research and its potential for informing conservation and management efforts."}
