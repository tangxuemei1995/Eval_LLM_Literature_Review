{"Abstract": "Recessive lethal variation (RLV) is a phenomenon where deleterious mutations are maintained in natural populations due to specific evolutionary mechanisms. This study investigates the roles of mutation-selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in maintaining RLV. We review the literature on the various mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of RLV, including associative overdominance and supergene effects. Our analysis reveals that mutation-selection balance plays a crucial role in maintaining RLV by allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate in the population. Heterozygote advantage and linked selection also contribute to the persistence of RLV by providing a selective advantage to individuals carrying deleterious mutations. The findings of this study highlight the complex interplay between these mechanisms and their importance in maintaining RLV in natural populations. The results have implications for our understanding of the evolution of deleterious mutations and the maintenance of genetic variation in the wild."}
