{"Abstract": "Deleterious variation, including deleterious mutations and inbreeding depression, poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of natural populations. This phenomenon, known as genetic load, can lead to a decline in population fitness and reduced adaptability to changing environments. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, we examine the impact of deleterious variation on conservation genetics, highlighting the need for effective management strategies to mitigate its effects. Our analysis reveals that simulations demonstrate the cumulative effect of deleterious mutations can lead to significant inbreeding depression, compromising population viability. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of genetic load for conservation breeding programs, emphasizing the importance of incorporating genetic diversity and reducing inbreeding to maintain population health. By understanding the deleterious effects of variation, conservation biologists can develop targeted interventions to safeguard the long-term survival of threatened species."}
