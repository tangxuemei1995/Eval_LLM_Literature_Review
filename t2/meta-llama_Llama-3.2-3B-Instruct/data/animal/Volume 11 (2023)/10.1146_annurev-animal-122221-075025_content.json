{"Abstract": "Insect populations are facing unprecedented declines, with widespread consequences for ecosystems and human societies. To inform effective conservation strategies, we have applied population genomics to investigate the genetic underpinnings of insect declines. Our analysis of genome assemblies from a diverse range of insect species reveals significant genetic divergence and reduced genetic diversity in declining populations. Notably, deleterious mutations, which can impair fitness and survival, are overrepresented in these populations. Furthermore, our results suggest that genetic adaptation to changing environmental conditions may be a key driver of insect declines. We have identified specific genetic variants associated with increased resistance to pesticides and other environmental stressors, which may be contributing to population declines. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the genetic component of insect declines in conservation efforts. By leveraging conservation genomics, we can identify effective conservation targets, prioritize species for protection, and develop targeted management strategies to mitigate the impacts of insect declines. Ultimately, our research underscores the need for a holistic approach to insect conservation, one that incorporates genetic, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives."}
