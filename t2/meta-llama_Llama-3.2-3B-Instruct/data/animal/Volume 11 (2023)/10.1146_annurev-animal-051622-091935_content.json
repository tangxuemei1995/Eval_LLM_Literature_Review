{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes existing literature on the intersection of Indigenous perspectives and animal biosciences, highlighting the significance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in informing animal science research and practice. The American Indian and Native American communities have long demonstrated a profound understanding of the intricate relationships between animals, humans, and the environment, which is often overlooked in mainstream scientific discourse. One Health approaches, which integrate human, animal, and environmental health, can benefit from the incorporation of TEK. This review examines the historical and contemporary contexts of Indigenous knowledge production, its relevance to animal biosciences, and the potential for collaborative research and knowledge co-production. By centering Indigenous voices and perspectives, this review aims to promote a more inclusive and equitable understanding of animal sciences, ultimately contributing to the development of more sustainable and culturally responsive animal health practices."}
