{"Abstract": "Organizational research relies heavily on the quality and appropriateness of samples to ensure the validity and reliability of findings. However, sampling methods often fall short, leading to biased and unrepresentative results. This study examines the current state of sampling in organizational research, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods and the consequences of insufficient effort responding and participant dishonesty. A review of existing literature reveals that online samples are particularly susceptible to these issues, with low response rates and high levels of non-response. To address these concerns, this study investigates the effectiveness of innovative sampling techniques, including stratified sampling and snowball sampling, in improving data quality. The results suggest that these methods can significantly increase response rates and reduce non-response, leading to more accurate and reliable findings. The implications of these findings are discussed, highlighting the need for researchers to adopt more rigorous sampling methods to ensure the validity of their results."}
