{"Abstract": "Self-reflection at work is a crucial practice that enables individuals to examine their thoughts, emotions, and actions, leading to enhanced emotional regulation, improved leadership skills, and increased job satisfaction. By engaging in regular self-reflection, employees can identify areas for personal and professional growth, develop a greater sense of self-awareness, and cultivate a more positive and adaptive mindset. However, excessive rumination and distancing from one's emotions can hinder the benefits of self-reflection, leading to decreased motivation and well-being. This study explores the importance of self-reflection in the workplace, highlighting strategies for harnessing its potential while avoiding its pitfalls, and providing guidance for leaders and individuals seeking to integrate self-reflection into their daily practice."}
