{"Abstract": "This paper provides a retrospective analysis of the concept of employee voice and silence, a decade after its inception. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that employee voice refers to the proactive behavior of employees in sharing information and influencing organizational decisions, while employee silence is characterized by the absence of such engagement. The findings suggest that employee voice is positively correlated with organizational performance, job satisfaction, and employee well-being. Conversely, employee silence is linked to decreased job satisfaction, increased turnover intentions, and reduced organizational performance. The study highlights the importance of creating a culture that encourages open communication, active listening, and employee empowerment to foster a more proactive and engaged workforce. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of organizational development and human resource management."}
