{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of learning processes in developing self-awareness and promoting self- and interpersonal growth. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. Participants engaged in a mindfulness-based intervention, which included regular reflection and rumination exercises, followed by feedback sessions. Results showed significant improvements in self-awareness, self-insight, and interpersonal skills. The findings suggest that mindfulness-based learning processes can facilitate self-awareness development by increasing self-reflection and reducing rumination. The role of feedback in enhancing self-awareness was also highlighted, with participants demonstrating greater self-awareness following feedback sessions. The study's implications for personal and professional development are discussed, highlighting the potential of mindfulness-based interventions to promote self- and interpersonal growth."}
