{"Abstract": "This study investigates the dynamic interplay between actors and context in fostering creativity and innovation. Through a mixed-methods approach, we examine the complex interactions between individuals and their situational contexts, highlighting the reciprocal influences on creative performance. Our findings suggest that person-context interaction is a critical factor in enhancing creativity, and that team-situation interaction can either facilitate or hinder innovation. The study's results provide valuable insights into desirable directions for future research and practice, informing strategies to optimize creative performance in various contexts."}
