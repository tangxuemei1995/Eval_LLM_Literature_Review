{"Abstract": "This study aims to lay the groundwork for the development of the Challengeâ€“Hindrance Stressor Framework 2.0, integrating the Transactional Theory of Stress and Conservation of Resources theory. Building upon the existing framework, we examine the interplay between challenge and hindrance stressors, their appraisal processes, and the impact on employee well-being. Our analysis reveals that the negativity bias plays a crucial role in shaping the relationship between stressors and stress responses. We also explore the moderating effects of job demands and resources on the stressor-stress response relationship. The findings of this study provide a foundation for the development of a more comprehensive and nuanced framework, which can inform the design of interventions aimed at mitigating the negative effects of stressors on employee outcomes. The framework 2.0 will prioritize the integration of both challenge and hindrance stressors, and their reciprocal relationships with employee appraisals and well-being."}
