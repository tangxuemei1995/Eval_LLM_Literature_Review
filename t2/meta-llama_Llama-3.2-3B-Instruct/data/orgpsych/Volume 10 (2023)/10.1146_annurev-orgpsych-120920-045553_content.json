{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of leader thinking styles on follower creative performance. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. The results show that leaders with a more open and flexible thinking style foster a more innovative work environment, leading to increased follower creative performance. Conversely, leaders with a more rigid and closed thinking style hinder follower creativity. The findings suggest that leader development programs should focus on cultivating leader thinking skills, such as openness to new ideas and adaptability, to enhance follower creative performance. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of leadership development and organizational innovation."}
