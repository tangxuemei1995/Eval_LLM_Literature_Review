{"Abstract": "This review examines the intersection of organizational justice and racioethnic differences in the workplace, challenging the notion of colorblindness in the pursuit of fairness and equality. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that racioethnic differences persist in organizational justice, manifesting as disparate treatment, unequal opportunities, and biased decision-making. The review highlights the role of implicit bias, microaggressions, and systemic racism in perpetuating these disparities. Furthermore, it discusses the impact of organizational justice on racioethnic differences, including the effects of perceived fairness, trust, and commitment on employee outcomes. The findings of this review underscore the need for organizations to acknowledge and address racioethnic differences in organizational justice, promoting a more inclusive and equitable work environment. By doing so, organizations can foster a culture of fairness, respect, and belonging for all employees."}
