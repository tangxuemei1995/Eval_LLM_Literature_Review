{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of mental health and the workplace, with a focus on prevention, intervention, and accommodation strategies. Research indicates that mental illness is a pervasive issue in the workplace, resulting in decreased productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism. The literature highlights the importance of creating a supportive work environment that promotes mental well-being and reduces stigma around mental illness. This study reviews existing research on workplace mental health interventions, including mindfulness programs, employee assistance programs, and flexible work arrangements. The findings suggest that targeted interventions and accommodations can significantly improve mental health outcomes and reduce the economic burden of mental illness in the workplace."}
