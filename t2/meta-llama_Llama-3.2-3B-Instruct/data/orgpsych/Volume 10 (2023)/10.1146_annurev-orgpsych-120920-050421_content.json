{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of employee green behavior as a core component of environmentally sustainable organizations. Drawing on ecological behavior theory and environmental psychology, the research investigates the relationships between employee pro-environmental behavior, organizational environmental sustainability, and employee well-being. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 200 employees in environmentally conscious organizations. The results indicate a positive correlation between employee green behavior and organizational environmental sustainability, as well as a significant positive impact on employee well-being. Furthermore, thematic analysis revealed that employees' pro-environmental behavior is influenced by organizational leadership, communication, and culture. The findings suggest that employee green behavior is a critical factor in promoting environmental sustainability and organizational well-being. The study contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between employee behavior, organizational sustainability, and employee outcomes, highlighting the importance of fostering a culture of environmental responsibility within organizations."}
