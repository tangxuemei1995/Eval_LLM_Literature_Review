{"Abstract": "This abstract synthesizes the existing literature on psychological safety, highlighting key themes that have emerged in recent years. The concept of psychological safety has been extensively studied in the context of leadership and work experience, with a growing body of research emphasizing its impact on learning behavior and performance. Observations suggest that psychological safety is not only a critical component of organizational well-being but also a key driver of employee engagement and motivation. The literature reveals that leaders play a pivotal role in fostering a culture of psychological safety, and that this, in turn, can lead to improved collaboration, innovation, and overall organizational success. The findings of this review underscore the importance of prioritizing psychological safety in organizational development and highlight the need for further research in this area."}
