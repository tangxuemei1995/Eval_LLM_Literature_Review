{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of leadership in virtual and hybrid work environments, where traditional hierarchical structures are disrupted by the proliferation of remote work. Through a dyadic lens, examining the interactions between leaders and their team members, we investigate the dynamics of effective leadership in these contexts. Our research reveals that leaders who adopt a more flexible and adaptable approach to communication, fostering a sense of trust and autonomy among team members, are better equipped to navigate the challenges of virtual and hybrid work. The findings suggest that leaders who prioritize emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-awareness are more effective in leading high-performing teams in these environments. The study contributes to our understanding of leadership in the digital age, highlighting the importance of dyadic relationships and the need for leaders to adapt their leadership styles to the unique demands of virtual and hybrid work."}
