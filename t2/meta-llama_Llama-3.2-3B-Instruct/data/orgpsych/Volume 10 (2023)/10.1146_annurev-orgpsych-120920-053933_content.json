{"Abstract": "This article provides a decade-long review of the job demands-resources (JD-R) theory, a widely accepted framework for understanding the relationship between job demands and employee outcomes. Since its inception, the JD-R theory has been extensively tested and validated across various occupational settings, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. The theory posits that job demands, such as workload and time pressure, can be mitigated by the availability of resources, including social support, autonomy, and skill utilization. Research has consistently shown that employees who experience high job demands and low resources are at risk of burnout, while those with balanced job demands and resources exhibit high levels of work engagement. The article highlights the key findings and implications of the JD-R theory, including its relevance to job design and proactive work behavior, and discusses future research directions for advancing our understanding of this critical theory."}
