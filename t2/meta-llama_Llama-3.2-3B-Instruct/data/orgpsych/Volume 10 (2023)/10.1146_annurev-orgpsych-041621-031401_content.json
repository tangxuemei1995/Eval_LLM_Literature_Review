{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of structural equation modeling (SEM) in organizational research, highlighting its applications, limitations, and future directions. A review of the literature reveals that SEM has become a dominant method for testing complex relationships and latent variable models in organizational studies. However, the model fit indices often used in SEM research are criticized for their lack of robustness and reliability. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of latent interactions and the need for more nuanced understanding of organizational phenomena necessitate the development of new SEM approaches. This paper proposes several avenues for advancing the field, including the integration of machine learning techniques, the development of more sophisticated model fit indices, and the exploration of SEM's potential for capturing dynamic and nonlinear relationships in organizational contexts. By addressing these challenges, SEM can continue to evolve as a powerful tool for organizational research."}
