{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes a century of research on personnel selection, highlighting the pervasive impact of noise on workplace judgments. By examining the effects of unwanted variance on forecasting and strategic decision making, we identify key lessons for mitigating noise in selection processes. Our analysis reveals that noise can be reduced through the implementation of noise-reducing strategies, such as data preprocessing and model validation. By applying these strategies, organizations can improve the accuracy of their judgments and enhance overall performance. The findings of this study contribute to the development of evidence-based best practices for reducing noise in personnel selection."}
