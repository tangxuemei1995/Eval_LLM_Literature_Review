{"Abstract": "Graphene and two-dimensional materials have emerged as promising platforms for biomolecule sensing due to their unique properties, including high specific surface area (SSA) and density of states (DOS). The integration of these materials into field effect transistors (FETs) enables the detection of biomolecules through changes in electrical conductivity. However, the sensitivity and selectivity of these devices are often limited by defects and impurities. To overcome these challenges, standardized protocols for material synthesis and device fabrication are essential. Recent studies have employed impedance models to investigate the effects of defects on FET performance, revealing a correlation between defect density and biomolecule binding. By optimizing material properties and device design, graphene-based FETs have shown great promise for biomolecule sensing applications, including label-free detection and real-time monitoring. Further research is needed to standardize the fabrication and characterization of graphene-based biosensors to unlock their full potential."}
