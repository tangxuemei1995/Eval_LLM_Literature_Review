{"Abstract": "The process of translation, where genetic information encoded in mRNA is translated into a specific amino acid sequence, is a complex and highly regulated process. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of noncovalent interactions in facilitating the accurate translation of the universal genetic code. The stereochemical hypothesis, which proposes that the three-dimensional structure of aminoacyl-tRNA molecules plays a key role in determining the specificity of translation, has been supported by numerous experimental studies. Furthermore, the mRNA-protein complementarity hypothesis, which suggests that the secondary structure of mRNA and the specificity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contribute to the accuracy of translation, has also been extensively investigated. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of molecular interactions at the heart of translation, with a focus on the noncovalent interactions that govern the specificity of translation. By examining the latest research in this field, we aim to shed light on the intricate mechanisms that underlie the translation process and provide new insights into the regulation of protein synthesis."}
