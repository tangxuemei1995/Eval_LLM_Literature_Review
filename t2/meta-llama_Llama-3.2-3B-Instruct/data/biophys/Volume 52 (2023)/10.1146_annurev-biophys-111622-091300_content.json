{"Abstract": "High-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized the field of structural biology by enabling the determination of atomic-resolution 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes. This technique has overcome the limitations of traditional cryo-EM by reducing optical aberrations and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the prospects of cryo-EM are not without limitations, including the need for sophisticated sample preparation and the potential for artifacts introduced during the imaging process. Despite these challenges, advances in cryo-EM technology have led to significant improvements in resolution and accuracy, paving the way for further elucidation of the complex structures of biological molecules."}
