{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial ion channels play a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. These channels, including calcium, potassium, chloride, and porin channels, facilitate the exchange of ions across the mitochondrial inner membrane, influencing mitochondrial membrane potential, pH, and reactive oxygen species production. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of mitochondrial megachannels, which are large pores formed by the assembly of multiple porin subunits, in modulating mitochondrial calcium uptake and release. The dysregulation of mitochondrial ion channels has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of mitochondrial ion channels and their interactions with other mitochondrial proteins is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on mitochondrial ion channels, their functions, and their implications in human disease."}
