{"Abstract": "The ribosome, a crucial component of the translation machinery in cells, poses a significant challenge for computational modeling due to its complex structure and dynamic behavior. This study employs a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data to investigate the ribosome's conformational changes during translation. By integrating cryo-EM structures with molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate the ribosome's conformational dynamics and interactions with antibiotics. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and suggest potential strategies for the development of novel therapeutic agents. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the ribosome's complex behavior and its role in translation, with implications for the design of more effective treatments for bacterial infections."}
