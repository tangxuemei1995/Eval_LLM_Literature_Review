{"Abstract": "This study employs a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach to investigate energy transduction in biomolecular machines. By combining the strengths of quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics, the QM/MM method allows for the accurate simulation of electronic and nuclear processes in complex biological systems. The method is applied to model proton transfers, electron transfers, and nucleotide hydrolysis in biomolecular machines, with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of energy transduction. The results show that the QM/MM method is capable of accurately predicting the energy landscape of these processes, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of biomolecular machines. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of biological energy transduction and the development of novel biomimetic systems."}
