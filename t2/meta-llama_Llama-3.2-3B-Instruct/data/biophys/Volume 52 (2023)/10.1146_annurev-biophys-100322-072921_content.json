{"Abstract": "Ball-and-chain inactivation is a unique mechanism of voltage-dependent inactivation observed in certain potassium channels, including voltage-gated K+ channels and Ca2+-activated K+ channels. This process involves the binding of a ball-and-chain complex to the channel protein, leading to a conformational change that blocks the channel pore. In contrast, N-type inactivation, a similar mechanism observed in sodium channels, involves the binding of a different ball-and-chain complex. The distinct mechanisms of ball-and-chain inactivation and N-type inactivation have significant implications for our understanding of potassium and sodium channel function and regulation. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular basis of ball-and-chain inactivation, revealing the importance of specific amino acid residues and the role of the channel's cytoplasmic domain. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of ball-and-chain inactivation in potassium channels, highlighting its unique features and functional significance."}
