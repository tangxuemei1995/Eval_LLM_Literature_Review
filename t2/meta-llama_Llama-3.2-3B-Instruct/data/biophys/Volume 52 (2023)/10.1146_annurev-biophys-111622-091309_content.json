{"Abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical organelle responsible for protein folding, modification, and quality control. A coordinated system of molecular chaperones, including Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90, plays a pivotal role in maintaining ER homeostasis. This system functions in concert to facilitate protein folding, prevent protein aggregation, and regulate protein degradation. Hsp40 chaperones interact with Hsp70, which then binds to client proteins, facilitating their folding or unfolding. Hsp90, a co-chaperone of Hsp70, enhances the stability and activity of its client proteins. The coordinated action of this Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp90 system ensures the proper folding and quality control of ER-resident proteins, preventing ER stress and promoting cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of this system has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of ER protein quality control."}
