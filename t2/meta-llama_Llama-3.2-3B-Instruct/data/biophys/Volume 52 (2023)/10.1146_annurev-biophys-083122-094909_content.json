{"Abstract": "Rhodopsin, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), plays a crucial role in initiating visual transduction in the retina. Upon activation by 11-cis retinal, a conformational change in the receptor's structure triggers a signaling cascade. This cascade involves the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein, activation of downstream effectors, and subsequent generation of a visual signal. The precise mechanism of rhodopsin activation has been elucidated through a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies. Understanding the molecular basis of rhodopsin activation is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for visual disorders."}
