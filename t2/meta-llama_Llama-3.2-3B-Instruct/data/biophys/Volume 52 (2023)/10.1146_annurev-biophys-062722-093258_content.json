{"Abstract": "The description of molecular processes, such as permeation and conformational transitions, is crucial in understanding various biological and chemical phenomena. Free energy methods, including importance sampling and enhanced sampling, have emerged as powerful tools for simulating these processes. Importance sampling techniques, such as weighted ensemble methods and umbrella sampling, enable the exploration of high-energy regions, while enhanced sampling methods, like parallel tempering and replica exchange, facilitate the convergence of simulations. Recognition and association methods, which involve the identification of relevant molecular interactions, have also been employed to enhance the accuracy of free energy calculations. The application of these methods has been demonstrated in various systems, including protein-ligand binding, membrane permeation, and conformational transitions. By leveraging the strengths of these approaches, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of molecular processes, ultimately informing the design of novel therapeutics and materials. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of free energy methods for the description of molecular processes, highlighting their importance and potential applications."}
