{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationships between allostery, folding, and protein machines through the lens of hemoglobin's dynamic behavior. Hydrogen exchange analysis reveals the dynamic interplay between subunits, highlighting the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. AAA+ proteins, known for their molecular motor functions, are also examined for their role in protein folding and machine-like behavior. An autobiographical approach provides a unique perspective on the intricate mechanisms governing protein function, shedding light on the complex interplay between structure and function."}
