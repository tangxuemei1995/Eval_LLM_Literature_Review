{"Abstract": "Cooperative receptors, where the binding of one ligand induces a conformational change that enhances the affinity for subsequent ligands, are a crucial component of various biological systems. Rational design of cooperative receptors is essential for the development of novel biosensors and bioengineering applications. This review focuses on recent advances in the design and engineering of cooperative receptors, including the use of aptamers and binding-induced folding. Allosteric modulation and population shift strategies have been employed to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of these receptors. The design of cooperative receptors has also been influenced by advances in synthetic biology, enabling the construction of complex biological systems. By integrating principles from biochemistry, biophysics, and engineering, researchers can create cooperative receptors with tailored properties, opening up new avenues for biosensing, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications."}
