{"Abstract": "Quantitative Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized the field of nanoscopy by enabling the visualization of individual molecules with unprecedented resolution. By leveraging advanced computational algorithms and machine learning techniques, SMLM allows for the accurate quantification of molecular localization and dynamics in living cells. This abstract reviews the current state of quantitative SMLM, highlighting its applications in quantitative cell biology, including the study of protein localization, trafficking, and interactions. We discuss the key challenges and limitations of SMLM, including photobleaching, photodamage, and computational complexity, and explore strategies for overcoming these hurdles. The future of SMLM holds great promise for advancing our understanding of cellular biology and its potential applications in fields such as medicine and biotechnology."}
