{"Abstract": "The study of protein dynamics is crucial for understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying various biological processes. Recent advancements in time-resolved X-ray crystallography have enabled researchers to capture the structural changes occurring in proteins at the femtosecond timescale. Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool for probing the excited states of proteins. By applying electric fields to generate ultrafast conformational changes, researchers can now investigate the dynamics of proteins in real-time. This emerging approach has far-reaching implications for understanding protein mechanics and the underlying mechanisms governing protein function. The application of time-resolved X-ray crystallography to study protein dynamics has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of protein behavior and has significant implications for fields such as biotechnology and medicine. Further research in this area is expected to reveal new insights into the intricate mechanisms governing protein function."}
