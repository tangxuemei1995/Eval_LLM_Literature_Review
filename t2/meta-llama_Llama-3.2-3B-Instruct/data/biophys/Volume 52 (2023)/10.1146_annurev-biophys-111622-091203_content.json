{"Abstract": "The traditional central dogma of molecular biology has been expanded to incorporate genome resynthesis, orthogonal biosystems, and synthetic genetics. Recent advancements in synthetic biology have enabled the design and construction of novel genetic systems, allowing for the creation of orthogonal biosystems that can coexist and interact with native cellular processes. Genome resynthesis, facilitated by the discovery of unnatural base pairs and XNA (XNA nucleic acid) technologies, has opened up new avenues for genetic engineering and synthetic biology. This expanded central dogma has far-reaching implications for the design of novel biological pathways, the creation of novel biomaterials, and the development of novel therapeutics. The integration of genome resynthesis, orthogonal biosystems, and synthetic genetics promises to revolutionize our understanding of biological systems and enable the creation of novel biological entities."}
