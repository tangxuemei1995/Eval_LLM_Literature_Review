{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has revolutionized the field of structural biology by enabling the high-resolution imaging of intact biological samples. Recent advancements in cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) sample preparation have further enhanced the resolution and accuracy of cryo-ET, facilitating the discovery of novel viral structures and dynamics. This technology has led to a surge of in situ virological discoveries, revealing the intricate mechanisms of viral replication and transmission. The integration of cryo-ET and cryo-FIB has opened new avenues for understanding viral biology and has the potential to transform our understanding of viral diseases."}
