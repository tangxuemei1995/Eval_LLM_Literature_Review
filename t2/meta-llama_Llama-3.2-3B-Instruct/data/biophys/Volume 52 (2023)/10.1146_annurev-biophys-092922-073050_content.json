{"Abstract": "NLR (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domains-containing) resistosomes and inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play crucial roles in the innate immune response to microbial infections. Recent studies have elucidated the assembly and architecture of these complexes, revealing a dynamic interplay between autoinhibitory and activatory mechanisms. The resistosome channel, formed by the NLR protein, regulates the flow of NADase holoenzymes into the inflammasome, modulating its activation status. Ligand recognition by NLR proteins triggers a conformational change, releasing autoinhibitory peptides and allowing the inflammasome to assemble and activate. Understanding the assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes is essential for elucidating the mechanisms of innate immunity and developing therapeutic strategies against inflammatory diseases."}
