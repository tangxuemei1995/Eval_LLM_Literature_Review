{"Abstract": "The prediction of 3D structures of proteins and protein complexes has become a crucial aspect of structural biology, with significant implications for understanding protein function and disease mechanisms. However, the accuracy and reliability of these predictions remain a subject of ongoing debate. This critical assessment evaluates the current methods and tools used for protein structure prediction, with a focus on their strengths and limitations. A comprehensive analysis of the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) and Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) experiments reveals that artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown significant promise in improving prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, the evaluation of protein interactions remains a challenging task, with many methods exhibiting poor performance. This review highlights the current state of the field, discusses the key challenges and limitations, and provides recommendations for future research directions to improve the accuracy and reliability of protein structure prediction and interaction prediction methods."}
