{"Abstract": "Theoretical and practical aspects of multienzyme organization and encapsulation are crucial for advancing metabolic engineering. Bacterial microcompartments, protein scaffolds, and other biotechnological tools enable the compartmentalization of metabolic pathways, enhancing efficiency and product yield. This review synthesizes the current understanding of multienzyme organization, focusing on the theoretical frameworks and practical applications of these systems. Theoretical models, such as the 'catalytic site density' and 'enzyme loading' approaches, are discussed in relation to protein scaffold design and microcompartment formation. Practical aspects, including the engineering of metabolic pathways, protein expression, and microcompartment assembly, are also examined. The review highlights recent advances in the field, including the development of novel protein scaffolds and microcompartment types, and their potential applications in biotechnological processes, such as biofuel production and bioremediation. The integration of theoretical and practical knowledge is essential for the design of efficient and scalable metabolic engineering systems."}
