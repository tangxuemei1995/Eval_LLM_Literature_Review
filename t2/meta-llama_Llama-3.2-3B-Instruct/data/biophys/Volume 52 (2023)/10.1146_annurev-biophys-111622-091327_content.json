{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (CET) has revolutionized the field of structural biology by enabling the high-resolution, in situ imaging of complex cellular structures. By reconstructing 3D models of cells and their organelles, CET provides unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture of cells. This technique has been successfully applied to various cell types, revealing the intricate relationships between different cellular components. Biophysical modeling and quantitative cell biology approaches have further enhanced the understanding of CET data, allowing for the prediction of molecular interactions and dynamics. The integration of CET with these approaches has the potential to transform our understanding of cellular function and disease mechanisms."}
