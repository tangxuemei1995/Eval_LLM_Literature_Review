{"Abstract": "Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a crucial role in maintaining lipid homeostasis, drug extrusion, and overall human health. These membrane proteins utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport a wide range of substrates across cellular membranes. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the high-resolution structural characterization of human ABC transporters, revealing intricate mechanisms of substrate recognition and translocation. Structural studies have also highlighted the importance of specific residues and domains in regulating transporter activity and substrate specificity. Furthermore, the functional implications of these structural findings have been validated through biochemical and cellular assays. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of human ABC transporter structure and mechanism, with a focus on the implications for human disease and drug development. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of these transporters is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and the optimization of existing treatments."}
