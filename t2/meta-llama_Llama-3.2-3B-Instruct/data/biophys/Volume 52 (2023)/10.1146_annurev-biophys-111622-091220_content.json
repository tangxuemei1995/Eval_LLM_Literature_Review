{"Abstract": "Protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices is a crucial process that governs various cellular functions, including DNA search and transcription. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of electrostatics and disordered regions in modulating protein diffusion. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices, with a focus on the role of electrostatics and disordered regions. We discuss the impact of electrostatic interactions on protein diffusion, including the effects of charged residues and ionizable groups. Additionally, we examine the role of disordered regions, such as flexible loops and coils, in facilitating protein diffusion. Our analysis reveals that electrostatics and disordered regions can significantly influence protein diffusion rates and patterns, with implications for understanding DNA search and transcription. The findings of this review have important implications for the development of computational models and experimental approaches to study protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices."}
