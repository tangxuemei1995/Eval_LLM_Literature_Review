{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of anharmonic effects on the vibrational spectra of high-frequency modes in molecular systems. By employing a combination of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the role of mode mixing and anharmonicities in shaping the vibrational spectra of these modes. Our results show that anharmonic effects can lead to significant deviations from harmonic predictions, resulting in the appearance of resonances and broadening of spectral lines. We demonstrate that these effects are particularly pronounced in systems with high-frequency modes, where the vibrational energy levels are closely spaced. The findings of this study have important implications for the interpretation of vibrational spectroscopic data, particularly in the context of high-frequency modes. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between anharmonicities, mode mixing, and vibrational resonances, and highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to modeling high-frequency vibrational spectra."}
