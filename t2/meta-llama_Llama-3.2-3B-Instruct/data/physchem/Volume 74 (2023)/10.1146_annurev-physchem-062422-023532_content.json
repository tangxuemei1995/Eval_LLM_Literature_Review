{"Abstract": "The accurate representation of intermolecular interactions in aqueous systems is crucial for understanding various biological and chemical phenomena. This study explores the synergies between interaction analysis techniques and force field development, focusing on the many-body effects in aqueous systems. By employing a combination of experimental and computational methods, we investigate the limitations of current polarizable force fields and develop a novel many-body expansion approach. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of intermolecular interactions, particularly for systems involving hydrogen bonding and water dimerization. The proposed many-body expansion is validated through molecular dynamics simulations, showcasing enhanced stability and structural accuracy. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the development of more realistic force fields for aqueous systems, paving the way for further research in fields such as protein-ligand interactions and aqueous-phase chemistry. The proposed approach offers a promising avenue for improving the accuracy of simulations in aqueous environments."}
