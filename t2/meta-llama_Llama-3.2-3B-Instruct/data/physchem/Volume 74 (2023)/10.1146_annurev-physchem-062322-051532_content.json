{"Abstract": "The study of elementary molecular events is crucial for understanding the fundamental processes underlying chemical reactions and photochemical transformations. Ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for probing these events, leveraging the high-intensity, coherent radiation from free-electron lasers. By exploiting the unique properties of conical intersections, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy can provide direct insights into the electronic structure and dynamics of molecules. This review article highlights the recent advances in ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy, with a focus on its applications in studying conical intersections and photochemical reactions. Theoretical and experimental approaches are discussed, and the potential of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy is explored for elucidating the mechanisms of elementary molecular events, with implications for our understanding of chemical reactivity and photochemical transformations."}
