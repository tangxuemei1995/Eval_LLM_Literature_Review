{"Abstract": "We present a novel approach for 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging of microgels, utilizing a combination of adaptive optics and structured illumination nanoscopy. By leveraging the unique properties of microgels as adaptive materials, we develop a novel fluorescence labeling strategy that enables high-resolution imaging of microgel networks in three dimensions. Our approach involves the use of a custom-designed adaptive optics system to correct for aberrations and enhance signal-to-noise ratio, followed by structured illumination nanoscopy to achieve super-resolution imaging. Correlative microscopy techniques are employed to track microgel dynamics and morphology in real-time. The resulting 3D images reveal unprecedented details of microgel structure and behavior, providing new insights into the properties of polymer networks and adaptive materials. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging for studying complex microgel systems and opens up new avenues for research in materials science and biomedicine."}
