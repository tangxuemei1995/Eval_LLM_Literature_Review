{"Abstract": "The formation of stable glasses is a complex process influenced by surface-mediated equilibration, where the surface properties of the substrate play a crucial role in determining the glass transition temperature and structural anisotropy. This study investigates the surface-mediated formation of stable glasses through physical vapor deposition, focusing on the effects of enhanced surface mobility on glass transition and structural properties. The results show that the introduction of surface-mediated equilibration leads to the formation of stable glasses with enhanced surface mobility, resulting in reduced glass transition temperatures and increased structural anisotropy. These findings have significant implications for the design of stable glasses with tailored properties for various applications, including energy storage and optoelectronics."}
