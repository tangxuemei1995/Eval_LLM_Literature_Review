{"Abstract": "The adsorption of ions and molecules at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces is a complex phenomenon influenced by the unique properties of these interfaces. In this context, surface complexation and speciation play crucial roles in determining the adsorption behavior. This review focuses on the recent advances in understanding the adsorption of ions and molecules at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces, with a particular emphasis on the effects of nanoconfinement on surface complexation and speciation. Theoretical models and experimental studies are discussed, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between surface chemistry, electrostatic interactions, and confinement effects. The review also explores the implications of these findings for various applications, including water purification, catalysis, and biotechnology. Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on adsorption at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces and its potential for advancing our understanding of these complex systems."}
