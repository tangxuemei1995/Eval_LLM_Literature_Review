{"Abstract": "Gas-phase computational spectroscopy has emerged as a crucial tool for elucidating the molecular structures and properties of biological molecules, often referred to as the'molecular bricks of life'. This field combines advanced computational methods with experimental spectroscopic techniques to investigate the rotational and vibrational spectra of molecules in the gas phase. However, the complexity of biological molecules, characterized by their flexibility and anharmonicity, poses significant challenges for computational spectroscopy. Anharmonicity, in particular, introduces non-linear effects that significantly impact the rotational and vibrational spectra. Recent advances in computational methods, such as coupled-cluster theory and machine learning algorithms, have improved the accuracy of spectroscopic predictions. Nevertheless, further research is needed to fully exploit the potential of gas-phase computational spectroscopy for understanding the molecular structures and properties of biological molecules."}
