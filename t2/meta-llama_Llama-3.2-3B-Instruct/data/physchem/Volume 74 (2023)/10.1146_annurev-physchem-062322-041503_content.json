{"Abstract": "This study investigates the spectroscopic properties of clusters of atmospheric relevance, focusing on their formation mechanisms and implications for climate. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of spectroscopic data, we examine the role of new particle formation in the creation of clusters. Our findings suggest that clusters play a crucial role in the atmospheric chemistry of aerosols, influencing the formation of cloud condensation nuclei and the radiative properties of the atmosphere. Spectroscopic techniques, including Raman and Rayleigh scattering, are employed to characterize the optical and electronic properties of clusters. The results indicate that clusters exhibit unique optical signatures, which can be used to distinguish them from other aerosol species. Our research highlights the importance of spectroscopic studies in understanding the complex interactions between atmospheric aerosols and climate, and provides new insights into the mechanisms governing new particle formation."}
