{"Abstract": "This coda honors the scientific legacy of Phillip L. Geissler, a pioneer in the intersection of statistical mechanics, chemical dynamics, and biological systems. Geissler's work in aqueous environments and algorithm development significantly advanced our understanding of complex biological systems, leaving a lasting impact on the field of model development."}
