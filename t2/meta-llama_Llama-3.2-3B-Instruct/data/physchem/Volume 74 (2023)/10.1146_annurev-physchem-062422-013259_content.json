{"Abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting electronic structures and properties of materials. However, the accuracy of DFT calculations is heavily dependent on the choice of exchange-correlation functional and the imposition of exact constraints. This study investigates the predictive power of exact constraints and appropriate norms in DFT, with a focus on the exchange-correlation energy. We examine the impact of different exchange-correlation functionals on the accuracy of DFT predictions, and demonstrate that the use of exact constraints can significantly improve the accuracy of DFT calculations. Furthermore, we show that the choice of appropriate norms can also have a substantial impact on the predictive power of DFT. Our results suggest that the combination of exact constraints and appropriate norms can lead to more accurate predictions of electronic structures and properties, and have implications for the development of more reliable DFT functionals. The findings of this study contribute to the ongoing quest for a more accurate and reliable DFT."}
