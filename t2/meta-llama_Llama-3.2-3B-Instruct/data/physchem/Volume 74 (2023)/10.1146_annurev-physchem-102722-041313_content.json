{"Abstract": "In situ measurement of evolving excited-state dynamics during the deposition and processing of organic films is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms governing their optical properties. This study presents a novel single-shot transient absorption spectroscopy setup designed for in situ monitoring of organic thin film formation and thermal annealing. Utilizing a femtosecond laser source and a high-speed camera, the setup enables real-time observation of molecular aggregation and excited-state relaxation processes. The results demonstrate the ability to track the evolution of excited-state dynamics during film deposition and thermal annealing, revealing distinct changes in molecular structure and optical properties. These findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of organic thin films for various applications, including optoelectronic devices and solar cells."}
