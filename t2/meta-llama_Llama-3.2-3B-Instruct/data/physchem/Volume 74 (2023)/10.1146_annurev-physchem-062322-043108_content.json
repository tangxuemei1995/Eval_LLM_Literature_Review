{"Abstract": "The magneto-optical properties of noble metal nanostructures have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in spin-based technologies. This review focuses on the plasmon-mediated magneto-optics of superatoms, which exhibit unique spin-polarized emission and magnetic circular photoluminescence characteristics. Theoretical models and experimental studies demonstrate that the nanostructured geometry of noble metals can give rise to enhanced spin polarization, leading to the observation of magnetic circular dichroism. The review discusses the role of superatoms in modulating the magneto-optical response, including the influence of surface plasmon resonance and spin-orbit coupling. The findings of this review highlight the potential of noble metal nanostructures for the development of spin-based devices, such as spin-based sensors and magnetic data storage devices. The review also discusses the challenges and limitations of current research in this field and future directions for investigation."}
