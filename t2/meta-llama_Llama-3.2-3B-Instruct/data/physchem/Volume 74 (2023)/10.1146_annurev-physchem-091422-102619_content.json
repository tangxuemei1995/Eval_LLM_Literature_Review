{"Abstract": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a widely used biomarker in biological research, emitting light at a wavelength of 508 nm upon excitation. However, the underlying photoacid dynamics that govern its fluorescence behavior remain poorly understood. Utilizing ultrafast spectroscopic techniques, including stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we investigated the coherence and proton tunneling processes in GFP. Our results reveal a complex interplay between electronic and nuclear dynamics, leading to a non-radiative decay pathway that competes with fluorescence emission. The observed proton tunneling events facilitate the formation of a photoacid state, which in turn influences the fluorescence yield. These findings provide new insights into the ultrafast photochemistry of GFP, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms governing its fluorescence behavior and have significant implications for the design of novel fluorescent probes and biosensors."}
