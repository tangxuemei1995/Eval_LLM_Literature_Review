{"Abstract": "The Artificial Force Induced Reaction Method (AFIRM) is a novel approach for discovering new reactions through the manipulation of potential energy surfaces. By leveraging quantum chemical calculations and kinetic simulations, AFIRM enables the prediction of reaction pathways and the identification of potential reaction mechanisms. This method involves the use of a reaction path network to model the energy landscape of a reaction system, and the application of artificial forces to perturb the potential energy surface and induce new reaction pathways. The resulting reaction pathways are then simulated to predict the kinetic outcomes of the reactions. In this study, we demonstrate the application of AFIRM to the discovery of new organic synthesis reactions. Our results show that AFIRM can successfully predict novel reaction pathways and identify potential reaction mechanisms, with a high degree of accuracy. The findings of this study have significant implications for the discovery of new reactions and the development of novel synthetic methods in organic chemistry."}
