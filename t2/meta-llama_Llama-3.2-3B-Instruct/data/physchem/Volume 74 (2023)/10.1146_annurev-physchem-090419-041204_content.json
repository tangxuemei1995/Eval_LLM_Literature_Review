{"Abstract": "Site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder in various biological contexts. By incorporating site-specific fluorescence labels, this technique enables the probing of specific DNA sequences and their interactions with proteins, thereby providing insights into DNA replication and protein-DNA interactions. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of this approach in elucidating the conformational dynamics of DNA, including DNA breathing and breathing-like motions. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of DNA structure and function, and have the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with DNA conformational disorders. Further research is needed to fully explore the capabilities and limitations of this technique, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing DNA conformational dynamics."}
