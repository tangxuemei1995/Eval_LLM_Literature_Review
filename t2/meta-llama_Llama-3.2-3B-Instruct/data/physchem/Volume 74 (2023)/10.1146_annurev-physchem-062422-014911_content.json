{"Abstract": "Photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures is a complex process involving the generation of nonthermal carriers, such as hot electrons, which can lead to photocatalytic activities. In the steady state, these carriers interact with the surrounding environment, influencing the material's optical and electrical properties. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying photothermalization, focusing on the role of metallic nanoparticles and the impact of Raman thermometry on understanding the thermal dynamics. The interplay between hot electrons, phonons, and the material's lattice is also discussed, highlighting the potential applications of plasmonic nanostructures in photocatalytic processes and thermal management."}
