{"Abstract": "Molecular organic aggregates, such as J-aggregates and H-aggregates, have garnered significant attention in the field of optoelectronics due to their potential applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), solar cells, and photovoltaic devices. The excited states of these aggregates play a crucial role in determining their optoelectronic properties. This review article focuses on the theoretical modeling of excited states in molecular organic aggregates, with a particular emphasis on radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. The role of conical intersections and exciton models in understanding the dynamics of excited states is also discussed. Furthermore, the impact of singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation on the optoelectronic properties of these aggregates is examined. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of excited-state dynamics, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential applications of molecular organic aggregates in optoelectronic devices."}
