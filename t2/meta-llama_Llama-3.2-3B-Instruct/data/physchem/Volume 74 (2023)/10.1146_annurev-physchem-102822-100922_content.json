{"Abstract": "Many-body exciton scattering is a fundamental process in quantum optics, where the interaction between excitons and their environment leads to decoherence and dephasing. In this context, the optical signatures of stochastic processes play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of quantum systems. This study employs quantum stochastic calculus to investigate the effects of many-body interactions on the coherent nonlinear spectroscopy of excitons. By analyzing the excitation-induced dephasing, we reveal the intricate interplay between quantum fluctuations and classical noise in the exciton dynamics. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering stochastic processes in the theoretical description of many-body exciton scattering, and provide a framework for the development of more accurate models of quantum optics in complex systems."}
