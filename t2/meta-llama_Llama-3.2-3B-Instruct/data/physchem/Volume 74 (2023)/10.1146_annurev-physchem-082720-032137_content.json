{"Abstract": "Lanthanide-based upconverting nanoparticles have garnered significant attention for their potential in emerging applications, including X-ray detection, optical patterning, and photon-avalanching enabled photoswitching. The photodarkening and photobrightening properties of these nanoparticles are crucial for their functionality, with color centers playing a pivotal role in modulating light emission. This review highlights the intricate relationship between color centers, photon avalanching, and photoswitching in lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles. We discuss the impact of color centers on the optical properties of these nanoparticles, including their role in enhancing X-ray detection capabilities and facilitating optical patterning. The findings of this review provide a comprehensive understanding of the photodarkening, photobrightening, and color center-mediated mechanisms underlying the emerging applications of lanthanide-based upconverting nanoparticles."}
