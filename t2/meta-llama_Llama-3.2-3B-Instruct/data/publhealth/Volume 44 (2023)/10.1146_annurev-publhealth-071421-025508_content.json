{"Abstract": "Extreme heat events pose a significant threat to public health, particularly in vulnerable populations. As climate change exacerbates heatwaves, it is essential to develop effective public health preparedness strategies. This study examines the current state of public health preparedness for extreme heat events, highlighting the need for integrated heat action plans that incorporate disaster risk reduction measures. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that heat action plans are often fragmented and lack a clear framework for implementation. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates heat action plans with existing disaster risk reduction frameworks. Our findings suggest that this integrated approach can improve public health outcomes during extreme heat events, particularly for vulnerable populations. The proposed framework provides a foundation for policymakers and public health practitioners to develop effective heat action plans that prioritize disaster risk reduction and public health protection."}
