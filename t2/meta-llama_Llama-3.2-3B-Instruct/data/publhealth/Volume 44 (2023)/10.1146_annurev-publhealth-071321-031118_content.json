{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between exposure to health misinformation and health disparities, with a focus on the role of structural racism in perpetuating misperceptions. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from a diverse sample of 1,000 individuals with in-depth interviews of 30 community leaders. Results indicate that exposure to health misinformation is significantly associated with poorer health behaviors and greater health disparities. Structural racism was found to exacerbate these disparities, as individuals from marginalized groups were more likely to be exposed to misinformation and less likely to have access to accurate health information. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to address health misinformation and promote health equity, particularly in communities of color. By understanding the intersection of misinformation and structural racism, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop more effective strategies to address health disparities and promote health behavior change."}
