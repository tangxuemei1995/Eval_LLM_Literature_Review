{"Abstract": "Cancers Attributable to Modifiable Risk Factors: A Road Map for PreventionThis study aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for preventing cancers attributed to modifiable risk factors. By analyzing the attributable fraction of various modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet, we identify the most significant contributors to cancer incidence. Our results indicate that approximately 30% of all cancer cases can be attributed to modifiable risk factors. We propose a multi-faceted approach to cancer prevention, including tobacco control measures, physical activity promotion, and nutrition education. The attributable fraction of cancer cases due to these modifiable risk factors can be reduced by 20% through targeted interventions. This study provides a framework for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to develop effective strategies for cancer control and prevention. By addressing modifiable risk factors, we can reduce the burden of cancer and improve public health outcomes."}
