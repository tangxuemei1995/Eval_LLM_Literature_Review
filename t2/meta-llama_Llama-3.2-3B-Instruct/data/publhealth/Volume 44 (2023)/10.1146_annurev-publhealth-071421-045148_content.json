{"Abstract": "This study examines the interplay between climatic and environmental change, migration, and health, highlighting the complex relationships between these factors. Climate change-induced displacement and relocation have become increasingly prevalent, leading to significant health disparities among affected populations. The literature review reveals that environmental degradation, heat stress, and vector-borne diseases are among the primary health concerns associated with climate migration. Furthermore, the psychological impacts of displacement, including anxiety and depression, are also significant. The study suggests that addressing climate change and migration requires a comprehensive approach that incorporates health interventions, environmental mitigation strategies, and social support services. By exploring the intersections between climate change, migration, and health, this research aims to inform policy and practice, ultimately contributing to the development of effective strategies for mitigating the health consequences of climate migration."}
