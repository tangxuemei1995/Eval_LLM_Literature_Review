{"Abstract": "This study examines the potential of mobile technology to promote public health through the integration of physical activity tracking, culturally relevant personalized medicine, and behavior change theories. A multidisciplinary approach was employed, combining insights from health psychology, computer science, and sociology to develop a wearable sensor-based system. The system utilizes data from wearable sensors to track physical activity and provide personalized feedback, while also incorporating culturally relevant messaging to promote behavior change. The findings suggest that the system is effective in increasing physical activity levels and promoting health behavior change among participants. The results also highlight the importance of culturally relevant personalized medicine in improving health outcomes. The study's implications for public health promotion and the potential of mobile technology to support behavior change are discussed, with recommendations for future research and implementation."}
