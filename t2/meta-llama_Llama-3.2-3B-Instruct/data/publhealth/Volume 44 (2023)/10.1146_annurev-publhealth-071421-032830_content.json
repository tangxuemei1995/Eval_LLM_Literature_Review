{"Abstract": "The US public health workforce faces significant challenges in terms of recruitment, retention, and workforce development. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals ongoing struggles to enumerate and track workforce data, hindering informed decision-making and strategic planning. Recruitment efforts are often hindered by limited funding, inadequate training programs, and a lack of clear career pathways. Retention issues are exacerbated by burnout, lack of autonomy, and limited opportunities for professional growth. To address these challenges, future directions should prioritize workforce development initiatives, including evidence-based training programs, mentorship opportunities, and career advancement pathways. Additionally, efforts to improve workforce enumeration and tracking are crucial to inform policy decisions and allocate resources effectively. By addressing these challenges, the US public health workforce can be strengthened, ensuring a more effective and sustainable response to public health needs."}
