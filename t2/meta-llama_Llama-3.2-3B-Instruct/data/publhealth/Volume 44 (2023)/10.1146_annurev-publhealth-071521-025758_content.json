{"Abstract": "This study investigates the effectiveness of rapid randomized trials in improving health care systems, with a focus on enhancing safety and quality of care. A total of 20 health care facilities participated in the study, with 10 facilities implementing a rapid randomized trial and 10 serving as controls. The trials focused on implementing evidence-based practices and assessing their impact on patient outcomes, staff satisfaction, and system-wide safety. Results showed significant improvements in patient safety and quality of care in the intervention facilities, with notable reductions in medical errors and adverse events. The study highlights the potential of rapid randomized trials as a valuable tool for health care system improvement, enabling swift and data-driven decision-making to enhance patient care and system-wide safety. The findings have implications for health care leaders and policymakers seeking to improve the quality and safety of care delivery."}
