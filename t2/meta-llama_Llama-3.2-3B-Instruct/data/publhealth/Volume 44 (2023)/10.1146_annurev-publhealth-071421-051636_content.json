{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the public health implications of drought in a climate change context, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of human populations to drought-related health risks. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies on drought trends, human health, and drought risk management. The findings indicate that droughts exacerbate existing health inequalities, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the poor, elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. Climate change is projected to intensify drought frequency and severity, leading to increased mortality, morbidity, and displacement. Effective drought risk management strategies, including early warning systems, water conservation measures, and social protection programs, are essential to mitigate the public health impacts of drought. This review provides a critical framework for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to address the complex relationships between drought, climate change, and human health."}
