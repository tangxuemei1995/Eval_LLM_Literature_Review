{"Abstract": "This study examines the interplay between early childhood education, health, and economic outcomes, with a focus on equity disparities. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that high-quality early childhood education is crucial for promoting healthy child development, social-emotional learning, and long-term economic success. However, unequal access to early childhood education exacerbates existing health and economic disparities, particularly among disadvantaged populations. The findings suggest that targeted interventions, such as universal pre-kindergarten programs and home visiting initiatives, can help bridge the gap in early childhood education and improve health and economic outcomes for disadvantaged children. Policymakers and educators must prioritize equity and inclusivity in early childhood education to mitigate the negative consequences of inequality and promote a more equitable society. By addressing the complex relationships between early childhood education, health, and economics, this study contributes to the development of evidence-based policies and programs that promote healthy child development and economic mobility."}
