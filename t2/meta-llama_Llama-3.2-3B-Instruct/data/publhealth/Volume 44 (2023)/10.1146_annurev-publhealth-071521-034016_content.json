{"Abstract": "The mass incarceration of individuals in the United States has led to a significant increase in the number of prisoners requiring healthcare services within correctional facilities. This phenomenon has sparked a growing concern regarding the prioritization of public health within the prison system. Decarceration efforts have been proposed as a potential solution to alleviate the burden on correctional healthcare services. However, the implementation of decarceration strategies poses significant challenges, including the need for adequate post-release support services and the potential for increased recidivism rates. This review aims to examine the current state of public health within prisons, with a focus on the priorities that must be addressed in the age of mass incarceration. The literature suggests that correctional healthcare services are often inadequate, leading to poor health outcomes among prisoners. Decarceration efforts must be accompanied by a comprehensive approach to addressing the social determinants of health that contribute to incarceration. By prioritizing public health within prisons, policymakers can work towards reducing recidivism rates and promoting the overall well-being of individuals within the correctional system."}
