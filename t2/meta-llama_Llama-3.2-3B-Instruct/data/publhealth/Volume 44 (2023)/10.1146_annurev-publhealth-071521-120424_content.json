{"Abstract": "This literature review examines the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes globally, highlighting statistical challenges and the role of data visualization in evidence synthesis. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed journals yielded 250 studies, which were evaluated for methodological quality and thematic relevance. The findings indicate a significant association between air pollution exposure and increased risk of severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and mortality. Statistical challenges, such as confounding variables and spatial heterogeneity, were identified as major obstacles to accurately modeling the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes. Data visualization techniques, including spatial and temporal analysis, were found to enhance the interpretation of complex data and facilitate the identification of high-risk areas. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for further research on the intersection of air pollution and COVID-19, with a focus on developing effective data visualization tools and statistical models to inform public health policy."}
