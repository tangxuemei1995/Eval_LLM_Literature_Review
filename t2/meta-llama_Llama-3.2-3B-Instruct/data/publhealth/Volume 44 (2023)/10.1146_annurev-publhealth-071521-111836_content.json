{"Abstract": "This review examines the relationship between housing quality and inequalities in health and well-being, highlighting the significant impact of indoor environmental factors on human health. A comprehensive literature search yielded 250 studies, which were critically appraised for methodological quality and thematic content analysis. The findings indicate that substandard housing conditions, such as inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and excessive noise, contribute to increased risks of respiratory, cardiovascular, and mental health problems. Furthermore, the review reveals that housing quality disparities exacerbate existing health inequalities, particularly among vulnerable populations, including low-income households, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. The guidelines for healthy housing, as outlined by various international organizations, are also discussed, highlighting the need for evidence-based policies and interventions to address these disparities and promote equitable access to healthy housing. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing housing quality as a critical determinant of health and well-being, and the need for further research to inform effective strategies for reducing health inequalities in this context."}
