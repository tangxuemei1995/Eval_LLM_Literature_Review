{"Abstract": "Environmental justice, a concept born out of the civil rights movement, has been a pressing concern for decades, with a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. This issue is deeply intertwined with environmental racism, where communities of color are subjected to pollution, toxic waste, and inadequate access to green spaces, leading to significant racial health disparities. Structural racism perpetuates these injustices, as policies and practices are often designed to maintain the status quo, rather than addressing the root causes of environmental degradation. Despite the progress made in recent years, environmental justice remains a contentious issue, with ongoing debates surrounding the role of health advocacy and activism in driving change. This abstract reviews the historical context of environmental justice, its relationship with environmental racism, and the current state of health disparities, highlighting the need for continued health activism and policy reform to address the systemic inequalities faced by marginalized communities."}
