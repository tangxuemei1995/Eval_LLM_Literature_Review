{"Abstract": "This study aimed to develop and validate a novel approach for enhancing capacity for food and nutrient intake assessment in population sciences research. A regression calibration method was employed to address measurement error in dietary assessment, which is a significant challenge in nutritional epidemiology. The proposed approach integrated multiple sources of data, including self-reported food diaries, 24-hour recalls, and biochemical biomarkers. A calibration model was developed to reconcile discrepancies between these sources, resulting in improved accuracy and reliability of nutrient intake estimates. The proposed method was evaluated using a large cohort study, demonstrating significant reductions in measurement error and improved regression calibration. The findings of this study have important implications for population sciences research, enabling more accurate and reliable assessments of food and nutrient intake, which is essential for understanding the relationships between diet and health outcomes."}
