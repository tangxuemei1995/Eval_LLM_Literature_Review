{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted impacts of paid family and medical leave (PFML) on worker health, family well-being, and employer outcomes. A mixed-methods approach combining survey data and employer interviews was employed to investigate the effects of PFML on employee well-being, job satisfaction, and productivity. Results indicate that PFML significantly improves worker health, reduces stress, and enhances family well-being. Employers also reported positive outcomes, including increased employee retention, reduced turnover rates, and improved morale. Furthermore, PFML was found to have a positive impact on employer outcomes, such as reduced absenteeism and presenteeism. The findings suggest that PFML is a valuable policy intervention that can have far-reaching benefits for both workers and employers. The study's results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of PFML in promoting work-life balance and supporting the well-being of employees and employers alike."}
