{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust and efficient public health surveillance systems to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. This review aims to summarize recent innovations in public health surveillance for emerging infections, with a focus on the integration of advanced technologies such as spatial modeling and artificial intelligence. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies that have developed and evaluated novel surveillance approaches, including the use of national notifiable disease reporting systems, machine learning algorithms, and geospatial analysis. The findings suggest that these innovations have improved the timeliness and accuracy of disease detection, enabling more effective public health responses. Spatial modeling techniques have been shown to enhance the identification of high-risk areas and facilitate the allocation of resources. Artificial intelligence has been used to analyze large datasets and identify patterns that may not be apparent through traditional surveillance methods. The integration of these technologies has the potential to revolutionize public health surveillance, enabling more effective prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases. By leveraging these innovations, public health systems can improve their ability to detect and respond to emerging threats, ultimately reducing the burden of infectious disease on communities worldwide."}
