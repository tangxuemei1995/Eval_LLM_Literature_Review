{"Abstract": "Gentrification, a process of urban renewal driven by affluent residents and investors, poses significant threats to health equity in urban areas. This theoretical and methodological guide explores the intersections of gentrification, displacement, and urban regeneration, highlighting the need to prevent or mitigate its adverse effects on vulnerable populations. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, this guide identifies key factors contributing to gentrification, including socioeconomic, demographic, and policy-driven drivers. It also discusses the consequences of gentrification on urban health, including increased stress, decreased access to affordable healthcare, and heightened risk of chronic diseases. By examining the complex relationships between gentrification, displacement, and health equity, this guide provides a framework for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to develop effective strategies for promoting health equity in the face of gentrification."}
