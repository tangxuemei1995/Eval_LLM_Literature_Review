{"Abstract": "This study examines the value and impacts of academic public health departments (AHDs) in promoting evidence-based decision-making and addressing health disparities. A systematic review of existing literature reveals that AHDs play a crucial role in bridging the gap between academic research and public health practice. Through partnerships with community-based organizations and healthcare systems, AHDs facilitate the translation of research findings into actionable policies and interventions. The findings highlight the critical role of AHDs in promoting health equity, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. AHDs have been instrumental in developing and disseminating culturally sensitive interventions, addressing health inequities, and improving health outcomes for vulnerable populations. The study concludes that AHDs are essential components of a robust public health infrastructure, and their continued support is vital for addressing the complex health challenges facing communities worldwide."}
