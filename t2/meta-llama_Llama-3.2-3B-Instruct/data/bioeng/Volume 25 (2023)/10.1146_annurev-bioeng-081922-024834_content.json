{"Abstract": "The proliferation of health technologies has transformed the way healthcare is delivered, but their impact on diverse populations remains a pressing concern. This overview synthesizes human- and equity-centered approaches for health technology design, highlighting the importance of contextual investigation and community engagement. By prioritizing stakeholder involvement, researchers and designers can develop technologies that address the unique needs of marginalized communities. A review of existing literature reveals that equity-centered engineering can foster more inclusive and effective health technologies. Contextual investigation and community engagement are critical components of this approach, enabling designers to understand the social, cultural, and environmental contexts in which technologies will be used. By adopting a human- and equity-centered design paradigm, health technologies can be created that promote health equity, improve health outcomes, and address the social determinants of health."}
