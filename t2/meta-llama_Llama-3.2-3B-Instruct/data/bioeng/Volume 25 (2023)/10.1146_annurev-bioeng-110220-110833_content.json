{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neural plasticity underlying sensorimotor brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs), with a focus on sensory and motor learning. By analyzing neural activity in individuals with BMIs, we demonstrate significant reorganization of neural circuits in response to repeated training sessions. Our findings suggest that neural plasticity plays a crucial role in improving BMI performance, particularly in sensory processing. These results have implications for the development of more effective BMIs and highlight the potential for neural plasticity to be harnessed for neuroprosthetic applications."}
