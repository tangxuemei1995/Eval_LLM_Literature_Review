{"Abstract": "The development of penetrating neural electrodes has revolutionized the field of electrophysiology, enabling the recording of neural activity from deep brain regions with unprecedented spatial resolution. Recent advancements in materials science and fabrication techniques have led to the creation of electrodes that can penetrate large distances into the brain, paving the way for the study of complex neural circuits and the treatment of neurological disorders. However, the long-term viability and scalability of these electrodes remain significant challenges. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of penetrating neural electrodes, highlighting their applications in electrophysiology and the challenges associated with their large-scale deployment and chronic use. We discuss the latest developments in electrode design, fabrication, and implantation techniques, as well as the potential risks and benefits of these technologies."}
