{"Abstract": "The Internet of Bodies (IoB) is a rapidly emerging paradigm that integrates wearable and implantable devices to monitor and manage human health. Bioelectronic sensor nodes play a crucial role in this ecosystem, enabling real-time sensing, in-sensor analytics, and computation. These nodes integrate advanced biosensing technologies with miniaturized computing and communication capabilities, facilitating the exchange of vast amounts of data between devices and the cloud. However, the security and powering of these nodes pose significant challenges. This review provides an overview of the current state of bioelectronic sensor nodes for the IoB, highlighting recent advances in sensing technologies, in-sensor analytics, and power management. We discuss the implications of these advancements for IoB applications, including health monitoring, disease diagnosis, and personalized medicine. The review also explores the security challenges associated with IoB devices and proposes potential solutions for secure communication and data protection. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and challenges presented by bioelectronic sensor nodes in the IoB."}
