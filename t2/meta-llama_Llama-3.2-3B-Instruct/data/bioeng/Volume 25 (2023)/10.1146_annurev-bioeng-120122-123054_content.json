{"Abstract": "Aging is a complex, multifaceted process that affects individuals and societies worldwide, with significant implications for health, productivity, and quality of life. Recent advances in our understanding of biological clocks, senescence, and the molecular mechanisms underlying aging have led to the development of innovative anti-aging strategies. These approaches, including senolytic therapy, epigenetic reprogramming, and caloric restriction mimetics, aim to reverse or halt the aging process, thereby preventing age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Progeria, a rare genetic disorder characterized by premature aging, has also become a model for understanding the underlying biology of aging and developing effective therapeutic interventions. This review provides an overview of current trends in anti-aging research, highlighting the most promising strategies and their potential applications in promoting healthy aging and preventing age-related diseases."}
