{"Abstract": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging enables the non-invasive monitoring of cellular and tissue-level metabolic processes, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of energy metabolism. This approach leverages the inherent autofluorescence and fluorescence lifetime properties of biomolecules, such as NADH and FAD, to detect changes in redox state and metabolic flux. Multiphoton microscopy and two-photon excited fluorescence techniques have been employed to visualize metabolic processes in cells and tissues with high spatial and temporal resolution. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of label-free optical metabolic imaging in monitoring glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in real-time, allowing for the elucidation of metabolic network dynamics and the identification of key regulatory nodes. The application of this approach has far-reaching implications for the study of metabolic disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, enabling the development of novel therapeutic strategies and diagnostic tools. By elucidating the intricate relationships between metabolic processes and tissue function, label-free optical metabolic imaging holds promise for advancing our understanding of the complex interplay between metabolism and disease."}
