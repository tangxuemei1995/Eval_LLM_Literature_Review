{"Abstract": "Chronic pain is a debilitating condition affecting millions worldwide, with current treatments often yielding limited success. Recent advancements in neurotechnology have provided novel approaches to pain management, targeting both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promise in reducing chronic pain by modulating brain activity, while spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) offer peripheral-based interventions. These technologies have been shown to improve pain outcomes in various patient populations. However, the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their efficacy. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of neurotechnology for pain management, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of these interventions. By examining the existing literature, we hope to inform the development of personalized treatment plans for patients with chronic pain."}
