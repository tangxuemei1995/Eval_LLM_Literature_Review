{"Abstract": "Sex as a biological variable plays a crucial role in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, influencing the development and function of engineered tissues. Sexual dimorphism and sex differences in gene expression, hormone levels, and cellular behavior necessitate the use of sex-specific tissue models and stem cell populations. This review highlights the importance of considering sex characteristics in the design and optimization of tissue engineering strategies, including the selection of appropriate cell types, growth factors, and biomaterials. By accounting for sex differences, researchers can improve the efficacy and translational potential of regenerative therapies, ultimately leading to more effective treatments for sex-related diseases and disorders."}
