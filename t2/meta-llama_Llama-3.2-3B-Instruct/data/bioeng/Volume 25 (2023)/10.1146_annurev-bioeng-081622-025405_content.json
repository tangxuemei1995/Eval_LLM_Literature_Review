{"Abstract": "Photoacoustic imaging and characterization of bone in medicine has emerged as a promising non-invasive technique for assessing bone health and detecting various bone-related disorders. This review provides an overview of the principles, applications, and current state of photoacoustic imaging in bone characterization. Quantitative ultrasound is highlighted as a key technology for photoacoustic imaging, enabling accurate bone density and composition measurements. Spectral unmixing is also discussed as a crucial post-processing technique for separating overlapping spectral signals and improving image quality. The applications of photoacoustic imaging in bone characterization are diverse, including osteoporosis diagnosis, bone tumor detection, and monitoring of bone healing. The outlook for this technology is promising, with ongoing research focused on improving image resolution, reducing acquisition times, and expanding its clinical utility."}
