{"Abstract": "Epitranscriptional regulation, a layer of gene expression beyond transcriptional control, plays a crucial role in cardiovascular health and disease. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of epitranscriptomic modifications, such as RNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, in regulating gene expression in cardiovascular tissues. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of epitranscriptional regulation in the cardiovascular system, with a focus on its implications for cardiovascular bioengineering. We discuss the mechanisms by which epitranscriptomic modifications influence cardiovascular gene regulation, including their impact on cardiac development, function, and disease. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of epitranscriptional regulation in cardiovascular bioengineering, including the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between epitranscriptional regulation and cardiovascular health, and underscore the need for further research in this area."}
