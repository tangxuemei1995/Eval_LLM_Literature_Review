{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of nanotechnologies in developing physiology-informed drug delivery systems targeting the lymphatic system. Engineered nanoparticles were designed to interact with lymph nodes, facilitating targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Bioengineered biomaterials were used to create a lymphatic conduit, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Results demonstrate improved therapeutic outcomes and reduced side effects, paving the way for innovative cancer treatments and immunomodulatory therapies."}
