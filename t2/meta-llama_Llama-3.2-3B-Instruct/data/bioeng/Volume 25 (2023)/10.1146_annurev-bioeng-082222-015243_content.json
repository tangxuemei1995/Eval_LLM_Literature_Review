{"Abstract": "Engineered compounds have been designed to control ice nucleation and recrystallization, two critical processes in frozen food preservation and cryopreservation. By incorporating glyco-proteins, such as antifreeze proteins, into food matrices, researchers have successfully reduced ice nucleation rates and enhanced thermal hysteresis. These engineered compounds exhibit unique properties, including the ability to inhibit ice recrystallization, thereby maintaining a more uniform microstructure and texture. The application of these engineered compounds has significant implications for the development of novel food preservation strategies and cryoprotective agents, with potential benefits for industries such as food processing and pharmaceuticals."}
