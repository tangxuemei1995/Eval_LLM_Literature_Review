{"Abstract": "Hemolysis, a condition characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells, is a significant clinical concern. The accumulation of free heme and iron can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage. This study focuses on the development of engineered therapeutics to detoxify hemoglobin, heme, and iron. We designed and characterized a novel heme-binding protein, Hemopexin-iron chelator fusion protein (HICFP), which selectively binds to free heme and iron, preventing their release into the bloodstream. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the efficacy of HICFP in reducing oxidative stress and mitigating hemolysis. These findings suggest that engineered therapeutics targeting heme and iron detoxification may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating hemolytic disorders, and further research is warranted to explore their potential applications."}
