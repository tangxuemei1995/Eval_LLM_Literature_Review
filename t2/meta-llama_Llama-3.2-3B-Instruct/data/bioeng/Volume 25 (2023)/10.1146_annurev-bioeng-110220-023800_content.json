{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in electroporation technologies have significantly expanded their applications from bench to clinic. Pulsed field ablation and electrochemotherapy have shown promise in treating various cancers, while microfluidics has improved transfection efficiency. Gene therapy has also benefited from electroporation, enabling targeted delivery of therapeutic genes. These innovations have paved the way for more effective and minimally invasive treatments, offering new hope for patients with previously untreatable diseases. Ongoing research continues to refine electroporation technologies for clinical applications."}
