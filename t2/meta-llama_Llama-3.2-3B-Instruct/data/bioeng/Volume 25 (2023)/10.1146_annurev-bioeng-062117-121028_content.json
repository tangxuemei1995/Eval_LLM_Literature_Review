{"Abstract": "Dehydration is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt detection and treatment. Traditional methods of hydration assessment, such as clinical evaluation and laboratory tests, can be time-consuming and invasive. Recent advancements in wearable technology and medical devices have led to the development of noninvasive hydration monitoring systems. These systems utilize various sensors and algorithms to track changes in physiological parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity, to detect dehydration. This review aims to evaluate the current state of noninvasive hydration monitoring technologies and their potential applications in clinical settings. We examine the accuracy, reliability, and limitations of existing devices and discuss the future directions for research and development in this field. Our findings suggest that noninvasive hydration monitoring holds promise for improving early detection and treatment of dehydration, but further studies are needed to establish its clinical utility."}
