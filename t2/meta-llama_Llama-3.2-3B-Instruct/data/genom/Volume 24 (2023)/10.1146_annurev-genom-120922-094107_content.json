{"Abstract": "Skeletal dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormal bone development, leading to variations in stature. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play crucial roles in regulating bone growth and development. Recent studies have implicated dysregulation of these pathways in skeletal dysplasias, resulting in short and tall stature phenotypes. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways in skeletal dysplasia, with a focus on their role in regulating bone growth and development. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of these pathways in skeletal dysplasias, and explore the implications for our understanding of the underlying biology of these disorders. The review also highlights the potential therapeutic strategies for targeting these pathways in the treatment of skeletal dysplasias, with a focus on improving outcomes for individuals with short and tall stature phenotypes."}
