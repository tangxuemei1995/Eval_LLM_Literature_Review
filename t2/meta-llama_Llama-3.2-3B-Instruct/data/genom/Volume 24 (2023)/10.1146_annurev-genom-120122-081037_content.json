{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder caused by a point mutation in the HBB gene, leading to hemoglobin polymerization and red blood cell destruction. Recent advances in genetic modifiers, gene therapy trials, and gene editing technologies have provided new avenues for treating SCD. This review highlights the current understanding of SCD's pathophysiology and the emerging role of genetic modifiers in modulating disease severity. Gene therapy trials utilizing viral vectors have shown promising results in reducing hemoglobin polymerization and improving red blood cell survival. Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, hold great promise for correcting the underlying genetic defect. However, concerns regarding genotoxicity and off-target effects must be addressed. By integrating these findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of SCD research, from genetics to curative approaches, and to identify future directions for therapeutic innovation."}
