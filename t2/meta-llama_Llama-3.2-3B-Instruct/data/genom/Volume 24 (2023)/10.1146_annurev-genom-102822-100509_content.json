{"Abstract": "DECIPHER is a novel approach to improving genetic diagnosis by dynamically integrating genomic and clinical data. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and a comprehensive knowledge base, DECIPHER enables the accurate interpretation of rare genetic variants and their correlation with clinical phenotypes. This integration of genotype-phenotype correlation facilitates the identification of novel disease-causing mutations and enhances the precision of genetic diagnosis. DECIPHER's dynamic framework allows for the incorporation of diverse data types, including genomic sequencing data, clinical notes, and family histories. By addressing the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, DECIPHER has the potential to revolutionize the field of genetic diagnosis, enabling healthcare professionals to provide more accurate and personalized care for individuals with rare genetic disorders. The DECIPHER framework offers a promising solution for the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, and its application has far-reaching implications for the field of genetic medicine."}
