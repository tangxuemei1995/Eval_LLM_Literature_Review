{"Abstract": "The integration of genomic data has revolutionized the field of population genetics, enabling researchers to reconstruct complex demographic histories and infer ancestral relationships with unprecedented accuracy. This review synthesizes recent advances in methods for assessing population relationships and history using genomic data, with a focus on demographic inference, admixture, ancestry, effective population size, and molecular clocks. We discuss the theoretical foundations and empirical applications of these methods, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The use of genomic data to infer population size, migration patterns, and genetic drift is examined, as well as the application of molecular clocks to estimate divergence times. The review also highlights the importance of considering multiple lines of evidence and the need for rigorous validation of methodological approaches. By integrating insights from population genetics, phylogenetics, and computational methods, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics shaping human and non-human populations."}
