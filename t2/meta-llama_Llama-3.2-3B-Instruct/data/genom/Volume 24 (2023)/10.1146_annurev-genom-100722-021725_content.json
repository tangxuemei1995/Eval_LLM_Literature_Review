{"Abstract": "The rapid advancement of genomics has led to an increasingly complex landscape of legal considerations, with significant implications for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. This abstract reviews the current state of liability and data privacy in the genomics field, highlighting key challenges and emerging trends. The duty to warn and inform patients about the potential risks and benefits of genetic testing is a critical concern, particularly in the context of rare genetic disorders and precision medicine. Meanwhile, data privacy concerns surrounding genomic data storage, sharing, and analysis continue to pose significant challenges. This review synthesizes existing literature on liability and data privacy in genomics, with a focus on the intersection of these issues and their implications for the evolving genomics landscape. By examining the current state of the law and emerging trends, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for navigating the complex legal landscape of genomics."}
