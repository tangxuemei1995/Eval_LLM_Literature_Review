{"Abstract": "The human acrocentric chromosomes, including 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22, exhibit a unique characteristic of being attached to the centromere, allowing for their distinct behavior during cell division. Recent studies have shed light on the mechanisms underlying the p-arms of these chromosomes, revealing a distinct set of rules governing their recombination and Robertsonian translocation. The nucleolar organizer region (NOR) and ribosomal genes play a crucial role in regulating the expression of these genes, influencing the formation of heterochromatin and the maintenance of genomic stability. This research highlights the importance of the nucleolus in controlling the recombination events on the p-arms of human acrocentric chromosomes, and how these events contribute to the formation of Robertsonian translocations, a common mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for elucidating the molecular basis of human genetic disorders and developing targeted therapeutic strategies."}
