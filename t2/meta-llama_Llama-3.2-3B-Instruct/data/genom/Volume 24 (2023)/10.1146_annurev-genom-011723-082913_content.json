{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF complex is a chromatin remodeling enzyme complex that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during neural crest cell development. Neural crest cells are a transient, multipotent population that gives rise to diverse cell types, including Schwann cells, melanocytes, and glial cells. Mutations in the NF2 gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin 2, have been implicated in the development of schwannomas, a type of tumor that arises from Schwann cell precursors. Smarcb1, the gene encoding the tumor suppressor protein SMARCB1, is also frequently mutated in rhabdoid tumors, which are aggressive neoplasms that arise from neural crest-derived cells. This review highlights the importance of the SWI/SNF complex in regulating neural crest cell development and highlights the role of NF2 and Smarcb1 mutations in the development of schwannomas and rhabdoid tumors, respectively. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."}
