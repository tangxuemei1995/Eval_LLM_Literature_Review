{"Abstract": "Long-read DNA sequencing has revolutionized the field of genomics by enabling the detection of structural variants, repetitive DNA, and pathogenic mutations with unprecedented accuracy. Recent advances in sequencing technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, have pushed the boundaries of long-read sequencing, allowing for the characterization of complex genomic structures and the resolution of repetitive regions. However, despite these advances, long-read sequencing still faces significant challenges, including the interpretation of structural variants, the detection of epigenetic modifications, and the integration of long-read data with short-read data. Furthermore, the high cost and limited availability of long-read sequencing technologies hinder their widespread adoption. This review aims to provide an overview of the recent advances in long-read DNA sequencing, discuss the remaining challenges, and highlight the potential applications of this technology in the field of genomics and beyond."}
