{"Abstract": "The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has significantly impacted the field of open science, particularly in the context of large-scale biomedical datasets such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA). This study examines the challenges and opportunities arising from the application of GDPR to open data in genomics. We analyze the HCA's data sharing policies and practices, highlighting the tensions between the need for open access to genomic data and the need to protect individual privacy. Our analysis reveals that the HCA has successfully implemented measures to ensure data protection while promoting open science. We discuss the lessons learned from the HCA's experience and provide recommendations for other biomedical research initiatives seeking to balance data sharing and data protection in the GDPR era. Our findings have implications for the development of effective data governance frameworks in open science."}
