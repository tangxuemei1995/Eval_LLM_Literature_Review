{"Abstract": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing has revolutionized genomic research, enabling the detection of rare genetic variants and secondary findings that may have significant implications for patient health. However, the return of results to individuals and their families raises complex research ethics concerns. This review aims to discuss the current landscape of return of results in genomic research, focusing on the detection of incidental findings and secondary variants. We examine the current guidelines and frameworks governing the return of results, including the use of return of results policies, consent forms, and secondary use agreements. Our analysis highlights the need for a nuanced approach to return of results, one that balances individual patient autonomy with the potential benefits of genomic research. Ultimately, we argue that a new normal for return of results in genomic research requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating input from ethicists, clinicians, and researchers to ensure that the rights and interests of all stakeholders are protected."}
