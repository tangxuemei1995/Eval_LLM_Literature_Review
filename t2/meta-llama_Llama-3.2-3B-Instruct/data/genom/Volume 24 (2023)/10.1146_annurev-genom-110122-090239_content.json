{"Abstract": "Meiotic chromosome structure and the synaptonemal complex play a crucial role in determining fertility outcomes. The synaptonemal complex, a protein-based structure formed during meiosis, facilitates chromosome pairing and synapsis, essential for accurate recombination and genetic diversity. Abnormalities in the synaptonemal complex, such as reduced or absent complex formation, have been linked to infertility issues, including azoospermia and primary ovarian failure. Recurrent pregnancy loss is also associated with meiotic errors, including improper synaptonemal complex formation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the relationship between meiotic chromosome structure, the synaptonemal complex, and fertility outcomes. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptonemal complex formation and the consequences of its disruption on meiotic progression and fertility. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to address infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss associated with meiotic errors."}
