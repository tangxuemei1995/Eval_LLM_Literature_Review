{"Abstract": "The genetic determinants of axial length play a crucial role in the development of refractive errors, including microphthalmia and high myopia, in childhood. Axial length, a key parameter in determining refractive power, is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Research has identified several genetic variants associated with altered axial length, including those involved in the regulation of growth and development. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway have been implicated in the regulation of axial length, with mutations in these pathways leading to microphthalmia and high myopia, respectively. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies have identified novel genetic variants associated with axial length, highlighting the importance of genetic predisposition in the development of refractive errors. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the genetic determinants of axial length, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying microphthalmia and high myopia in childhood. The implications of this research for the prevention and treatment of refractive errors are discussed, highlighting the need for further investigation into the genetic and environmental factors influencing axial length development."}
