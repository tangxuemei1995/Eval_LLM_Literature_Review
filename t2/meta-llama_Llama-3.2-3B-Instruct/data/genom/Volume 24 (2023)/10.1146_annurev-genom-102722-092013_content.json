{"Abstract": "Padlock probe-based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) is a powerful tool for spatially resolved transcriptomics, enabling the creation of high-resolution spatial cell atlases and in situ cell typing. This method utilizes padlock probes to capture and amplify specific transcripts in situ, allowing for the detailed analysis of gene expression patterns across different cell types and tissues. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) and subsequent sequencing of the amplified fragments provide comprehensive transcriptomic information. Spatially resolved ISS has numerous applications in various fields, including cancer research, developmental biology, and neurology, facilitating the identification of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets."}
