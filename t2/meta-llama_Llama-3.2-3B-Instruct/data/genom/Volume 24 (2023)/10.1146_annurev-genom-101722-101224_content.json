{"Abstract": "Extracellular RNA (ecRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs have emerged as critical components of intercellular communication, influencing various physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have elucidated the complex systems and mechanisms underlying the crossing of membranes by RNA molecules, including the role of specific transporters, receptors, and microRNAs. This review aims to contextualize the current understanding of RNA crossing membranes, focusing on the distinct populations of extracellular RNA and glycoRNAs. We discuss the structural and functional characteristics of these RNA molecules, their interactions with cell surface receptors and transporters, and the downstream signaling pathways triggered by their binding. Furthermore, we highlight the implications of RNA crossing membranes for our understanding of RNA-mediated regulation of cellular processes, including immune responses, cell differentiation, and cancer progression."}
