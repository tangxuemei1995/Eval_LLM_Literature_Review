{"Abstract": "This primer provides a comprehensive overview of federated analysis for privacy-preserving data sharing, a crucial approach in the era of big data and genomics. By leveraging decentralized architectures and advanced cryptographic techniques, federated analysis enables the collaborative analysis of private data without compromising individual privacy. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection frameworks emphasize the need for robust privacy measures, making federated analysis an attractive solution. This primer delves into the technical and legal aspects of federated analysis, exploring its applications in genomics and other domains. It discusses the key challenges, benefits, and limitations of federated analysis, as well as its potential to facilitate data sharing while maintaining user privacy. By providing a thorough understanding of federated analysis, this primer aims to inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the development of privacy-preserving data sharing solutions."}
