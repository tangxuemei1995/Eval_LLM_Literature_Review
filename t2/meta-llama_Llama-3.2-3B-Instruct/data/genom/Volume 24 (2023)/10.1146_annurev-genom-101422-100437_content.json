{"Abstract": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for elucidating the complex relationships between gene regulation and cellular state. By leveraging single-cell sequencing technologies, researchers can now investigate the dynamic interactions between noncoding variants, gene expression, and cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the methods and insights gained from sc-eQTL analysis, highlighting the potential of this approach to uncover novel regulatory variants and their functional consequences. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for cell state-specific gene regulation and noncoding variant effects in eQTL analyses, and provide a framework for integrating sc-eQTL data with other omics datasets to gain a deeper understanding of gene regulation and cellular heterogeneity. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of gene regulation and cellular state, and highlight the potential of sc-eQTL analysis as a powerful tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases."}
