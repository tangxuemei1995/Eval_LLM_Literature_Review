{"Abstract": "Coral reefs are complex ecosystems that rely on the interactions between coral polyps, microorganisms, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) for their function and resilience. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of microbial communities in decomposing DOM, releasing essential nutrients, and mitigating the effects of deoxygenation on coral reefs. The decomposition of DOM by coral-associated microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea, is a key process that regulates the availability of nutrients for coral growth and survival. Furthermore, the microbiomes of coral reefs play a crucial role in modulating the effects of deoxygenation, which can have devastating consequences for coral reefs. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the interactions between microbial communities, DOM, and ecosystem function in coral reefs, highlighting the importance of preserving the integrity of these complex interactions for the long-term health and resilience of coral reef ecosystems."}
