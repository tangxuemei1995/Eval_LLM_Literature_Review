{"Abstract": "Marshes and mangroves have long been recognized as vital components of coastal ecosystems, providing essential ecosystem services that mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events, including cyclones and hurricanes. These nature-based coastal storm buffers play a crucial role in reducing flood risk and protecting coastal infrastructure. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this study examines the effectiveness of marshes and mangroves in buffering against storm surges and sea-level rise. The findings highlight the importance of preserving and restoring these ecosystems, which not only provide natural flood protection but also support biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. The study also discusses the potential for integrating nature-based solutions with traditional coastal engineering approaches to enhance the overall resilience of coastal communities. By leveraging the unique characteristics of marshes and mangroves, this research aims to inform policy and practice, promoting the adoption of nature-based coastal storm buffers as a key strategy for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events."}
