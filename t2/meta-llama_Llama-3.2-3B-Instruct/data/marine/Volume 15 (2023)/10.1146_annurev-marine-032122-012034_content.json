{"Abstract": "The Beaufort Gyre, a large, rotating mass of water in the Arctic Ocean, plays a crucial role in the global ocean circulation and climate system. Located in the Beaufort Sea, this gyre is characterized by a unique circulation pattern, where warm, salty water from the Gulf Stream collides with cold, freshwater-rich water from the Arctic. This collision leads to a significant decrease in ocean heat content, which in turn affects regional climate patterns. Our research highlights the importance of the Beaufort Gyre in regulating the Arctic Ocean's freshwater budget and its implications for sea ice coverage and global climate change."}
