{"Abstract": "The oceanography field has historically been male-dominated, with women underrepresented in research, academia, and professional positions. This disparity has significant implications for the advancement of oceanographic knowledge and the effective management of marine resources. A review of existing literature reveals that gender equity in oceanography is influenced by various factors, including societal norms, institutional barriers, and individual biases. Women in oceanography often face challenges related to career advancement, mentorship, and representation in decision-making positions. To address these issues, this study examines the current state of gender equity in oceanography, with a focus on the experiences of women in research and academia. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, such as mentorship programs, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and policy changes, to promote gender equity and advance the field of oceanography."}
