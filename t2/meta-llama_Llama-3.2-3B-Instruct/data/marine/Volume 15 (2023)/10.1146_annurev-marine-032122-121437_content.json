{"Abstract": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are a growing concern due to their significant impacts on marine ecosystems and ecosystem services. Rising ocean temperatures, primarily caused by climate change, lead to increased frequency and severity of MHWs. These extreme events can cause widespread damage to marine life, alter species distributions, and disrupt the delicate balance of marine food webs. Studies have shown that MHWs can lead to coral bleaching, reduced fish populations, and changes in phytoplankton communities. Furthermore, MHWs can also have cascading effects on coastal ecosystems, including increased erosion and reduced water quality. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on the biological impacts of MHWs, highlighting the need for further research on the long-term consequences of these events and the development of effective conservation strategies to mitigate their effects. Understanding the biological impacts of MHWs is crucial for developing effective management plans to protect marine ecosystems and ecosystem services."}
