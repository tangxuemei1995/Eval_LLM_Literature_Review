{"Abstract": "Eastern boundary upwelling systems, such as the California Current and the Humboldt Current, play a crucial role in regulating regional climate and marine ecosystems. However, these systems are vulnerable to climate change, which is projected to alter ocean circulation patterns and temperature regimes. This study examines the impacts of climate change on eastern boundary upwelling systems, with a focus on changes in upwelling intensity, ocean productivity, and marine biodiversity. Using a combination of observational data and climate modeling, we find that climate change is expected to weaken upwelling in these systems, leading to reduced ocean productivity and changes in marine species distributions. Our results highlight the need for continued monitoring and research into the impacts of climate change on eastern boundary upwelling systems, and the importance of preserving these critical ecosystems in the face of global warming. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between climate change, ocean circulation, and marine ecosystems."}
