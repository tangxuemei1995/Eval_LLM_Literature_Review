{"Abstract": "The deep ocean's water column is a vast, largely unexplored environment that harbors a diverse array of prokaryotic life forms. Recent studies have revealed a thriving metabolic activity in this region, with prokaryotes playing a crucial role in the ocean's biogeochemical cycles. This research focuses on the exploration of prokaryotic life in the deep ocean's water column, with a particular emphasis on the metabolic processes and interactions between prokaryotes and their environment. Using a combination of molecular and culturing techniques, we have identified a range of prokaryotic taxa, including bacteria and archaea, that are capable of surviving and thriving in the extreme conditions of the deep ocean. Our findings highlight the importance of prokaryotes in the ocean's ecosystem and underscore the need for further research into the microbial oceanography of this region. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between prokaryotes and their environment in the deep ocean's water column."}
