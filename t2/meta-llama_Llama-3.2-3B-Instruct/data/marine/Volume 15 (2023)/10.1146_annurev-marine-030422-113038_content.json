{"Abstract": "Marine organisms have evolved complex internal biological clocks to synchronize their physiological processes with environmental cycles, ensuring optimal survival and reproduction. Endogenous oscillators, such as circadian, circatidal, circalunar, and circannual rhythms, play a crucial role in regulating various physiological and behavioral responses in marine species. These internal rhythms are influenced by external environmental cues, including light-dark cycles, tidal cycles, lunar cycles, and seasonal changes. Climate change, however, poses a significant threat to the integrity of these internal biological clocks, as altered environmental conditions can disrupt the synchronization of these rhythms. For instance, changes in temperature and daylight patterns can affect the circadian rhythms of marine animals, leading to disruptions in feeding behavior, migration patterns, and reproductive cycles. In contrast, some marine algae have evolved unique strategies to maintain their circadian rhythms in response to environmental changes. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the complex interactions between endogenous oscillators and environmental cycles in marine organisms, with a focus on the impacts of climate change on these internal biological clocks."}
