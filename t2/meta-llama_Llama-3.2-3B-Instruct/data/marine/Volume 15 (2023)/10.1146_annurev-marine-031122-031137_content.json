{"Abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive review of global Quaternary carbonate burial, integrating proxy-based reconstructions and model-based simulations to elucidate the persisting uncertainties in this critical component of the Earth's carbon cycle. During the Quaternary, changes in sea level, ocean circulation, and climate drove the burial of carbonate sediments, influencing the global carbon budget. Proxy records, including coral, foraminiferal, and sedimentary archives, provide valuable insights into past carbonate production and burial patterns. However, these records are often fragmented and subject to uncertainties. To address these limitations, we employed a suite of global climate models to simulate the Quaternary carbonate cycle. Our results indicate that the global carbonate burial rate varied significantly during glacial and interglacial periods, with a pronounced impact on the carbon cycle. Despite advances in modeling and proxy-based reconstructions, uncertainties persist, particularly regarding the magnitude and timing of past carbonate burial. This study highlights the need for continued interdisciplinary research to refine our understanding of the Quaternary carbonate cycle and its role in the Earth's carbon budget."}
