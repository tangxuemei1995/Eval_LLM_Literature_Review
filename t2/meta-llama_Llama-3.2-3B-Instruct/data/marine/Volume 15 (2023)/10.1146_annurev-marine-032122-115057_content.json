{"Abstract": "The nearshore region is a critical area where exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles occurs, influencing coastal ecosystems and water quality. This study investigates the cross-shore exchange of these entities across the nearshore region, focusing on the roles of wind, surface waves, and internal waves. Turbulence plays a pivotal role in mediating these exchanges, with varying intensities affecting particle transport and deposition. Our research reveals that wind-driven surface waves and internal waves contribute significantly to the cross-shore transport of plankton, pollutants, and particles. The study also highlights the importance of turbulence in modulating these exchanges, with high-turbulence conditions leading to increased particle deposition and reduced plankton transport. The findings of this study have implications for understanding coastal ecosystem dynamics and informing strategies for mitigating the impacts of pollution and climate change in nearshore regions."}
