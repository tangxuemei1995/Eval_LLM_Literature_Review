{"Abstract": "This study utilizes 129I, a nuclear reprocessing tracer, to investigate the flow features and connectivity between the Arctic and subpolar North Atlantic Oceans. By analyzing the distribution and transit times of 129I, we reveal the complex dynamics governing the exchange of water masses between these two ocean basins. Our results indicate that 129I is primarily transported through the Fram Strait, a key gateway between the Arctic and subpolar North Atlantic. The tracer's distribution also reveals a significant connection between the Arctic and the Norwegian Sea, highlighting the importance of this region in shaping the North Atlantic circulation. The transit time distribution of 129I provides insights into the timescales governing the exchange of water masses, with implications for our understanding of ocean circulation and climate variability. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system and highlight the potential of nuclear tracers in elucidating the complex dynamics of ocean circulation."}
