{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 was one of the most devastating environmental disasters in recent history, resulting in the uncontrolled release of millions of gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This study examines the oil transport processes that occurred following the blowout, with a focus on oil spreading, dispersion, droplet formation, and eddy diffusivity. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that the oil plume underwent a complex series of transformations, including droplet formation, coalescence, and dispersion by ocean currents and eddies. The eddy diffusivity parameter, which describes the rate at which eddies mix the oil with the surrounding water, was found to play a critical role in shaping the oil plume's trajectory and fate. Numerical modeling simulations were used to investigate the effects of varying eddy diffusivity on oil transport and dispersion, with results indicating that higher eddy diffusivity values led to increased oil spreading and dispersion. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of oil transport following major spills and for the development of effective strategies for mitigating the environmental impacts of such events."}
