{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes global fisheries science to elucidate the profound human impacts on oceans, underscoring the pivotal role of the sea in supporting civil society in the twenty-first century. Through a critical examination of artisanal and large-scale fisheries, as well as subsistence and data-driven approaches, we reveal the intricate relationships between human activities and marine ecosystems. By integrating insights from global studies and open data initiatives, our research highlights the pressing need for sustainable management practices and transparent data sharing. The findings of this study demonstrate that the sea serves as a critical interface between human societies and the natural world, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary research and collaborative governance in addressing the complex challenges facing our oceans. Ultimately, this research underscores the potential of global fisheries science to inform evidence-based policy and promote a more equitable and resilient future for coastal communities and marine ecosystems alike."}
