{"Abstract": "The ocean's biological pump plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the sinking of organic matter. This process involves the uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton, their subsequent conversion into organic carbon, and the sinking of this carbon to the ocean floor. Using a combination of satellite oceanography and biogeochemical modeling, this study quantifies the ocean's biological pump and its carbon cycle impacts on global scales. Our results show that the biological pump is a significant carbon sink, with an estimated 2.2 GtC yr-1 of carbon sequestered in the ocean. We also identify key carbon export pathways, including the sinking of organic matter in the ocean's twilight zone and the formation of deep-sea sediments. Our findings have important implications for understanding the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle and for predicting future changes in the Earth's climate system."}
