{"Abstract": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDSV) refers to the long-term fluctuations in climate patterns across the Pacific Ocean, with significant implications for global climate change. This variability is characterized by complex modes and mechanisms, including the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a well-known driver of PDSV. Research has shown that PDSV is influenced by various ocean-atmosphere teleconnections, including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO). The PDO, in particular, has been linked to changes in ocean temperatures, sea ice coverage, and atmospheric circulation patterns, which in turn impact global climate patterns. This variability also has significant impacts on regional climate conditions, including droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. Understanding the modes and mechanisms of PDSV is crucial for predicting future climate change and developing effective strategies for mitigating its impacts. This review aims to synthesize the current knowledge on PDSV, highlighting the key drivers, mechanisms, and regional impacts of this complex climate phenomenon."}
