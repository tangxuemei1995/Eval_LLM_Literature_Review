{"Abstract": "This study provides novel insights into marine iron biogeochemistry by integrating iron isotope analysis with sediment and dust records. Utilizing the GEOTRACES protocol, we investigated the iron isotopic composition of sediments and dust from various oceanic and continental settings. Our results reveal significant variations in iron isotopic signatures across different environments, suggesting distinct iron cycling mechanisms. The incorporation of iron from dust and hydrothermal vents into sediments is found to be a critical process in shaping the global iron budget. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the importance of considering the interplay between atmospheric and oceanic iron sources in understanding the complex biogeochemical dynamics of iron. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of ocean biogeochemistry and the Earth's iron cycle, and underscore the need for continued research into the role of iron isotopes in marine biogeochemical processes."}
