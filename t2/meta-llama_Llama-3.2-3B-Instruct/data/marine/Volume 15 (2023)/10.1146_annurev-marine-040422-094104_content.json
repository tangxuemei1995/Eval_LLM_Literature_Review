{"Abstract": "Lipid biogeochemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the complex interactions between microorganisms, their environment, and the global carbon cycle. Recent advances in lipidomic techniques have revolutionized the field, enabling the comprehensive analysis of lipid biomarkers in various environmental samples. This review synthesizes the current state of lipid biogeochemistry and highlights the applications of modern lipidomic techniques in microbial oceanography. We discuss the importance of lipid biomarkers in tracing the fate of organic matter, assessing microbial community composition, and reconstructing past environmental conditions. Meta-omics approaches have also been employed to integrate lipidomic data with other omics technologies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of lipid biogeochemical processes. The review highlights the potential of lipidomics in addressing key questions in biogeochemistry, including the role of lipids in the ocean's carbon cycle and the impact of climate change on lipid biogeochemical processes. By integrating lipidomic data with other scientific disciplines, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and their environment."}
