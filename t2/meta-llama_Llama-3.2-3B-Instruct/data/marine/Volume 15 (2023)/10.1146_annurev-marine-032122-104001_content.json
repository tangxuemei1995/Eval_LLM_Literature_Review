{"Abstract": "This study investigates the application of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes in diatoms, foraminifera, and corals as a paleoindicator of past oceanic and atmospheric conditions. By analyzing the nitrogen isotopic composition of biomineralized structures in these organisms, we reveal insights into the isotopic signatures of ancient marine environments. The results show that diatoms, foraminifera, and corals exhibit distinct nitrogen isotope patterns that reflect their ecological niches and environmental conditions. Foraminifera, in particular, display a strong correlation between their nitrogen isotope composition and the oxygen isotopic composition of the surrounding seawater. These findings suggest that fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes can be used to reconstruct ancient oceanic and atmospheric conditions, including temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability. The implications of this research are significant for understanding past climate change, ocean circulation, and the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen. The results also highlight the potential of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes as a novel paleoindicator for paleoclimate research and biogeochemical modeling."}
