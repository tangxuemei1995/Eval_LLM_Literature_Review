{"Abstract": "The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate through the biological carbon pump, a process where marine organisms absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This process is influenced by various factors, including flux attenuation, the formation of marine snow and fecal pellets, and microbial degradation. Zooplankton feeding patterns and aggregate formation also impact carbon export. Research has shown that flux attenuation can lead to reduced carbon export, while the formation of aggregates can enhance it. Marine snow and fecal pellets, produced by zooplankton, can also contribute to carbon export through microbial degradation. Understanding the complex interactions between these processes is essential for predicting the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on carbon export in the ocean, highlighting the key factors that influence this process and their implications for climate regulation."}
