{"Abstract": "Induced resistance in fruit and vegetables is a complex host physiological response that limits postharvest disease development. This response is triggered by various factors, including ethylene, abscisic acid, and salicylic acid, which interact with plant defense mechanisms to confer protection against pathogens. Research has shown that induced resistance can be achieved through physiological factors such as maturation delay, which can be induced by manipulating ethylene production or sensitivity. This delay in ripening can extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables, thereby reducing the risk of postharvest disease. Furthermore, induced resistance can also be achieved through the use of plant growth regulators, such as salicylic acid, which can stimulate the production of defense-related genes. Understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying induced resistance is crucial for the development of effective postharvest management strategies, and has significant implications for the food industry and global food security. By elucidating the complex interactions between host physiology and pathogens, researchers can identify new targets for disease control and develop innovative approaches to improve postharvest quality and safety."}
