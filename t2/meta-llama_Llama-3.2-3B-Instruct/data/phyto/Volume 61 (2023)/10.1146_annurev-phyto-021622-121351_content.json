{"Abstract": "Kitaviruses, a family of small, single-stranded RNA viruses, have been identified as causative agents of atypical plant diseases, including nonsystemic disorders. These viruses, such as cilevirus, higrevirus, and blunervirus, have been associated with citrus leprosy, a disease characterized by the formation of lesions on citrus plants. The transmission of kitaviruses by Brevipalpus mites, a common vector of plant viruses, has been well-documented. Recent studies have also implicated negevirus, a kitavirus, in the etiology of citrus leprosy. The discovery of kitaviruses has expanded our understanding of the complex interactions between plant viruses, vectors, and hosts, and has highlighted the need for further research into the mechanisms of transmission and disease development. This knowledge has significant implications for the management and control of nonsystemic plant diseases, and for the development of novel strategies for virus transmission and disease prevention."}
