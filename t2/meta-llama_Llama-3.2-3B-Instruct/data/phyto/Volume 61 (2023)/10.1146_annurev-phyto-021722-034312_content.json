{"Abstract": "Functional peptides have emerged as a promising approach for plant disease control, offering a novel and sustainable alternative to traditional chemical pesticides. These short-chain peptides, derived from various natural sources, have been shown to exhibit potent antimicrobial and antifungal activities against a wide range of plant pathogens. The mechanisms of action of functional peptides involve disruption of microbial cell membranes, inhibition of essential enzymes, and modulation of plant defense responses. Recent studies have focused on the production of functional peptides through fermentation and genetic engineering, enabling large-scale production and optimization of their efficacy. Novel biopesticides based on functional peptides have been developed, demonstrating superior performance and environmental sustainability compared to conventional pesticides. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of functional peptides for plant disease control, highlighting their mechanisms of action, natural sources, production methods, and potential applications as novel biopesticides. The findings of this review have significant implications for the development of sustainable and effective strategies for plant disease management, and may pave the way for the commercialization of functional peptides as a new generation of plant protection products."}
