{"Abstract": "Phycopathology, the study of algal diseases, has experienced a resurgence in recent years due to the growing importance of algal aquaculture and the increasing awareness of algal ecology and biosecurity concerns. This field of research has expanded to encompass the complex interactions between algal pathogens, their hosts, and the environment. Recent studies have highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and managing algal diseases, incorporating insights from ecology, parasitology, and biosecurity. As the global demand for algal-based food and feed products continues to rise, the reemergence of phycopathology has significant implications for the sustainability and safety of algal aquaculture."}
