{"Abstract": "The complex interactions between crops and their associated microbiota play a crucial role in plant health, productivity, and adaptation to environmental stresses. Recent advances in plant breeding and genomics have enabled the identification of host genetic factors that influence the composition and function of the crop microbiota. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the relationships between crop genetics, microbiota composition, and rhizosphere ecology. We discuss the key mechanisms by which host genetics shape the microbiota, including the regulation of nutrient uptake, defense signaling, and symbiotic interactions. The impact of crop domestication on the microbiota is also examined, highlighting the trade-offs between improved yield and reduced microbial diversity. Furthermore, we explore the potential of precision breeding approaches to engineer desirable traits in crop microbiota, such as enhanced nutrient acquisition and disease resistance. By elucidating the intricate relationships between crop genetics, microbiota, and rhizosphere ecology, this review provides a foundation for the development of novel breeding strategies that optimize crop-microbiota interactions and promote sustainable agriculture practices."}
