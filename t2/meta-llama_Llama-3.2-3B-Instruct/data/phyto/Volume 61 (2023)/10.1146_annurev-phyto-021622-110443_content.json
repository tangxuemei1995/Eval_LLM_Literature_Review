{"Abstract": "The plant ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in regulating plant immunity against pathogens by controlling the turnover of effectors secreted by microbial pathogens. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ubiquitination in modulating proteostasis within plant cells, thereby influencing the efficacy of plant defense responses. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the UPS in plant immunity, with a focus on its interaction with microbial effectors and the mechanisms underlying ubiquitination-mediated regulation of proteostasis. The potential of targeting the UPS for microbial manipulation is also discussed, with implications for the development of novel strategies for plant disease control and the exploration of new avenues for plant-microbe interactions."}
