{"Abstract": "This study examines the international trade of ornamental plants and its local effects on the spread of viral and bacterial diseases. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that the global trade of ornamental plants can facilitate the transmission of plant pathogens across borders, resulting in significant economic and environmental impacts. The study highlights the need for effective regulation and monitoring of plant imports to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of local production and cultivation practices in reducing the reliance on imported plants and minimizing the risk of disease transmission. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers, plant producers, and regulatory agencies seeking to mitigate the effects of viral and bacterial diseases on ornamental plant production and local ecosystems."}
