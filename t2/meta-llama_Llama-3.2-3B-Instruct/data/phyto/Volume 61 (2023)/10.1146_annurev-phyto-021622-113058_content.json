{"Abstract": "Integrated nematode management is crucial for maintaining global food security in a world facing climate change, soil degradation, and increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices. This review synthesizes existing knowledge on the constraints, policy, processes, and technologies required for effective integrated nematode management. We highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between nematodes, plants, and the microbiome in soil ecosystems. Genome editing and genetic approaches hold promise for developing nematode-resistant crop varieties, while remote sensing and precision agriculture can enhance monitoring and management of nematode populations. Root health and microbiome manipulation are also critical for promoting soil resilience and nematode control. Effective policy frameworks and processes are necessary to integrate these approaches and ensure their scalability and sustainability. By addressing these challenges, we can develop a more resilient and sustainable food system for the future, mitigating the impacts of nematodes and other soil pests on global food security."}
