{"Abstract": "The Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is a significant threat to global tomato production, with its emergence linked to the coevolution of viruses and host resistance within geographic centers of plant diversity. This study investigates the historical dynamics of ToBRFV and its host, Solanum lycopersicum, focusing on the Mediterranean region as a key center of plant diversity. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that ToBRFV has coevolved with its host over thousands of years, with evidence of selective pressure favoring the evolution of resistance genes. The study also explores the impact of plate tectonics on the distribution of ToBRFV and its host, highlighting the role of geographical barriers in shaping the coevolutionary process. The findings suggest that the coevolution of ToBRFV and its host is a complex, long-term process influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and geographical factors. Understanding this coevolutionary history is crucial for developing effective strategies to manage ToBRFV and other plant viruses, and for conserving crop diversity in the face of emerging threats."}
