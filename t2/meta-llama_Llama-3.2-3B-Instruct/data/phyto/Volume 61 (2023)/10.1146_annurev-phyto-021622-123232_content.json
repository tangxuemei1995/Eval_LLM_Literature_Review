{"Abstract": "Plant pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to subvert plant membrane trafficking, compromising plant immunity and facilitating pathogen survival. Haustoria, specialized structures formed by pathogens during infection, serve as hubs for endomembrane trafficking, allowing for the secretion of effector proteins that manipulate plant cellular processes. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of autophagy in regulating endomembrane trafficking and protein secretion in response to pathogen infection. This subversion of plant membrane trafficking enables pathogens to evade plant immune responses and establish a stable infection site. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this subversion is essential for the development of effective plant defense strategies and the discovery of novel targets for disease control."}
