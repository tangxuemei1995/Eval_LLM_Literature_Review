{"Abstract": "A recent pandemic of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV) has been reported globally, affecting major tomato and pepper crops worldwide. The virus, a member of the Tobamovirus family, is transmitted through seed and has been linked to significant yield losses and economic impacts on the agricultural industry. A thorough review of existing literature reveals that poor seed hygiene practices and inadequate crop rotation strategies have contributed to the rapid spread of ToBRFV. Furthermore, the virus has shown resistance to conventional control measures, including chemical treatments and biological control methods. To combat this pandemic, it is essential to adopt integrated pest management strategies that prioritize seed hygiene, crop rotation, and the development of resistant cultivars. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of ToBRFV research and identify key areas for future investigation to mitigate the impact of this devastating virus on global food security."}
