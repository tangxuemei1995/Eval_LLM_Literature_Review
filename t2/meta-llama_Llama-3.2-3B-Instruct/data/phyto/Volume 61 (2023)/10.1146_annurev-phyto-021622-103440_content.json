{"Abstract": "Downy mildew, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, is a devastating plant pathogen that has evolved complex strategies to infect and colonize hosts. Recent advances in genome-enabled technologies have provided unprecedented insights into the biology and evolution of P. infestans. Telomere-to-telomere assembly of the P. infestans genome has revealed a highly dynamic and heterogeneous genome, with evidence of heterokaryosis and somatic adaptation. This has significant implications for our understanding of the pathogen's ability to adapt to changing environments and evade host immune responses. Effector proteins, which play a critical role in the pathogen's infection process, have also been shown to undergo rapid evolution and selection. Furthermore, the development of biosurveillance tools based on genomic data has the potential to revolutionize the detection and management of downy mildew. This review synthesizes the latest genome-enabled research on P. infestans, highlighting the key findings and their implications for our understanding of this important plant pathogen."}
