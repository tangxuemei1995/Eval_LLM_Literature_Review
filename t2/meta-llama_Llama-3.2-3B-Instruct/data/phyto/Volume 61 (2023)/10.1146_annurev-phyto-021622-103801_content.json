{"Abstract": "Phytophthora capsici, a highly pathogenic oomycete, has been a significant threat to vegetable crops worldwide for over a century. Despite its long history, recent advances in fundamental biology and disease management have significantly expanded our understanding of this plant pathogen. Phytophthora capsici is a complex organism with a unique life cycle, involving both aquatic and terrestrial phases, and its pathogenicity is mediated by a range of effector proteins. The development of fungicides has been a cornerstone of disease management, but the increasing prevalence of fungicide resistance has necessitated the exploration of alternative strategies. This review highlights the recent progress in our understanding of Phytophthora capsici's biology, including its genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and discusses the current challenges and future directions in disease management, including the development of resistant cultivars and novel fungicides. By synthesizing the latest research findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on Phytophthora capsici and its implications for vegetable production."}
