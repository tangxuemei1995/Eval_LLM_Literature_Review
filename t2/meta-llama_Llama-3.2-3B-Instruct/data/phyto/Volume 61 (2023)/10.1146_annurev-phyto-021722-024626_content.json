{"Abstract": "The global forest health crisis is a pressing public-good dilemma that necessitates international collective action to address the escalating threats to forest ecosystems. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, driven by climate change, have created a perfect storm of factors exacerbating forest degradation and loss. Biological invasions, fueled by human activities, further complicate the issue by introducing non-native species that outcompete native vegetation for resources. The consequences of inaction will be severe, including loss of biodiversity, decreased ecosystem resilience, and diminished provision of essential ecosystem services. Effective natural resource policy and conservation of biodiversity are critical to mitigating these impacts. This crisis demands a coordinated international response, involving governments, civil society, and the private sector, to develop and implement effective strategies for forest conservation and restoration. By working together, we can prevent the irreversible damage to our planet's most valuable ecosystems."}
