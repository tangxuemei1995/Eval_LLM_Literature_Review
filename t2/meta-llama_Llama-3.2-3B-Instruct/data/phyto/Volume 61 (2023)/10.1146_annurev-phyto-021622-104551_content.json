{"Abstract": "Ralstonia solanacearum is a highly pathogenic bacterium causing bacterial wilt disease in solanaceous crops worldwide. This plant pathogen employs a complex arsenal of virulence strategies, including type III secretion system, flagellar motility, and quorum sensing, to establish infection and colonize plant tissues. The evolution of R. solanacearum is closely linked to environmental factors, such as temperature and moisture, which influence its pathogenicity and transmission dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of biological control methods, including the use of beneficial microorganisms and plant-based biofertilizers, to manage R. solanacearum populations. However, the development of effective resistance strategies remains a pressing concern, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the bacterium's biology and ecology. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on R. solanacearum virulence and resistance, and discuss prospects for future research and management strategies."}
