{"Abstract": "Plant-pathogenic bacteria employ complex strategies to modulate host plant responses and establish a favorable environment for colonization and pathogenesis. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of host metabolites as key signals in regulating bacterial virulence. This inter-kingdom signaling pathway involves the detection and utilization of host metabolites by bacterial effectors, which in turn modulate host immune responses and facilitate bacterial survival. Type III secretion systems play a pivotal role in delivering these effectors into host cells, where they interact with host metabolites to regulate virulence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this metabolic signaling network is essential for the development of novel strategies to control plant-pathogenic bacterial infections, and has significant implications for the design of targeted antimicrobial therapies and plant defense mechanisms."}
