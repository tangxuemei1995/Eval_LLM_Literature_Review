{"Abstract": "Microbiomes are complex ecosystems comprising diverse microbial communities that interact and influence each other's organization and function. Network structure analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for elucidating the intricate relationships within these microbial networks. By examining coassociation and co-occurrence patterns, researchers can identify modules of highly interconnected microbes that cooperate to achieve specific functions. This study applies network analyses to plant and soil microbiomes, revealing novel insights into the organization and function of these ecosystems. The results demonstrate that modular structures are a common feature of both plant and soil microbiomes, and that these modules play a crucial role in shaping ecosystem processes. Understanding the power of network structure in microbiomes has significant implications for microbial ecology and the development of novel strategies for promoting ecosystem health and resilience."}
