{"Abstract": "Tuft cells are a recently identified cell type in the respiratory epithelium, characterized by their role in type II taste transduction and mucociliary clearance. Recent studies have highlighted the context- and tissue-specific programming of tuft cells, revealing a complex interplay between cytokines, neurotransmitters, and eicosanoids. IL-25, a cytokine involved in type 2 immunity, has been shown to promote the development and function of tuft cells in the lung. Conversely, acetylcholine and cysteinyl leukotriene have been implicated in regulating tuft cell activity. These findings suggest a conserved cell lineage, with tuft cells playing a critical role in maintaining respiratory homeostasis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying tuft cell programming is necessary to elucidate their role in respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."}
