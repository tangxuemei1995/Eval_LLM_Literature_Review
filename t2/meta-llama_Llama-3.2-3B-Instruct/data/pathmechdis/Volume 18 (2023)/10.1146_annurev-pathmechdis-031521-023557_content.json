{"Abstract": "Tumor cell clusters have been increasingly recognized as key drivers of collective migration and metastasis in cancer progression. Through the orchestration of collective signaling, these clusters facilitate the coordinated movement of individual cells, enabling the formation of polyclonal seedings in distant organs. This process is mediated by the exchange of soluble factors, cell-cell interactions, and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The collective migration of tumor cell clusters is further enhanced by the presence of circulating tumor cell clusters in the bloodstream, which can serve as a reservoir for metastatic cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying collective metastasis is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the orchestration of tumor cell clusters."}
