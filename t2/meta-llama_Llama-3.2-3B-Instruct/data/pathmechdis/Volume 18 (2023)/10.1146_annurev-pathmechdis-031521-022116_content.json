{"Abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are released by tumor cells and play a crucial role in modulating the tumor microenvironment. These multifunctional entities can carry a wide range of cargoes, including proteins, RNAs, and lipids, which enable them to interact with and influence various cell types, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating cells. The interaction between EVs and these cells can promote cell migration and invasion, contributing to tumor progression. Furthermore, EVs can also modulate the immune response, influencing the tumor microenvironment and potentially leading to immune evasion. Recent studies have also highlighted the potential of EVs as a diagnostic tool, with liquid biopsies emerging as a promising approach for non-invasive monitoring of tumor burden and response to therapy. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of EVs in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting their role in tumor progression, immune modulation, and potential applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy."}
