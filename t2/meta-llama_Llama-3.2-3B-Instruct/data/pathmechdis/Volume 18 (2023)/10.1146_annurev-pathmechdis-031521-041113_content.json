{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between metabolism and colorectal cancer has been a subject of increasing interest in recent years. Alterations in metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in energy production and nutrient processing, have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. A growing body of evidence suggests that dietary factors, such as a high-fat diet and low-fiber intake, can disrupt the balance of the gut microbiome, leading to changes in metabolic function and increasing the risk of colorectal cancer. Conversely, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been shown to promote a healthy gut microbiome and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the metabolic mechanisms underlying colorectal cancer and the role of the gut microbiome in modulating metabolic function. The findings of this review have important implications for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer."}
