{"Abstract": "Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by an adverse reaction to gluten, leading to inflammation and damage in the small intestine. The immunobiology of celiac disease involves a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and immune system dysregulation. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, with specific HLA alleles conferring susceptibility to the condition. T cells and B cells are central to the immune response, with T cells mediating the cytotoxic response and B cells producing autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2, a key gluten-targeting enzyme."}
