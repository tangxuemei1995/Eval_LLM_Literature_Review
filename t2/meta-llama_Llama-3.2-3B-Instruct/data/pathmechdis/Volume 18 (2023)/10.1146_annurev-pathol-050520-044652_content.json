{"Abstract": "Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of cancers characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant lymphocytes. Molecular monitoring of lymphomas is crucial for assessing response to therapy and detecting residual disease. This study employed next-generation sequencing to analyze circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with lymphoma. We found that ctDNA levels correlated with measurable residual disease (MRD) and response assessment. Notably, ctDNA analysis revealed specific mutations associated with treatment outcomes. These findings suggest that ctDNA-based monitoring can provide valuable prognostic information and guide treatment decisions in lymphoma patients. Further studies are warranted to validate these results and explore the clinical utility of ctDNA analysis."}
