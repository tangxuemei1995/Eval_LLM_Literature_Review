{"Abstract": "Liver zonation, a spatially organized pattern of metabolic and functional specialization, plays a crucial role in maintaining hepatic homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of circadian rhythm in regulating metabolic processes, including those involved in liver function. The WNT signaling pathway, a key regulator of spatial organization, is also implicated in the establishment and maintenance of liver zonation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and its consequences on pathophysiology. We discuss the role of circadian rhythm in modulating metabolic processes, including hepatic detoxification, and the impact of liver zonation on the progression of monogenic diseases. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between spatial lobular organization and WNT signaling, highlighting the complex interplay between these factors in regulating liver function. Finally, we discuss the implications of chronopharmacology, the study of the time-dependent effects of drugs on liver function, and its potential applications in the treatment of liver diseases. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and its consequences on pathophysiology, highlighting the need for further research in this area."}
