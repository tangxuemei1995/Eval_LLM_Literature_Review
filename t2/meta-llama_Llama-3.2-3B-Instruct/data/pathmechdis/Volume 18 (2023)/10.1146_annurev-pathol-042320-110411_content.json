{"Abstract": "Red blood cell alloimmunization is a significant concern in transfusion medicine, resulting from the immune system's response to foreign antigens on red blood cells. This phenomenon can lead to hemolysis, a condition characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, and has severe consequences for patients, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as sickle cell disease. The development of alloimmunization is often a result of repeated exposure to incompatible blood components, leading to the production of antibodies that can cause hemolytic reactions. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of red blood cell alloimmunization, its causes, consequences, and management strategies. The findings of this review highlight the importance of careful blood typing and screening procedures to prevent alloimmunization, as well as the development of novel strategies to mitigate its effects. Understanding the complexities of red blood cell alloimmunization is crucial for improving patient outcomes in transfusion medicine."}
