{"Abstract": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a complex and multifaceted condition characterized by progressive liver injury and fibrosis, resulting from chronic alcohol consumption. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of ALD have highlighted the critical role of programmed cell death (PCD) and pattern recognition receptors (PRR) in the development of liver damage. Activation of PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of the complement system, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of PCD. The gut-liver axis, mediated by the release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the gut microbiome, also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ALD. This review aims to summarize the recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of ALD, with a focus on the role of PCD, PRRs, and the gut-liver axis in the development of liver damage. The implications of these findings for the diagnosis and treatment of ALD are also discussed."}
