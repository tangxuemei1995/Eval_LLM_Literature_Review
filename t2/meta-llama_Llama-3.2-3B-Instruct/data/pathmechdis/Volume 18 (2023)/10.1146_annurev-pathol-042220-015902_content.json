{"Abstract": "Asthma is a complex and multifaceted respiratory disorder characterized by chronic inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and reversible airflow obstruction. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of mucus in asthma pathophysiology, with excessive mucus production contributing to airway obstruction and exacerbating symptoms. Galectin-10, a member of the galectin family, has emerged as a key player in regulating mucus production and inflammation in the airways. Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, also play a significant role in asthma pathogenesis, with their accumulation in the airways contributing to inflammation and tissue damage. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the pathology of asthma, with a focus on the role of mucus, galectin-10, and neutrophils in airway obstruction and inflammation. By elucidating the complex interactions between these key players, this review seeks to provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies for asthma management."}
