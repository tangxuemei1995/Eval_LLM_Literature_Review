{"Abstract": "Adipose tissue remodeling plays a pivotal role in various pathophysiological conditions, including burns, infectious diseases, and cachexia. The process of browning, where white adipose tissue (WAT) is converted into brown adipose tissue (BAT), has been implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism and inflammation. However, excessive or dysregulated browning can contribute to fibrosis and tissue damage. In the context of burns, infectious diseases, and cachexia, adipose tissue remodeling is characterized by the infiltration of immune cells, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the formation of fibrotic tissue. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of adipose tissue remodeling in these conditions, highlighting the complex interplay between browning, fibrosis, and inflammation. The findings of this review have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting adipose tissue remodeling in these diseases, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes and reducing morbidity and mortality."}
