{"Abstract": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its association with neurological disorders and birth defects. Recent studies have elucidated the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection, revealing a complex interplay between viral tropism, immune evasion, and host cell ubiquitination. TRIM7, a ubiquitin ligase, has been identified as a key regulator of ZIKV replication and transmission, with its antagonism of immune responses facilitating viral persistence. The virus exploits host cell ubiquitin pathways to evade immune surveillance, thereby promoting its survival and replication. Furthermore, ZIKV has been shown to modulate the host cell's ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to the degradation of key immune proteins and the suppression of antiviral responses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV pathogenesis is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies and vaccines against this emerging public health threat."}
