{"Abstract": "Parkinson's syndrome, a complex neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Recent advances in functional genomics have elucidated the oligogenic nature of Parkinson's disease, with multiple genetic variants contributing to its heterogeneity. The GBA and LRRK2 genes have emerged as key players in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's, with mutations in these genes leading to impaired lysosomal function and mitochondrial dysfunction. Alpha-synuclein, a protein involved in synaptic transmission, has also been implicated in the disease process. The interplay between synapses, lysosomes, and mitochondria is critical in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's syndrome. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of Parkinson's syndrome, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors that contribute to its development and progression."}
