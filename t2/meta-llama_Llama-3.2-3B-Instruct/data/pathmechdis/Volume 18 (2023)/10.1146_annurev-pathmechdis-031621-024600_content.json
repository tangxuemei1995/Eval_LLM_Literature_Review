{"Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance of pancreatic cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells within the TME contribute to the creation of a pro-tumorigenic environment, facilitating tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of stromal interactions with pancreatic cancer cells, including the exchange of signaling molecules and metabolic products. Targeting the TME, particularly CAFs and immune cells, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome pancreatic cancer resistance to conventional treatments. Elucidating the mechanisms of TME in pancreatic cancer will be essential for the development of novel therapeutic approaches."}
