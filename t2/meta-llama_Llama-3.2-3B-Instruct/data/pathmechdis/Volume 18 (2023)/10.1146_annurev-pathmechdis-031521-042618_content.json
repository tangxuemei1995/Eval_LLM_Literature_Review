{"Abstract": "Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the excessive accumulation of mast cells in various tissues, leading to a range of clinical manifestations including anaphylaxis, skin lesions, and organ dysfunction. Recent studies have shed new light on the pathogenesis of mastocytosis, highlighting the critical role of genetic mutations in the development of the disease. The KIT D816V mutation, a gain-of-function mutation in the KIT gene, is a common driver of mast cell proliferation and survival. Elevated tryptase levels, a hallmark of mastocytosis, have been linked to disease severity and prognosis. Emerging concepts in diagnosis and therapy, including targeted therapies and prognostication, offer new avenues for managing mastocytosis. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of mastocytosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, with a focus on the emerging concepts and potential therapeutic strategies. By elucidating the complex interplay between genetic, molecular, and clinical factors, this review seeks to advance our understanding of mastocytosis and inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches."}
