{"Abstract": "Neuroepithelial interactions play a pivotal role in the development and progression of cancer, particularly in the perineural space. Recent studies have highlighted the complex relationships between neurons, glial cells, and cancer cells, leading to the concept of the 'neurocancer axis'. This axis is characterized by the transdifferentiation of cancer cells into neuronal-like cells, promoting axonogenesis and the formation of perineural nets. These networks facilitate the spread of cancer cells along nerve fibers, contributing to the development of perineural invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, the interaction between cancer cells and neuronal cells can lead to the suppression of antitumor immune responses and the promotion of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuroepithelial interactions in cancer is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the neurocancer axis, including immunotherapies and targeted therapies aimed at disrupting perineural nets and promoting antitumor immune responses."}
