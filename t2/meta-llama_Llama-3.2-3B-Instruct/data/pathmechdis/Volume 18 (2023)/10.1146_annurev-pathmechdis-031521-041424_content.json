{"Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal carcinomas have emerged as a distinct entity within head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), exhibiting unique clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics. This review aims to provide an in-depth examination of the epidemiology, risk factors, and molecular mechanisms underlying HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas, with a special focus on nonkeratinizing lesions. The role of HPV in modulating immune responses and evading immune surveillance is discussed, highlighting the concept of immune escape. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics, including HPV DNA testing and next-generation sequencing, have improved the detection and characterization of HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas. The implications of these findings for clinical management, including the potential for improved treatment outcomes and reduced mortality, are also explored. Overall, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between HPV, the host immune system, and the development of oropharyngeal carcinomas, with implications for future research and clinical practice."}
