{"Abstract": "The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem comprising trillions of microorganisms that play a crucial role in maintaining host health. Recent advances in genetic engineering have enabled the manipulation of the gut microbiome, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention and prevention of diseases. This review highlights the recent progress in microbiome engineering, focusing on the expansion of genetically tractable members of the human gut microbiome. We discuss the development of novel tools and strategies for microbiome editing, including CRISPR-Cas systems and base editing. The potential applications of microbiome engineering in treating gastrointestinal disorders, modulating the immune system, and preventing antibiotic-resistant infections are also explored. By expanding the repertoire of genetically tractable members of the human gut microbiome, microbiome engineering holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic approaches and the prevention of human diseases."}
