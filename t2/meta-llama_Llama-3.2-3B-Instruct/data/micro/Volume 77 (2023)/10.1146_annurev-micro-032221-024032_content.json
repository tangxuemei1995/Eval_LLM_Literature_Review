{"Abstract": "Extracytoplasmic function σ factors (ECF σ factors) are a crucial component of bacterial signal transduction, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to environmental stresses. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the distribution and regulatory diversity of ECF σ factors across various bacterial species, highlighting their unique characteristics and functional adaptations. Comparative genomics and bioinformatics tools reveal a wide range of ECF σ factors with distinct promoter recognition sequences, transcriptional regulatory networks, and interaction partners. The evolution of ECF σ factors has been shaped by the intricate interplay between environmental pressures, genome organization, and gene regulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge on ECF σ factors, emphasizing their importance in understanding bacterial stress response mechanisms and their potential applications in biotechnology and medicine. The future directions of ECF σ factor research are discussed, including the exploration of novel regulatory mechanisms and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies."}
