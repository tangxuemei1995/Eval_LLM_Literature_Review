{"Abstract": "Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play a crucial role in the charging of amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, a process essential for protein synthesis in all living organisms. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting aaRSs for antimalarial drug development, as these enzymes are also involved in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, which are essential for the growth and replication of Plasmodium parasites. By exploiting the unique reaction hijacking capabilities of certain aaRSs, researchers have identified novel antimalarial compounds that selectively inhibit the charging of amino acids to tRNA, thereby disrupting parasite protein synthesis. This abstract reviews the current state of research on targeting aaRSs for antimalarial drug development, highlighting the potential of reaction hijacking as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of malaria."}
