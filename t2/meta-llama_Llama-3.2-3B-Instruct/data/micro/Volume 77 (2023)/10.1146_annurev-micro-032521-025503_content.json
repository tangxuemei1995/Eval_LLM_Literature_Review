{"Abstract": "The bacterial flagellum is a complex molecular machine that propels bacteria through their environment, while the type III secretion system (T3SS) is a versatile virulence apparatus that delivers effector proteins into host cells. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have enabled the structural characterization of the T3SS and its interactions with the flagellum. This study provides structural insights into the T3SS of the bacterial flagellum, revealing the assembly and function of the injectisome, a key component of the T3SS. Cryo-EM structures of the T3SS reveal the conformational changes that occur during the injection of effector proteins, while cryo-ET studies provide a detailed view of the T3SS in its native environment. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the T3SS and its interactions with the flagellum, with implications for our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The structural data presented here will serve as a foundation for future studies into the biology of the T3SS and its role in bacterial infection."}
