{"Abstract": "LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) are a family of bacterial proteins that play a crucial role in global regulation of gene expression. These proteins exhibit versatility in their ability to act as both activators and repressors, modulating the expression of target genes in response to various environmental cues. This versatility is often accompanied by complex mechanisms of action, involving multiple protein-protein interactions, DNA binding, and post-translational modifications. Despite their importance, the common and uncommon facets of LTTRs remain poorly understood. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on LTTRs, highlighting their structural and functional characteristics, as well as their involvement in global regulation of gene expression. The complexities and nuances of LTTRs are discussed, with a focus on their role in modulating transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli, and the implications for our understanding of bacterial gene regulation."}
