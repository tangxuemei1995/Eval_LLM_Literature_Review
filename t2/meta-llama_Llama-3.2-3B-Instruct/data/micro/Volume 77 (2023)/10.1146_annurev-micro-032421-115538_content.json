{"Abstract": "Transporter proteins, comprising a significant portion of microbial eukaryotic pangenomes, play a pivotal role in facilitating adaptation to diverse environments and interactions with host organisms. These proteins, often encoded in accessory genomes, have evolved to confer enhanced fitness and survival capabilities, including increased virulence. The acquisition of transporter genes through horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events has contributed to the remarkable diversity of microbial eukaryotes. This diversity is further underscored by the presence of transporter proteins in both core and accessory genomes, highlighting their importance as ecological assets. The functional specialization of transporter proteins, such as substrate specificity and membrane localization, enables them to modulate nutrient uptake, detoxification, and pathogenesis. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying transporter protein evolution and function will provide valuable insights into the intricate relationships between microbes and their environments, ultimately informing strategies for microbial control and biotechnological applications."}
