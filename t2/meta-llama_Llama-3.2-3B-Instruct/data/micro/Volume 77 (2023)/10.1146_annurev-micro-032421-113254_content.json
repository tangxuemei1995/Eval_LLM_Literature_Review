{"Abstract": "The early fossil record of eukaryotes, spanning from the Neoproterozoic to the Archean eons, provides crucial insights into the evolution of complex life forms. This period witnessed the emergence of eukaryogenesis, a pivotal event that led to the diversification of eukaryotic cells. The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), occurring approximately 2.7 billion years ago, is believed to have played a significant role in shaping the eukaryotic lineage. This study examines the frameworks for interpreting the early fossil record of eukaryotes, with a focus on the Proterozoic era. By integrating fossil evidence with geochemical and paleoenvironmental data, we reconstruct the eukaryotic evolutionary history and explore the implications of the GOE on the origin of complex life. Our findings shed new light on the enigmatic early eukaryotes and provide a framework for future research on the evolution of eukaryotes."}
