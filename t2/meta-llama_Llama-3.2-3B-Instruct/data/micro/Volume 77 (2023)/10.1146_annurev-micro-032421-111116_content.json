{"Abstract": "TonB-dependent transport is a critical mechanism facilitating the uptake of essential nutrients and antibiotics across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, including members of the Bacteroidetes phylum. This process involves the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex, which mediates the energy-dependent transport of substrates through the β-barrel porin OmpF. The discovery of Trojan horse antibiotics, such as gentamicin, has highlighted the importance of TonB-dependent transport in bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying TonB-dependent transport, revealing a complex interplay between the TonB complex, β-barrel porins, and membrane lipids. Understanding the TonB-dependent transport system is essential for the development of novel antibacterial strategies and the design of effective antibiotics targeting this critical bacterial pathway."}
