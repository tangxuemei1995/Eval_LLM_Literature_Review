{"Abstract": "The emergence of metazoan multicellularity is a pivotal event in the history of life on Earth, marking a profound shift from unicellular to complex, multicellular organisms. Recent advances in genomics and comparative analyses of holozoan genomes have provided new insights into the origins of metazoan multicellularity. Our research suggests that a microbial black swan event, involving a previously unknown microbial symbiont, played a crucial role in the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity in the common ancestor of all metazoans. This event, which we term the'symbiotic switch,' likely involved the acquisition of a novel gene regulatory network that coordinated the development and differentiation of cells within a multicellular organism. Phylogenetic analysis of holozoan genomes reveals a distinct pattern of gene expression and cellular organization that is consistent with this hypothesis. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of complex life on Earth and highlight the importance of considering the role of microbial symbionts in shaping the evolution of multicellularity."}
