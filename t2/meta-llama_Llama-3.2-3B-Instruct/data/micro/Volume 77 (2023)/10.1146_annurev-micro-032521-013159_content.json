{"Abstract": "Brucella, a genus of Gram-negative alphaproteobacteria, is a significant zoonotic pathogen causing brucellosis in humans and animals worldwide. The cell envelope of Brucella is a critical component of its pathogenicity, comprising a unique outer membrane and a peptidoglycan layer. Recent studies have elucidated the structure and function of Brucella's outer membrane proteins, which play a pivotal role in the bacterium's ability to invade and survive within host cells. The peptidoglycan layer, on the other hand, is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell envelope and resisting host immune responses. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the Brucella cell envelope, highlighting its unique features and the mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity, with implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against brucellosis."}
