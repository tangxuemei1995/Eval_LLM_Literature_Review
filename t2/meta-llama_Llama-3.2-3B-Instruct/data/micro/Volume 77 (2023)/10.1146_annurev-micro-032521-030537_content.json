{"Abstract": "The phc quorum-sensing system in Ralstonia solanacearum species complex plays a crucial role in regulating pathogenicity and virulence. This system, comprising PhcA, PhcB, and PhcC proteins, is involved in cell-cell communication and modulates the production of virulence factors. In Ralstonia solanacearum, the phc quorum-sensing system has been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in type III secretion system (T3SS) and exotoxin production. Similarly, in Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum, the phc system has been implicated in the regulation of T3SS and flagellar motility. The phc quorum-sensing system is also essential for the formation of biofilms and the development of plant disease symptoms. Understanding the mechanisms of the phc quorum-sensing system in Ralstonia solanacearum species complex is crucial for the development of effective strategies for disease control and management."}
