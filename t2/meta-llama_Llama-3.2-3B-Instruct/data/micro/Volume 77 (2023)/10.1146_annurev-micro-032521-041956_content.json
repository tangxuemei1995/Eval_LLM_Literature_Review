{"Abstract": "The assembly of microbial communities in fermented foods is a complex process influenced by various factors, including food composition, processing conditions, and environmental interactions. This review focuses on the microbiome assembly in fermented foods, with a particular emphasis on cheese and sourdough. The microbial communities in these fermented products are shaped by the interactions between microorganisms, including lactic acid bacteria, yeast, and other microorganisms. The assembly of these communities is influenced by factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of community assembly in determining the flavor, texture, and nutritional properties of fermented foods. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of microbiome assembly in fermented foods, with a focus on cheese and sourdough, and to discuss the implications for the production of high-quality fermented products. The review also explores the potential applications of microbiome assembly in the development of new fermented foods and the improvement of existing ones."}
