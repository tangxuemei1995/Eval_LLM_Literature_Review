{"Abstract": "Electron transfer beyond the outer membrane is a crucial process in the survival and adaptation of certain microorganisms, such as Shewanella and Geobacter, in environments with limited energy availability. These bacteria have evolved unique mechanisms to harness electrons from their surroundings, facilitating the transfer of electrons to external acceptors. The cytochrome-based electron shuttle system plays a pivotal role in this process, enabling the efficient transfer of electrons across the outer membrane. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying extracellular electron transfer, revealing the importance of electron shuttles and cytochromes in mediating this process. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of electron transfer beyond the outer membrane in Shewanella and Geobacter, highlighting the key players and mechanisms involved in this complex process. By elucidating the intricacies of extracellular electron transfer, this review seeks to contribute to our understanding of the ecological and biotechnological implications of this phenomenon."}
