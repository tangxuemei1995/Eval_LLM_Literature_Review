{"Abstract": "Bacterial pathogens have evolved complex mechanisms to reprogram their virulence in response to environmental cues, enabling them to adapt to changing host conditions and optimize their pathogenicity. The two-component system (TCS) and quorum sensing (QS) play crucial roles in regulating these processes. The c-di-GMP signaling pathway, a key component of QS, modulates the expression of virulence genes and regulates interkingdom cell-cell communication. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of interkingdom cell-cell communication in reprogramming bacterial virulence. The c-di-GMP pathway interacts with the TCS to fine-tune the expression of virulence factors, allowing pathogens to adjust their pathogenicity in response to host immune responses. This reprogramming process is essential for bacterial pathogens to establish and maintain infection, and understanding the mechanisms underlying virulence reprogramming is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Elucidating the complex interactions between QS, TCS, and interkingdom cell-cell communication will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing bacterial pathogenesis."}
