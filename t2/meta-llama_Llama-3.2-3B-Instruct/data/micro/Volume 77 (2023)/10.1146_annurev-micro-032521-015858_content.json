{"Abstract": "Candida auris is a highly pathogenic and emerging fungal species that has gained significant attention due to its resistance to antifungal drugs, including azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins. Recent studies have elucidated the genetic mechanisms underlying its resistance, highlighting the importance of the cell wall and MAP kinase signaling pathways. The emergence of C. auris is attributed to its ability to acquire and express resistance genes, such as the FKS1 gene, which encodes a target of echinocandins. The cell wall of C. auris is also characterized by the presence of a unique glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which confers resistance to azoles. The MAP kinase signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of resistance genes and the maintenance of cell wall integrity. Understanding the genetic basis of C. auris resistance is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies and the prevention of its spread. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between C. auris and its environment, and to identify novel targets for antifungal therapy."}
