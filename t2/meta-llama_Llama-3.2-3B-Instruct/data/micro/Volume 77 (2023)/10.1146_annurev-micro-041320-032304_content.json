{"Abstract": "The evolution of bacteria and archaea has been shaped by their ability to adapt to changing environments and transition between different habitats. The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) event, a period of rapid diversification of microbial life, is thought to have occurred in response to habitat transition and dispersal. This transition has been driven by environmental factors such as climate change, geological events, and the formation of new ecosystems. The human microbiome, in particular, has undergone significant changes in response to habitat transition, with shifts in the composition of microbial communities in response to diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. This review aims to explore the relationship between habitat transition and microbial evolution, with a focus on the CPR event and its impact on the human microbiome. By examining the mechanisms of dispersal and adaptation, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and their environments."}
