{"Abstract": "Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is a reproductive barrier that arises when a female insect harbors a male-specific Wolbachia endosymbiont, leading to reduced fertility or sterility in infected males. This phenomenon is mediated by Wolbachia's toxin, which disrupts male germ cell development and function. The nuclease activity of Wolbachia is also implicated in CI, as it degrades male-specific RNA molecules, further inhibiting male fertility. Deubiquitylases, enzymes that remove ubiquitin tags, have been shown to play a role in regulating Wolbachia's toxin activity. The male-killing toxin of Wolbachia is a key factor in CI, as it induces apoptosis in infected male germ cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CI is crucial for elucidating the evolutionary pressures driving the co-evolution of Wolbachia and its insect hosts. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular biology of CI, highlighting the complex interplay between Wolbachia's toxin, nuclease, and deubiquitylase activities in mediating this reproductive barrier."}
