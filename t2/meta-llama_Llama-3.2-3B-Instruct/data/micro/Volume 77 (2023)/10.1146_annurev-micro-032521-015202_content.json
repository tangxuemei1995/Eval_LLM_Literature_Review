{"Abstract": "Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are complex microbial communities that form on the surface of arid lands, playing a crucial role in shaping the biogeochemistry of these ecosystems. In extreme environments, such as those found in arid regions, BSCs are particularly resilient and can thrive under conditions of high temperatures, low moisture, and intense radiation. The microbiology of BSCs is characterized by the presence of diverse cyanobacterial populations, which are capable of surviving desiccation and contributing to the formation of a protective crust. These crusts can alter soil properties, such as pH and nutrient availability, and influence the local hydrology. This research highlights the importance of BSCs in arid lands, with a focus on the role of cyanobacteria in maintaining ecosystem function and resilience in extreme environments. Understanding the microbiology of BSCs is essential for predicting ecosystem responses to climate change and developing strategies for sustainable land management in arid regions."}
