{"Abstract": "Apicomplexan mitochondria exhibit unique properties that distinguish them from other mitochondrial types. In the genus Plasmodium, the parasite's mitochondria have been found to harbor electron transport complexes that are essential for the production of ATP, which is crucial for the parasite's survival and replication. In contrast, Toxoplasma mitochondria lack these complexes, relying instead on the host cell's mitochondria for energy production. The ATP synthase in Apicomplexan mitochondria has also been shown to possess distinct subunit compositions, which may contribute to its unique functional properties. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting electron transport complexes and ATP synthase as antiparasitic strategies, offering new avenues for the development of more effective treatments against Plasmodium and Toxoplasma infections. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these unique properties and to explore their therapeutic potential."}
