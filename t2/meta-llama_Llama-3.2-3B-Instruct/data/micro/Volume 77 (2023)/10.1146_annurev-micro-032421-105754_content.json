{"Abstract": "The human gut phageome, comprising bacteriophages integrated into the gut microbiome, plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health and influencing disease susceptibility. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between phages, bacteria, and the host, leading to significant variation in the phageome across individuals. This study investigates the factors affecting the variation of the human gut phageome, with a focus on the interplay between environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that diet, stress levels, and genetic predisposition significantly impact phage abundance and diversity in the gut. Furthermore, the study suggests that the gut virome, comprising both bacteria and phages, exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity, with distinct phage communities associated with different health outcomes. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the gut phageome's role in human health and disease, highlighting the need for further research into the complex relationships between phages, bacteria, and the host."}
