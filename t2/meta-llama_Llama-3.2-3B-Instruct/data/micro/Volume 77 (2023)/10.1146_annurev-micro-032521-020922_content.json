{"Abstract": "Glacial and hypersaline environments pose unique challenges for fungal growth and survival, with temperatures often below freezing and salt concentrations exceeding 30%. Despite these extreme conditions, various fungal species have been found to thrive in these ecosystems. This study investigates the diversity and adaptability of fungi in glacial and hypersaline environments, focusing on halophilic, psychrophilic, and extremophilic species. We analyzed the genetic and biochemical characteristics of fungal isolates from glacial ice and hypersaline lakes, revealing a range of halotolerant and psychrotolerant species. Notably, several species exhibited high levels of salt exclusion and cold adaptation mechanisms, allowing them to survive in environments with limited resources. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of fungal ecology in extreme environments and highlight the potential for these organisms to serve as model systems for studying adaptation and survival in harsh conditions."}
