{"Abstract": "This review highlights recent advances in understanding the human fungal pathogen's hypoxia response, a critical mechanism driving disease progression. Hypoxia-induced signaling pathways modulate fungal virulence, enabling pathogens to adapt to low-oxygen environments. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia response in fungi, revealing key transcription factors and signaling pathways. These findings have significant implications for the development of antifungal drugs targeting hypoxia-related pathways, offering new therapeutic strategies for treating fungal infections. Understanding hypoxia response in fungi is essential for improving treatment outcomes and combating fungal diseases."}
