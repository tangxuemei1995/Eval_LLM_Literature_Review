{"Abstract": "Bacteria are often perceived as impermeable entities, but recent studies have revealed that they can engage in metabolite externalization, a process where they release metabolites into their environment. This phenomenon, known as 'leakiness,' is a key mechanism of cross-feeding, where bacteria exchange nutrients with each other. Efflux pumps, specialized transporters that actively expel metabolites, play a crucial role in this process. Through the analysis of microbial interactions and metabolic networks, we have identified the mechanisms underlying metabolite externalization in bacterial cross-feeding. Our findings highlight the importance of efflux pumps in facilitating the exchange of nutrients between bacteria, and demonstrate that leakiness is a widespread phenomenon in microbial ecology. This research has significant implications for our understanding of microbial metabolism and the evolution of bacterial interactions."}
