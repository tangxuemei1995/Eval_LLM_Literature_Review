{"Abstract": "Fungal genomes exhibit remarkable plasticity in response to environmental stress, characterized by polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation. These genomic alterations enable fungi to adapt to changing conditions, such as nutrient scarcity and temperature fluctuations. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying fungal genome plasticity, with a focus on polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation. We discuss the evolutionary pressures driving these genomic changes and their impact on fungal physiology and ecology. Furthermore, we highlight the potential applications of fungal genome plasticity in biotechnology, including stress tolerance and bioremediation. By elucidating the complex relationships between fungal genomes and their environment, this review aims to contribute to our understanding of the dynamic nature of fungal genomes and their role in shaping fungal evolution and ecology."}
