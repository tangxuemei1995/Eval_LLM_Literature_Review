{"Abstract": "The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in the activation of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of bacterial components in modulating inflammasome signaling, with certain bacterial influencers capable of either promoting or inhibiting inflammasome activation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of bacterial influencers of inflammasome signaling, focusing on the key players such as gasdermin, NLR proteins, and caspases 1 and 8. The mechanisms by which these bacterial components interact with the inflammasome and modulate its activity are discussed, highlighting the complex interplay between host and pathogen in the regulation of pyroptosis. The implications of these findings for our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies are also explored."}
