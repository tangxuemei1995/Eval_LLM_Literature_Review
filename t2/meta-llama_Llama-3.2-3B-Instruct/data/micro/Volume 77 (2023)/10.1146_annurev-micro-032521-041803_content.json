{"Abstract": "Secretory IgA (sIgA) is a crucial component of the mucosal immune system, providing protection against enteropathogens such as Salmonella. The structure-function relationships of sIgA have been extensively studied, revealing a complex interplay between its polymeric and monomeric forms. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of sIgA's polymeric structure and its role in binding enteropathogens, with a focus on the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and its impact on sIgA secretion. The relationships between sIgA's polymeric structure, its ability to bind Salmonella, and the immune response to enteric infections are discussed. Furthermore, the implications of sIgA's structure-function relationships for vaccine development and therapeutic strategies against enteric diseases are explored. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on sIgA's structure-function relationships across scales, from molecular to organismal levels."}
