{"Abstract": "This study examines the evaluations of civil litigants regarding their legal experiences, focusing on procedures, satisfaction, and fairness. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey of 500 civil litigants was conducted, assessing their perceptions of the legal process and its outcomes. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses revealed common themes of frustration, dissatisfaction, and perceived unfairness. Regression analysis indicated that litigants' evaluations of fairness and satisfaction were significantly influenced by the complexity of the case, court efficiency, and the quality of legal representation. The findings highlight the need for improvements in civil law procedures to enhance litigants' experiences and promote fairness."}
