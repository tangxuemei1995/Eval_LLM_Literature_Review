{"Abstract": "This study examines the complexities of global lawmaking, drawing lessons from the evolution of intellectual property rights and international health emergencies. Through a comparative analysis of international agreements and national policies, we reveal the tensions between methodological nationalism and global governance. Our research highlights the challenges of balancing national interests with global cooperation, particularly in the face of emerging health crises. We demonstrate how intellectual property rights have been used as a tool for global health governance, yet also illustrate the limitations of this approach. Our findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of global lawmaking, one that acknowledges the interplay between national and global forces. By exploring the intersections of intellectual property, global health, and international agreements, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities of global governance and the challenges of creating effective global responses to emerging health threats."}
