{"Abstract": "This study examines the concept of legitimacy in the context of legal authority in the twenty-first century. Drawing on normative alignment theory, we investigate the relationship between trust, confidence, and compliance in the face of evolving legal frameworks. Through a critical discourse analysis of autobiographical accounts from legal professionals, we uncover the tensions between normative expectations and practical realities. Our findings suggest that legitimacy is increasingly contingent upon the ability to foster cooperation and engagement among diverse stakeholders. We argue that the erosion of trust and confidence in institutions is a pressing concern, necessitating a reevaluation of the normative foundations of legal authority. Ultimately, our research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of legitimacy in the contemporary legal landscape, one that acknowledges the complex interplay between normative alignment, compliance, and cooperation."}
