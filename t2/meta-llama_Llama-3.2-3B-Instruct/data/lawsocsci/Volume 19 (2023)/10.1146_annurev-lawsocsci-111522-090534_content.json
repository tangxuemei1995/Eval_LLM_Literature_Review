{"Abstract": "This interdisciplinary study explores the complex relationships between vaccines, public health, and the law, examining the intersections of sociolegal and science studies. Through ethnographic fieldwork and critical analysis of existing literature, this research reveals the multifaceted roles of law in shaping vaccine development, distribution, and administration. The study highlights the tensions between scientific evidence, regulatory frameworks, and social norms in influencing vaccine policy and practice. By engaging with the experiences of healthcare professionals, policymakers, and community members, this research demonstrates the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between law, science, and society in public health contexts. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the sociolegal dynamics surrounding vaccines, informing strategies for improving vaccine uptake and promoting public health outcomes."}
