{"Abstract": "This study examines the lasting impact of Guant치namo Bay on the global rule of law, focusing on the intersection of torture, military commissions, and habeas corpus. The research explores how the CIA's secret black sites and the subsequent establishment of military commissions at Guant치namo Bay undermined the principles of human rights and the rule of law. The Supreme Court's decisions in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld and Boumediene v. Bush, which established the right to habeas corpus and limited the use of military commissions, are analyzed in the context of Guant치namo's legacy. The study also investigates the role of war crimes and the erosion of due process in the post-9/11 era. By examining the complex relationships between these concepts, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the ongoing struggle to balance national security with human rights and the rule of law in the aftermath of Guant치namo's establishment."}
