{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics, to combat the spread of the virus. However, this rapid expansion has also highlighted a critical data governance gap, where the collection, storage, and use of personal data have raised significant concerns regarding privacy and trust. This gap has been exacerbated by the reliance on contact tracing apps and digital health records, which often rely on AI-driven algorithms to process and analyze vast amounts of sensitive data. As governments and organizations continue to invest in digital solutions to mitigate the pandemic's impact, it is essential to address the data governance gap to ensure that data is collected, stored, and used in a way that prioritizes individual privacy and promotes trust. By adopting privacy by design principles, we can create more resilient and trustworthy data systems that support public health efforts while protecting individual rights."}
