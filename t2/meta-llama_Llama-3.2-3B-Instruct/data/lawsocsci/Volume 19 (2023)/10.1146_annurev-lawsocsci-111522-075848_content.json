{"Abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of refeudalization and its implications on the relationship between law and sovereignty. Building on the concept of refeudalization, which refers to the re-emergence of feudal ties and obligations in modern societies, this research explores how the decline of the rule of law and the rise of democratic representation can lead to a reconfiguration of power dynamics. Through a critical analysis of the intersection of contractualization, representation, and sovereignty, this research argues that refeudalization can result in the erosion of democratic principles and the reassertion of pre-democratic forms of authority. The findings suggest that the refeudalization of law can have far-reaching consequences for the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic institutions, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between law, power, and representation in modern societies."}
