{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into government public administration poses significant challenges for regulating its development and deployment. This study examines the sociotechnical design of AI systems in government, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach to regulation. Through a mixed-methods analysis of existing literature and case studies, we identify key factors influencing the design of AI systems in government, including institutional capacity, data quality, and stakeholder engagement. Our findings suggest that a sociotechnically informed regulatory framework is essential for ensuring the responsible development and deployment of AI in government. This framework should prioritize transparency, accountability, and human-centered design principles. By adopting a sociotechnical design approach, governments can harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks and ensuring that these systems serve the public interest. The implications of our research have significant implications for the development of effective AI regulations in government, and highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to addressing the complex challenges of AI governance."}
