{"Abstract": "The integration of technology in law firms has been a subject of intense debate, with some arguing that it is revolutionizing the legal profession, while others claim that it is merely augmenting traditional practices. This study examines the impact of technology on law firms, with a particular focus on the role of artificial intelligence in transforming the legal services industry. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data, we investigate the organizational complementarity between technology and traditional legal practices. Our findings suggest that the effective adoption of technology by law firms is contingent upon the development of complementary strategies that leverage the strengths of both traditional and digital approaches. The results highlight the need for law firms to adopt a nuanced and adaptive approach to technological transformation, one that balances the benefits of innovation with the need for organizational stability and continuity."}
