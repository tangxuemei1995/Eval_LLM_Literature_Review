{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of laws and policies in mitigating implicit bias and promoting equal intergroup relations. Drawing on theories of social cognition and psychology, we analyze the impact of legislative frameworks on social segregation and intergroup interactions. Our analysis reveals that policies aimed at reducing segregation and promoting diversity can have a positive effect on reducing implicit bias. Conversely, laws that perpetuate segregation can exacerbate existing biases. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of effective social interventions and highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between laws, policies, and social cognition. By exploring the complex relationships between laws, policies, and social behavior, this research contributes to the growing field of psychology and law, shedding light on the potential for legal frameworks to shape social outcomes."}
