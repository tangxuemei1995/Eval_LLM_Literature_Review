{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex role of police officers as witnesses and defendants in the legal system, with a focus on police accountability and the implications for law enforcement. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case law, this research explores the tensions between police immunity and the pursuit of truth in the courtroom. The concept of qualified immunity is scrutinized in the context of perjury and Brady evidence, highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability within law enforcement agencies. The findings of this study suggest that police officers' testimony can be unreliable and biased, compromising the integrity of the judicial process. Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of police accountability and the need for reforms that balance public safety with the pursuit of justice and truth."}
