{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of social reproduction and law, focusing on the unpaid and domestic work that underpins capitalist societies. Drawing on materialist feminist theory and legal realism, we analyze the ways in which laws and policies perpetuate and regulate the reproduction of social relations. Through a critical examination of domestic work, care, and unpaid labor, we reveal how these activities are often excluded from the formal economy and subject to unequal distribution of resources and power. Our research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of social reproduction and its relationship to law, one that acknowledges the material and social conditions that shape the lives of individuals and communities. By centering the experiences of marginalized groups, we aim to inform policy and legal reforms that promote greater social justice and equality."}
