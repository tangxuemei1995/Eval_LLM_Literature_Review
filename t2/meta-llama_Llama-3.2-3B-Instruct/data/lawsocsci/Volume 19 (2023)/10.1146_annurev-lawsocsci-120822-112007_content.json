{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of mandatory employment arbitration on access to justice in the workplace. Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data, we analyze the effects of mandatory arbitration clauses on employees' ability to seek redress for employment-related grievances. Our findings suggest that mandatory arbitration can lead to a decrease in access to justice, as employees are forced to resolve disputes through private, often costly, and time-consuming arbitration processes. In contrast, alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation, can provide a more accessible and affordable means of resolving employment disputes. The study's results have implications for employment law and policy, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach to alternative dispute resolution in the workplace. Ultimately, our research underscores the importance of balancing the interests of employers and employees in the pursuit of access to justice."}
