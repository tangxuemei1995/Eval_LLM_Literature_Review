{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China, a country where the rule of law is often compromised in favor of state control. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and empirical evidence, this research explores the relationship between state capitalism and property rights, markets, and labor in China. The dual state framework is employed to understand the coexistence of state-led and market-oriented economic policies. The findings suggest that China's state capitalism has led to the erosion of property rights, particularly in the land sector, where state control and expropriation have become common practices. The labor market is also characterized by state intervention, with the government exerting significant control over employment and wages. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of China's economic development and its impact on the rule of law, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of state capitalism in China."}
