{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into global governance structures raises fundamental questions regarding the modalities, rationales, and tensions surrounding its regulation. This interdisciplinary study examines the complex interplay between AI-driven decision-making and existing global governance frameworks. Through a critical analysis of algorithmic regulation and machine learning applications, we identify both opportunities and challenges for enhancing global cooperation and addressing pressing issues such as data sovereignty, bias, and accountability. Our research reveals that AI-driven governance modalities can facilitate more efficient and effective decision-making, yet also introduce novel risks and uncertainties. By exploring the intersection of AI and global governance, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the need for adaptive and inclusive regulatory frameworks that balance technological innovation with social responsibility and human values. Ultimately, our findings highlight the imperative for a multidisciplinary approach to AI regulation, one that prioritizes transparency, accountability, and human-centered design."}
