{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of firearms law and scholarship, moving beyond the traditional focus on bullets and bodies to examine the complex relationships between gun rights, self-defense, and the broader legal landscape. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case law, this research reveals the multifaceted nature of firearms law, encompassing issues of constitutional interpretation, public policy, and social justice. By situating firearms law within the context of broader debates around gun control and self-defense, this study aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of firearms in American society and the ongoing evolution of firearms law and scholarship."}
