{"Abstract": "This study centers the experiences of low-wage immigrant laborers, highlighting the intersections of racism and immigration in the workplace. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with immigrant workers, this research reveals the ways in which racism and xenophobia shape their working conditions, job security, and access to rights and justice. The findings suggest that immigrant workers face unique forms of exploitation, including wage theft, harassment, and discriminatory hiring practices. The study argues that a critical examination of the relationships between racism, immigration, and labor is essential for promoting the rights and dignity of low-wage immigrant workers. By centering the voices and experiences of these workers, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the complex power dynamics at play in the global labor market."}
