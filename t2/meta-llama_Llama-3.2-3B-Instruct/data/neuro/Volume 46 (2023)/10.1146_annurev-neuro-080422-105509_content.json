{"Abstract": "Meningeal mechanisms play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of migraine, a complex and debilitating headache disorder. The meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, are involved in the initiation and propagation of migraine attacks. Research has identified the trigeminal nerve, which innervates the meninges, as a key player in the development of migraine. Meningeal afferents, specialized nerve fibers that detect changes in the meninges, contribute to neurogenic inflammation, a hallmark of migraine. Sensitization of these afferents leads to an exaggerated response to normal stimuli, resulting in the characteristic pain and other symptoms of migraine. Cortical spreading depression, a wave of abnormal electrical activity, also plays a role in migraine pathophysiology, contributing to the spread of pain and other symptoms. Understanding the meningeal mechanisms underlying migraine is crucial for the development of effective treatments and prevention strategies."}
