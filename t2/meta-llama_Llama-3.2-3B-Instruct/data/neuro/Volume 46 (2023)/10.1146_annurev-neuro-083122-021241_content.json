{"Abstract": "This study investigates the integration of feedforward and feedback information streams in the modular architecture of the mouse visual cortex. Utilizing a combination of electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, we examined the role of layer 1 patchy connections and the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in modulating the processing hierarchy. Our results demonstrate that activation of the M2 receptor in layer 1 enhances the convergence of feedforward and feedback information streams, leading to improved processing efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, we found that this modulation is mediated by the strengthening of M2 receptor-preferring connections between layer 1 and subsequent layers. These findings provide novel insights into the functional organization of the mouse visual cortex and have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual processing."}
