{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neural circuits underlying emotion processing across species, with a focus on the valence dimension of emotional experience. Using a combination of cross-species comparative and circuit-level analyses, we examine the neural mechanisms that govern the generation and regulation of emotional states. Our results reveal that the valence circuit, a network of interconnected brain regions, is conserved across mammals, including humans, and plays a critical role in modulating emotional responses. We identify key nodes and connections within this circuit, including the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, and demonstrate their involvement in emotion regulation. These findings have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of emotion and suggest potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for emotional disorders."}
