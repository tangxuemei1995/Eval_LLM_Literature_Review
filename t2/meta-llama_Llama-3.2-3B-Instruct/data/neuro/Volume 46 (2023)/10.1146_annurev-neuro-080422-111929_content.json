{"Abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster, the visual system is capable of detecting motion and directing attention towards moving stimuli. This is achieved through a complex interplay of neural computations involving multiple visual neurons and interneurons. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying motion detection in flies, revealing a multiplicative disinhibition process that enhances the response to motion. This process involves the inhibition of inhibitory neurons, which in turn enhances the activity of excitatory neurons responding to motion. Direction selectivity is also crucial for fly motion detection, as it allows flies to track moving objects in different directions. The neural computation underlying direction selectivity involves the interaction of multiple visual neurons and interneurons, including the use of multiplicative disinhibition to enhance the response to motion. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying fly motion detection has implications for our understanding of visual processing in insects and may also inform the development of novel visual prosthetics for humans."}
