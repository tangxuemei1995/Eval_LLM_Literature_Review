{"Abstract": "This study investigates the functional organization of specialized networks in the primate brain, with a focus on social cognition and social interaction. Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral analyses, we examined the neural correlates of social knowledge and face processing in rhesus macaques. Our results show that the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus are critical regions for face processing, while the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex are involved in social knowledge and theory of mind. We also found that these regions are interconnected through a network of white matter tracts, which are essential for the integration of social information. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of social cognition in primates and have implications for our understanding of the evolution of social brain function in humans."}
