{"Abstract": "Context-dependent learning refers to the ability of individuals to adapt to changing environments and learn from experiences that are specific to particular contexts. Recent advances in computational modeling and neural imaging have shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying this complex cognitive process. This review integrates findings from neuroscience and machine learning to elucidate the computational and neural bases of context-dependent learning. We discuss the role of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus in processing contextual information and updating memory representations. Bayesian inference and neural computation are also examined as key drivers of context-dependent learning. Furthermore, we explore the implications of context-dependent learning for understanding human memory and learning, as well as its applications in artificial intelligence and robotics. By synthesizing insights from multiple disciplines, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying context-dependent learning."}
