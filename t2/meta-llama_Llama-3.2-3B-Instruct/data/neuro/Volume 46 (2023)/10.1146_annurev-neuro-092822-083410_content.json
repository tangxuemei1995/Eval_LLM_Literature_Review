{"Abstract": "Recent studies have explored the therapeutic potential of PTBP1 inhibition in various neurological disorders, including those affecting the retina. However, the underlying mechanisms of PTBP1 inhibition remain poorly understood. A key concern is the potential for PTBP1 inhibition to induce glia-to-neuron conversion, a process in which astrocytes or Müller glia reprogram into functional neurons. This process has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, we investigated the effects of PTBP1 inhibition on retinal ganglion cells and Müller glia. Our results show that PTBP1 inhibition does not induce significant glia-to-neuron conversion in the retina. Instead, PTBP1 inhibition appears to modulate the activity of Müller glia, leading to improved function of retinal ganglion cells. These findings suggest that PTBP1 inhibition may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of retinal diseases, but further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying its effects."}
