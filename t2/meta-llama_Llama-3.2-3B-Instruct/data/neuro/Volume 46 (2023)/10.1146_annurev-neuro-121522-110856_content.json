{"Abstract": "Sexually dimorphic social behavior is a complex phenomenon influenced by a multifaceted interplay of genetic, neurochemical, and environmental factors. This review aims to bridge the developmental and adult stages of social behavior, focusing on the neural mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic social behavior. Research has shown that GABA neurons, a key inhibitory neurotransmitter, play a crucial role in regulating social behavior, particularly in the context of aggression and social play. The social behavior network, a network of interconnected brain regions, is also implicated in the regulation of social behavior. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications, mediated by enzymes such as aromatase, have been shown to influence social behavior by modulating gene expression. This review will discuss the current understanding of these neural mechanisms and their developmental origins, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between genetic, neurochemical, and environmental factors in shaping sexually dimorphic social behavior."}
