{"Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. By modulating neural activity in specific brain regions, DBS aims to alleviate symptoms of these debilitating psychiatric conditions. Studies have shown that DBS can effectively reduce OCD symptoms, including compulsive behaviors and anxiety, in patients who have failed to respond to traditional treatments. Furthermore, DBS has also demonstrated efficacy in treating depression, particularly in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. The precise mechanisms underlying DBS's therapeutic effects are not fully understood, but evidence suggests that it modulates neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin and dopamine, to promote neural plasticity and reduce symptoms. As a minimally invasive procedure, DBS offers a promising alternative to traditional psychiatric treatments, with potential applications in improving the quality of life for individuals with OCD and depression."}
