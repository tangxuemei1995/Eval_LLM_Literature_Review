{"Abstract": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues plays a crucial role in navigation, visual processing, and perception. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of multisensory integration in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the vestibular and visual cortices. This integration enables the brain to accurately estimate self-motion, spatial location, and visual context. In this context, the vestibular system, which detects changes in head position and movement, provides essential information for navigation and balance. Visual cues, on the other hand, offer information about the environment and object recognition. The integration of these cues in the cerebral cortex allows for the creation of a unified perceptual representation, enabling individuals to navigate complex environments and perceive their surroundings accurately. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this integration is essential for developing novel treatments for vestibular disorders and improving navigation and visual processing in individuals with neurological or psychiatric conditions."}
