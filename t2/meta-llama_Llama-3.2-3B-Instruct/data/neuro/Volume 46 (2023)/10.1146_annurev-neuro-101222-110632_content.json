{"Abstract": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between the body and brain in the formation and retrieval of memories, focusing on the concept of exaptation. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the role of the hippocampus in memory consolidation and the interplay between sharp-wave ripples, homeostasis, and allostasis in modulating cognitive processes. Our analysis reveals that the body's glucose regulation and autonomic nervous system play a crucial role in shaping memory formation, with implications for the body-brain partnership. Furthermore, we discuss the potential for exaptation of memory, where previously stored information is reactivated and reinterpreted in response to changing physiological states. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex dynamics between the body and brain in memory formation, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between physiological and cognitive processes."}
