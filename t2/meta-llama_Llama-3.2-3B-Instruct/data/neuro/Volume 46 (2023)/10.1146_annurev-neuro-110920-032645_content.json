{"Abstract": "This review article explores the neural mechanisms underlying navigation, a complex cognitive process that relies on the integration of multiple sensory inputs and spatial memory. Recent advances in neural network research have shed light on the neural circuits and computations involved in navigation, including the role of head direction cells, dopamine signaling, and path integration. By examining the connections between these components, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how neural networks process spatial information and generate navigational behaviors. Our review highlights the key findings from studies on menotaxis, the ability to navigate through familiar environments, and the neural transformations involved in coordinate transformation, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the neural basis of navigation and its potential applications in robotics and cognitive neuroscience."}
