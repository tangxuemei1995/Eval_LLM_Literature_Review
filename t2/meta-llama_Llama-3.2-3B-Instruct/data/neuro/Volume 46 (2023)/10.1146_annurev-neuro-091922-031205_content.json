{"Abstract": "Astrocyte endfeet play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and regulating cerebral blood flow, thereby influencing brain function and pathology. The endfeet, thin extensions of astrocytes that wrap around capillaries, are essential for neurovascular coupling, a process by which changes in neural activity influence blood flow and metabolism. However, the precise mechanisms underlying astrocyte endfeet function and their contribution to brain disease remain poorly understood. Research has shown that alterations in astrocyte endfeet structure and function are associated with various neurological disorders, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the complex relationships between astrocyte endfeet, blood-brain barrier integrity, and cerebral blood flow, with the ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain-related diseases."}
