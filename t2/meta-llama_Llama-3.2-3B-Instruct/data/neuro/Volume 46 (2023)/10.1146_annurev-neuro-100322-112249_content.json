{"Abstract": "Circadian rhythms, regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and overall health. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the brain, have been implicated in the modulation of circadian rhythms through calcium signaling pathways. Recent studies have revealed that astrocytes can act as gliotransmitters, releasing neurotransmitters and signaling molecules that synchronize neural activity with the circadian clock. However, dysregulation of circadian rhythms has been linked to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and glioma. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the complex relationships between circadian rhythms, astrocytes, and gliotransmitters, highlighting both the beneficial and detrimental effects of these interactions. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these relationships, this review seeks to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of circadian-related disorders and potential therapeutic strategies for their treatment."}
