{"Abstract": "The construction of a cognitive map, a mental representation of spatial relationships and navigation, is a complex process involving the coordinated development of neural circuits and computations within the brain. Research has identified the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus as key structures involved in the formation of cognitive maps, with the hippocampus playing a critical role in the initial stages of spatial learning and memory. As the brain matures, the entorhinal cortex integrates information from multiple sources, including sensory inputs and prior experiences, to construct a comprehensive cognitive map. This abstract reviews the current understanding of the development of cognitive maps, highlighting the interplay between the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and discussing the implications for our understanding of spatial navigation and memory. The findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for spatial disorders and cognitive impairments."}
