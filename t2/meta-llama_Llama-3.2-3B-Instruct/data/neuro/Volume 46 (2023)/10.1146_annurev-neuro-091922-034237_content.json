{"Abstract": "Aging is a complex process that affects various physiological systems, including cholesterol metabolism, leading to an increased risk of age-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in cholesterol homeostasis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism contributing to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a critical role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and maintaining neuronal health. As aging progresses, microglial function declines, leading to impaired cholesterol metabolism and increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of cholesterol metabolism in aging and age-related neurological disorders, with a focus on the role of microglia in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and maintaining neuronal health. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cholesterol metabolism in aging may provide new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of age-related neurological diseases."}
