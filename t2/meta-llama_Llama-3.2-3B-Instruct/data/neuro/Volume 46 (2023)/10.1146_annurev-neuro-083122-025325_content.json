{"Abstract": "Spinal interneurons play a crucial role in regulating motor control and locomotion, with a diverse array of neuronal populations contributing to the complex circuitry of the ventral horn. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of interneuronal connectivity in modulating motor output, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting unique expression profiles and synaptic connections. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of spinal interneuron diversity and connectivity, with a focus on their role in motor control and locomotion. We discuss the functional specialization of interneuronal subtypes, including their involvement in rhythmic activity generation, sensory processing, and motor pattern formation. Furthermore, we examine the molecular mechanisms underlying interneuronal connectivity, including synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between spinal interneurons, motor control, and locomotion."}
