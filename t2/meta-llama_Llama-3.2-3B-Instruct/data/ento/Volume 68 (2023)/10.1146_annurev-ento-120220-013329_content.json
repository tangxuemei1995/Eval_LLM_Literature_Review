{"Abstract": "Phoresy, a form of symbiotic association where one organism, the phoretic organism, rides on another, the host organism, has long been recognized as a crucial mechanism of dispersal in various Acari species. However, the nature of this relationship is often misunderstood as purely parasitic, with the phoretic organism deriving benefits at the expense of the host. This abstract reviews recent studies on phoresy in Acari, highlighting the complexity of host-pheretic relationships and the conditional nature of these associations. We discuss the various benefits that phoretic organisms can derive from host-pheretic relationships, including enhanced dispersal, increased access to new habitats, and improved survival rates. Furthermore, we examine the ways in which phoretic organisms can influence host behavior and ecology, and vice versa. Our review reveals that phoresy is a multifaceted phenomenon that challenges traditional notions of parasitism and highlights the intricate interdependencies between host and phoretic organisms."}
