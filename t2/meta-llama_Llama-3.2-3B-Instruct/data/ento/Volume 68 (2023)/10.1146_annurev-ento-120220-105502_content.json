{"Abstract": "The management of insect pests with Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) crops has been a crucial aspect of agricultural practices in the United States. Bt crops, which produce a toxin that kills certain insect species, have been widely adopted for the control of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera pests, including the European corn borer and the cotton bollworm. However, the overuse of Bt crops has led to the development of insect resistance, necessitating the implementation of refuge strategies to maintain the effectiveness of these crops. Refuge strategies involve planting non-Bt crops alongside Bt crops to provide a source of susceptible insects, thereby maintaining the genetic diversity of the pest population and slowing the development of resistance. This review examines the current state of insect resistance management in Bt crops, including the use of refuge strategies, and discusses the implications for sustainable agricultural practices in the United States."}
