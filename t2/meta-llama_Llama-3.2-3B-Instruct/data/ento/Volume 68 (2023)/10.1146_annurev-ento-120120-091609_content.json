{"Abstract": "Dehydration dynamics in terrestrial arthropods are intricately linked to their ability to sense water availability and respond to environmental changes. As climate change alters humidity levels, arthropods must adapt to maintain water balance and ensure survival. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the physiological and behavioral mechanisms underlying water sensing and conservation in terrestrial arthropods, from the molecular to the ecosystem level. We examine the role of humidity sensing in regulating water loss and the impact of drought on trophic interactions, including predator-prey dynamics and nutrient cycling. Our analysis highlights the need for arthropods to develop novel strategies to cope with changing environmental conditions, and underscores the importance of considering the complex interactions between water availability, climate change, and ecosystem functioning in the context of arthropod ecology."}
