{"Abstract": "Spodoptera frugiperda, the fall armyworm, is a highly invasive and destructive pest species that has spread across the Americas, causing significant economic losses to agriculture. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the ecology, evolution, and management options of S. frugiperda, highlighting the complexities of its taxonomy, population genetics, and host plant use. Our analysis reveals that strain hybridization and mate attraction play crucial roles in the species' reproductive success, while insecticide resistance has emerged as a major concern. The review also discusses the evolutionary history of S. frugiperda, including its origins and dispersal patterns. Effective management strategies, including integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, are discussed, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of the species' ecology and evolution. By integrating insights from population genetics, host plant use, and mate attraction, researchers and policymakers can develop targeted management strategies to mitigate the impacts of S. frugiperda on agricultural productivity and ecosystem health."}
