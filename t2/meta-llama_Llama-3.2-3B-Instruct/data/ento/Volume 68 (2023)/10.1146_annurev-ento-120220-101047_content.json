{"Abstract": "Climate warming has been shown to disrupt the delicate balance of life cycles in various organisms, leading to changes in the timing and duration of diapause, a state of dormancy that allows individuals to survive adverse environmental conditions. This study examines the impact of climate warming on univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, focusing on the phenomenon of prolonged diapause. We review the current literature on the mechanisms underlying diapause, including the role of circannual rhythms, phenotypic plasticity, and bet-hedging strategies. Our analysis reveals that climate warming can lead to extended diapause periods, allowing individuals to delay reproduction and increase their chances of survival. However, this adaptation comes at a cost, as prolonged diapause can also lead to reduced fitness and altered phenotypes. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions between climate change, life cycle strategies, and phenotypic plasticity in understanding the impacts of warming on ecosystems. By exploring the dynamics of diapause in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the adaptive responses of organisms to climate change."}
