{"Abstract": "Iron homeostasis is a crucial process in insects, essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin, enzymes, and other biomolecules. Insects have evolved complex mechanisms to regulate iron levels, involving the interplay of ferritin, transferrin, and metal transporters. Ferritin, a key iron-storage protein, plays a central role in iron sequestration and release, while transferrin, a glycoprotein, facilitates iron transport across cell membranes. Metal transporters, such as DMT1 and IRT1, regulate iron uptake from the environment and its incorporation into biomolecules. Disruptions in iron homeostasis can lead to impaired insect development, reduced fertility, and increased susceptibility to pathogens. This review highlights the current understanding of iron homeostasis in insects, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms and their implications for insect physiology and disease susceptibility."}
