{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential of remote sensing technologies, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imaging, for early monitoring of forest wood-boring pests. By analyzing high-resolution aerial images and satellite data, researchers can identify infestations of insects such as beetles and borers at an early stage. This enables timely interventions to prevent damage to forest ecosystems and timber production. The findings of this research highlight the feasibility of remote sensing for forest pest management, offering a cost-effective and efficient approach to early detection and monitoring of wood-boring pests in forests."}
