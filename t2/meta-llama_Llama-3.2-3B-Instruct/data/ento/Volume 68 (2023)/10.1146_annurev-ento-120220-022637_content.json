{"Abstract": "This study examines the diversity, form, and postembryonic development of Paleozoic insects, a group that has long been shrouded in mystery due to the scarcity of fossil records. Phylogenetic analysis of Hexapoda reveals deep divergences among the earliest known insect lineages, which had already begun to exhibit characteristic hexapodal appendages. Functional morphology of Paleozoic insect fossils suggests that these ancient insects had evolved complex body plans, including wing-like appendages and exoskeletal structures. The postembryonic development of Paleozoic insects is also explored, with evidence suggesting that these insects underwent significant transformations during their larval stages, including the development of imaginal discs. This research provides new insights into the evolution of insect body plans and highlights the importance of considering the functional morphology of fossilized remains in understanding the biology of ancient organisms."}
