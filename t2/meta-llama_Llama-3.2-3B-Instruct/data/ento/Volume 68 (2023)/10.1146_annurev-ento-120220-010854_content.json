{"Abstract": "Forest insect biosecurity is a critical component of forest management, aiming to prevent the introduction and spread of non-native insect species that can cause significant economic and ecological harm. This review synthesizes existing knowledge on the processes, patterns, and predictions of forest insect biosecurity, highlighting the pitfalls and challenges associated with eradication efforts. We examine the various pathways through which non-native insect species can enter forests, including human activity, climate change, and international trade. Phytosanitary measures, such as surveillance and monitoring, are essential for early detection and rapid response to invasive species. However, the effectiveness of these measures is often hindered by inadequate funding, limited resources, and insufficient coordination among stakeholders. Our analysis reveals that a comprehensive approach to forest insect biosecurity, incorporating multiple strategies and stakeholders, is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with biological invasions. By understanding the complex dynamics of forest insect biosecurity, we can develop more effective prevention and eradication strategies to protect forest ecosystems and economies."}
