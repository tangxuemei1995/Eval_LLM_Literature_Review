{"Abstract": "This study investigates the postcopulatory behavior of tephritid flies, focusing on the role of accessory gland peptides in remating and the efficacy of the sterile insect technique (SIT) in controlling tephritid populations. Our results show that male tephritid flies release accessory gland peptides during copulation, which play a crucial role in facilitating remating and sperm transfer. The peptides also influence sperm quality and fertility, with higher concentrations associated with improved sperm motility and viability. The SIT, which involves sterilizing male flies through genetic modification or chemical treatment, was found to be highly effective in reducing remating rates and increasing the proportion of sterile males. These findings have significant implications for the development of SIT programs for managing tephritid pests, and highlight the importance of understanding the postcopulatory behavior of these flies in the context of population control strategies."}
