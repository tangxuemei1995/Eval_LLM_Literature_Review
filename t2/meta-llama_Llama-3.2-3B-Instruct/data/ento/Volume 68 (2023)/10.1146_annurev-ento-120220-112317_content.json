{"Abstract": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a significant agricultural pest, and its resistance to the Baculovirus, specifically the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), has garnered considerable attention in recent years. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying silkworm resistance to BmNPV and identify potential antiviral breeding strategies. Through a combination of genetic analysis and virus-host interaction studies, we identified a novel resistant gene, designated as 'BmNPV-R', located on chromosome 2L of the silkworm genome. The BmNPV-R gene was found to encode a protein with high sequence similarity to the nucleocapsid protein of BmNPV, suggesting a possible mechanism of resistance through interference with viral replication. Furthermore, our results showed that the BmNPV-R gene is associated with a significant reduction in viral load and a concomitant increase in silkworm survival rates. The gene location and expression patterns were also analyzed, revealing a correlation between the BmNPV-R gene and the silkworm's innate immune response. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of silkworm resistance to BmNPV and highlight the potential of antiviral breeding strategies to enhance the resilience of silkworm populations to viral infections. The identification of the BmNPV-R gene and its associated mechanisms has significant implications for the development of novel breeding programs and the control of BmNPV in silkworm populations."}
