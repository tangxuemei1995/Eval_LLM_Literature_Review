{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate ecology of stingless bees (Apidae: Apinae: Meliponini) in tropical regions, with a focus on their role in pollination, honey production, and resin collection. Our research reveals that stingless bees are crucial pollinators of various tropical crops, including coffee, cocoa, and fruit trees. The bees' unique social structure and communication systems enable them to efficiently collect and transport pollen, resulting in significant honey production. Furthermore, stingless bees are also important collectors of resin, which is used by local communities for medicinal and industrial purposes. Our findings highlight the importance of stingless bees in maintaining ecosystem balance and providing valuable resources for human societies. The study's results have significant implications for bee conservation, sustainable bee-keeping practices, and the development of eco-friendly industries that rely on these social bees."}
