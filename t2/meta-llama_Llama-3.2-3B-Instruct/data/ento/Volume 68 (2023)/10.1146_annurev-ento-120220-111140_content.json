{"Abstract": "The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, is a highly invasive planthopper native to Asia that has been introduced to the United States, posing significant threats to native ecosystems and agricultural industries. This invasive species exhibits a unique life cycle, with a complex host plant relationship and a propensity for rapid reproduction. Research has shown that the spotted lanternfly can cause substantial damage to a wide range of host plants, including those in viticulture, resulting in significant economic losses. Effective management strategies, including biological control and integrated pest management, are crucial to mitigating the invasion potential of this species and protecting native ecosystems."}
