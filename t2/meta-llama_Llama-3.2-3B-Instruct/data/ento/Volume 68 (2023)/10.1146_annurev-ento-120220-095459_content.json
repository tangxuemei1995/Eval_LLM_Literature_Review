{"Abstract": "Vibrational signaling systems play a crucial role in insect communication, enabling the exchange of information between individuals and facilitating complex social behaviors. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the functional diversity of vibrational signaling systems in insects, highlighting the various substrates, modes, and contexts in which these signals are generated and perceived. From substrate-borne vibrations to air-borne sound waves, we examine the evolution of vibrosensory systems and their integration with other sensory modalities. Our analysis reveals the importance of multimodal signaling in pest management, where vibrational cues can be leveraged to disrupt insect social behavior and communication networks. By elucidating the functional diversity of vibrational signaling systems, this review contributes to our understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying insect communication and behavior."}
