{"Abstract": "The resurgence of bed bugs, Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, has become a significant public health concern worldwide. This phenomenon is attributed to various factors, including increased international travel, changes in pest management practices, and the development of pesticide-resistant populations. Historical control options against bed bugs have been largely based on chemical control methods, which have been criticized for their environmental and health impacts. In recent years, nonchemical control methods have gained attention as a more sustainable alternative. This review aims to provide an overview of historical and contemporary control options against bed bugs, including chemical and nonchemical methods. The review highlights the effectiveness and limitations of various control strategies, such as heat treatment, cold treatment, and biological control. The discussion also emphasizes the need for integrated pest management approaches that combine multiple control methods to effectively manage bed bug infestations. Understanding the complexities of bed bug biology and ecology is crucial for developing effective control strategies that balance public health and environmental concerns."}
