{"Abstract": "Plant-pollinator networks play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem function and resilience in the face of global environmental change. Despite their importance, these networks are often vulnerable to disruptions caused by ecosystem shifts and environmental stressors. This study investigates the resilience of plant-pollinator networks to ecosystem shifts and global environmental change. Using a combination of empirical data and modeling approaches, we examine the effects of climate change, habitat fragmentation, and invasive species on the structure and function of plant-pollinator networks. Our results show that these networks exhibit high levels of robustness and resilience, with many species and communities able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. However, we also identify key factors that contribute to network vulnerability, including the loss of pollinator species and the degradation of plant-pollinator interactions. Our findings have important implications for conservation and management strategies aimed at maintaining ecosystem resilience in the face of global environmental change."}
