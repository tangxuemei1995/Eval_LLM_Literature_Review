{"Abstract": "The chemical ecology of floral resources plays a crucial role in the conservation biological control of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid wasps. These insects rely on specific floral volatiles and nectar-associated microorganisms as food sources, which are essential for their development and reproduction. In agroecosystems, the manipulation of floral resources can significantly impact the efficacy of conservation biological control. This study investigates the role of floral volatiles and nectar-associated microorganisms in supporting parasitoid and hyperparasitoid wasp populations. We examined the effects of different floral resources on the growth and reproduction of these wasps, and found that certain floral volatiles and microorganisms enhanced their development and survival. Our results highlight the importance of considering the chemical ecology of floral resources in the design of conservation biological control strategies for agroecosystems. By manipulating floral resources, farmers and conservationists can create a more favorable environment for parasitoid and hyperparasitoid wasps, leading to improved biological control outcomes."}
