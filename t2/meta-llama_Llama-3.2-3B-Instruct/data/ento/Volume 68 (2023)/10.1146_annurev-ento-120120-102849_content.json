{"Abstract": "The evolution of herbivory on land is a pivotal event in the history of life on Earth, with significant implications for the development of ecosystems and the fossil record. This study examines the impact of arthropods and pathogens on fossil and modern plants, with a focus on the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. By analyzing damage types and functional feeding groups, we investigate the role of arthropods and pathogens in shaping plant evolution and diversity. Our research spans the Cretaceous-Paleogene ecologic crisis, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, and the Permian-Triassic ecologic crisis, three critical periods in Earth's history marked by significant environmental upheaval. We find that arthropods and pathogens played a crucial role in the development of herbivory on land, with evidence of damage to fossil plants dating back to the Early Paleozoic era. Our results suggest that the evolution of herbivory was a complex and multifaceted process, driven by a combination of factors including climate change, geological events, and the interactions between plants and animal herbivores. By exploring the origins and evolution of herbivory on land, this study provides new insights into the history of life on Earth and the complex relationships between plants and animals."}
