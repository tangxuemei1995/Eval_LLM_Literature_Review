{"Abstract": "Advances in optical/infrared interferometry have significantly expanded our understanding of various astrophysical phenomena, from the intricate dynamics of the Galactic Center to the detection of exoplanets and the study of young stellar objects. Recent breakthroughs in instrumentation have enabled the formation of high-contrast images and spectroscopic measurements, allowing researchers to probe the properties of active galactic nuclei and the circumstellar environments of stars. The development of advanced wavefront sensing and control systems has improved the precision and stability of interferometric observations, facilitating the detection of exoplanets and the characterization of their host stars. Furthermore, the integration of optical/infrared interferometry with other observational techniques, such as spectroscopy and imaging, has enabled the study of complex astrophysical phenomena, including the formation of young stellar objects and the evolution of galaxies. This review highlights the current state of the field, discussing recent advances in instrumentation, data analysis, and theoretical modeling, and exploring the potential applications of optical/infrared interferometry in the study of the universe, from the Galactic Center to the detection of exoplanets and the study of young stellar objects."}
