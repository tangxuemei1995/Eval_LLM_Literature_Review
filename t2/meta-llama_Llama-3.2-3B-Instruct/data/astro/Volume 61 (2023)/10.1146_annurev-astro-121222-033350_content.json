{"Abstract": "This autobiography chronicles the author's journey as a strategic scientist, traversing the realms of time and space. Born in China, the author's fascination with the mysteries of the universe led them to pursue a career in radio astronomy. Through their work in VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry), the author gained unparalleled insights into the dynamic interplay between the Earth's crust and the universe. Astro-geodynamics, a field that seeks to understand the intricate relationships between celestial bodies and the Earth's interior, became a central focus of their research. International cooperation played a pivotal role in the author's work, as collaborations with scientists from around the world enabled the advancement of deep space exploration. This narrative weaves together the author's personal experiences, scientific discoveries, and the broader context of China's contributions to the field. By exploring the intersections of time, space, and human endeavor, this autobiography offers a unique perspective on the evolution of strategic science and its potential to shape our understanding of the cosmos."}
