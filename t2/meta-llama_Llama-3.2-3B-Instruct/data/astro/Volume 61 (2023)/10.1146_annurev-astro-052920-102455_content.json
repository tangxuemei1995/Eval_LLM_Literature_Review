{"Abstract": "The epoch of cosmic dawn marks a pivotal moment in the history of the universe, where the first stars and galaxies began to form and ionize the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). Quasars, incredibly luminous objects thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies, played a crucial role in this process. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this abstract aims to synthesize our current understanding of the interplay between quasars and the IGM at cosmic dawn. Research suggests that the growth of SMBHs during this period was closely tied to the formation and evolution of galaxies, with quasars serving as a key driver of galaxy evolution. The intense radiation emitted by quasars is believed to have triggered the reionization of the IGM, a process that had a profound impact on the large-scale structure of the universe. Studies of quasar spectra and IGM absorption lines have provided valuable insights into the physical conditions of the IGM at cosmic dawn. These observations have revealed a complex interplay between the IGM and the surrounding galaxy, with the IGM playing a crucial role in regulating the growth of SMBHs. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on quasars and the IGM at cosmic dawn, highlighting the key findings and open questions in this rapidly evolving field. By exploring the complex relationships between quasars, galaxies, and the IGM, this review seeks to shed new light on the early universe and the formation of the first stars and galaxies."}
