{"Abstract": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the diffuse, ionized gas that surrounds galaxies, playing a crucial role in their formation and evolution. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of key physical processes in shaping the CGM, including hydrodynamic and thermodynamic interactions between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the galaxy's hot halo. These interactions can lead to the formation of complex plasma structures, such as filaments and bubbles, which in turn influence the galaxy's growth and evolution. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of key physical processes in the CGM, including the role of hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and radiative processes in shaping the CGM's morphology and composition. We also discuss the implications of these processes for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, including the regulation of star formation and the distribution of metals. By integrating insights from cosmological simulations, observations of galaxy clusters and large-scale structure, and laboratory experiments, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex physical processes that govern the CGM. Our review highlights the need for further research into the CGM's role in shaping the universe's large-scale structure and the formation of galaxies."}
