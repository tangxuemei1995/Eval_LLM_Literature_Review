{"Abstract": "This study employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to analyze and model astronomical time-series data, a crucial aspect of astrostatistics. By leveraging the strengths of GPR in handling complex, non-linear relationships, we aim to improve the accuracy of time-domain astronomical observations. Our approach involves utilizing a large dataset of astronomical time-series data, which encompasses various astrophysical phenomena, such as stellar variability and pulsar activity. We apply GPR to identify patterns and trends in these datasets, utilizing techniques such as Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to account for uncertainty and model selection. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GPR in capturing the underlying dynamics of astronomical time-series data, particularly in the presence of noise and non-linear relationships. Our findings have significant implications for the analysis and interpretation of astronomical data, enabling researchers to better understand complex astrophysical phenomena and make more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of GPR makes it an attractive alternative to traditional methods, such as linear regression and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, for large-scale astronomical time-series analysis. By integrating GPR with astrostatistics techniques, we provide a novel framework for the analysis of astronomical time-series data, paving the way for future research in this field."}
