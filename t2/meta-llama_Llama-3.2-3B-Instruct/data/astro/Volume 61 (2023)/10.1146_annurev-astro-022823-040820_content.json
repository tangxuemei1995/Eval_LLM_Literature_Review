{"Abstract": "The formation of planets and the origins of life in the universe are deeply intertwined with the chemical processes that occur within protoplanetary disks. These disks, the precursors to planetary systems, are dynamic environments where gas and dust interact, leading to the formation of complex molecules and the delivery of organic materials to nascent planets. This review article provides an overview of the current state of knowledge in protoplanetary disk chemistry, with a focus on the key chemical processes that shape the composition of these disks. From the formation of simple molecules such as water and ammonia, to the more complex molecules like amino acids and sugars, we examine the role of radiation, shock waves, and grain surface chemistry in shaping the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks. We also discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of planet formation and the origins of life in the universe, highlighting the potential for astrochemical studies to provide insights into the complex interplay between chemistry, physics, and biology in the early universe."}
