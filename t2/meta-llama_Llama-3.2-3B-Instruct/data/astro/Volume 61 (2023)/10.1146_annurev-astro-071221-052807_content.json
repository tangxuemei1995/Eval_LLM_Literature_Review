{"Abstract": "Galactic dynamos play a crucial role in shaping the large-scale magnetic fields and circumgalactic medium of spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way. These dynamos are driven by the rotation of the galaxy and the interactions between the interstellar medium and the galactic magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that the magnetic Reynolds number, a measure of the ratio of magnetic diffusion to advection, is a key parameter in determining the efficiency of galactic dynamos. In this context, we review the current understanding of galactic dynamos and their impact on the large-scale magnetic fields and circumgalactic medium of spiral galaxies. We discuss the role of the galactic rotation rate, the strength of the magnetic field, and the properties of the interstellar medium in driving the dynamo process. Our analysis is based on a comprehensive review of the literature, including observations of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, as well as theoretical models of galactic dynamos. We highlight the importance of considering the interplay between the galactic dynamo and the circumgalactic medium in understanding the large-scale magnetic fields of spiral galaxies. Our findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of the Milky Way and the formation of structure in the universe."}
