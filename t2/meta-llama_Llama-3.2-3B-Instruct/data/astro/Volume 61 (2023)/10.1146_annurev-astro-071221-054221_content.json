{"Abstract": "The Interstellar Interlopers explores the phenomenon of comets originating from the interstellar medium and perturbing the formation of protoplanetary disks around young stars. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and simulations, this study reveals the complex dynamics governing the capture and ejection of cometary bodies from interstellar space. The findings suggest that interstellar interlopers can significantly impact the growth and evolution of planetary systems, potentially influencing the delivery of volatile compounds and organic molecules to terrestrial planets. The research highlights the need for further investigation into the role of interstellar comets in shaping the architecture of protoplanetary systems and the potential for their discovery to provide insights into the early history of our solar system."}
